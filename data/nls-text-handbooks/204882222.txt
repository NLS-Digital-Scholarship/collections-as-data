Preface
UK 2003 is the 54th edition of the annual reference
book on the United Kingdom. Drawing on a wide
range of official and other authoritative sources, it
provides a factual and up-to-date overview of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, including the
main aspects of government policy, how services
are provided, and the organisations involved.
Social, economic, cultural, environmental and
foreign affairs are all covered. The Yearbook is a
widely used work of reference, both in the United
Kingdom and overseas, where it is an important
element of the information service provided by
British diplomatic posts.
This edition has been fully updated and revised.
The photographs provide a record of events during
the year, including the Queen’s Golden Jubilee
celebrations. The text indicates some of the ways
the UK has changed during the reign. Fifty years
ago - having established the NHS and overhauled
the social security system - post-war governments
were turning their attention to other issues such as
the national housing shortage. Television was then
in its infancy. Tower blocks, motorways and out-
of-town shopping centres were still unknown in
the UK.
The following decades have seen steadily
improving living standards and a major expansion
of higher education and international travel.
Children born today will live about nine years
longer than those born in 1952. Working lives and
leisure activities have been transformed by
technological change and the UK has become a
multicultural society in which ownership of home
and car are the norm rather than the exception.
Many of these changes are documented in this
edition. There is also a reminder of some of the
major scientific advances made in the UK over the
half century.
Notes and definitions
1. The full title of the UK is ‘the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland’. ‘Great Britain’ comprises England,
Wales and Scotland.
2. Statistics in this book apply to the UK as a
whole wherever possible. However, data are
not always available on a comparable basis, so
in some areas information has been given for
one or more of the component parts of the
UK. Geographical coverage is clearly
indicated.
3. Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in UK 2003 is accurate at
the time of going to press. The text is generally
based on information available up to the end
of August 2002. Data for the most recent year
may be provisional or estimated.
4. The mid-2001 population estimates quoted in
chapters 1-5 and 9 are based on the results of
the 2001 Census. ONS is due to publish final
revised mid-year estimates for 1982 to 2000 in
early 2003. Other data - for example birth
rates and death rates - will also be revised in
due course to take account of the Census-
based population estimates.
5. Figures given in tables and charts may not
always sum to the totals shown because of
rounding.
6. Information about particular companies has
been taken from company reports and news
releases, or from other publicly available
sources. No information about individual
companies has been taken from returns
submitted in response to ONS statistical
inquiries: these remain entirely confidential.

Population 2
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland (UK) was formed in 1801 and
constitutes the greater part of the British Isles. The
largest of the islands is Great Britain, which
comprises England, Scotland and Wales. The next
largest is Ireland, comprising Northern Ireland,
which is part of the UK, and, in the south, the
Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large island
chains known as the Inner and Outer Hebrides,
and to the north of the Scottish mainland are the
Orkney and Shetland Islands. All these, along with
the Isle of Wight, Anglesey and the Isles of Scilly,
have administrative ties with the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel
Islands between Great Britain and France are
largely self-governing, and are not part of the UK
(see page 6).
Physical features
The UK has a varied geological structure giving
rise to distinctive features in the landscape. The
clays and sandstones of the south east produce the
fertile soil characteristic of the farmland found in
parts of East Anglia and the London Basin, while
the chalk which underlies the gently rolling hills in
Sussex and Kent is exposed as sheer cliffs on the
coast at places such as Beachy Head and Dover.
Jurassic limestone stretches from Dorset and
Devon to Yorkshire and includes the Cleveland
Hills, Lincoln Edge, the Northampton Uplands
and the Cotswolds. A typical feature of this type of
landscape is that fields are separated not by hedges
but by walls built, like many of the houses in the
region, of local stone.
Carboniferous limestone lies further to the north
and forms the Pennine Chain, popularly known as
the ‘backbone of England’. In the central Pennines
there are extensive platforms of almost pure
limestone, notably around Malham Tarn, where
the rock is so porous that despite heavy rainfall
there is virtually no surface water as the rain
immediately soaks through to the subterranean
caverns which predominate in the area.
The metamorphic rocks (old grits and slates)
found in much of Wales, the Lake District and
southern Scotland produce the austerely wild
scenery, characteristic of these parts of the UK,
while much of the Scottish Highlands and Outer
Hebrides is formed of Britain’s oldest rocks
(ancient gneiss and schists), created up to 2,600
million years ago.
England
England is a country of mostly low hills and plains
with a 3,200 km coastline cut into by bays, coves
and estuaries. Upland regions in the north include
the Pennine Chain, which splits northern England
into western and eastern sectors. The north-west is
the home of the Lake District, which includes the
highest point in England, Scafell Pike at 978 m,
while the north-east includes the rugged landscape
of the Yorkshire moors.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s north-eastern coast, at its
nearest point, is separated from Scotland by a
stretch of water - the North Channel - only 21 km
wide. It has a 488 km border with the Irish
Republic, forming the UK’s only land boundary
with another Member State of the European
Union.
The landscape consists mainly of low hill country,
although there are two significant mountain
ranges: the Mournes, extending from South Down
to Strangford Lough in the east, and the Sperrins,
reaching through the north-western boundaries of
Northern Ireland.
On the Antrim coast near Bushmills is the Giant’s
Causeway. At this World Heritage Site there are
almost 40,000 massive basalt columns which
formed around 60 million years ago when volcanic
rock intruded into the surrounding chalk, cooled
and slowly solidified into huge polygonal columns,
1
The United Kingdom and its people
1 The United Kingdom
mainly hexagonal. The longest columns are
around 12 m high.
Lough Neagh is the largest freshwater lake in the
British Isles and one of the largest in Europe,
covering an area of 382 sq km.
Scotland
Scotland, the most northerly of the four parts of
the United Kingdom, covers about one-third of
the island of Great Britain. Bounded by England
to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and
north, and the North Sea to the east, Scotland is
a country with large areas of unspoilt and wild
landscape, and many of the UK’s mountains,
including its highest peak, Ben Nevis (1,343 m).
The Scottish Lowlands and Borders are largely
areas of gentle hills and woodland, contrasting
dramatically with the rugged landscape of the
Highlands in the north. A striking physical feature
is Glen More, or the Great Glen, which cuts across
the central Highlands from Fort William on the
west coast for 97 km north-east to Inverness on
the east coast. A string of lochs in deep narrow
basins are set between steep-sided mountains that
rise past forested foothills to high moors and
remote rocky mountains.
Wales
Wales is a mountainous country on the western
side of Great Britain. Around one-quarter of the
land is above 305 m and in the north its highest
peak, Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), rises to 1,085 m. The
Welsh coastline stretches for 1,180 km and consists
of many bays, beaches, peninsulas and cliffs.
Climate
The climate in the United Kingdom is generally
mild and temperate. Prevailing weather systems
move in from the Atlantic, and the weather is
mainly influenced by depressions and their
associated fronts moving eastwards, punctuated by
settled, fine, anticyclonic periods lasting from a
few days to several weeks. The temperature rarely
rises above 32°C (90°F) or falls below -10°C
(14°F).
Rainfall is greatest in western and upland parts of
the country, where the annual average exceeds
1,100 mm; the highest mountain areas receive
more than 3,000 mm. Over much of lowland
central England, annual rainfall ranges from 700
to 850 mm, although parts of East Anglia and the
South East receive just 550 mm. Rain is fairly well

the wettest. During May, June and July (the
months of longest daylight) the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five hours in
northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight. During the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine is at
a minimum, with an average of an hour a day in
northern Scotland and two hours a day on the
south coast of England.
Population
The population of the UK at mid-2001 was 58.8
million (see Table 1.1). Official projections, based
on 2000 population estimates, suggest that the
population will reach nearly 65 million by 2025.

The UK population was the third largest in the
European Union (EU) in 2001 after Germany (82
million) and France (59 million) (see Table 1.2).
Having been static in the 1970s, overall population
has begun to grow again. The rate of increase is in
line with some other EU countries, but significantly
slower than the United States or Australia. The 2001
Census showed that for the first time there are
more people over 60 than there are children.
Historical outline
(see Appendix B for a list of significant dates)
‘Britain’ derives from Greek and Latin names
which probably stem from a Celtic original.
Although in the prehistoric timescale the Celts
were relatively late arrivals in the British Isles, only
with them does Britain emerge into recorded
history. The term ‘Celtic’ is often used rather
3
The United Kingdom and its people
1 The United Kingdom
generally to distinguish the early inhabitants of
the British Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon
invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in 55 and
54 bc, contact between Britain and the Roman
world grew, culminating in the Roman invasion of
ad 43. Roman rule, which lasted till about 409,
was gradually extended from south-east England
to include Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of
Scotland.
England
When the Romans finally withdrew from Britain,
the lowland regions were invaded and settled by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes (tribes from what is now
north-western Germany). England takes its name
from the first of these. To begin with, the Anglo-
Saxon kingdoms were fairly small and numerous,
but as time went on they formed themselves into
fewer but larger areas of control. Eventually the
southern kingdom of Wessex came to dominate,
mainly because it played a leading role in resisting
the Viking invasions of the 9th century. Athelstan
(who reigned from 924 to 939) used the title of
‘King of all Britain’, and from 954 there was a
single kingdom of England.
In 1066 the last successful invasion of England
took place. Duke William of Normandy defeated
the English at the Battle of Hastings and became
King William I, known as ‘William the
Conqueror’. Many Normans and others from
France came to settle; French became the language
of the ruling classes for the next three centuries;
and the legal and social structures were influenced
by those in force across the Channel.
When Henry II, originally from Anjou, was king
(1154-89), his‘Angevin empire’ stretched from the
river Tweed on the Scottish border, through much
of France to the Pyrenees. However, almost all of
the English Crown’s possessions in France were
finally lost during the late Middle Ages.
In 1215 a group of barons demanded a charter of
liberties as a safeguard against the seemingly
arbitrary behaviour of King John. The rebels
captured London and the King agreed to
negotiate. He eventually attached his seal to a
document containing their demands and the
resulting formal royal grant became known as the
Magna Carta. Among other things, the charter
promised that ‘To no one will we sell, to no one
deny or delay right or justice’. It established the
important constitutional principle that the power
of the king could be limited.
The Civil War that broke out in England in 1642,
and which resulted in the capture and eventual
execution of Charles I, brought about a lasting
change in the balance of power between monarch
and Parliament. A leading statesman at this time
was Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) who, as Lord
Protector from late 1653 until his death, had
supreme legislative and executive power in
association with Parliament and the Council of
State during the interregnum before Charles II
ascended the throne, restoring the monarchy.
Parliamentary reform was a recurrent issue in the
18th and 19th centuries. The 1832 Reform Act
began the process of dismantling the old
parliamentary system and extending the franchise,
while the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 gave the
vote to a gradually wider section of the
population. During the 20th century, the
Representation of the People Acts took the process
still further. In 1918, women over the age of 30
were enfranchised and in 1928 the Equal Franchise
Act lowered the voting age for women to 21.
Universal suffrage for all eligible people over
18 (see page 31) was granted in 1969.
Northern Ireland
Henry II of England invaded Ireland in 1169. He
had been made the country’s overlord by the
English Pope Adrian IV, who wanted the Irish
Church to be fully obedient to Rome. Although
Anglo-Norman noblemen controlled part of the
country during the Middle Ages, little direct
authority came from England.
The Tudor monarchs tended to intervene in Ireland
far more, and during the reign of Elizabeth I there
were several attempts to deal with rebellion. The
northern province of Ulster was particularly subject
to unrest, but in 1607, after the rebel leaders had
been defeated and had fled, Protestant immigrants
went to settle there from Scotland and England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) coincided with
further uprisings in Ireland, which Oliver
Cromwell suppressed. More fighting took place
after the overthrow of King James II, a Roman
Catholic, in 1688. At the Battle of the Boyne
(1690) the Protestant William of Orange (later
King William III) defeated the forces of James II
who was trying to regain the English throne from
his power base in Ireland.
4
The United Kingdom and its people
1 The United Kingdom
In 1782 the Government in London gave the Irish
Parliament power to legislate on Irish affairs. This
Parliament, however, represented only the Anglo-
Irish minority. Following the unsuccessful
rebellion of Wolfe Tone’s United Irishmen
movement in 1798, Great Britain took back control
of Ireland under the 1800 Act of Union. The Irish
Parliament was abolished in 1801 and Irish
interests were represented by members sitting in
both Houses of the Westminster Parliament.
The question of‘Home Rule’ for Ireland remained
one of the major issues of British politics. By 1910
the Liberal Government in London depended for
its political survival on support from the Irish
Parliamentary Party. The conflict deepened as some
unionists and nationalists in Ireland formed private
armies. In 1914 Home Rule was approved in the
Government of Ireland Act but implementation was
suspended because of the First World War.
In 1916 a nationalist uprising in Dublin was put
down and its leaders executed. Two years later the
nationalist Sinn Fein party won a large majority of
the Irish seats in the General Election to the
Westminster Parliament. Its members refused to
attend the House of Commons and instead
formed their own assembly - the Dail Eireann - in
Dublin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
began operations against the British
administration in 1919.
In 1920 a new Government of Ireland Act provided
for separate Parliaments in Northern and
Southern Ireland, subordinate to Westminster. The
Act was implemented in Northern Ireland in 1921,
giving six of the nine counties of the province of
Ulster their own Parliament with powers to
manage internal affairs. However, the Act proved
unacceptable in the South and the 26 counties of
Southern Ireland eventually left the UK in 1922.
From 1921 until 1972 Northern Ireland had its
own Parliament in which the unionists, primarily
representing the Protestant community, held a
permanent majority and formed the regional
government. The nationalist minority was
effectively excluded from political office and
influence.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the civil rights
movement and reactions to it resulted in serious
inter-communal rioting, leading to the British
Army being sent in to help the police keep law and
order in 1969.
In 1972, when terrorism and violence reached its
peak, the British Government decided to take back
direct responsibility for law and order. The
Northern Ireland Unionist Government resigned
in protest, the regional government was abolished
and direct rule from Westminster began; this was
to last until devolved powers were given back to
a Northern Ireland Assembly in December 1999
(see page 14).
Scotland
Evidence of human settlement in what is now
known as Scotland dates from around the third
millennium bc. By the time the Romans invaded
Britain, many tribes were living in the region, but
despite a number of attempts to control them,
Roman rule never permanently extended to most
of Scotland. In the sixth century, the Scots, a Celtic
people from Ireland, settled on the north-west
coast of the island of Great Britain, giving their
name to the present-day Scotland.
The kingdoms of England and Scotland were
frequently at war during the Middle Ages. When
King Edward I tried to impose direct English rule
over Scotland in 1296, a revolt for independence
broke out, which ended in 1328 when King
Edward III recognised its leader, Robert the Bruce,
as King Robert I of Scotland.
In 1603 Queen Elizabeth I of England, who never
married and had no children of her own, was
succeeded by her nearest heir, King James VI of
Scotland. He became King James I of England and
so united the English and Scottish crowns in one
person.
In 1745 Charles Edward Stuart (also known as
‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’ or ‘The Young Pretender’)
attempted to retake the British throne for the
Stuarts. Landing in the Hebrides, he went on to
Edinburgh, defeating government forces at
Prestonpans. He advanced southwards into
England, capturing Carlisle, but was turned back
at Derby and eventually defeated at the Battle of
Culloden, north-east of Inverness, in April 1746.
Politically, England and Scotland remained
separate during the 17th century, apart from a
period of union forced on them by Oliver
Cromwell in the 1650s. It was not until 1707 that
the English and Scottish Parliaments agreed on
a single Parliament for Great Britain to sit at
Westminster in London. Nearly 300 years later, in
July 1999, devolution meant that power to
5

Scottish Parliament (see page 21).
Wales
Wales remained a Celtic stronghold ruled by
sovereign princes under the influence of England
after the Romans had left Britain. In 1282 King
Edward I brought Wales under English rule and the
castles he built in the north remain among the UK’s
finest historic monuments. Edward Is eldest son -
later King Edward II - was born at Caernarfon in
1284 and was created the first English Prince of
Wales in 1301. The eldest son of the reigning
monarch continues to bear this title, Prince Charles
being made Prince of Wales in 1969.
At the beginning of the 15th century, Welsh
resentment of unjust English laws and
administration, and widespread economic
discontent, resulted in the nationalist leader
Owain Glyndwr heading an unsuccessful revolt
against the English. From 1485 to 1603 the Tudor
dynasty, which was of Welsh ancestry, ruled
England and it was during this time that the Acts
of Union (1536 and 1542) united England and
Wales administratively, politically and legally.
This situation prevailed until July 1999, when
devolution gave the National Assembly for Wales
specific powers to make secondary legislation to
meet distinctive Welsh needs (see page 27).
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney
and Sark being the largest in the group) were part
of the Duchy of Normandy in the 10th and 11th
centuries and remained subject to the English
Crown after the loss of mainland Normandy to the
French in 1204. The Isle of Man was under the
nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266, and
eventually came under the direct administration of
the British Crown in 1765, when it was bought for
£70,000. Its parliament, Tynwald, was established
more than 1,000 years ago and is the oldest
legislature in continuous existence in the world.
Today these territories have their own legislative
assemblies and systems of law, and their own
taxation systems. The UK Government is
responsible for their international relations and
external defence.
The UK is one of the 15 Member States of the
European Union (EU - see page 59) but the
Channel Islands and Isle of Man are neither EU
Member States in their own right nor part of the
UK Member State. Broadly speaking, EU rules on
the free movement of goods and the Common
Agricultural Policy apply to the Islands, but not
those on the free movement of services or
persons. Islanders benefit from the provision for
free movement of persons only if they have close
ties with the UK.

Population
Nearly 84 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom lives in England, mainly in the
major cities and metropolitan areas in London
and the South East, South and West Yorkshire,
Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the West
Midlands, and conurbations on the rivers Tyne,
Wear and Tees. The population of England almost
trebled between 1851 and the end of the 20th
century. Table 2.1 shows that the South West, East
and South East regions each grew by more than 10
per cent between 1981 and 2001.
England is by far the most densely populated part
of the UK. In 2001 it had a population density of
377 people per sq km compared with Wales (140),
Northern Ireland (124) and Scotland (64).
In contrast to Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales, England has no separate elected national
body exclusively responsible for its central
administration (see chapters 3, 4 and 5). Instead

The regions of England 9
a number of government departments look after
England’s day-to-day administrative affairs (see
Appendix A) and there is a network of nine
Government Offices for the Regions (GOs - see
page 9). However, in the longer term, the
Government is committed to providing for
directly elected regional assemblies in those
regions that want them (see page 10).
Representation at Westminster and in
Europe
There are 529 English parliamentary constituencies
represented in the House of Commons (see
Table 2.2). Conservative support tends to be
strongest in suburban and rural areas, and the
party has a large number of parliamentary seats in
the southern half of England. The Labour Party’s
key support comes mainly from the big cities and
areas associated with heavy industry, but it
currently holds many seats which had in the past
been considered safe Conservative constituencies.
The Liberal Democrats, who are traditionally strong
in the South West, now have over a third (15) of
their English seats in Greater London and the
South East.
A Standing Committee on Regional Affairs was
revived in April 2000. It consists of 13 Members
sitting for constituencies in England and reflects
party representation in the House. Any Member
representing an English constituency may take
part in its proceedings, but they may not make
a motion, vote or be counted in the quorum. The
committee considers issues specific to the English
regions.
Structure of local government
In many areas of England a two-tier system of
county and district councils is responsible for
government at the local level. However, there are
also a number of single-tier, or unitary, authorities
- especially in the larger cities (see map on page 8).
Some ‘borough’ or ‘city’ councils are unitary and
others operate at the district level. Since July 2000
the strategic government of London has been the

(see below).
Metropolitan county areas
The six metropolitan county areas in England -
Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, Merseyside,
Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and South
Yorkshire - have 36 district councils, but no
county councils. The district councils are
responsible for all services apart from those which
have a statutory authority over areas wider than
the individual boroughs and districts. For example,
waste disposal (in certain areas); the fire services
and civil defence; and public transport are run by
joint authorities composed of elected councillors
nominated by the borough or district councils.
Non-metropolitan counties
County councils in England are responsible for
large-scale services in their areas such as transport,
planning, highways, traffic regulation, education,
consumer protection, refuse disposal, the fire
service, libraries and the personal social services.
They are each subdivided into a number of
district councils which are responsible for more
local matters like environmental health, housing,
decisions on most local planning applications, and
collection of household waste. Both tiers of local
authority have powers to provide facilities such as
museums, art galleries and parks; these
arrangements depend on local agreement. In areas
containing unitary authorities, the latter provide
both county and district level functions.
Greater London
Greater London is made up of 32 boroughs and
the City of London, each with a council
responsible for most services in its area. In May
2000 Londoners voted for a directly elected
Mayor1 for the capital, and a separately elected
Assembly of 25 members. Subsequent elections
will take place every four years. The Mayor and
the London Assembly form the Greater London
Authority (GLA), the first elected London-wide
body since the Greater London Council (GLC)
was abolished in 1986. The Mayor of London sets
key strategies on a range of London-wide issues,
such as transport, economic development,
strategic and spatial development and the
environment. The London Assembly scrutinises
both the activities of the Mayor and issues of
concern to Londoners.
In elections for London’s Mayor, voters are
required to mark both their first and second
choices on their ballot papers. If, in the first
round, no candidate receives more than 50 per
cent of the total votes cast, the second choices for
the two leading candidates are added to their
initial scores to decide the overall winner. For the
Assembly elections, London is divided into
14 constituencies whose members are elected
using the ‘first-past-the-post’ system. A further
11 London-wide seats are allocated on a ‘top-up’
basis, whereby votes are counted across London
and the seats shared among the political parties in
proportion to the votes each party receives. In the
May 2000 elections, the Labour Party won nine
seats, the Conservatives also won nine, the Liberal
Democrats four and the Green Party three. The
Mayor stood as an Independent candidate.
Parishes
The smallest type of administrative area in
England is the parish. These date from medieval
times but have operated in their current form only
since 1894. Modern parish councils (which may
choose to call themselves town councils) have two
main roles: to represent community views and to
deliver local services. There are now around 9,500
parishes in England, including over 100 that have
been created since the introduction of the Local
Government and Rating Act 1997.

Cities in England
City status is purely honorific and confers no
additional powers or functions on the town. In
December 2000 the Government announced that
the Queen had decided to mark her Golden Jubilee
by grants of city status to a suitably qualified town
in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom.
In March 2002, Preston was chosen to receive this
honour in England.
Preston is the administrative capital of Lancashire. It
is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was
granted its first Charter in 1179 by King Henry II.
The University of Central Lancashire, founded in
1828 as the Preston Institution for the Diffusion of
Knowledge, is now one of the country's largest
universities, while Preston North End Football Club,
one of the founding members of the Football
League in 1888, is home to the new National
Football Museum which contains the FIFA Football
Collection and other important footballing items.

a regional level. They bring together the English
regional services for nine departments - the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Department
of Trade and Industry, Department for Education
and Skills, Department for Work and Pensions,
Department of Health, Department for
Transport, Home Office, Department for
Culture, Media and Sport and Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs - and work
with regional partners, including local authorities
and Regional Development Agencies (RDAs - see
page 339).
In April 2000 the Government set up a Regional
Co-ordination Unit in order to co-ordinate the
delivery of regional initiatives, promote the use of
GOs by Whitehall departments, and manage the
shared functions of the GOs.
Voluntary regional chambers have also been
established in each region. They provide a means
through which the RDAs can consult on their
proposals and give an account of their activities.
Proposals for devolution to the English regions
In May 2002 the Government published a White
Paper Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the
English Regions, which proposed the establishment
of elected assemblies in regions that want them.
Such assemblies would be responsible for setting
priorities, delivering regional strategies and
allocating funding. Their functional responsibilities
would cover economic development, skills and
employment, spatial planning, housing, transport,
environmental protection, tourism, culture, sport
and public health.
Before any elected regional assembly is
established, a referendum would be held and
A few distinctive facts about England
■ English law comprises 'common law' (based on
ancient custom and previous rulings in similar
cases), 'statute law' (parliamentary and
European Community legislation) and 'equity'
(general principles of justice correcting or adding
to common or statute law). Wales also uses
English law, but devolution has meant that some
legislation now applies differently in that part of
the UK (see page 28).
■ The Church of England broke away from the
Roman Catholic Church during the Reformation
in the early 16th century. The Sovereign is head
of the Church of England and appoints its two
archbishops and 42 diocesan bishops (see
page 34).
■ Despite its high population density and degree
of urbanisation, England has a diverse natural
environment with many unspoilt rural and
coastal areas which are protected under the law
(see chapter 19). The English landscape is
distinct in character from many other parts of
the UK, and several of its regions and counties
have inspired great English writers, artists and
musicians over the centuries; these include the
Lake District (William Wordsworth, poet), Dorset
(Thomas Hardy, novelist), Essex and Suffolk (John
Constable, landscape painter) and
Worcestershire (Edward Elgar, composer).

a majority of those voting would need to be in
favour of the proposal. The Government
recognises that interest in elected regional
assemblies varies across England, so referendums
would be held only in regions where there was
sufficient interest.
Elected regional assemblies would be based on the
existing administrative boundaries used by the
GOs and RDAs. They would have between 25 and
35 members, including a leader and a cabinet of
up to six members chosen by, and wholly
accountable to, the full assembly. The voting
system would be the Additional Member System
of proportional representation (see page 22)
which is used for the Scottish Parliament and the
Welsh Assembly. This would ensure that the
overall composition of an assembly broadly
reflected the votes cast for the different parties.
Most of an assembly’s money would come
through a single government grant, with the
assembly deciding how it should use this to
address key regional priorities. Using figures for
2001/02, an assembly in the North East, for
example, would be responsible for around £350
million and would influence decisions on how
another £500 million would be spent. Additional
funds would be raised through the council tax,
collected on behalf of the assembly by the local
authorities in the region as part of their existing
arrangements.
The Government intends to introduce a Bill to
provide for referendums and associated local
government reviews when parliamentary time
allows, with the aim of enabling the first
referendum to be held during the current
Parliament. Once at least one region has voted for
an elected assembly, legislation would be
introduced to provide for an assembly to be set
up. The Government envisages having the first
regional assembly established and operating early
in the next Parliament.
Economic performance
Economic performance varies considerably
between and within the nine English regions.
For example, Inner London has had the highest
level of gross domestic product (GDP) per head in
the European Union (EU) for a number of years,
but it also contains some of the worst pockets of
deprivation in the UK. Under the Objective
1 status for EU funding that came into force in
January 2000 (see page 340), three areas of
The English language
Modern English derives primarily from one of the
dialects of Old English (or Anglo-Saxon), itself made
up of several Western Germanic dialects brought to
Britain in the early fifth century. However, it has
been very greatly influenced by other languages,
particularly Latin and, following the Norman
conquest, by French - the language of court,
government and the nobility for many years after
1066. The re-emergence of English was marked by
events such as the Statute of Pleading in 1362,
which laid down that English was to replace French
as the language of law. The 14th century saw the
first major English literature since Anglo-Saxon days,
with works such as Piers Plowman by William
Langland and the Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey
Chaucer.
English is one of the most widely used languages in
the world. Estimates suggest that around 310
million people speak it as their first language, with
a similar number speaking it as a second language.
It is the official language of air traffic control and
maritime communications; the leading language of
science, technology, computing and commerce; and
a major medium of education, publishing and
international negotiation.
Because of today's accessibility of oral
communication (via the telephone, television, radio
and cinema), the language is changing faster than it
did in the past. New words from many sources are
constantly being adopted and words which become
popular with the public are repeated again and
again in different circumstances by thousands of
people, quickly adding to their meaning and
sometimes changing it.
British English has borrowed much from other
English-speaking countries, particularly the United
States, but many words and phrases have also
entered the language from Commonwealth
countries, notably Australia and those in the
Caribbean.
England - Merseyside, South Yorkshire, and
Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - qualified for
funding from 2000 to 2006. According to the latest
figures, household disposable income per head in
1999 was above the England average in London
(by 19 per cent) and in the South East and East
(both by 8 per cent), and the same three regions
had the highest gross weekly earnings for full-time

employees in 2000. The North East had the lowest
household disposable income and GDP per head
in 1999, as well as the lowest average weekly
earnings in 2000.

Population
About half of Northern Ireland’s 1.7 million
population live in the eastern coastal region, at the
centre of which is the capital, Belfast. The
population has increased by 5 per cent in the past
ten years. Within Northern Ireland, the population
density in 2001 was highest in the district council
area of Belfast at 2,528 people per sq km and
lowest in Moyle at only 32 people per sq km.
Around 36 per cent of the population was aged
under 25 in 2001, a higher proportion than in any
other region of the United Kingdom. In the late
1990s the Northern Ireland Continuous
Household Survey (CHS) reported that 54 per cent
of the Northern Irish population regarded
themselves as Protestants and 42 per cent as
Roman Catholics.
Cities in Northern Ireland
There are now five cities in Northern Ireland: Armagh,
Belfast, Lisburn, Londonderry and Newry. Unlike the
other parts of the UK, where only one town was
granted city status to mark the Queen's Golden
Jubilee in 2002 (see chapters 2, 4 and 5), in Northern
Ireland both Lisburn and Newry were honoured.
■ Lisburn became the home of French Huguenots
in the 17th century who nurtured the growing
linen industry and the town quickly became a
major linen producer. Today the focus has
changed to the manufacturing of synthetic
fabrics but the city remains an important centre
for commerce and industry.
■ Newry is notable for having the first inland
waterway in the British Isles, which contributed
greatly to the town's prosperity in the 19th
century. The canal had 14 locks and provided a
means to export goods (mainly linen and stone).
Today Newry is a busy city benefiting from its
close proximity to the border with the Irish
Republic.

Northern Ireland: districts
Representation at Westminster
For UK Government General Elections, Northern
Ireland is divided into 18 single-seat
constituencies and there is a simple ‘first-past-the-
post’ electoral system. Although there are 18 MPs
elected to represent Northern Ireland in the House
of Commons, the four Sinn Fein party members
have not taken their seats. Since December 2001,
however, they have had access to facilities at
Westminster.
Following devolution (see below), the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland - a member of the UK
Cabinet whose main function is to ensure that the
devolution settlement works satisfactorily -
remains responsible for Northern Ireland Office
matters not devolved to the Northern Ireland
Assembly. These include policing, security policy,
prisons and criminal justice.
The Westminster Parliament also has a Northern
Ireland Grand Committee to consider Bills at the
second and third reading stages, take oral
questions and ministerial statements, and debate
matters relating specifically to Northern Ireland. It
includes all sitting Northern Ireland MPs and up
to 25 others as nominated by the committee of
selection.
In 1994 the Northern Ireland Affairs Select
Committee was established to examine the
expenditure, policy and administration of the
Northern Ireland Office. The Committee has the
power to send for people, papers and records, and
has investigated areas such as employment,
electricity prices, education, BSE and the security
forces in Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland Assembly and
Executive
The first elections to the Northern Ireland
Assembly were held in June 1998 using the single
transferable vote system of proportional
representation. The 18 constituencies are the

same as those for the UK Parliament, but each
returns six MLAs (Members of the Legislative
Assembly), giving the Assembly a total of 108
members.
At its first meeting in July 1998, the Assembly
elected, on a cross-community basis, a First
Minister and a Deputy First Minister and
appointed ten ministers with responsibility for
each of the Northern Ireland departments (see
Appendix A), which together form the Executive.
These 12 ministers make up the Executive
Committee, which meets to discuss and agree on
those issues which cut across the responsibilities
of two or more ministers. Its role is to prioritise
executive business and recommend a common
position where necessary.
Powers and responsibilities
Power to run most of Northern Ireland’s domestic
affairs was fully devolved by the Westminster
Parliament to the Northern Ireland Assembly and
its Executive Committee of Ministers in December
1999. The Assembly meets in Parliament Buildings
at Stormont, Belfast, and is the prime source of
authority for all devolved responsibilities. It has
full legislative and executive powers within this
framework, which means it can make laws and
take decisions on all the functions of the Northern
Ireland departments.
The Executive’s main function is to plan each year,
and review as necessary, a programme of
government with an agreed budget. This is subject
to approval by the Assembly, after scrutiny in
Assembly Committees, on a cross-community
basis. MLAs can be on more than one Assembly
Committee.
The Assembly has ten Statutory Committees.
Membership of Committees is in broad
proportion to party strengths in the Assembly to
ensure that the opportunity of Committee places
is available to all Members. Each Committee has a
scrutiny, policy development and consultation role
in relation to its department and a role in the
initiation of legislation.
A 60-member Civic Forum, whose chairperson is
appointed by the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister, represents the business, trade union,
voluntary and other sectors of the Northern Ireland
community. It acts as a consultative mechanism on
social, economic and cultural matters.
Representation in Europe
Northern Ireland forms a single, multi-seat
constituency to elect three of the 87 UK
representatives to the European Parliament
(MEPs) every five years. As with local and
Assembly elections, the single transferable vote
form of proportional representation is used.
Structure of local government
Northern Ireland is divided into 26 local
government districts, each forming a single-tier
local authority. They are responsible for refuse
collection, leisure and recreation facilities,

3 Northern Ireland
Countdown to devolution
Direct rule from Westminster (imposed in 1972) was
never intended to be permanent. Over the years,
successive British and Irish Governments have worked
closely together to try to bring lasting peace to
Northern Ireland, recognising the need for new
political arrangements acceptable to both sides of the
community. The key events leading up to the
establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly were:
■ 1985: an Anglo-Irish Agreement provided a new
basis for relations between the UK and the Irish
Republic, creating an Intergovernmental
Conference in which to discuss issues of mutual
interest, such as improved cross-border co¬
operation and security.
■ 1993: the Downing Street Declaration set out the
British and Irish Governments' views on how a
future settlement might be achieved and restated
that any constitutional change would require the
consent of a majority of people in Northern
Ireland.
■ 1997: a new UK Government (elected in May)
confirmed its intention of making the talks process
as inclusive as possible and maintained that any
agreement reached would have to have the broad
support of the parties representing each of the
main communities.
■ 1998 (April): multi-party talks held in Belfast
concluded with the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.
Legislation was passed at Westminster authorising
a referendum on the settlement in Northern Ireland
and permitting elections to a new Northern Ireland
Assembly. The Irish Parliament also considered the
Agreement and passed legislation authorising
a concurrent referendum in the Irish Republic.
■ 1998 (May): referendums were held in both parts
of Ireland, and the Agreement received a clear
endorsement. Northern Ireland voted 71.1 per cent
in favour and 28.8 per cent against, while in the
Irish Republic the result was 94.3 per cent and
5.6 per cent respectively.
■ 1998 (June): a new Northern Ireland Assembly of
108 members was elected.
■ 1999: power was devolved to the Assembly and
its Executive Committee of Ministers under the
Northern Ireland Act 1998. At the same time
a number of institutions set up to assist
intergovernmental dialogue became fully
functional (see page 17).
building control, cemeteries and tourist amenities,
and nominate locally elected representatives to sit
as members of the various statutory bodies
dealing with, for example, education, libraries
and healthcare. Local authorities in Northern
Ireland also have a consultative role in matters
such as planning, roads and housing, and offer
leadership and support in local economic
development.
Finance
Unlike the other parts of the United Kingdom,
local authorities in Northern Ireland are not
financed through a council tax. Instead they
continue to raise revenue to help fund the services
they provide by levying a domestic rate on homes
and a business rate on commercial property.
In 2002/03 net revenue expenditure for local
authorities in Northern Ireland is estimated at
£313 million: £261 million is financed from
district rates, £47 million financed by general
grant and £5 million from the reserves.
Security policy
The Government remains committed to ensuring
that the security forces in Northern Ireland have
available the powers they need to counter the
terrorist threat.
The system of separate and temporary legislation
for Northern Ireland and Great Britain has now
been replaced by permanent UK-wide anti¬
terrorist legislation contained in the Terrorism Act
2000 and the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security
Act 2001 (see page 188).
Reform of policing
An independent Commission on Policing, set up
under the terms of the Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement, carried out an extensive review of
policing in Northern Ireland. Its report - A New
Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland (the Patten
Report) - was published in September 1999 and
made recommendations which led to the Police
(Northern Ireland) Act 2000.

Intergovernmental dialogue
Under the 1998 Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, a
number of new institutions were set up to facilitate
intergovernmental dialogue between Northern
Ireland, the Irish Republic and the UK Government.
They came into operation at the same time as
power was devolved to the Northern Ireland
Assembly in December 1999.
■ The North/South Ministerial Council is a forum
for those with executive responsibilities in
Northern Ireland and the Irish Government. The
Council meets on a regular basis to develop
consultation, co-operation and action on an all¬
island and cross-border basis.
■ The North/South Implementation Bodies,
established by international agreement between
the British and Irish Governments, implement
the policies agreed by ministers in the
North/South Ministerial Council. They deal with
waterways, food safety, trade and business
development, special European Union
programmes, marine matters, and language.
■ The British-lrish Council aims to promote and
develop good relationships among all the
peoples of the United Kingdom and Ireland. It
has representatives from the British and Irish
Governments, the devolved institutions in
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and
others from the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man.
■ The British-lrish Intergovernmental Conference's
role is to promote bilateral co-operation on
matters of mutual interest between the two
governments.
Provisions contained in the Act have:
■ enhanced the police service’s accountability
through a new Policing Board to be made up
of ten members of the Northern Ireland
Assembly and nine independent members;
■ given the Board powers to call for reports and
initiate inquiries, and require it to monitor
and assess police performance;
■ provided for the establishment of new district
policing partnerships aimed at improving
local accountability;
■ introduced measures to redress the religious
imbalance in the police service between
Protestants and Catholics. The first group of
recruits trained specifically for the new police
service graduated in April 2002;
■ changed the name of the RUC to the ‘Police
Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating
the Royal Ulster Constabulary)’. For
operational purposes, the service is called the
‘Police Service of Northern Ireland’; and
■ established a Commissioner to oversee the
implementation of changes.
The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 set up the
office of a Police Ombudsman to provide an
independent means of impartially investigating
complaints against police officers in Northern
Ireland. When it is perceived to be in the public
interest, the Police Ombudsman can also react to
incidents, even if no individual complaint has
been made.
Review of criminal justice
In parallel with the work of the Commission on
Policing, the Government carried out a review of
the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland in
which political parties, interested bodies,
organisations and individuals were consulted. Its
recommendations, published in March 2000, were
subject to further consultation which ended the
following September and in November 2001 the
draft Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill was
published.
Having consulted further on the measures in the
draft, the Government introduced the Justice
(Northern Ireland) Bill in the House of Commons
in December 2001 and it received Royal Assent in
July 2002. The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002
contains provisions to:
■ amend the law relating to the judiciary and
courts in Northern Ireland, including
provision for the creation of a Judicial
Appointments Commission and for the
removal of judges, changes to eligibility
criteria, a new oath and provisions to make
the Lord Chief Justice head of the judiciary in
Northern Ireland;
■ provide for the appointment of the Attorney
General for Northern Ireland after devolution
of responsibility for justice matters to the
17
The United Kingdom and its people
3 Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland Assembly (scheduled for
May 2003) and establish a public prosecution
service;
■ establish a Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice
and a Northern Ireland Law Commission;
■ set out the aims of the youth justice system
and make other provisions dealing with this
system, including extending it to 17 year olds;
■ provide for the disclosure of information
about the release of offenders in Northern
Ireland to victims of crime and to confer on
victims the right to make representations in
relation to the temporary release of offenders;
and
■ provide for measures in relation to
community safety.
Economy
Northern Ireland accounts for 2.2 per cent of UK
gross domestic product (GDP). GDP rose from
£9.3 billion in 1989 to £17.0 billion in 1999 (at
current prices), an increase of 82 per cent. In 1999
GDP per head in Northern Ireland was 77.5 per
cent of the UK average, an increase from 74.7 per
cent in 1989. Between 1989 and 1999 real GDP
per head increased by 20.8 per cent in Northern
Ireland, compared with 16.5 per cent for the UK
as a whole.
Some comparisons between the Northern
Irish and UK economies
■ Manufacturing industry accounted for some
19.0 per cent of Northern Ireland's GDP in 1998,
compared with 20.3 per cent for the UK as
a whole at that time.
■ Agriculture, forestry and fishing accounted for
4.0 per cent of Northern Ireland's GDP in 1998,
compared with 1.3 per cent for the UK.
■ In 2001, 60.2 per cent of export trade was to
the EU, slightly higher than the UK average of
58.9 per cent. Trade from the EU accounted for
nearly 42 per cent of imports, lower than the UK
average of 49 per cent.
Northern Ireland’s economic development
strategy was reviewed following the Enterprise,
Trade and Investment Committee’s consideration
Human rights and equality
The European Convention on Human Rights became
part of Northern Ireland domestic law when the
Human Rights Act 1998 (see page 183) came into
effect throughout the UK in October 2000.
A commitment to protect human rights and promote
equality was central to the Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement. The subsequent Northern Ireland Act
1998 not only placed a statutory duty of equality on
all public authorities but also established the
following bodies with specific responsibilities for
fostering equal opportunities and good community
relations:
■ The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
- to give advice to the Government and the
Northern Ireland Assembly on human rights
issues, particularly on any need for legislation to
protect human rights.
■ The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland-
to be responsible for fair employment, equal
opportunities, racial equality, disability issues and
enforcing the statutory duty of equality on public
authorities.
■ The Parades Commission - to help implement
the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act
1998, the purpose of which is to regulate public
processions in Northern Ireland. The Commission
imposed some form of restriction on 152
contentious parades in the year to 31 March
2002 out of a total of 3,301 notified parades.
The majority of parades each year are organised
by the Protestant/Unionist community and most
take place during the six months from around
Easter to the end of September.
■ The Victims Commission - whose 1998 report
l/l/e Will Remember Them led the Government to
appoint a minister for victims and establish a
Victims Liaison Unit in the Northern Ireland
Office. Since then, the Government has
committed more than £18 million to support
victims of inter-community unrest in Northern
Ireland.
of the ‘Strategy 2010’ report, published in March
1999. Strategy 2010 emphasised the need for
economic change and made over 60
recommendations for developing the economy
over the following ten years, one of which was the
18
The United Kingdom and its people
3 Northern Ireland
establishment of an Economic Development
Forum (EDF). The EDF is a partnership body
that provides a formal mechanism through which
a wide range of key organisations can advise
ministers in Northern Ireland on issues relating to
the development and future competitiveness of
the Northern Ireland economy. Membership of
the forum comprises central government, local
government and the major social partners.
The EDF’s first publication - Working Together for
a Stronger Economy - was launched in June 2002
and sets out seven key strategic priorities to be
addressed if the Northern Ireland economy is to
be significantly strengthened by the year 2010.
A few distinctive facts about Northern
Ireland
■ Estimates from the 1991 Census suggest that
around 142,000 people in Northern Ireland had
some ability to use Irish as a means of
communication, either orally or in writing.
■ Unlike most other areas of the UK, Northern
Ireland's secondary education retains a largely
selective system with pupils going to grammar
schools or secondary intermediate schools
according to academic ability, although there are
proposals to change this arrangement (see page
105). Since 1998 education authorities have a
statutory duty to promote Irish-medium
education.
■ Northern Ireland has some excellent facilities for
the arts. The Waterfront Hall in Belfast is an
entertainment venue and convention centre and
home to the Ulster Concert Orchestra, while the
Odyssey Centre on the east bank of the river
Lagan includes a science centre, IMAX film
theatre, indoor arena, entertainment pavilion
and piazzas (see chapter 16).
■ Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) footballers,
hurlers and camogie players from northern
counties are often involved in all-Ireland
championships in these traditional Irish sports
(see chapter 18).
■ A fifth of the total area in Northern Ireland is
designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and just under a sixth is Green Belt land
(see chapter 19).
A new research, development and innovation
strategy, due to be published in March 2003, will
lead to increased emphasis on the promotion of
innovation and creativity within the Northern
Ireland economy.
The public expenditure allocation within the
Northern Ireland Executive’s responsibility for
2002/03 is £6.9 billion.
Economic assistance
The Berlin EU summit at the end of March 1999
agreed a Special Programme for Northern Ireland
in support of peace, worth about £366 million
between the years 2000 and 2004. It also
confirmed the renewal for three years of EU
support of approximately £10 million a year for
the International Fund for Ireland, set up in 1986
by the British and Irish Governments to
encourage cross-border co-operation in business
enterprise, tourism, community relations, urban
development, agriculture and rural development.
Donors include the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the European Union.
The total resources available to the fund to date
amount to £431 million.

Population
Scotland’s population has changed relatively little
in the last 50 years. In June 2001 the estimated
population was 5.1 million (see Table 4.1),
compared with 5.2 million in 1971 and 5.1 million
in 1951. The population density is the lowest in
the UK, averaging 64 people per sq km in 2001.
Within Scotland, the population density was
highest in Glasgow City at 3,298 people per sq km
and lowest in the Highland council area at only
8 people per sq km. Three-quarters of the
population live in the central lowlands where two
of Scotland’s largest cities are situated: the capital,
Edinburgh (population 449,000) in the east and
Glasgow (population 579,000) in the west.
Representation at Westminster
Of the 659 seats in the UK Parliament at
Westminster, 72 currently represent constituencies
Cities in Scotland
The granting of city status is a 'reserved matter' on
which UK Government ministers advise the
Sovereign. However, any comments which the
devolved administrations may wish to make are
taken into account in deciding which towns should
be honoured in this way.
In March 2002 Stirling was one of five towns in the
UK granted city status to mark the Queen's Golden
Jubilee (see also chapters 2, 3 and 5). Its roots were
established over 800 years ago when it was one of
the most important settlements in Scotland,
occupying a position which allowed it to control the
lowest crossing point of the River Forth. One of the
most significant events in its history is the Battle of
Stirling Bridge which was fought and won by
William Wallace in 1297 against an occupying
English army.

in Scotland. The Scotland Act 1998, which set up
the Scottish Parliament and Executive (see below),
removed the statutory minimum of 71 Scottish
seats, and required the Boundary Commission
for Scotland to determine the level of Scottish
representation by applying the same electoral
quota as in England. The Boundary Commission
published its provisional recommendations of
new boundaries for Westminster constituencies in
Scotland in February 2002, recommending that
there should be 59 Scottish seats at the
Westminster Parliament. The Commission is due
to make its final review report between December
2002 and December 2006.
The House of Commons Scottish Grand
Committee comprises all MPs in Scottish
constituencies and may be convened anywhere in
Scotland as well as at Westminster. Its business can
include questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and other debates that are referred to it,
including those on statutory instruments.
The Scottish Parliament and Scottish
Executive
In a referendum held in September 1997, 74 per
cent of those who voted endorsed the UK
Government’s proposals to set up a Scottish
Parliament and Executive to administer Scottish
21

affairs. On a second question - whether to give
the new Parliament tax-varying powers - 64 per
cent were in favour. Legislation was introduced in
the Westminster Parliament in December 1997
and the following November the Scotland Act 1998
passed into law.
Elections to the first Scottish Parliament for
almost 300 years were held in May 1999, and it
met for the first time in July of that year. Unlike
the Westminster Parliament, the Scottish
Parliament does not have a second chamber to
revise legislation which comes before it. Detailed
scrutiny of Bills is carried out in committees or by
taking evidence from outside experts. The House
of Lords no longer considers Scottish legislation
on devolved matters (although it remains the final
court of appeal in hearing civil cases arising from
the Scottish courts - see chapter 14).
The Scottish Parliament’s 129 members (MSPs) are
elected for a fixed four-year term. The Additional
Member System of proportional representation is
used in Scottish Parliamentary elections, giving
each voter two votes: one for a constituency MSP
and one ‘regional’ vote for a registered political
party or an individual independent candidate.
There are 73 single-member constituency seats and
56 seats representing eight regions (based on the
European parliamentary constituencies), with each
region returning seven members. These MSPs are
allocated so that each party’s overall share of seats
in the Parliament reflects its share of the regional
vote.
The Labour Party, which has traditionally done
well in elections in Scotland, is the largest single
party (see Table 4.2), with 55 MSPs. It has 52 of
the 73 constituency seats, including nearly all
those in central Scotland. The Scottish National
Party is the second largest party, with 34 MSPs.
Most of its seats come from the ‘top-up’ PR
system, as do 18 of the Conservative Party’s 19,
making the latter the third largest party in the
Parliament. The Conservatives won their first
constituency seat in a by-election in March 2000,
taking it from the Labour Party.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has a seat in
the UK Cabinet and is responsible for
representing Scottish interests within the
Government through the Scotland Office.
The Scottish Executive - the administrative arm of
government in Scotland - has responsibility for all
Responsibilities
The Scottish Parliament is responsible for health;
education and training; local government; housing;
economic development; many aspects of home
affairs and civil and criminal law; transport; the
environment; agriculture, fisheries and forestry; and
sport, culture and the arts. In these areas, the
Scottish Parliament is able to amend or repeal
existing Acts of the UK Parliament and to pass new
legislation of its own.
Responsibility for a number of other issues, including
overseas affairs, defence and national security, overall
economic and monetary policy, energy, employment
legislation and social security, anti-discrimination,
asylum and immigration, remains with the UK
Government and Parliament as 'reserved' matters
under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998.
public bodies whose functions and services have
been devolved to it, and is accountable to the
Scottish Parliament for them.
The Parliament currently meets at the General
Assembly Hall in Edinburgh. A new Parliament
building is being built at Holyrood, at the lower
end of the Royal Mile, where the previous Scottish
Parliament met in Parliament House from 1640 to
1707. It is due for completion in autumn 2003.
The First Minister, normally the leader of the
party with most support in the Parliament, heads
the Scottish Executive. Since the first elections, the
Executive has been run by a partnership between
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with the latter
having two seats in the Cabinet of the Scottish
Parliament, including that of Deputy First
Minister. There are 11 Cabinet positions in all.
(See Appendix A for addresses and functions of
Scottish Executive departments.)
Finance
The Scottish Executive’s budget for 2003/04 is
£22.8 billion. The majority of the funding for the
Scottish Parliament comes from the UK
Parliament’s block grant through the Secretary of
State for Scotland’s Office, but other sources of
revenue include non-domestic rate income. The
Scottish Parliament is solely responsible for the
allocation of the total Scottish budget.
The Scottish Parliament has the power to increase
or decrease the basic rate of income tax in

A few distinctive facts about Scotland
■ Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language related to Irish,
was introduced into Scotland in about ad 500.
Today it is spoken by an estimated 70,000 people
mostly living along the north-west coast and in
the Hebrides. The Scottish Executive is providing
over £13.0 million to support Gaelic in 2002/03.
Broadcasting is the largest single area, accounting
for £8.5 million.
■ Education in Scotland is structured differently from
other parts of the UK, with significant differences
in the school curriculum and a separate system of
public examinations (see chapter 10).
■ The Scottish legal system (see chapter 14) differs
in many respects from that of England. During the
16th century, certain aspects of medieval church
law and much of the Roman, or civil, law as
developed by the jurists of Holland and France
helping to promote Scotland’s interests within the
European Union.
Structure of local government
Scotland’s 32 single-tier councils are responsible
for the full range of local government services,
including education, social work, police and fire
services, roads, public transport, local planning,
urban development, housing, libraries, leisure and
recreation. They are not compelled to provide
these services themselves: if they choose, they may
buy them in from other authorities or the private
sector.
was brought together to form the basis of Scots
law. The 1707 Treaty of Union allowed Scotland to
keep Scots law, its own courts and its legal
profession. The prosecution, prison and police
services are also separate from those in England
and Wales.
■ Scotland has a rich cultural heritage, which
invigorates its tradional arts scene and its
contemporary culture, particularly in terms of
music and the performing arts. There are also
several major collections of the fine and applied
arts, such as the National Gallery of Scotland and
the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in
Edinburgh, and the Burrell Collection in Glasgow.
In July 2001 a Museum of Scottish Country Life
was opened at Kittochside near East Kilbride, the
first major national museum in the west of
Scotland (see chapter 16).
23
The United Kingdom and its people
4 Scotland
Although local authorities are independent and
manage their own day-to-day business, the First
Minister has powers to oversee their work in areas
such as finance, town and country planning,
transport and housing.
Six of the eight police and fire brigades cover the
area of more than one local authority and are
administered by joint boards appointed by the
authorities in their areas. These boards appoint
their own Chief Constables and Firemasters who
are responsible for day-to-day operations.
‘Community Planning’ is a key theme in the
forthcoming Local Government in Scotland Bill.
In practical terms, it would create a framework for
local authorities, other public and private bodies,
the voluntary sector and the local community
aimed at improving service delivery and providing
a means of linking national and local priorities.
Community councils
Scotland also has around 1,200 community
councils. They are similar to parishes in England
and as such are non-political, broadly-based
organisations through which communities can
speak and act on issues they have identified
locally. Although they have no statutory powers,
they do have a right to be consulted on local
planning issues.
Economy
Extraction of offshore oil and gas, growth in
services and, more recently, developments in high-
technology industries (such as chemicals, electronic
engineering and information technology) have
taken the place of the traditional Scottish industries
of coal mining, steel production and shipbuilding.
Manufacturing still remains important, however,
and Scotland’s manufacturing exports in 2001 were
valued at £18.7 billion.
Some key features of the Scottish economy
■ Electronics: Scotland has one of the biggest
concentrations of the electronics industry in
Western Europe. Electrical and instrument
engineering exports were worth £11.0 billion in
2001, accounting for 58 per cent of Scotland's
manufactured exports.
■ Financial services: Financial services are one of
Scotland's most important industries, responsible
for contributing at least £11 billion to the
economy. Scotland is the sixth largest equity
management centre in Europe and fifteenth in the
world. Ten of Scotland's top 20 companies are in
the financial services sector, including Scotland's
largest company by capital value. Scotland now
commands 70 per cent of the UK financial services
market outside London. Direct employment in
financial services in Scotland is now close to
100,000 with a similar number of people in
supporting economic activity, accounting for more
than 10 per cent of the Scottish working population.
■ Fishing: Fishing remains significant, particularly in
the north-east and in the Highlands and Islands. In
2001, landings into Scotland accounted for 66 per
cent by weight and over 60 per cent by value of
landings by UK vessels into the UK. Fish farming,
particularly of salmon, has grown in importance;
Scotland produces the largest amount of farmed
salmon in the EU.
■ Forestry: Scotland accounts for just under half of
the UK's timber production. In the last ten years
there has been significant international and local
investment in wood-based panel production and
in pulp and paper processing.
■ Oil and gas: Offshore oil and gas production has
made a significant contribution to the UK
economy in the last 30 years. Many of the UK's
118 offshore oilfields are to the east of the Isles of
Shetland and Orkney or off the east coast of the
mainland.
■ row/sm:Tourism is a major source of revenue and
industries supporting tourism provide about
200,000 jobs. In 2001 expenditure by tourists was
valued at £4.1 billion and there were around
19.1 million tourist trips, including those
originating in Scotland.
■ Whisky: Whisky production continues to be
important to Scotland. In 2001 the value of drinks
exports, dominated by whisky, was estimated at
£2.3 billion. There are 90 whisky distilleries in
Scotland, most of them in the north-east.

Population
Wales (Cymru in Welsh) has a population of just
over 2.9 million, about two-thirds of whom live in
the southern valleys and the lower-lying coastal
areas. Cardiff, the capital, grew in the 19th century
as a coal exporting port, and the two other large
ports of Swansea and Newport also depended for
their prosperity on the surrounding mining and
metal production during the Industrial
Revolution. They are still among the most densely
populated areas today. The population has grown
by 89,700 (3 per cent) in the past 20 years, with
Ceredigion (23.1 per cent) seeing the greatest
population growth, while both Blaenau Gwent and
Merthyr Tydfil lost 7.5 per cent of their populations.
The highest population density in 2001 was in the
unitary authority area of Cardiff with 2,176 people
per sq km, and the lowest was in Powys with only
24 people per sq km.
Cities in Wales
Throughout the UK, city status cannot be claimed
by a town fulfilling certain criteria. Instead, those
known to be interested in the honour are invited to
apply by way of competition held from time to time.
Each application is considered on its merits and the
commonly held belief that the place chosen has to
have a cathedral is not true.
There are five cities in Wales. Cardiff was made a city
in 1905, while Swansea was honoured with city status
in 1969 to mark the investiture of the Prince of Wales.
The others are Bangor, St David's and the latest,
marking the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, Newport.
Newport has been the gateway to Wales since it was
the Roman town of Caerleon. Once famous for
steelmaking, it is now a centre of high technology
industry. In 2010 the city will host the Ryder Cup
golf tournament at the Celtic Manor Resort and
Hotel.

The House of Commons Welsh Grand Committee
comprises all MPs in Welsh constituencies and up
to five others who may be added from time to
time. Its role is to consider Bills referred to it at
second reading stage, questions tabled for oral
answer, ministerial statements, and other matters
relating exclusively to Wales.
Following devolution (see below), the UK
Government retains responsibility in Wales for
certain matters including foreign affairs, defence,
taxation, overall economic policy, crime, justice
and prisons, human rights and anti-
discrimination issues, social security and
broadcasting. The office of Secretary of State for
Wales continues with the post holder keeping a
seat in the UK Cabinet. He or she is responsible
for promoting the devolution settlement, bringing
forward primary legislation, bidding for the
Assembly’s budget and ensuring that Welsh
interests are properly represented and considered
within the UK Government.
National Assembly for Wales and Welsh
Assembly Government
In 1997 the Welsh people narrowly endorsed
government proposals to devolve certain powers
and responsibilities to a National Assembly. Of
those who voted, 50.3 per cent were in favour. The
Government of Wales Act 1998 laid down the
necessary statutory framework to establish the
National Assembly for Wales, which held its first
elections in May 1999 and began functioning as a
devolved administration two months later.
In February 2002 the National Assembly voted to
make clear the difference in roles between

ministers and the Assembly as a whole. The Welsh
Assembly Government develops and implements
policy. It is accountable to the National Assembly
and is primarily located in Cathays Park, Cardiff.
The National Assembly for Wales debates and
approves legislation and holds the Assembly
Government to account. Its debating chamber and
members are located at Cardiff Bay.
Electors have two votes in Assembly elections: one
for their local constituency and one for their
electoral region. The Assembly comprises 60
members (AMs): 40 from local constituencies
(with the same boundaries as those for Welsh seats
in the House of Commons) and 20 regional
members. The Assembly is elected by the
Additional Member System of proportional
representation.
The Labour Party has traditionally had strong
support in Wales. It has the largest number of
seats in the Assembly (see Table 5.2), although it
does not have an overall majority. Since October
2000 it has run the Assembly in partnership with
the Liberal Democrats.
The First Minister, who heads the Assembly, is
supported by a Cabinet of eight ministers in
charge of: economic development; finance, local
government and communities; education and
lifelong learning; health and social services;
culture, sport and the Welsh language ; rural
development and Wales abroad; environment; and
open government.
The Assembly is also responsible for over 50
public bodies. These include the Welsh
Development Agency, with a budget of £202
million in 2002/03 and total expenditure of some
£380 million; the Higher Education Funding
Powers of the Welsh Assembly
The National Assembly for Wales only has powers to
make secondary legislation (see page 40) which it
uses to meet distinctive Welsh needs. Primary
legislation on Welsh affairs continues to be made in
the UK Parliament at Westminster.
Within Wales, the Assembly has power to develop
and put into practice policies in the following areas:
agriculture, forestry, fisheries and food; ancient
monuments and historic buildings; culture; economic
development; education and training; the
environment; health and health services; highways;
housing; industry; local government; social services;
sport and recreation; tourism; town and country
planning; transport; water and flood defence; and
the Welsh language.
Council for Wales (with planned gross
expenditure in 2002/03 of £321 million); the
Sports Council for Wales, with projected gross

in aid from the Welsh Assembly Government and
£11 million in Lottery funding for sport) and the
Welsh Language Board (with a budget of £7.3
million in 2002/03).
The Secretary of State for Wales is voted the Welsh
Budget by the UK Parliament which he must then
pass on to the Assembly, after keeping back
enough to run his own office. The Assembly’s
budget for 2002/03 is £10.5 billion and for
2003/04, £11.2 billion.

A few distinctive facts about Wales
■ Welsh literature has a long tradition and is one
of the oldest in Europe. Music is also very
important to the Welsh people and Wales is
particularly well-known for its choral singing.
Special festivals, known as eisteddfodau,
encourage both Welsh literature and music (see
chapter 16).
■ The media in Wales include several Welsh and
English language newspapers, local radio
stations and the television broadcaster, Sianel
Pedwar Cymru (S4C - see chapter 17).
■ Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union, which has
come to be regarded as the Welsh national
game. Soccer is also very popular in Wales, and
the Football Association Cup Finals of May 2001
and 2002 were held at the Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff (see chapter 18).
■ About one-quarter of the land in Wales is
designated as a National Park or Area of
Outstanding Natural Beauty. The three National
Parks are Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and
the Pembrokeshire Coast. In addition, Wales has
over 1,000 Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
a number of internationally important nature
conservation sites (see chapter 19).
the European Parliament are by proportional
representation. Wales forms a single constituency.
An office in Brussels aims to promote Welsh
interests within the EU and works in close co¬
operation with the UK Representative Office
(UKREP).
Structure of local government
The 22 Welsh unitary authorities (see map on
page 27) have collective responsibility for
spending over a third of the National Assembly’s
budget. The Assembly sets the policy framework
and makes the secondary legislation within which
local government operates. It also has a
responsibility to ensure that local decision-making
reflects the requirements of the law and, where
appropriate, priorities fixed by the Assembly.
Whole council elections are held every fourth year,
with the next due in 2004.
The unitary authorities in Wales are responsible
for schools; social services; local environmental
services; housing; local roads; emergency
planning; libraries; museums and art galleries; and
economic development. Separate authorities are
responsible for the police and fire services.
The National Assembly has set up a Partnership
Council to advise it on the various functions of
local government. It comprises locally elected
representatives - including those from the
National Parks, police and fire authorities, and
community councils (see below) - and selected
members of the Assembly. It also assists the
Assembly in preparing guidance and advice to
local councils.
Communities and community councils
Welsh unitary authorities are subdivided into a
number of smaller areas called ‘communities’.
There are around 1,000 such communities, about
750 of which have community councils with
similar powers and functions to parish councils in
England (see page 9).
The Welsh language
■ Welsh is a Celtic language whose nearest
cousins are Cornish and Breton. The language as
spoken today is descended directly from Early
Welsh which emerged as a distinct tongue as
early as the sixth century.
■ Estimates suggest that 20 per cent of the
population over the age of three in private
households are able to speak Welsh. In much of
the rural north and west, Welsh remains the first
language. It is widely used for official purposes,
and is treated equally with English in the work
of the National Assembly.
■ The National Assembly encourages Welsh-
medium education in its schools. Since September
2000, Welsh has been taught - as a first or
second language - to all pupils between the
ages of 5 and 16, and other subjects are taught
in Welsh to primary and secondary schoolchildren
in about 500 schools (see chapter 10).
Economy
The Welsh economy, which traditionally relied on
coal and steel, experienced some major changes
during the 20th century. In recent years, Wales has

Some key features of the Welsh economy
■ Although there has been a decline in the steel
industry over recent years, it still remains
important to the Welsh economy, with crude
steel production in Wales at around 4.7 million
tonnes in 2001, accounting for 35 per cent of
UK steel output.
■ Manufacturing accounts for 27 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in Wales, compared with
19 per cent in the UK as a whole.
■ In the service sector, tourism and leisure services
are significant - estimates indicate that about
12.8 million tourist trips were made to Wales
from the UK and overseas in 2001.
■ A key feature of the economy has been the
volume of investment from overseas companies
and from elsewhere in the UK. Since 1983, over
2,000 inward investment projects have been
recorded in Wales, bringing in a total of £14.3
billion and promising the creation and
safeguarding of over 227,000 jobs. Overseas-
owned manufacturing companies in Wales
employ more than 74,000 people.
attracted a more varied range of manufacturing
industries, including many at the forefront of
technology, and a growing number involved in
e-commerce. Inward investment has also become
an important factor in the Welsh economy, and
cultural industries are now a rapidly growing
contributor.
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA - see page
340) has broad functions and powers, so that it is
well placed to contribute to economic
regeneration across the whole of Wales.

The UK in the European Union 57
The United Kingdom is a parliamentary
democracy, based on universal suffrage. It is also a
constitutional monarchy in which ministers of the
Crown govern in the name of the Sovereign, who is
both Head of State and Head of the Government.
There is no ‘written constitution’ as such; instead,
the relationship between the State and the people
relies on statute law, common law and
conventions.1
The UK Parliament makes primary legislation
(other than for matters devolved to the Scottish
Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly -
see chapters 3 and 4) and is the highest authority
in the land. It continues to have the supreme
authority for government and law-making in the
UK as a whole (see page 33). The executive
comprises the Government (members of the
Cabinet and other ministers responsible for
policies); government departments and agencies;
local authorities; public corporations; independent
regulatory bodies; and certain other organisations
subject to ministerial control. The judiciary (see
chapter 14) determines common law and
interprets statutes.
In her role as Monarch, the Queen is head of the
executive and plays an integral part in the
legislature. She heads the judiciary and is both the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the
Crown and ‘supreme governor’ of the established
Church of England.
Following devolution (see chapters 3, 4 and 5), the
responsibilities of the Secretaries of State for
1 Conventions are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as indispensable to the
working of government.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland changed
considerably, although they retain their positions
in the UK Cabinet. They ensure that the ‘reserved
interests’ (see pages 22 and 33) of the countries
they represent are properly considered in central
government and they lead the presentation of
government policy in their parts of the UK. They
are also responsible for safeguarding and
promoting the devolution settlements of their
respective countries.
Parliamentary electoral system
For electoral purposes the UK is divided into 659
constituencies, each of which returns one member
to the House of Commons. To ensure that
constituency electorates are kept roughly equal,
four permanent Parliamentary Boundary
Commissions, one each for England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, have kept
constituency size under review. After 2005, when
the Boundary Commissions for England, for Wales
and for Scotland are due to report on their latest
reviews, all four Commissions will be absorbed
into the independent Electoral Commission - see
page 55.
Voters
British citizens, and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and the Irish Republic
resident in the UK, may vote in parliamentary
elections provided that they are:
■ aged 18 or over;
■ included in the register of electors for the
constituency; and
■ not subject to any legal incapacity to vote.

Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
People not entitled to vote include members of
the House of Lords, foreign nationals resident in
the UK (other than Commonwealth citizens or
citizens of the Irish Republic), some patients
detained under mental health legislation,
sentenced prisoners and people convicted within
the previous five years of corrupt or illegal
election practices. Members of the armed forces,
Crown servants and staff of the British Council
employed overseas (together with their wives or
husbands if accompanying them) may be
registered at an address in the constituency where
they would live if not serving abroad. British
citizens living abroad may apply to register as
electors for a period of up to 15 years after they
have left the UK.
Voting procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, and usually does
so in person at a polling station. However,
measures aimed at modernising voting and
registration procedures for UK elections were
introduced under the Representation of the People
Act 2000 and implemented for the first time in the
General Election held in June 2001. Provisions in
the Act include:
■ the right for electors to cast their vote by post
if they find that method more convenient;
■ a rolling register, updated monthly, to enable
voters to register at any time of the year;
■ improved access and facilities for disabled
voters; and
■ easier registration for homeless people, those
in mental institutions, and unconvicted or
remand prisoners.
Voting is not compulsory in the UK and the
simple majority system is used for Westminster
elections. Candidates are elected if they have more
votes than any of the other candidates (although
not necessarily an absolute majority over all other
candidates).
Candidates
British citizens, and resident citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and the Irish Republic,
may stand for election as Members of Parliament
(MPs) provided that they are aged 21 or over and
are not disqualified. Disqualified people include
undischarged bankrupts; those sentenced to more
than one year’s imprisonment; members of the

A candidate’s nomination for election must be
proposed and seconded by two electors registered
as voters in the constituency and signed by eight
other electors. Candidates do not have to be
backed by a political party. A candidate must also
deposit £500, which is returned if he or she
receives 5 per cent or more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend on
a General Election campaign is £5,483 plus
4.6 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 6.2 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. A higher limit of £100,000
has been set for by-elections because they are
often seen as tests of national opinion in the
period between General Elections. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to these statutory maxima.
A candidate is also entitled to send one election
communication to each voter free of postal
charges.
Parliament
Origins
Medieval kings had to meet all royal expenses,
private and public, out of their own income. If
extra resources were needed for an emergency,
32
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
such as going to war, the Sovereign would seek
help from his barons in the Great Council - a
gathering of leading men which met several times
a year. During the 13th century several English
kings found their own private revenue, together
with aid from the barons, insufficient to meet the
expenses of government. They therefore called not
only their land-owning barons to the Great
Council but also representatives of counties, cities
and towns, mainly to get them to agree to
additional taxation. In this way the Great Council
came to include those who were summoned by
name (who, broadly speaking, were later to form
the House of Lords) and those who were
representatives of communities - the Commons.
These two groups, together with the Sovereign,
became known as ‘Parliament’ - a term meaning a
meeting for parley or discussion.
Originally the King’s legislation needed only the
agreement of his councillors, but, starting with the
right of individuals to present petitions, the
Commons was eventually allowed to appeal to the
Crown on behalf of groups of people. During the
15th century they won the right to take part in the
process of giving their requests - or ‘Bills’ - the
form of law.
Powers
There are three parts of Parliament - the elected
House of Commons, the appointed House of
Lords and the Sovereign. They meet together only
on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
State Opening of Parliament, when the Commons
is summoned by the Sovereign to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three is normally
needed to pass laws, but that of the Sovereign is
given as a matter of course.
Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the UK
as a whole and has powers to legislate for any
parts of it separately. However, by convention it
will not normally legislate on devolved matters in
Scotland and Northern Ireland without the
agreement of the Scottish Parliament and the
Northern Ireland Assembly respectively. Under the
Acts of Parliament which set up these
administrations, the Westminster Parliament still
has UK-wide responsibility in a number of areas,
including defence, foreign affairs, economic and
monetary policy, social security, employment, and
equal opportunities.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which
are Crown dependencies and not part of the UK
(see also page 6), legislation on domestic matters
normally takes the form of laws enacted by Island
legislatures. However, UK laws are sometimes
extended to the Islands, with their agreement, for
example in matters such as immigration and
broadcasting.
As there are no legal restraints imposed by a
written constitution, Parliament may legislate as it
pleases, as long as the UK meets its obligations as
a member of the European Union (see page 59). It
can make or change law, and overturn established
conventions or turn them into law. It can even
legislate to prolong its own life beyond the normal
period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not assert
itself in this way. Its members work within the
common law and normally act according to
precedent. The House of Commons is directly
responsible to the electorate, and, during the 20th
century, the House of Lords increasingly
recognised the supremacy of the elected chamber.
Functions
The main functions of Parliament are:
■ to pass laws;
■ to provide (by voting for taxation) the means
of carrying on the work of government;
■ to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
■ to debate the major issues of the day.
In performing these, Parliament helps to bring the
relevant facts and issues to the attention of the
electorate. By custom, Parliament is also informed
before important international treaties and
agreements are ratified. The making of treaties is,
however, a royal prerogative carried out on the
advice of the Government and does not need
parliamentary approval.
Meetings
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but not all Parliaments serve their full five-
year term. The maximum life has been prolonged
by legislation only in rare circumstances, such as
the two World Wars. The Sovereign dissolves
Parliament and calls for a General Election on the
advice of the Prime Minister.
33
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
The life of a Westminster Parliament is divided
into sessions. Each usually lasts for one year -
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ (when the
House does not sit) at night, at weekends, at
Christmas, Easter and the late Spring Bank
Holiday, and during a long summer break usually
starting in late July. The average number of ‘sitting
days’ in a session is about 148 in the House of
Commons and about 152 in the House of Lords.2
At the start of each session the Sovereign’s speech
to Parliament outlines the Government’s policies
and proposed legislative programme. Each session
is ended by the Sovereign dismissing it - called
‘prorogation’. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued’
for a few days until the new session begins.
Prorogation brings to an end nearly all
parliamentary business: in particular, public Bills
which have not been passed by the end of the
session are lost, unless the Opposition has agreed
they may be carried over.
House of Commons
The House of Commons consists of 659 elected
MPs. In July 2002 there were 118 women MPs and
12 MPs who had declared that they were of
minority ethnic origin. Of the 659 seats, 529
represent constituencies in England, 40 in Wales,
72 in Scotland, and 18 in Northern Ireland.
After a Parliament has been dissolved, and a
General Election has been held, the Sovereign
summons a new Parliament. When an MP dies,
resigns3 or is made a member of the House of
Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid
an annual salary of £55,118 (from April 2002) and
provided with up to £72,310 for staff salaries and
£18,234 for incidental expenses. (For ministers’
salaries see page 45). All MPs are entitled to travel
allowances and London members may claim a
supplement for the higher cost of living in the
capital. MPs from other parts of the UK may
receive allowances for subsistence and for a second
home near Westminster.
2 Taken over the last seven sessions. This includes two 'short'
sessions in the election years of 1997 (1996-97, 79 days) and
2001 (2000-01, 83 days) and the Tong' session in 1997-98
(228 days).
3 By tradition, an MP who wishes to resign from the House can do
so only by applying for office as Crown Steward or Bailiff of the
Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of the Manor of Northstead. These
positions disqualify the holder from membership of the House of
Commons.
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the
Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over the House.
Other officers include the Chairman of Ways and
Means and two deputy chairmen, who may all act
as Deputy Speakers. They are elected by the House
as nominees of the Government, but may come
from the Opposition as well as the government
party. The House of Commons Commission,
a statutory body chaired by the Speaker, is
responsible for the administration of the House.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs) include the
Clerk of the House of Commons - the principal
adviser to the Speaker on the House’s privileges
and procedures. The Clerk’s other responsibilities
relate to the conduct of the business of the House
and its committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms, who
waits upon the Speaker, carries out certain orders
of the House. He is also the official housekeeper of
the Commons’ part of the Palace of Westminster
and is responsible for security.
House of Lords
Current composition
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual
and the Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual are
the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the
Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and
the 21 next most senior bishops of the Church of
England. The Lords Temporal consist of:
■ hereditary peers;
■ life peers created to help carry out the judicial
duties of the House (up to 12 Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary or ‘Law Lords’ and a
number of other Lords of Appeal);4 and
■ all other life peers.
The number of peers eligible to sit at July 2002 is
shown in Table 6.2 (see page 35), which also
shows how the three main political parties were
represented. Crossbenchers, many of whom have
specialist knowledge and expertise, do not vote
with a political party. There were 116 women
peers at July 2002.
4 The House of Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in
the UK and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland (see chapter 14).

Members of the House of Lords receive no salary
for their parliamentary work, but they can claim
for expenses incurred in attending the House (for
which there are maximum daily rates) and for
certain travelling expenses. Average daily
attendance is about 369 members.
Reform
In its first term of office, the Government
announced that it wanted the House of Lords to
be more representative of British society at the
start of the 21st century. As a first step, it passed
legislation in November 1999 to reduce the
number of hereditary peers from over 750 to 92.
In May 2000 the House of Lords Appointments
Commission was set up to make
recommendations on the appointment of non¬
political peers to be chosen from public nominees.
The Commission invited nominations in
September 2000 and in April 2001 the Queen
announced her intention to give non-political life
peerages to the 15 people recommended. They
were selected from a total of 3,166 applications on
the basis that they would bring considerable
experience and authority to the House of Lords,
adding to the range of expertise available in a
number of areas, including science, social policy,
housing, employment, education, business and
international affairs.
After winning its second consecutive term of
office in June 2001, the Government announced
its intention to consult and then introduce
legislation to implement the next phase of House
of Lords reform. A White Paper (The House of
Lords - Completing the Reform) was published in
November 2001. In May 2002 the Lord Chancellor
announced that the Government was inviting the
House of Commons and the House of Lords to
establish a Joint Committee to take the reform
forward.
The Joint Committee has been asked to prepare
a report on options for the ultimate composition
and powers of the House of Lords once a
complete reform has been accomplished. These
options, which include a fully nominated and
fully elected House, and any intermediate options,
will be presented to both Houses and put to a free
vote. The Committee has also been asked to
recommend a transition strategy for the reform
process.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor (see page 45), who sits on the
woolsack5 and acts as Speaker of the House. If the
Lord Chancellor is not present, a nominated
deputy takes his place.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk of the
Parliaments is responsible for the records of
proceedings of the House of Lords and for the text
of Acts of the UK Parliament. He is the accounting
officer for the House, and is in charge of its
administrative staff, known as the Parliament
Office. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
usually known simply as ‘Black Rod’, is responsible
for security, accommodation and services in the
House of Lords’ part of the Palace of Westminster.
Parliamentary privilege
To ensure that Parliament can carry out its duties
without hindrance, certain rights and immunities
apply collectively to each House and its staff, and
individually to each Member. These include
freedom of speech; first call on the attendance of
Members, who are therefore free from arrest in
civil actions and excused from serving on juries,
or being forced to attend court as witnesses; and
the right of access to the Crown, which is a
collective privilege of the House. Further
privileges include the rights of the House to
control its own proceedings (so that it is able, for
instance, to keep out ‘strangers’6 if it wishes); to
decide upon legal disqualifications for
5 The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion stuffed with
wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a tradition
dating from the medieval period, when wool was the chief source
of the country's wealth.

membership and to declare a seat vacant on such
grounds; and to punish for breach of its privileges
and for contempt. Parliament has the right to
punish anybody, inside or outside the House, who
commits a breach of privilege - that is, offends
against the rights of the House.
Parliamentary procedure
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on
precedent and is set down by each House in a
code of practice known as its ‘Standing Orders’.
The debating system is similar in both Houses.
Every subject starts off as a proposal or ‘motion’
by a member. After debate, in which each member
(except the person putting forward the motion)
may speak only once, the motion may be
withdrawn: if it is not, the Speaker or Chairman
‘puts the question’ whether to agree to the motion
or not. The question may be decided without
voting, or by a simple majority vote. The main
difference between the two Houses is that in the
House of Lords the Lord Chancellor or the
deputising Chairman do not control procedure;
instead such matters are decided by the general
feeling of the House, which is sometimes
interpreted by its Leader.
In the Commons the Speaker has full authority to
enforce the rules of the House and must uphold
procedure and protect minority rights. The
Speaker may or may not allow a motion to end
discussion so that a matter may be put to the vote,
and has powers to stop irrelevant and repetitious
contributions in debate. In cases of serious
disorder the Speaker can adjourn or suspend the
sitting. The Speaker may order members who have
broken the rules of behaviour of the House to
leave the Chamber, or may suspend them for a
number of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the Commons
and announces the final result. If there is a tie, the
Speaker gives a casting vote (usually to keep the
situation as it is), without expressing an opinion
on the merits of the question. Voting procedure in
the House of Lords is broadly similar. The Lord
Chancellor may vote, but does not have a casting
vote.
Public access to parliamentary proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally public
and may be broadcast on television and radio,
either live or, more usually, in recorded or edited
form. Complete coverage is available on cable and
satellite television and a pilot project to ‘webcast’
parliamentary debates on the Internet began in
January 2002. The minutes, speeches and
parliamentary questions (see page 37) are
transcribed in Hansard, the Official Report, and
are also published daily on the Parliament website.
Select committees
Select committees are appointed for a particular
task, generally one of enquiry, investigation and
scrutiny. They report their conclusions and
recommendations to the House as a whole; in
many cases they invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the House.
A select committee may be appointed for a
Parliament, or for a session, or for as long as it
takes to complete its task. Each committee is
constituted on a basis which is in approximate
proportion to party strength in the House.
In their examination of government policies,
expenditure and administration, select committees
may question ministers, civil servants, interested
bodies and individuals. Through hearings and
published reports, they bring before Parliament
and the public an extensive amount of fact and
informed opinion on many issues, and build up
considerable expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
Fifteen committees have been set up by the House
of Commons to examine aspects of public policy,
expenditure and administration across the main
government departments and their associated
public bodies. The Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work of
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. Other
regular Commons select committees include those
on Public Accounts and on Standards and
Privileges, and there are ‘domestic’ select
committees covering the internal workings of
Parliament.
Each House has a select committee to keep it
informed of EU developments, and to enable it to
scrutinise and debate EU policies and proposals,
while three Commons standing committees
debate specific European legislative proposals.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal and
Appellate Committees in which most of the
House’s judicial work is carried out, there are
select committees - working in the same manner
as House of Commons committees - on the
European Union, Science and Technology, the
Constitution, and Economic Affairs. From time to
time other committees may also be set up to

Examination of government policy
In addition to the scrutiny by select committees, both
Houses offer a number of other opportunities for the
Opposition and the Government's own backbenchers
to examine policy. In the House of Commons, these
include:
■ Question Time: for 55 minutes on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, ministers
answer MPs' questions. Prime Minister's Question
Time takes place for half an hour every Wednesday
when the House is sitting. Parliamentary Questions
are one means of finding out about the
Government's intentions. They are also a way of
raising complaints brought to MPs' notice by
constituents. MPs may also put questions to
ministers for written answer; the questions and
answers are published in Hansard. There are about
40,000 questions every year.
■ Adjournment debates: MPs use motions for the
adjournment of the House to raise constituency
cases or matters of public concern. There is a half-
hour adjournment period at the end of the
business of the day, and opportunities for several
adjournment debates on Wednesday mornings.
Westminster Hall is also widely used for
adjournment debates.
■ Emergency debates: an MP wishing to discuss
a 'specific and important matter that should have
urgent consideration' may, at the end of Question
Time, ask for an adjournment of the House. On the
very few occasions when this action is successful,
the matter is debated for three hours in what is
known as an emergency debate, usually on the
following day.
consider particular issues (or, sometimes, a
particular Bill), and ‘domestic’ committees - as in
the Commons - cover the internal workings of the
House.
Control of finances
The UK Parliament (and in particular the House
of Commons) has the responsibility of overseeing
revenue generation and public expenditure. It has
to be sure that the sums granted on each area of
spending are used only for the purposes intended.
No payment out of the central government’s
public funds can be made, and no taxation or
loans authorised, except by Act of Parliament.
However, limited interim payments can be made
from the Contingencies Fund.
■ Early day motions (EDMs): backbench MPs may
express their views on particular issues in this way.
A number of EDMs are tabled each sitting day;
they are very rarely debated but can be useful in
measuring the amount of support for the topic by
the number of MPs who add their signatures to
the EDM.
■ Opposition days: on 20 days in each session
(sometimes divided into half-days) opposition
parties choose the business to be discussed. Of
these days, 17 are allocated to the Leader of the
Opposition and three to the second largest
opposition party.
■ Expenditure debates: the details of proposed
government expenditure are debated on three
days in each session.
■ Procedural opportunities: criticism of the
Government may also occur during the debate on
the Queen's Speech at the beginning of each
session, on motions of censure for which the
Government provides time, and in debates on the
Government's legislative and other proposals.
■ Motions of no confidence: as a final act of
parliamentary control, the House of Commons
may force the Government to resign by passing
a resolution of 'no confidence'. The Government
must also resign if the House rejects a proposal
which the Government considers so vital to its
policy that it has declared it a 'matter of
confidence' or if the House refuses to vote the
money required for the public service.
The Finance Act is the most important piece of
annual legislation. It authorises the raising of
revenue and is based on the Chancellor of the
Exchequer’s Budget statement (see page 335).
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out by
House of Commons select committees (see
page 36).
The law-making process in the
UK Parliament
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament
(primary legislation) and delegated or secondary
legislation (usually in the form of statutory
37
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
instruments) made by ministers under powers
given to them by an Act (see page 40). While the
interpretation of the law is refined constantly in
the courts (see chapter 14), changes to statute law
can only be made by Parliament. (Since
devolution, the Scottish Parliament and the
Northern Ireland Assembly can also make primary
legislation on devolved matters - see pages 22
and 15.)
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary Bills.
Proposals for legislation affecting the powers of
particular bodies (such as individual local
authorities) or the rights of individuals (such as
certain plans relating to railways, roads and
harbours) are known as Private Bills, and are
subject to a special form of parliamentary
procedure. Bills which change the general law and
make up the more significant part of the
parliamentary legislative process are called Public
Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either House,
by a government minister or any MP or peer.
Most Public Bills which become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’. Bills
introduced by other MPs or peers are known as
‘Private Members’ Bills (see box on page 40).
Government Bills are generally accompanied by
Explanatory Notes, written by the Department
which is promoting the Bill and updated if it is
enacted. The notes are not passed or endorsed by
Parliament. The purpose is to provide background
information and to make it easier for the reader to
understand what the Bill is seeking to achieve.
The main Bills forming the Government’s
legislative programme are announced in the
Queen’s Speech at the State Opening of
Parliament, which usually takes place in
November or shortly after a General Election, and
the Bills themselves are introduced into one or
other of the Houses over the following weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there may be
consultation with professional bodies, voluntary
organisations and others with an interest,
including pressure groups looking to promote
specific causes. ‘White Papers’, which are
government statements of policy, often contain
proposals for changes in the law; these may be
debated in Parliament before a Bill is introduced.
As part of the process of modernising procedures,
some Bills are now published in draft for pre¬
legislative scrutiny before beginning their passage
through Parliament. The aim is to allow more
input from backbenchers and other interested
parties at an early stage, helping to save time and
reducing the number of amendments made
during the legislative process. The Government
may also publish consultation papers, sometimes
called ‘Green Papers’, setting out proposals which
are still taking shape and inviting comments from
the public.
Passage of Government Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses (see Figure 6.3 on page 39). Bills relating
mainly to financial matters are almost always
introduced in the Commons.
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may vote to turn itself into a
‘Committee of the Whole House’ in order to
consider Bills in detail after their second reading.
This allows unrestricted discussion: the general
rule that an MP or peer may speak only once on
each motion does not apply in committee.
Standing committees
House of Commons standing committees debate
and consider Public Bills at the committee stage.
The committee examines the Bill clause by clause,
and may amend it before reporting back to the
House. Ordinary standing committees do not have
names but are called simply Standing Committee
A, B, C and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members, with
a party balance reflecting as far as possible that in
the House as a whole. In the Lords, various sorts
of committees on Bills may be used (such as
Grand Committees and Select Committees - see
page 36) instead of, or as well as, a Committee of
the Whole House.
In the Commons the House may vote to limit the
time available for consideration of a Bill. This is
done by passing a ‘timetable’ motion proposed
by the Government, commonly known as a
‘guillotine’.
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen for
Royal Assent, after which it becomes an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been refused
since 1707. In the 2000-01 session 21 Public Bills
were enacted.

Private Members' Bills
Early in each session backbench members of the
Commons ballot for the chance to introduce a Bill
on one of the Fridays when such Bills have
precedence over government business. The first 20
members whose names are drawn win this privilege,
but it does not guarantee that their Bills will pass
into law. Members may also present a Bill on any
day without debate, while on most Tuesdays and
Wednesdays when the Commons is sitting MPs may
introduce a Bill under the 'ten minute rule', which
gives an opportunity for a brief speech by the
member proposing the Bill and one by a member
opposing it.
In most sessions some Private Members' Bills
become law (although there were none in the
2000-01 session). They do not often require public
expenditure, but if they do they cannot go forward
to committee stage unless the Government decides
to provide the necessary money. Peers may
introduce Private Members' Bills in the House of
Lords at any time. A Private Member's Bill passed by
one House will not proceed in the other unless
taken up by a member of that House.
Private Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers. They
go through a similar process to Public Bills, but
most of the work is done in committee, where
procedures follow a semi-judicial pattern.
Hybrid Bills
Hybrid Bills are Public Bills which may affect private
rights, for example, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill,
which was passed in 1996. As with Private Bills,
there are special arrangements for the passage of
Hybrid Bills through Parliament which allow those
affected to put their case.
Limitations on the power of the Lords
The main legislative function of the House of
Lords is to act as a revising chamber,
complementing but not rivalling the elected
House of Commons. As a result, it has some
limitations on its powers. Under the provisions of
the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the powers
of the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
restricted. Bills authorising taxation or national
expenditure are passed without amendment as a
formality. A Bill dealing only with taxation or
expenditure must become law within one month
of being sent to the Lords, whether or not the
Lords agree to it, unless the Commons direct
otherwise.
The Parliament Acts also make it possible for a Bill
to be passed by the Commons without the consent
of the Lords in certain, though very rare,
circumstances. The Lords do not usually prevent
Bills from being enacted which the Commons are
keen to pass, although they will often amend and
return them for further consideration. If no
agreement is reached between the two Houses on
a non-fmancial Commons Bill, the Lords can
delay the Bill for a period which, in practice,
amounts to at least 13 months. Following this, the
Bill may be presented to the Queen for Royal
Assent, provided it has been passed in the current
session and previous session by the Commons.
There is one important exception: any Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament needs the full
assent of both Houses.
Secondary legislation
To reduce unnecessary pressure on parliamentary
time, primary legislation often gives ministers or
other authorities the power to make detailed rules
and regulations under an Act by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation (usually in the
form of‘statutory instruments’ or ‘Sis’). Such
powers are normally delegated only to authorities
directly accountable to Parliament or to the
devolved legislatures, so that the risk of
undermining the authority of the UK Parliament
is kept to a minimum. Acts which allow for
delegated legislation usually give Parliament the
opportunity to agree (‘affirmative procedure’) or
disagree (‘negative procedure’) with any resulting
Sis, while some also require that organisations
affected must be consulted before rules and orders
can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the
technical propriety of these Sis. In order to save
time on the floor of the House, the Commons
uses standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments (unless they are simply laid before the
House or subject to negative resolution); actual
decisions are taken by the House as a whole. In the
Lords, debates on Sis take place on the floor of the
House, which (in contrast to primary legislation)
does have the power of veto. The House of Lords
has appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the appropriateness of
the powers to make secondary legislation in Bills.

Joint committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn from
both Houses, are appointed in each session to deal
with Consolidation Bills7 and Sis (see page 40).
The two Houses may also agree to set up joint
select committees on other subjects, such as the
Joint Committee on the Reform of the House of
Lords (see page 35) and on Human Rights.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. The Queen’s title in the UK is
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories
Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of
the Faith’. In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man she is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor.
In addition to being queen of the United
Kingdom, the Queen is also Head of State of 15
other realms8 and Head of the Commonwealth. In
each country where she is Head of State, she is
represented by a Governor-General, appointed by
her on the advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and independent of the UK
Government.
In the Overseas Territories (see page 66) the Queen
is usually represented by governors who are
responsible to the UK Government for the
administration of the countries in which they serve.
Succession, accession and coronation
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute
and partly from common law rules of descent.
Despite interruptions in the direct line of
succession, inheritance has always been how the
Monarchy has passed down the generations, with
sons of the Sovereign coming before daughters in
succeeding to the throne. When a daughter does
succeed, she becomes Queen Regnant, and has the
same powers as a king. The ‘consort’ of a king
takes her husband’s rank and style, becoming
Queen. No special rank or privileges are given to
the husband of a Queen Regnant.
7 A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts into
one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.

Facts and figures from the current reign
In June 2002 the Queen celebrated her Golden
Jubilee. Here are some statistics gathered from her
50 years on the throne:
■ the Queen is the fifth longest serving British
monarch - only Victoria, George III, Henry III and
Edward III have reigned for 50 years or more;
■ she is the 40th monarch since William the
Conqueror ruled England;
■ she has conferred over 380,000 honours and
awards, personally held more than 450
investitures and received around 3 million items
of correspondence;
■ over the course of the reign, well over 1 million
people have attended garden parties at
Buckingham Palace in London or the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh;
■ she has given Royal Assent to more than 3,100
Acts of Parliament;
■ she has given regular Tuesday evening audiences
to ten Prime Ministers;
■ in 50 years the Queen has undertaken 251
official visits to 128 different countries ranging
in size from the Cocos Islands (area 14 sq km,
population 655) to the People's Republic of
China (area 9.6 million sq km, population 1.25
billion). By the end of 2002 she will have visited
Canada 20 times, Australia 14 times, New
Zealand ten times and Jamaica six times;
■ she has sent almost 100,000 telegrams to
people aged 100 and more than 280,000
telegrams to couples celebrating their 60th
wedding anniversaries in the UK and the
Commonwealth;
■ she has given 88 State banquets and launched
17 ships (including the Queen Elizabeth 2 in
September 1967); and
■ she has sat for over 120 portraits during her
reign, the most recent being painted in 2001 by
Lucian Freud.

succeed. The order of succession to the throne
(see also page 44) can be altered only by common
consent of the countries of the Commonwealth of
which the Monarch is Sovereign.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon as
his or her predecessor dies: there is no interval
without a ruler. He or she is at once proclaimed at
an Accession Council, to which all members of the
Privy Council (see page 44) are called. Members of
the House of Lords, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen
and other leading citizens of the City of London
are also invited.
The coronation follows the accession. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey in
London in the presence of representatives of both
Houses of Parliament and all the major public
organisations in the UK. The Prime Ministers and
leading members of the Commonwealth nations
and representatives of other countries also attend.

published for the first time as part of the Royal
Household’s commitment to openness and
accountability in its use of public money. The
Civil List Report is more detailed than the ten-
yearly Royal Trustees Report (see below), with
more information about Royal Household
operations, performance indicators and future
developments.
In July 2000 a Royal Trustees’ Report
recommended that Civil List payments should
remain at the 1991 level of £7.9 million a year for
a further ten years from 2001. About three-
quarters of the Queen’s Civil List provision is
needed to meet the cost of staff. Under the Civil
List, the Duke of Edinburgh receives an annual
parliamentary allowance of £359,000 (which the
Queen reimburses) to enable him to carry out his
public duties. In return for the Civil List and other
financial support, the Queen surrenders the
income from the Crown Estate (£148 million in
2001/02) and other hereditary revenues to the
nation. The Prince of Wales does not receive a
parliamentary allowance since he is entitled to the
annual net revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall.
In 2001/02 the Queen’s total expenditure as Head
of State was £35.3 million, of which £15.5 million
was spent on the upkeep of the royal palaces,
£4.9 million on royal travel, and £643,000 on
communications and information services.
The Queen’s private expenditure as Sovereign
comes from the Privy Purse, which is financed
mainly from the revenues of the Duchy of
Lancaster;9 her expenditure as a private individual
is met from her own personal resources.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid income
tax on all personal income and on that part of the
Privy Purse income which is used for private
purposes. She also pays tax on any realised capital
gains on her private investments and on the
private proportion of assets in the Privy Purse. In
line with this, the Prince of Wales pays tax on the
income from the Duchy of Cornwall so far as it is
used for private purposes.
In July 2001 the Lord Chamberlain, the most
senior member of the Queen’s Household,

trust for the Sovereign since 1399. It is kept quite apart from his
or her other possessions and is separately administered by the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
published revised guidelines setting out how
members of the Royal Family could pursue
careers, including those in business, in a way
which would avoid allegations that they were
exploiting their royal status. Before a member of
the Royal Family takes on a new business activity,
he or she must consult the Lord Chamberlain,
who would be expected to advise against accepting
an invitation to an engagement which could not
be kept entirely separate from any aspects of the
business activities of the member of the Royal
Family concerned.
The Monarch's role in government
As a result of a long process of change during
which the Monarchy’s absolute power has been
gradually reduced, custom now dictates that the
Queen usually follows ministerial advice. Within
this framework she performs a range of important
duties, such as summoning, proroguing (see page
34) and dissolving Parliament; and giving Royal
Assent to legislation passed by the UK or Scottish
Parliament or by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The Queen formally appoints important office
holders, including the Prime Minister and other
government ministers (see page 44), judges,
officers in the armed forces, governors, diplomats,
bishops and some other senior clergy of the
Church of England. In instances where people
have been wrongly convicted of crimes, she is
involved in pardoning them. She also confers
peerages, knighthoods and other honours.10 In
international affairs the Queen, as Head of State,
has the power to declare war and make peace, to
recognise foreign states, to conclude treaties and
to take over or give up territory.
The Queen holds Privy Council meetings (see
page 44), gives audiences to her ministers and
officials in the UK and overseas, receives accounts
of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
state papers. She is consulted on many aspects of
national life, and must show complete
impartiality.
The law states that a regent has to be appointed to
perform the royal functions if the monarch is
totally incapacitated. The regency follows the line
of succession, provided that the person concerned
has reached the age of 18. The first eight members
10 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice
of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her personally - the
Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit
and the Royal Victorian Order.

of the Royal Family in order of succession to the
Throne are: The Prince of Wales, Prince William
of Wales, Prince Henry of Wales, The Duke of
York, Princess Beatrice of York, Princess Eugenie
of York, The Earl of Wessex, and the Princess
Royal.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief source
of executive power in the State, but as the system
of Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, the Cabinet took on much of its role.
Today the Privy Council is the main way in which
ministers advise the Queen on the approval of
Orders in Council (such as those granting Royal
Charters or enacting subordinate legislation) or
on the issue of royal proclamations (such as the
summoning or dissolving of Parliament).
In August 2002 there were 474 Privy Counsellors,
whose appointments are for life. The Privy
Council consists of all members of the Cabinet,
other senior politicians, senior judges and some
individuals from the Commonwealth. It is only
members of the government of the day, however,
who play any part in its policy work. The Prime
Minister recommends membership of the Privy
Council to the Sovereign.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council committees
(of which the Cabinet is technically one),
normally comprising ministers with the relevant
policy interest, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man. Except for the Judicial Committee,
membership is confined to members of the
administration of the day.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is
the final court of appeal from courts in UK
Overseas Territories and those Commonwealth
countries which decided to keep this method of
appeal after their independence. In addition, the
Committee hears appeals from the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man, and (until the end of
2002) from the disciplinary and health
committees of the medical and associated
professions. It is the court of final appeal for
determining devolution issues (that is, issues as to
the limits of the powers and functions of the
executive and legislative authorities in Scotland,
Northern Ireland and Wales). It also has a limited
jurisdiction to hear certain ecclesiastical appeals.
Members of the Judicial Committee include the
Lord Chancellor, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
other Privy Counsellors who hold or have held
high judicial office and certain judges from the
Commonwealth.
Her Majesty's Government
Her Majesty’s Government consists of those
ministers responsible for the conduct of national
affairs. The Queen alone appoints the Prime
Minister, and all other ministers are appointed by
her on the Prime Minister’s recommendation.
Most ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully represented
by ministers in the Lords. The Lord Chancellor
(see page 45) is always a member of the House of
Lords.
The composition of governments can vary both in
the number of ministers and in the titles of some
offices. New ministerial offices may be created,
others may be abolished, and functions may be
transferred from one minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First Lord
of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service.
The Prime Minister’s unique position of authority
comes from majority support in the House of
Commons and from the power to appoint and
dismiss ministers. By modern convention, the
Prime Minister always sits in the Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the Cabinet (see
page 46), is responsible for allocating functions
among ministers and, at regular meetings with the
Queen, informs her of the general business of the
Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include
recommending a number of appointments to the
Queen. These include Church of England
archbishops, bishops and certain deans and some
200 other clergy in Crown ‘livings’; senior judges,
such as the Lord Chief Justice; Privy Counsellors;
and Lords Lieutenant. He also recommends
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland (after consultation with the
first Minister of the Scottish Parliament), The
Poet Laureate, The Constable of the Tower of
London, and some university posts; and
appointments to several public boards and
institutions, such as the BBC (British Broadcasting
44
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
Corporation), as well as various royal and
statutory commissions.
The Prime Minister’s Office supports him in his role
as head of government. This includes providing
policy advice, tracking the delivery of government
commitments and initiatives, and ensuring effective
communications to Parliament, the media and the
public. Following the 2001 General Election, several
new units - including the Delivery Unit, the Forward
Strategy Unit and the Office of Public Services
Reform - have been set up within the Cabinet Office
to assist the Prime Minister in these tasks.
Deputy Prime Minister
In May 2002 the Prime Minister announced that
the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)
would be separated from the Cabinet Office (see
page 46) and established as a central government
department in its own right, taking responsibility
for policy areas from both the old Department for
Transport, Local Government and the Regions
(DTLR) and the Cabinet Office.
The Deputy Prime Minister is First Secretary of
State, deputising for the Prime Minister in his
responsibilities in the UK and abroad and chairing
seven Cabinet Committees and sub-committees.
He will be taking forward the White Papers on
regional governance - Your Region, Your Choice:
Revitalising the English Regions (see page 10) - and
urban policy - Our Towns and Cities: The Future
(see page 307).
The ODPM oversees the work of the Social
Exclusion Unit and has responsibility for the
Regional Co-ordination Unit and the Government
Offices for the Regions (GOs - see page 9). It also
assists the Deputy Prime Minister in his role in
support of the Prime Minister on issues such as
Northern Ireland and climate change. Its new
responsibilities include: regional policy; local
government; local government finance; planning;
housing; urban policy; the Neighbourhood
Renewal Unit; and the Fire Service.
Departmental ministers
Ministers in charge of government departments
are usually in the Cabinet; they are known as
‘Secretary of State’ or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental ministers
The holders of various traditional offices, namely
the President of the Council, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal, the
Paymaster General and, from time to time,
Ministers without Portfolio, may have few or no
departmental duties. They are therefore available
to carry out any duties the Prime Minister may
wish to give them. In the present administration,
for example, the President of the Council is Leader
of the House of Commons, and the Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster is Minister for the Cabinet
Office.
Lord Chancellor and law officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, as
both a minister with departmental functions and
the head of the judiciary (see page 197). The three
Law Officers of the Crown advising the UK
Government are the Attorney General and the
Solicitor General (for England and Wales) and the
Advocate General for Scotland.
Other ministers
Ministers of State are middle-ranking ministers.
They normally have specific responsibilities, and
are sometimes given titles which reflect these
functions, for example, ‘Minister for Housing and
Planning’ or ‘Minister for E-Commerce and
Competitiveness’.
The most junior ministers are Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State (or, where the senior
minister is not a Secretary of State, simply
Parliamentary Secretaries). They may be given
responsibility, directly under the departmental
minister, for specific aspects of the department’s
work.
Ministerial salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons (from April 2002) range from £82,624
a year for junior ministers to £124,979 for Cabinet
ministers (inclusive of their parliamentary salaries
- see page 34). The Prime Minister receives
a salary of £171,554 and the Lord Chancellor
£180,045.
Ministerial salaries in the House of Lords (as at
April 2002) range from £64,485 for junior
ministers to £94,826 for Cabinet ministers.
The Leader of the Opposition in the Commons
receives a salary of £119,159 (inclusive of his
parliamentary salary); two Opposition whips in
the Commons and the Opposition Leader and
Chief Whip in the Lords also receive additional
salaries.

Ministerial responsibility
Ministerial responsibility refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy and
actions which ministers share, and to ministers’
individual responsibility for the work of their own
departments.
Collective responsibility means that all ministers
unanimously support government policy once it has
been settled. The policy of departmental ministers
must agree with the policy of the Government as a
whole. Once the Government has decided its policy
on a particular matter, each minister is expected to
support it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers are
allowed free votes in Parliament on important issues
of principle or conscience.
Ministers are individually accountable for the
work of their departments and agencies, and have
a duty to Parliament to answer for their policies,
decisions and actions.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However, many
issues cut across departmental boundaries and
need the agreement of more than one minister.
The full Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee
considers proposals where the issue is one which
raises major policy concerns, is likely to lead to
significant public comment or criticism, or where
the departmental ministers concerned have been
unable to agree.
On taking up office ministers resign directorships
in private and public companies, and must ensure
that there is no conflict between their public
duties and private interests. Detailed guidance on
handling ministers’ financial interests is set out in
a ministerial code.
The Cabinet
About 20 ministers (the number can vary) chosen
by the Prime Minister sit in the Cabinet; these
may include both departmental and non-
departmental ministers. The Cabinet balances
ministers’ individual duties with their collective
responsibility as members of the Government
and takes the final decisions on all government
policy.
Cabinet meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its business is
confidential, although after 30 years Cabinet
papers usually become available for inspection in
the Public Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets weekly when
Parliament is sitting, and less often when it is not.
Cabinet Committees take some of the pressure off
the full Cabinet by settling issues among smaller
groups of people or at a lower level, or at least by
clarifying them and defining points of
disagreement. Committees let those ministers
most closely concerned come to decisions in a way
which ensures that the Government as a whole
can accept full responsibility for them. This
delegated responsibility means that Cabinet
Committee decisions have the same formal status
as those taken by the full Cabinet.
Cabinet Committees include those dealing with
defence and overseas policy, economic policy,
home and social affairs, the environment, and
local government. The membership and terms of
reference of all ministerial Cabinet Committees
are published. Where appropriate, the Secretary of
the Cabinet and other senior Cabinet Office
officials go to meetings of the Cabinet and its
Committees.
The Cabinet Office
In June 2002 the Cabinet Secretary designate
announced that, with the agreement of the Prime
Minister, he would restructure the Cabinet Office
on taking up office in September. The restructured
Cabinet Office would focus its work on four key
objectives:
■ to support the Prime Minister in leading the
Government;
■ to support the Government in transacting its
business;
■ to lead and support Civil Service reform and
the delivery of better public service
programmes; and
■ to co-ordinate national security and
intelligence (see page 82).
The Cabinet Secretary is a senior civil servant who
reports directly to the Prime Minister. Since 1983,
he has also had the role of Head of the Home
Civil Service.
The party political system
The party system, which has existed in one form
or another since the 18th century, depends upon

The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the Prime
Minister's Official Spokesman (PMOS) and other
staff in the Prime Minister's Press Office have direct
contact with the parliamentary press through
regular meetings with the Lobby correspondents.
The Lobby correspondents are a group of political
journalists with the special privilege of access to
the Lobby of the House of Commons, where they
can talk privately to government ministers and other
members of the House. The PMOS is the accepted
channel through which information about
parliamentary business is passed to the media.
In May 2002 the Prime Minister's Office put forward
proposals to change the Lobby system by opening
up the morning briefings to others, including the
foreign press, once new, larger premises could be
found. Under the proposed new system, Cabinet
members, ministers and senior officials would be
able to brief the media directly, in addition to the
PMOS or his deputy.
there being organised political groups, each of
which presents its policies to the electorate for
approval. In practice, most candidates in elections,
and almost all winning candidates, belong to one
of the main parties. A system of voluntary
registration for political parties in the UK was
introduced in 1998.
For the last 150 years Britain has had a
predominantly two-party system. Since 1945 either
the Conservative Party, whose origins go back to
the 18th century, or the Labour Party, which
emerged in the last decade of the 19th century, has
held power, each having won eight General
Elections. The Liberal Democrats were formed in
1988 when the Liberal Party, which also traced its
origins to the 18th century, merged with the Social
Democratic Party, formed in 1981. Other parties
include two national parties, Plaid Cymru - The
Party of Wales (founded in 1925) and the Scottish
National Party (founded in 1934). Northern Ireland
has a number of parties. They include the Ulster
Unionists, formed in the early part of the 20th
century; the Democratic Unionists, founded in
1971 by a group which broke away from the Ulster
Unionists; the Social Democratic and Labour Party,
founded in 1970; and Sinn Fein, which is the
political wing of the IRA (see page 5).
The party which wins most seats (although not
necessarily the most votes) at a General Election,
or which has the support of a majority of
members in the House of Commons, usually
becomes the Government. By tradition, the
Sovereign invites the leader of that party to form a
government. About 100 members of the governing
party in the House of Commons and the House of
Lords receive ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet - see page 46) on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority
party becomes the official Opposition, with its
own leader and ‘shadow cabinet’.
The party system in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition sit
opposite one another on the front benches in the
debating chamber of the House of Commons,
with their supporters (‘the backbenchers’) sitting
behind them. There are similar seating
arrangements for the parties in the House of
Lords, but many peers do not wish to be
associated with any political party, and therefore
choose to sit on the ‘crossbenches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament
relies to a large extent on the relationship between
the Government and the Opposition parties.
Depending on the relative strengths of the parties
in the House of Commons, the Opposition may
try to overthrow the Government by defeating it
on a ‘matter of confidence’ vote. In general,
however, the Opposition aims to contribute to the
formulation of policy and legislation by
constructive criticism; to oppose government
proposals with which it disagrees; to table
amendments to Government Bills; and to put
forward its own policies in order to improve its
chances of winning the next General Election.
The Government Chief Whips in the Commons
and the Lords, in consultation with their
Opposition counterparts, arrange the scheduling
of government business; they do so under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of
the two Houses. Collectively, the Chief Whips are
often referred to as ‘the usual channels’ when the
question of finding time for a particular item of
business is being discussed.
The Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
usually chosen by the party leaders, manage their
parliamentary parties. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the party’s
voting strength by ensuring members attend
47
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
important debates, and passing on to the party
leadership the opinions of backbench members.
Unofficial party committees
The Parliamentary Labour Party comprises all
members of the party in both Houses. When the
Labour Party is in office, a parliamentary
committee, half of whose members are elected
and half of whom are government representatives,
acts as a channel of communication between the
Government and its backbenchers in both Houses.
When the party is in opposition, the
Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under
the direction of an elected parliamentary
committee, which acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of the
backbench membership of the party in the House
of Commons. When the Conservative Party is in
office, ministers attend its meetings by invitation
and not by right. When the party is in opposition,
the whole membership of the parliamentary party
may attend meetings. The leader appoints a
consultative committee, which acts as the party’s
‘shadow cabinet’.
Financial controls over parties
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000 contained provisions to make party funding
more open, control spending on elections and
ensure the fair conduct of referendums. Under the
financial provisions in the Act:
■ political parties may only accept donations of
over £200 from ‘permissible donors’ -
individuals on the UK electoral register,
registered companies incorporated in the EU
which do business in the UK, registered
political parties and trade unions;
■ all donations of over £5,000 to a political
party’s central organisation must be reported
to the Electoral Commission (see page 55) on
a quarterly basis - weekly during a General
Election campaign;
■ all donations of over £1,000 to accounting
units, such as a constituency association,
must be reported to the Electoral
Commission;
■ individual MPs and other people elected to
office, including MEPs (see page 57),
members of the devolved assemblies of Wales
and Northern Ireland and the Scottish
Parliament, members of local authorities and
the Mayor of London, are subject to similar
controls on the source of donations and have
to report to the Electoral Commission any
donations over £1,000;
■ a cap on campaign spending by political
parties applies before a General Election. A
party has an allowance of £30,000 for each
constituency contested; and
■ third parties at elections (such as trade
unions) are also subject to expenditure limits
set at 5 per cent of the maximum for political
parties.
Government departments
The main role of government departments and
their agencies is to implement government policy
and advise ministers. They are staffed by
politically impartial civil servants and generally
receive their funding from money provided by
Parliament. They often work alongside local
authorities, non-departmental public bodies, and
other government-sponsored organisations.
The structure and functions of departments are
sometimes reorganised if there are major changes
in government policy. A change of government,
however, does not necessarily affect the functions
of departments.
The work of some departments (for instance, the
Ministry of Defence) covers the UK as a whole.
Other departments, such as the Department for
Work and Pensions, cover England, Wales and
Scotland, but not Northern Ireland. Others again,
such as the Department for Education and Skills,
are mainly concerned with affairs in England and
Wales. (For responsibilities associated with the
devolved administrations, see chapters 3, 4 and 5.)
Most departments are headed by ministers.
However, some are non-ministerial departments
headed by a permanent office holder and
ministers with other duties are accountable for
them to Parliament. For example, the Secretary of
State for Education and Skills accounts to
Parliament for the work of the Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED). OFSTED is
headed by HM Chief Inspector of Schools in
48
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
England, who is largely independent of the
Secretary of State.
The functions of the main government departments
and agencies are set out in Appendix A, pages
477-487.
Non-departmental public bodies
A non-departmental public body (NDPB,
sometimes known as a ‘quango’) is a national or
regional public body, working independently of
ministers to whom they are accountable. There are
two main types of NDPB:
■ Executive NDPBs are those with executive,
administrative, commercial or regulatory
functions. They carry out set functions within
a government framework but the degree of
operational independence varies. Examples
include the Arts Council of England, the
Environment Agency and the Health and
Safety Executive.
■ Advisory NDPBs are those set up by ministers
to advise them and their departments on
particular matters. Examples include the
Committee on Standards in Public Life and
the Low Pay Commission. Some Royal
Commissions are also classified as advisory
NDPBs.
There are currently over 1,000 NDPBs in the UK.
A list of all NDPBs is held centrally by the Cabinet
Office and is issued annually in the publication
Public Bodies. An electronic directory is available
via the Cabinet Office website.
The Civil Service
The constitutional and practical role of the Civil
Service in Great Britain is to help the Government
of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Executive and
the National Assembly for Wales formulate their
policies, carry out decisions and administer public
services for which they are responsible. A separate
Northern Ireland Civil Service was created in 1921
to serve the local administration. Its present role is
to support the Northern Ireland Executive in the
administration of public services for which it has
responsibility.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown; in effect
this means the Government of the United
Kingdom, the Scottish Executive and the National
Assembly for Wales. Executive powers are
generally exercised by ministers of the Crown who
are in turn answerable to the appropriate
Parliament or Assembly. The Civil Service as such
has no separate constitutional personality or
responsibility. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the minister in
charge of the department in which he or she is
serving. A change of minister, for whatever reason,
does not involve a change of staff.
Cabinet ministers may each appoint a maximum
of two special advisers. The Prime Minister
approves all appointments and they are paid for
from public funds. There are about 80 such
advisers in the present administration. Their
appointments come to an end when the
Government’s term of office finishes, or when the
appointing minister leaves the Government or
moves to another appointment.
The Civil Service Code, introduced in 1996, is a
concise statement of the role and responsibilities
of civil servants. It was revised in 1999 to take
account of devolution. The Code includes an
independent line of appeal to the Civil Service
Commissioners (see page 50) on alleged breaches
of the Code.
At June 2001 civil servants constituted about 2 per
cent of the working population in employment,
and about 10 per cent of all public sector
employees. The number of permanent civil
servants (on a full-time equivalent basis),
including those in the Diplomatic Service (see
page 50) fell from 751,000 in 1976 to 482,700 in
April 2001. These figures include the Senior Civil
Service, which in April 2001 comprised around
3,850 (non-industrial) of the most senior
managers and policy advisers. Part-time working
has increased over recent years with 13.8 per cent
of civil servants (on a headcount basis) working
part time at April 2001.
In April 2001 about half of all civil servants (full¬
time equivalent) provided services direct to the
public. These included paying benefits and
pensions, running employment services, staffing
prisons, issuing driving licences, and providing
services to industry and agriculture. Around one
in five were employed in the Ministry of Defence
and its agencies. The rest were divided between
central administrative and policy duties; support
services; and services that were largely financially
self-supporting, for instance, those provided by
49
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
the Royal Mint. About four-fifths of civil servants
(full-time equivalent) worked outside London.
Civil Service Commissioners
The Civil Service Commissioners are responsible
for ensuring that recruitment to the Civil Service
should be on merit and based on fair and open
competition. The Commissioners, who are
independent of government, produce a mandatory
recruitment code and audit the recruitment
policies and practices of departments and agencies
to ensure that they comply. They also approve
appointments through external recruitment to the
Senior Civil Service, and hear and determine
appeals in cases of concern about propriety and
conscience under the Civil Service Code.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of some
5,200 people, provides staff for the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (FCO - see page 68) in
London and at British diplomatic missions abroad.
Terms and conditions of service are comparable,
but take into account the special demands of the
Diplomatic Service, particularly the requirement
to serve abroad. UK civil servants, members of the
armed forces and individuals from the private
sector may also serve in the FCO and at overseas
posts on loan or attachment.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) is
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, and
has its own Civil Service Commission. There were
about 26,500 permanent non-industrial civil
servants in the NICS at 31 March 2002. There is a
degree of mobility between the NICS and the Civil
Service in Great Britain.
Equality and diversity
The Civil Service aims to create a culture in which
the different skills, experience and expertise that
individuals bring are valued and used. Its equal
opportunities policy states that there must be no
unfair discrimination on the basis of age, disability,
gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race,
colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin or
(in Northern Ireland) community background.
The Civil Service is committed to achieving greater
diversity, particularly at senior levels, where
women, people from ethnic minorities and those
with disabilities are under-represented.
In April 2001, 50.5 per cent of civil servants were
female; minority ethnic representation was 6.0 per
cent; and at least 3.1 per cent of staff employed
were disabled. Progress is monitored and reported
on regularly by the Cabinet Office.
Central management
As Minister for the Civil Service, the Prime
Minister is responsible for central co-ordination
and management of the Civil Service. He is
supported by the Head of the Home Civil Service
who chairs the Civil Service Management Board.
(The function of official Head of the Home Civil
Service is combined with that of the Cabinet
Secretary - see page 46.) The Cabinet Office
oversees the central framework for management
of the Civil Service. Day-to-day responsibility for
a wide range of terms and conditions has been
delegated to departments and agencies, and to the
Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for
Wales.
Executive agencies
Executive agencies were introduced to deliver
government services more efficiently and
effectively within available resources. They are
part of the Civil Service but, under the terms of
individual framework documents and subject to
overall budgets agreed with their parent
department and/or the Treasury, they have
delegated authority to employ their own staff and
organise service provision in ways best suited to
meet customer needs. Agencies are headed by
chief executives who are personally responsible for
day-to-day operations. They are normally directly
accountable to the responsible minister, who in
turn is accountable to Parliament. Abolition,
privatisation, contracting-out, merger or
rationalisation of a given government function are
all options considered on their merits before an
agency is set up. Certain changes to the way
agencies will operate in the future, including how
they will be reviewed, have been set out in a policy
review report - Better Government Services:
Executive Agencies in the 21st Century - published
in July 2002.
Local government
Powers
Local authorities work within the powers laid
down under various Acts of Parliament. Their
functions are far-reaching. Some are mandatory,
which means that the authority must do what is
required by law; others are discretionary, allowing
an authority to provide services if it wishes. In
50
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
certain cases, ministers have powers to secure
uniformity in standards in order to safeguard
public health or to protect the rights of individual
citizens. Where local authorities exceed their
statutory powers, they are regarded as acting
outside the law and can be challenged in court.
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the Office of the
Deputy Prime Minister. However, other
departments, such as the Department for
Education and Skills, the Department for Work
and Pensions, the Department of Health and the
Home Office, are also concerned with various
local government functions.
In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland local
authorities now deal mainly with the devolved
Parliament and Assemblies. The structure of local
government in each country of the UK is
described in chapters 2-5.
Employees
About 2 million people (on a full-time equivalent
basis) are employed by local authorities in the UK.
These include school teachers, the police,
firefighters (see below) and other non-manual and
manual workers. Education is the largest locally
provided service, with 0.9 million full-time
equivalent jobs. Councils are individually
responsible, within certain legislative
requirements, for deciding the structure of their
workforces.
Every part of the UK is covered by a local
authority fire service. Each of the 59 fire
authorities must by law provide a firefighting
service and maintain a brigade to meet all normal
requirements. Each fire authority appoints a Chief
Fire Officer (or Firemaster in Scotland) who has
day-to-day control of operations. The fire services
in England and Wales employ around 56,400 staff
and spend about £1.6 billion each year. In
Scotland nearly 12,000 people are employed in fire
brigades (including uniformed, non-uniformed
and volunteer personnel) and forecast current
expenditure on the service in 2002/03 is
£212 million.
Elections
Local authorities consist of elected councillors
who are paid a basic allowance but may be
entitled to additional allowances and expenses for
attending meetings or taking on special
responsibilities.
The procedure for local government voting is
broadly similar to that for elections to the UK
Parliament, except that proportional representation
is used in Northern Ireland. Eligibility rules for
voters are also similar to those for UK
parliamentary elections, except that citizens of
other Member States of the EU may vote. To stand
for election, candidates must either be registered as
an elector or have some other close connection
within the electoral area of their candidature, such
as their principal place of employment.
Whole council elections are held every four years
in all county councils in England, borough
councils in London, and about two-thirds of non¬
metropolitan district councils. In all other district
councils (including the metropolitan districts)
one-third of the councillors are elected in each of
the three years when county council elections are
not held. However, a few non-metropolitan
district councils will soon hold biennial elections
with half of the councillors elected every two
years. Whole council elections are every fourth
year in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
At present, counties in England are divided into
electoral areas called ‘divisions’ that can only
return one member. However, provisions in the
Local Government Act 2000 will, if they come into
force, allow them to have multi-member county
divisions. Districts in England and Northern
Ireland are divided into ‘wards’ and Welsh unitary
authorities into electoral ‘divisions’. Wards in
metropolitan districts return three councillors.
Wards in London boroughs and non-metropolitan
authorities return between one and three
councillors. In Scotland the unitary councils are
divided into wards, each returning one councillor.
The electoral arrangements of local authorities in
England are kept under review by the Boundary
Committee for England, established in April 2002
as a statutory committee of the Electoral
Commission (see page 55). Periodic electoral
reviews of local authorities are undertaken in
Scotland by the Local Government Boundary
Commission for Scotland.
Provision of local services
The duty of Best Value requires local authorities to
deliver services by the most economic, efficient
and effective means available to meet the
requirements of local communities; and to make
arrangements to secure continuous

Electronic and postal voting in local elections
As part of the Government's commitment to make
voting easier and modernise the electoral process
(see page 32), 30 councils were given approval to
run electoral pilots in the 2002 English local and
mayoral elections. These included all-postal ballots,
voting electronically using mobile phone text
messaging and voting online via the Internet:
■ in South Tyneside, where all-postal voting was
used, turnout was 55 per cent compared with
27 per cent in the previous local election; and
■ St Albans announced the first e-voting and
counting results of the local elections just four
minutes after the close of the poll. In the two
wards piloting e-democracy over half those
voting did so online (26.5 per cent) or by
telephone (23.9 per cent).
The Electoral Commission undertook a full
evaluation of these electoral pilots and published its
report in August 2002. The evaluation will be used
in deciding a further pilot programme for 2003.
Local authorities in Scotland can apply to Scottish
Ministers for approval to run similar pilots at local
by-elections. The first, an all-postal ballot, took place
in Stirling Council in April 2002 where the turnout
was 63 per cent, an increase of 20 per cent over the
previous by-election. These pilots are also being
evaluated by the Electoral Commission.
improvements. They have to review all their
functions; monitor their performance against
national and local indicators; and publish an
annual performance plan which is subject to
audit.
In June 2002 the Government published for
consultation a draft Local Government Bill, aimed
at paving the way for substantial new freedoms for
councils to help them improve services, including
public transport and care for those most in need
and creating safer and cleaner communities. The
draft Bill includes provisions which would, when
enacted, give councils:
■ freedom to borrow to pay for major projects,
such as new buildings and infrastructure;
■ powers to set up schemes with businesses to
improve their area;
■ new provisions on council tax (see page 357),
including the introduction of a fixed ten-year
cycle of revaluations;
■ greater power to charge for discretionary
services; and
■ business rate relief for properties with
rateable values of under £8,000.
Internal organisation
Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough, or city, both granted by royal authority.
Traditionally, their councillors choose a Mayor (in
Scotland a Provost) to act as presiding officer and
perform ceremonial duties. In the City of London
and certain other large cities, he or she is known
as the Lord Mayor. In Scotland the presiding
officer of the council of the four longest
established cities - Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh
and Glasgow - is called the Lord Provost.
The Local Government Act 2000 required local
authorities in England and Wales to implement

new decision-taking structures, including the
option of a directly elected mayor (see below). In
most authorities the arrangements are based on
one of three executive frameworks: a mayor and
cabinet; a council leader and cabinet; or a mayor
and council manager. Within these options local
authorities have considerable flexibility to work
under a constitution which reflects local
circumstances. Small shire district councils with
a population of fewer than 85,000 have, in
addition to executive arrangements, the choice of
reforming their existing committee system. The
majority of English and Welsh local authorities
have opted for a style of executive where the
leader of the cabinet is chosen by other
councillors.
Directly elected mayors
Provisions in the Local Government Act 2000
required councils in England and Wales to hold
binding referendums if, following consultation,
local people indicated that they wanted to directly
elect a mayor under the new executive
arrangements the Act put in place. Although the
Government has powers to direct a local authority
to hold a referendum in certain circumstances, in
June 2002 it announced that it would not
intervene in cases where it did not agree with the
judgement made by a council following
consultation.
In the May 2002 English local elections, there were
seven elections for an executive mayor (Watford,
Hartlepool, North Tyneside, Doncaster,
Middlesbrough and the London boroughs of
Lewisham and Newham) and five referendums on
adopting the framework in which a council’s
mayor is elected by the public. Bedford, Mansfield,
Oxford, Stoke-on-Trent and the London Borough
of Hackney will be holding mayoral elections in
October 2002. The Stoke-on-Trent election will
result in the first occasion where a directly elected
mayor will be supported by a council manager.
A further two local authorities (Corby and the
London Borough of Ealing) will be holding
mayoral referendums in October and December
2002 respectively.
Decision-making and scrutiny
All new decision-making structures are required
to incorporate rigorous arrangements for review
and scrutiny of councils’ policies and the decisions
they make. Some decisions, such as the acceptance
of policies and the budget, are reserved for the full
council, but most of those relating to the
implementation of policy are for the executive.
The executive is also responsible for preparing the
policies and budget to propose to the council.
Decisions may be taken by the executive
collectively, by individual members of the
executive, by committees of the executive or by
officers of the authority. The executive is also able
to delegate decision-making to area committees
and to enter into partnership arrangements with
other authorities.
The new arrangements are designed to ensure that
people know who in the council is responsible for
taking decisions, how they can make their input
into decision-making and how to hold decision¬
makers to account.
Public access
The public (including the press) is admitted to
meetings of the executive when key decisions are
being discussed. They also have access to agendas,
reports and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. In addition, local authorities
must publish a forward plan setting out the
decisions which will be taken over the coming
months. Local authorities may exclude the public
from meetings and withhold papers only in
limited circumstances.
Local authority finance
Local government expenditure accounts for about
25 per cent of public spending. In 2001/02
expenditure by local authorities in the UK was
about £98.8 billion. Current expenditure amounted
to £84.7 billion; capital expenditure, net of capital
receipts, was £7.2 billion; and debt interest £3.1
billion. Local government capital expenditure is
financed primarily by borrowing within limits set
by central government and from capital receipts
from the disposal of land and buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise revenue
through the council tax (see chapter 23), which
meets about 25 per cent of their revenue
expenditure. Their spending is, however, financed
primarily by grants from central government or the
devolved administrations and by the redistribution
of revenue within each country from their national
non-domestic rate, a property tax levied on
businesses and other non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland continue to
raise revenue through the levying of a domestic
rate and a business rate.

Financial safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be audited
by independent auditors appointed by the Audit
Commission in England and Wales, or in Scotland
by the Accounts Commission for Scotland. In
Northern Ireland the chief local government
auditor carries out this role. Local electors have a
right to inspect the accounts to be audited. They
may also ask questions and lodge objections with
the auditor.
Standards and accountability in
government
A number of safeguards are in place to ensure the
probity of individuals in carrying out their public
duties.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
The Committee on Standards in Public Life (now
known as the Wicks Committee) was originally set
up in 1994 under Lord Nolan. Its role is to
examine the standards of conduct of all holders of
public office, including arrangements relating to
financial and commercial activities, and make
recommendations as to any changes necessary to
ensure the highest standards of propriety in public
life.
The Committee has published seven reports. The
first, in 1995, led to the appointment of a
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
(see below) and a Commissioner for Public
Appointments (see page 55). Other reports have
resulted in:
■ changes in the ethical framework for local
government, including the establishment in
2001 of a new Standards Board for England
(www.standardsboard.co.uk);
■ a new regulatory regime for political party
funding in the UK, overseen by an independent
Electoral Commission, (see page 55);
■ new rules governing the conduct and
discipline of MPs and strengthened guidance
on lobbying;
■ the introduction of new Codes of Conduct
for government ministers and special
advisers; and
■ the mandatory registration of all peers’
relevant financial interests and a short code of
conduct for members of the Elouse of Lords.
In December 2001 the Committee announced an
inquiry into the regulation of MPs’ standards of
conduct. Written and oral submissions were
considered during May and June 2002 and the
Committee expects to publish its conclusions and
recommendations in autumn 2002.
The Committee announced a further inquiry -
Defining the Boundaries within the Executive:
Ministers, Special Advisers and the Permanent Civil
Service - in February 2002 and published a
consultation paper to launch the process the
following month. The key issues to be considered
are:
■ what special advisers do;
■ how they relate to permanent civil servants;
■ how effective are the codes of conduct
governing the work of special advisers and
other civil servants;
■ the role of the Civil Service Commissioners;
and
■ the need for a Civil Service Act.
Public hearings began in June 2002 and a report
(the Committee’s ninth) is expected to be
published towards the end of 2002.
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards was created in 1995, following
recommendations of the Committee on Standards
in Public Life. The Commissioner, who is
independent of government, can advise MPs on
matters of standards, and hold initial
investigations into complaints about alleged
breaches of the rules by Members. The
Commissioner reports to the House of Commons
Select Committee on Standards and Privileges.
Financial interests of MPs and Members
of the House of Lords
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-fmancial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must declare it
when speaking in the House or in Committee and
must indicate it when giving notice of a question
or motion. They must also disclose any relevant
financial interest in other proceedings of the
House and in dealings with other Members,
54
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
ministers or civil servants. The House of Lords has
its own register on similar lines to that for MPs,
based on a Code of Conduct which came into
force in April 2002.
Commissioner for Public Appointments
The Commissioner for Public Appointments is
independent of government and is responsible for
monitoring, regulating and auditing ministerial
appointments to a range of public bodies
including non-departmental public bodies
(NDPBs - see page 49), public corporations,
nationalised industries, National Health Service
Trusts and utility regulators. Departments are
required to follow the Commissioner’s Code of
Practice which covers the seven principles to be
applied to these appointments - ministerial
responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny, equal
opportunities, probity, openness and transparency,
and proportionality.
Complaints
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration - more usually known as the
Parliamentary Ombudsman - investigates
complaints from members of the public (referred
to him by MPs) alleging that they have been
unfairly treated through maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government and
reports to a select committee of the House of
Commons. The Ombudsman’s area of authority
covers central government departments and
agencies, and a large number of NDPBs. He
cannot investigate complaints about government
policy, the content of legislation or relations with
other countries.
In making investigations, the Ombudsman has
access to all departmental papers, and has powers
to call before him those from whom he wishes to
take evidence. When an investigation is
completed, he sends a report with his findings to
the MP who referred the complaint (with a copy
for the complainant). When a complaint is
upheld, the Ombudsman normally recommends
that the department or other body makes some
kind of compensation (which might be financial
in appropriate cases). There is no appeal against
the Ombudsman’s decision.
The Ombudsman received 2,139 new complaints
in 2001/02, an increase of 24 per cent over the
previous year and the highest number ever
received. A total of 1,988 cases were concluded
during the year: of these, 781 complaints were
resolved informally and 195 statutory
investigations were completed. The Department
for Work and Pensions received the largest
number of complaints against a single
department, accounting for 32 per cent of the
total received.
Separate arrangements apply for complaints about
the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for
Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and
devolved public bodies. Complaints to the Scottish
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
are referred through Members of the Scottish
Parliament; complaints to the Welsh
Administration Ombudsman can be made direct.
Local government complaints system
Local authorities are encouraged to settle
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public often ask their own
councillor for help in this. Local authorities must
also appoint a monitoring officer, whose duties
include ensuring that the local authority acts
lawfully when carrying out its business.
Complaints against inefficient or badly managed
local government may be investigated by
independent Commissions for Local
Administration, often known as ‘the Local
Ombudsman service’. There are Local Government
Ombudsmen in England and Wales; the functions
of the Local Government Ombudsman in
Scotland are to be taken over by the new Scottish
Public Services Ombudsman. A report is issued on
each complaint fully investigated and, if injustice
is found, the Local Ombudsman normally
proposes a solution. The council must consider
the report and reply to it.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of maladministration
by district councils and certain other public bodies.
Electoral Commission
An independent Electoral Commission was set up
under the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendnms Act 2000 (see also page 48) to
supervise the financial restrictions on parties,
oversee referendums and have broad responsibility
for electoral law. From April 2002 it took over the
functions of the Local Government Boundary
Commission for England and in due course it will
55
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
also take over the functions of the four
Parliamentary Boundary Commissions. At the
discretion of Scottish Ministers and the National
Assembly for Wales respectively it could also take
over the functions of the Local Government
Boundary Commissions for Scotland and for
Wales (see page 51).
Modernising government
The Government has taken a number of measures
as part of its long-term programme to modernise
and improve public services. These include:
■ drawing up Public Service Agreements (PSAs)
with government departments (see page 350)
to set a clear framework of policy objectives
and resource allocation, and provide a way of
measuring and monitoring effectiveness;
■ measures aimed at improving the quality of
public services and making them more
responsive, including schemes like Charter
Mark (see below);
■ the establishment of the Prime Minister’s
Delivery Unit to drive improvements in
health, education, crime reduction and
transport, and the creation of the Centre for
Management and Policy Studies to improve
policy-making, draw on external experience
and strengthen the skills of civil servants;
■ making all government services available
electronically by 2005. By the end of 2001,
54 per cent of public services were online
with over 73 per cent planned to be available
by the end of 2002; and
■ a reform programme to create a more open,
diverse and professional Civil Service.
Freedom of information
The Freedom of Information Act 2000 provides for
a statutory right of access to recorded information
held across the public sector, including
Parliament, government departments, local
authorities, health trusts, doctors’ surgeries,
publicly funded museums and other
organisations.
The main features of the Act are:
■ a right of wide general access to information,
subject to clearly defined exemptions and
conditions;
■ a requirement to consider discretionary
disclosure in the public interest even when an
exemption applies;
■ a duty to publish information; and
■ powers of enforcement through an
independent Information Commissioner and
an Information Tribunal.
The Information Commissioner is also
responsible for promoting the rules for the
processing of personal information set out in the
Data Protection Act 1998.
National Statistics
National Statistics, the UK’s independent national
statistical service, was set up in June 2000. It aims
to provide an accurate, up-to-date, comprehensive
and meaningful picture of the UK economy and
society to support the formulation and
monitoring of economic and social policies by
government at all levels. In line with the
Government’s commitment to greater openness
and accessibility of publicly held information, all
its online data are available free of charge.
Charter Mark
A key objective of the Government’s plans is to
improve the delivery of public services with more
emphasis on the consumer. The Charter Mark
scheme aims to help public service organisations
become more focused on the needs of users. The
scheme applies to all public services, at both
national and local level. It sets out clear standards
of service, ensures consultation with users, and
has an easy-to-use complaints procedure.
Pressure groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations which
aim to influence the decision-making of
Parliament and Government, to the benefit of
their members and the causes they support. The
range of issues pressure groups cover is very wide:
from politics and consumer affairs to religion and
the environment. Some have over 1 million
members; others only a few. Some bring pressure
to bear on a number of different issues; others are
concerned with a single subject. Some have come
to play a recognised role in the way the UK is
governed; others attempt to influence through
radical protest. Frequently national newspapers
will take up the cause of a pressure group and
help campaign on its behalf.
56
Government and foreign affairs
6 Government
Ministers have a duty to give fair consideration
and due weight to informed and impartial advice
from civil servants, so pressure groups often try to
guide the views of civil servants and in this way
influence the briefing they give to ministers.
Members of pressure groups often have direct
expertise and an awareness of what is practicable,
and can therefore offer useful advice to the
Government in forming policy or drafting
legislation. The contacts between civil servants
and pressure group representatives may be
relatively informal - by letter, telephone or
e-mail - or more formal, through involvement in
working parties or by giving evidence to
committees of inquiry.
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers, whose job
is to develop contacts with MPs and peers
sympathetic to their cause, and to brief them when
issues affecting the group are raised in Parliament.
The UK in the European Union
As a Member State of the European Union, the
UK is bound by the various types of European
Community (EC) legislation and wider policies
based on a series of treaties since the 1950s (see
chapter 7). Almost all UK government
departments are involved in EU-wide business,
and European legislation is an increasingly
important element of government.
The Community enacts legislation which is
binding on the national governments of the 15
Member States or, in certain circumstances, on
individuals and companies within those states. UK
government ministers take part in the discussions
and decision-making, and the final decision is
taken collectively by all the Member States.
The UK Representative Office (UKREP), based in
Brussels, conducts most of the negotiations on
behalf of the UK Government. Following UK
devolution, offices to promote the interests of
Scotland and Wales within the EU opened in
Brussels in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Both work
in close co-operation with UKREP.
Council of the European Union
This is the main decision-making body. Member
States are represented by the ministers appropriate
to the subject under discussion. When, for
instance, education matters are being discussed,
the UK’s Secretary of State for Education and
Skills attends with his or her European
counterparts. The Presidency of the Council
changes at six-monthly intervals and rotates in
turn among the 15 Member States of the Union.
In some cases Council decisions must be
unanimous; in others taken by qualified majority
voting (a qualified majority being the number of
votes required for a decision to be adopted) with
votes weighted according to a country’s population
- currently ten each for Germany, France, the
United Kingdom and Italy; eight for Spain; five
each for Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands and
Portugal; four each for Austria and Sweden; three
each for Denmark, Finland and the Irish Republic;
and two for Luxembourg. The threshold for the
qualified majority is set at 62 votes out of 87.
European Council
This usually meets twice a year and comprises the
Heads of State or Government (accompanied by
their foreign ministers), the President of the
European Commission and one other
Commissioner. The Council defines general
political guidelines.
European Commission
This is the executive body. It implements the
Council’s decisions, initiates legislation and
ensures that Member States put it into effect. Each
of the 20 Commissioners, who are drawn from all
Member States (there are two from the UK), is
responsible for a specific policy area, for example,
education, transport or agriculture. The
Commissioners are entirely independent of their
countries, and serve the EU as a whole.
European Parliament
This plays an increasingly important role in the
legislative process. There are 626 directly elected
members (MEPs), including 87 from the UK. The
Parliament is consulted about major decisions and
has substantial shared power with the Council of
the European Union over the EC budget (see page
60). In areas of legislation, its role varies between
consultation, where it can influence but does not
have the final say in the content of legislation;
co-operation and assent procedures, where its
influence is greater; and co-decision (introduced by
the Maastricht Treaty and extended in the
Amsterdam Treaty - see page 59), where a
proposal requires the agreement of both the
Council and the European Parliament. The
Parliament meets in full session in Strasbourg for

about one week every month, although its
committee work normally takes place in Brussels.
Elections to the European Parliament take place
every five years, most recently in June 1999. In the
UK, these were held under a proportional
representation system,11 bringing the country into
line with the other Member States.
EC legislation
Some EC legislation is issued jointly by the
Council of the European Union and the European
Parliament, some by the Council and some by the
Commission under delegated powers. It consists
of Regulations, Directives and Decisions.
■ Regulations are directly applicable in all Member
States, and have the force of law without the need
for implementing further measures;
■ Directives are equally binding as to the result
to be achieved but allow each Member State
to choose the form and method of
implementation; and
■ Decisions, like Regulations, do not normally
need national implementing legislation. They
11 The regional list system is used for England, Scotland and Wales,
under which an elector may cast his or her vote for a party list of
candidates. England is divided into nine regions while Scotland
and Wales each constitute one region. These 11 regions each
return between four and 11 MEPs, depending on the size of the
electorate of each region. Northern Ireland, which also
constitutes one region, continues to use the single transferable
vote system to return its three MEPs.
are binding on those to whom they are
addressed.
Other EU institutions
Each Member State provides one of the judges to
serve in the European Court of Justice, which is
the final authority on all aspects of Community
law. Its rulings must be applied by Member States,
and fines can be imposed on those failing to do so.
The Court is assisted by a Court of First Instance,
which handles certain cases brought by
individuals and companies. The UK is also
represented on the Court of Auditors, which
examines Community revenue and expenditure,
to see that it is legally received and spent.

The United Kingdom has global foreign policy
interests. It is a member of the European Union
(EU), United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO), Group of Eight (G8) and
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE). It has close relationships with
a large number of countries through the
Commonwealth and with the United States.
European Union
The UK is a Member State of the EU, which
promotes co-ordinated social and economic
progress among its members, common foreign
and security positions, police and judicial co¬
operation in criminal matters, and European
citizenship. The EU’s principal institutions and its
legislative processes are described on pages 57-8.
Treaties
The structure and operation of the EU are
governed by a series of treaties. The objectives of
the 1957 Rome Treaty establishing the European
Community (which the UK joined in 1973) were
the creation of a common internal, or single,
market (see page 60), including the elimination of
customs duties between Member States, free
movement of goods, people, services and capital,
and the elimination of distortions in competition
within this market. These aims were reaffirmed by
the 1986 Single European Act, which incorporated
measures to complete the single market. Under the
Rome Treaty, the European Commission speaks on
behalf of the UK and the other Member States in
international trade negotiations.
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the Rome
Treaty and made other new commitments,
including moves towards economic and monetary
union (see page 60). It established the European
Union, which comprises the European
Community and intergovernmental arrangements
for a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP
- see pages 60-1) and for increased co-operation
on justice and home affairs policy issues (see page
61). It also enshrined the principle of subsidiarity
under which, in areas where the Community and
Member States share competence, action should
be taken at European level only if its objectives
cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone
and can be better achieved by the Community. In
addition, the Treaty introduced the concept of EU
citizenship as a supplement to national citizenship.
The Amsterdam Treaty, in force from 1999,
provides for the further protection and extension
of citizen’s rights; integration of the ‘social
chapter’ (previously a separate protocol to the
Maastricht Treaty) into the treaty framework
following its adoption by the UK; new
mechanisms to improve the operation of the
CFSP; and an increase in the areas subject to co¬
decision between the Council of Ministers and
European Parliament, and simplification of the
co-decision procedure.
The Nice Treaty, which was signed in February
2001 but is yet to enter into force, would introduce
changes to the EU’s institutional machinery in
preparation for enlargement (see page 61). From
2005 the number of votes for each EU country in
the Council of the European Union would be
altered to take account of prospective new
members, the total number rising from the 87
votes for the current 15 Member States up to 345
votes for 27 Member States. The UK, Germany,
France and Italy would each have 29 votes. The
total needed for a qualified majority (see page 57)
would increase from 62 to 255, and for a blocking
minority from 26 to 91, in an EU of 27 Member
59
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
States. Qualified majority voting would be
extended to 35 more areas, including trade in
some services, aspects of asylum and immigration
policy, and regulation of the European Court of
Justice. From 2005 the European Commission
would be composed of one member from each
country, up to 27.
Any amendments to the Treaties must be agreed
unanimously and must then be ratified by each
Member State according to its own constitutional
procedures. In the UK, Treaty ratifications must
be approved by Parliament before they can come
into force.
Policies
The Community budget and broader EU policies
are described below. Policies affecting more
specific UK sectors - for example, the Common
Agricultural Policy - appear in the appropriate
chapters.
European Community budget
The Community’s revenue consists of levies on
agricultural imports from non-member countries,
customs duties, a proportion of value added tax
(VAT) receipts and contributions from Member
States based on gross national product (GNP).
Increasingly, more revenue is being raised from
contributions linked to GNP and less from VAT
receipts and customs payments. The UK continues
to receive an annual budget rebate, which has
been in place since 1984.
Single market
The single European market, providing for the
free movement of people, goods, services and
capital within the EU, came into effect in 1993
(see also page 366). It covers, among other
benefits, the removal of customs barriers, the
liberalisation of capital movements, the opening
of public procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications. Under
the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement,
which came into force in 1994, most of the EU
single market measures have been extended to
Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
Economic and monetary union
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged the achievement
of economic and monetary union in stages,
culminating in the adoption on 1 January 1999 of
a single currency (the euro). In 1998 a meeting of
EU Heads of State and Government agreed that
11 of the 15 EU Member States (excluding the
UK, Denmark, Greece and Sweden) would take
part in the single currency from its launch date. It
also agreed the establishment of the European
Central Bank (ECB).
On 1 January 1999 conversion rates between
currencies of qualifying countries and the euro
were legally fixed. The euro became the legal
currency in those countries and the ECB assumed
responsibility for formulating the monetary policy
of the euro area. Since no euro banknotes or coins
would be available until 1 January 2002, national
currencies continued to exist in parallel with the
euro, and national banknotes and coins were used
for all cash transactions. Greece, having earlier
failed the economic convergence criteria, joined
the euro area on 1 January 2001. On 1 January
2002 euro notes and coins were introduced
officially. By 1 March 2002 all remaining national
banknotes and coins in the 12 Member States
making up the euro area ceased to be legal tender.
See page 334 for the UK Government’s economic
tests for joining the single currency.
Regional and infrastructure development
The economic and social imbalances within the
EU are considerable, and will become more
evident with further enlargement. To address
these, there are four Structural Funds promoting
economic advancement in underdeveloped
regions and supporting the conversion of areas
facing structural difficulties (see also page 340).
Infrastructure projects and schemes to promote
development and diversification of industry are
financed by the European Regional Development
Fund. The European Social Fund supports human
resource and equal opportunities schemes and
training measures for the unemployed and young
people. The Guidance Section of the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
supports agricultural restructuring and some rural
development activities. The Financial Instrument
for Fisheries Guidance promotes the
modernisation of the fishing industry. The UK
will receive over £10 billion from the Structural
Funds in 2000-06. A Cohesion Fund, set up under
the Maastricht Treaty, provides financial help to
reduce disparities between EU members’
economies. Only Spain, Portugal, Greece and the
Irish Republic were in receipt of such funding in
2002.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The intergovernmental CFSP, introduced under
the Maastricht Treaty, provides for Member States
60
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
to agree unanimously common policies and/or
joint actions on a wide range of international
issues, in the belief that when they are able to
speak with one voice on international affairs they
carry more weight than any single Member State
could alone. 1 he Amsterdam Treaty preserves the
principle that all policy should be decided by
unanimity, but states that decisions implementing
common strategies, which are themselves agreed
by unanimity, will be by qualified majority voting.
A Member State may prevent a vote being taken
by qualified majority voting for ‘important and
stated reasons of national policy’. In addition,
qualified majority voting does not apply to
decisions having military or defence implications.
A Member State may abstain and stand aside from
an EU decision/action when its interests are not
affected.
In 1998 the UK and France launched an initiative
to strengthen the EU’s capacity to respond to
crises, on the basis that, if the Union is to play a
coherent and effective political role, this needs to
be underpinned by a credible European military
capability. In support of this initiative, the
European Council in 1999 agreed to develop by
2003 the capability, drawing on forces from
Member States, to deploy up to 60,000 ground
troops, with naval and air support as appropriate.
These forces would be able to deal with the full
range of military and civilian crisis management
tasks. At the maximum scale of operation, the UK
could contribute up to 12,500 ground troops,
18 warships and 72 combat aircraft. Collective
defence remains the responsibility of NATO,
which will also continue to have a major role in
crisis management (see also page 79).
Justice and home affairs
The Maastricht Treaty established
intergovernmental arrangements for increased co¬
operation among EU states on justice and home
affairs issues. These issues include visa, asylum,
immigration and other policies related to free
movement of people; and police, customs and
judicial co-operation in criminal matters
(including co-operation through EUROPOL - see
page 76). This is a growing aspect of EU work
and, since the Amsterdam Treaty came into force,
has both Community-based and
intergovernmental-based areas of co-operation.
A protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty
recognises the UK’s right to exercise its own
frontier controls.
Enlargement
A key policy objective of the EU is to enlarge the
Union, to include those European nations sharing
its democratic values and aims, and which are
functioning market economies, able to compete in
the EU and to take on the obligations of
membership. In 1998 an accession process with
the applicant states was launched, and formal
negotiations started with Poland, Hungary,
Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus and the Czech Republic.
Then, in 1999, the EU agreed to invite six other
countries - Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,
Romania and Slovakia — to open accession
negotiations (which were launched in February
2000), and also confirmed Turkey’s candidature
for membership. Up to ten new members are
likely to accede in time to take part in the 2004
elections to the European Parliament.
In 1999 the European Council agreed the EU’s
budgetary arrangements for the period 2000-06,
including making financial provision for the first
new Member States to join the Union in that
period. Upon its entry into force, the Treaty of
Nice (see page 59) would provide for the
institutional changes necessary for enlargement.
A Convention on the Future of Europe was
instigated by the European Council at its summit
at Laeken, Belgium, in December 2001 to prepare
for the next intergovernmental conference in 2004
on the future direction of the EU. Inaugurated in
February 2002, the year-long Convention is
considering how to make the EU more
democratic, effective and transparent. In the
context of planned enlargement, its agenda
amounts to a fundamental re-examination of the
Union’s institutional architecture. The Convention
involves members of national parliaments and the
European Parliament, as well as representatives of
EU Member State governments, the European
Commission and applicant countries.
Other international
organisations
United Nations
The UK is a founder member of the UN and one
of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, along with China, France, Russia and the
United States. It supports the purposes and
principles of the UN Charter, including the
maintenance of international peace and security,

Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
the development of friendly relations among
nations, the achievement of international co¬
operation on economic, social, cultural and
humanitarian issues, and the protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms. The UK is the
fifth largest contributor to the UN regular budget
and to peacekeeping operations, and one of the
biggest voluntary contributors to UN funds,
programmes and agencies. In order to enhance the
UN’s effectiveness, the UK is advocating
modernisation of the organisation, including
reform of the Security Council’s composition. The
UK is also committed to the reinforcement of the
UN’s role in preventing and resolving conflicts
around the world.
Commonwealth
There are 54 members of the Commonwealth,1
including the UK (see map). It is a voluntary
association of independent states, nearly all of
which were once British territories. The
organisation promotes democracy, the rule of law,
good governance and human rights, as well as
economic and social development. Comprising
nearly one-third of the world’s countries, it
represents a combined population of 1.7 billion
people.
The Queen is Head of the Commonwealth and is
Head of State in the UK and 15 other member
countries (see page 41). The Commonwealth
Secretariat, based in London, is the main
intergovernmental agency of the Commonwealth.
It helps host governments to organise
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings
(CHOGM - which take place every two years),
ministerial meetings and other conferences. It
administers assistance programmes agreed at these
meetings, including the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation, which provides expertise,
advisory services and training to Commonwealth
developing countries.
Following the 11 September terrorist attacks in the
United States, the Heads of Government Meeting
was postponed from Brisbane in October 2001 to
Coolum, Australia, in March 2002.
1 Pakistan and Zimbabwe are suspended from the councils of the
Commonwealth. Pakistan was suspended in October 1999
following a military coup. Zimbabwe was suspended for a year in
March 2002 following international criticism of the conduct of
presidential elections. Fiji's suspension, imposed in 2000, has been
lifted.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is central to UK defence
policy (see page 79). NATO’s stated functions are
to:
■ help provide security and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area;
■ provide a transatlantic forum for Member
States to consult on issues of common
concern;
■ deter and defend against any threat to the
territory of any NATO member state;
■ contribute to crisis management and conflict
prevention on a case-by-case basis; and
■ promote partnership, co-operation and
dialogue with other countries in the Euro-
Atlantic area.
Each of the 19 Member States - Belgium, Canada,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United
States - has a permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The main decision¬
taking body is the North Atlantic Council. It
meets at least twice a year at foreign minister
level, and weekly at the level of permanent
representatives. Defence ministers also meet at
least twice a year.
Group of Eight
The UK is one of the Group of Eight (G8) leading
industrialised countries. The other members are
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia
(included as a full member from 1998, although
the other countries continue to function as the G7
for some discussions) and the United States. The
G8 is an informal group with no secretariat. Its
presidency rotates each year among the members,
the key meeting being an annual summit of Heads
of Government. Originally formed in 1975 (as the
G7) to discuss economic issues, the G8 agenda
now includes a wide range of foreign affairs and
international issues such as terrorism, nuclear
safety, the environment, UN reform and
development assistance. Heads of State or
Government agree a communique issued at the
end of summits. The G8 summit meeting in June
2002 was hosted by the Canadian Government in

Kananaskis, Alberta. It focused in particular on
increased aid to Africa on a partnership basis (see
also page 66).
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The UK is a member of the OSCE, a regional
security organisation whose 55 participating states
are from Europe, Central Asia and North America.
All decisions are taken by consensus. The OSCE is
based in Vienna, where the UK has a permanent
delegation. The main areas of work are:
■ early warning and prevention of potential
conflicts through field missions and
diplomacy and the work of the OSCE High
Commissioner on National Minorities;
■ observing elections and providing advice on
human rights, democracy and law, and
media;
■ post-conflict rehabilitation, including civil
society development; and
■ promoting security through arms control and
military confidence-building.
Council of Europe
The UK is a founding member of the Council of
Europe, which is open to any European state
accepting parliamentary democracy, the rule of
the law and fundamental human rights. There are
44 full Member States. One of the Council’s main
achievements is the European Convention on
Human Rights (see page 70).
Other international bodies
The UK belongs to many other international
bodies, including the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), which regulates the international financial
system and provides credit for member countries
facing balance-of-payments difficulties; the World
Bank, which provides loans to finance economic
and social projects in developing countries; the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which promotes economic
growth, support for less developed countries and
worldwide trade expansion; and the World Trade
Organisation (WTO - see page 366). Other
organisations to which Britain belongs or extends
support include the regional development banks in
Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and Asia, and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
Regional relations
Central and Eastern Europe
and Central Asia
European security
In 1990 the UK and its NATO allies, together with
former adversaries in the Warsaw Pact
Communist bloc, set up the North Atlantic Co¬
operation Council to promote understanding. In
1994 NATO invited the non-Alliance states in
Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia to
join a Partnership for Peace programme, a form of
association which enlists the Partners’ assistance in
peacekeeping operations. The Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council was set up in 1997 to develop
closer political and military links between NATO
countries and non-members.
The UK played a significant role in negotiations
leading to a NATO-Ukraine partnership charter,
signed in 1997, and the accession to NATO in
1999 of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Mechanisms for a permanent relationship
between NATO and Russia, established in a
Founding Act in 1997, have been extended by the
creation in May 2002 of a NATO-Russia Council
(see also page 79). The Council will provide a
framework for partnership and co-operation, with
the aim of taking joint decisions and actions.
Economic help
The UK and other Western countries continue to
help deal with the economic problems following the
fall of Communism, and to promote the
development of market economies. The IMF
provides support for stabilisation programmes and
the World Bank finance for structural reform to
nearly all countries in the region. This is further
bolstered by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development’s investments and its role in
attracting additional private investment. The EU’s
PHARE scheme is primarily devoted to aiding
Central European countries in the process of reform
and development of their infrastructure. Countries
of the former Soviet Union (excluding Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania) and Mongolia receive help
through a parallel programme (TACIS), which
concentrates on democratisation, financial services,
transport, energy (including nuclear safety) and
public administration reform. The Community
Assistance for Association, Democratisation and
Stabilisation (CARDS) programme is focused on
countries in the Western Balkans.

Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
Association and co-operation agreements
The EU has strengthened relations with Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia
by signing Europe (Association) Agreements with
them. The agreements provide an institutional
framework to support the process of integration,
and anticipate accession of these countries to the
EU when they are able to assume the obligations
of membership (see page 61).
EU Partnership and Co-operation Agreements are
in force with Russia, Ukraine, Moldova,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Similar agreements
have been signed with Belarus and Turkmenistan.
Trade and Co-operation Agreements with Albania
and Macedonia are also in force. The purpose of
these agreements is to reduce trade barriers,
develop wide-ranging co-operation and increase
political dialogue.
The EU is promoting closer links through
Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA)
with states in south-eastern Europe, provided that
they meet the EU’s conditions on democracy,
electoral and media reform, and respect for
human rights. The first SAA, with Macedonia, was
signed in April 2001. Croatia signed its SAA in
October 2001.
Middle East
Arab-lsraeli peace process
The UK supported the breakthrough in the
Middle East peace process in 1993, when Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)
agreed to mutual recognition and signed a
declaration on interim self-government for the
Palestinians in Israeli-held territories occupied
since 1967. The first stage of the declaration was
implemented in 1994, when the Palestinians
adopted self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
Jericho area. A peace treaty between Israel and
Jordan was also signed in that year. The UK has
continued to encourage peace talks between Israel,
Syria and Lebanon.
In 1995 Israel and the PLO reached an agreement
providing for a phased Israeli troop withdrawal
from occupied Palestinian areas of the West Bank
and for elections to a new Palestinian Council
with legislative and executive powers. The UK
took part in the EU-coordinated observation of
the Palestinian elections in 1996.
Subsequent progress in the process has been far
from smooth, with frequent disruptions over
political and security concerns. Since September
2000 there has been a serious and continuing
escalation of violence between Israelis and
Palestinians, which increasingly has involved
Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israeli
civilians and Israeli military incursions and
reprisals in Palestinian-administered territory.
The UK Government has pressed for an end to the
violence and for a resumption of political
engagement, believing that a solution to the crisis
will not be reached if it is seen purely as a security
or military question. The Government maintains
its conviction that a lasting resolution must both
protect Israel’s security and provide a just
exchange of land for peace; and, with its EU
partners, has reaffirmed the Palestinian right to
self-determination including the option of
statehood.
Iraq
The UK condemned Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in
1990 and supported all UN Security Council
resolutions designed to force Iraqi withdrawal and
restore international legality. Because of Iraq’s
failure to withdraw, its forces were expelled in
1991 by an international coalition led by the
United States, the UK, France and Saudi Arabia,
acting under a UN mandate.
UN sanctions against Iraq have remained in force
(although with substantial humanitarian
exemptions), because Iraq has failed to comply
with the relevant Security Council resolutions,
particularly those relating to the supervision of
the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction. British initiatives at the UN led, in
1996, to the establishment of an oil-for-food
programme for Iraq and, in 1999, to the lifting of
the ceiling on Iraq’s oil exports and an expansion
of the humanitarian programme. In May 2002 the
Security Council adopted a new resolution
revising the sanctions arrangements. While
maintaining strict, targeted controls on military
and ‘dual-use’ equipment (having a legitimate civil
use as well as a potential military application), the
system allows Iraq to freely import civilian goods.
Nevertheless, the UK Government remains
concerned about Iraq’s breach of outstanding UN
obligations and seeks the disarmament of the Iraqi
regime. The UK Parliament was recalled on 24
September 2002 to discuss the issue of Iraq and its
weapons of mass destruction. On the same day the
Government published a 50-page dossier detailing
64
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
Iraq’s breach of UN resolutions and its attempts to
rebuild illegal weaponry.
In order to protect the Shia minority in southern
Iraq and the Kurdish population in the north
against attacks by Iraqi forces, UK and US
warplanes continue to patrol ‘no-fly’ zones over
southern and northern Iraq, established after the
war in 1991.
Mediterranean
The UK and other EU Member States are
developing, on the basis of the Barcelona
Declaration of 1995, closer links with 12
Mediterranean partners (Morocco, Algeria,
Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the
Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Cyprus and Malta)
with the aim of promoting peace and prosperity
in the region. Libya has also been invited to sign
up to the Declaration. Euro-Mediterranean
Association Agreements covering political
dialogue, free trade and co-operation in a number
of areas are in force with Tunisia, Morocco and
Israel, as well as an Interim Agreement with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation. An Association
Agreement with Jordan is in the process of
ratification and another with Egypt awaits
signature. Turkey, Cyprus and Malta have long¬
standing Association Agreements with the EU.
Asia-Pacific region
The UK has well-established relations with Japan,
China, the Republic of Korea, many South East
Asian nations, Australia and New Zealand, and has
defence links with some countries in the region. It
is a member, with Malaysia, Singapore, Australia
and New Zealand, of the Five Power Defence
Arrangements, which celebrated their 30th
anniversary in November 2001. British
commercial activity has developed through
increased trade and investment, and through the
setting up of business councils, joint commissions
or industrial co-operation agreements. The UK is
also taking advantage of increased opportunities
for English language teaching, co-operation in
science and technology, and educational exchanges.
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process was
inaugurated in 1996. ASEM is intended to foster
closer economic and political ties between EU
countries and Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The fourth
ASEM took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, in
September 2002.
The UK and its EU and G8 partners continue to
encourage India and Pakistan to join international
nuclear non-proliferation regimes (see page 74).
This became of increasing concern during 2002 as
bilateral tensions over terrorism and the disputed
territory of Kashmir have brought the two
regional powers to the brink of war, with potent
international implications. The UK Government
has played a significant role in the co-ordinated
diplomatic efforts of the international community
to defuse the crisis.
In 1998 the UK rejoined the South Pacific
Commission, having withdrawn in 1995. The
Commission provides technical advice and
assistance to its Pacific Island members, with
which the UK has long-standing and
Commonwealth ties. See page 367 for trading
relations between the EU and the 76 African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
Hong Kong
In 1997 the UK returned Hong Kong to Chinese
sovereignty under the provisions of the 1984 Sino-
British Joint Declaration, which guarantees that
Hong Kong’s way of life, including its rights and
freedoms, will remain unchanged for 50 years
from the handover. The UK continues to have
responsibilities towards Hong Kong and the
3.5 million British passport holders living there.
The territory is the UK’s second largest export
market in Asia.
The Americas
The UK Government considers that the close
transatlantic links between the UK, the United
States and Canada remain essential to guarantee
the security and prosperity of Europe and North
America.
The UK and the US co-operate closely on nuclear,
defence and intelligence matters. As founding
members of NATO, the UK and US are deeply
involved in Western defence arrangements and, as
permanent members of the UN Security Council,
work closely together on major international
issues. In addition, there are important economic
links. The UK and US are each other’s biggest
source of inward investment, and the US is the
UK’s largest single trading partner. More than
5,000 US companies are based in the UK, and
almost 10,000 across the EU as a whole. Over
3 million jobs on each side of the Atlantic depend
on this investment. EU-US summit meetings are
held twice a year.
65
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
Strong political and economic links are
maintained with Canada, with which the UK
shares membership of the Commonwealth, NATO
and other key international organisations. EU-
Canada summit meetings take place twice a year.
The UK is the second largest investor in Canada
(after the US) and Canada is the fifth largest
investor in the UK.
Important British connections with Latin America
date from the early 19th century. Greater
democracy and freer market economies have
enabled the UK to strengthen its modern links
with the region, and it is now one of the largest
investors after the United States. UK exports to
Latin America are worth £2.5 billion a year. An
increasingly important part of the UK’s
relationship with Latin America takes place
through the EU. The first summit of EU, Latin
American and Caribbean Heads of State and
Government was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in
1999. The second took place in Madrid, Spain, in
May 2002, when a trade agreement was signed
between the EU and Chile (the EU’s only other
such agreement in Latin America being with
Mexico). The EU is the largest provider of
developmental assistance to Latin America, and
the region is the largest per capita recipient of EU
aid in the world.
The first UK/Caribbean Forum, held in 1998 in
Nassau, Bahamas, marked the beginning of a new
longer-term process of co-operation between the
UK and the countries of the region. The second
meeting was hosted by the UK Government in
London in 2000, and the third was held in
Georgetown, Guyana, in April 2002. See page 367
for trading relations between the EU and the 76
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
Africa
British aims in Africa are to promote peace and
security, prosperity and democracy. The UK Prime
Minister declared African development a policy
priority for his administration’s second term in
office. The UK is giving political and practical
support to efforts to prevent or end African
conflicts; promoting trade, reducing debt and
supporting development for lasting prosperity; and
supporting African governments, organisations
and individuals espousing the principles of
democracy, accountability, the rule of law and
human rights. The UK Government has welcomed
the New Partnership for Africa’s Development
(NEPAD), an African-led strategy (endorsed in
July 2001 by the Organisation of African Unity) for
sustainable growth and development. In support of
NEPAD, the G8 countries (see page 62) adopted a
development assistance action plan at their
summit in Canada in June 2002.
Since the abolition of apartheid and the election
of the first African National Congress government
in 1994, South Africa’s relations with the UK have
broadened into areas ranging from development
assistance to military advice, and from sporting
links to scientific co-operation. There has also
been a steady flow of state and ministerial visits to
and from South Africa. The UK is South Africa’s
largest single trading partner, and largest foreign
investor. A trade, development and co-operation
agreement between the EU and South Africa was
signed in 1999, providing for the creation of a free
trade area and for further substantial development
assistance from the EU.
See page 367 for trading relations between the EU
and the 76 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
countries.
Overseas Territories
The UK’s Overseas Territories (OTs) have a
combined population of about 190,000. The
territories are listed on page 67. Most have
considerable self-government, with their own
legislatures. Governors appointed by the Queen are
responsible for external affairs, internal security,
defence and international financial services. Most
domestic matters are delegated to locally elected
governments and legislatures. The British Indian
Ocean Territory, the British Antarctic Territory, and
South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have
non-resident Commissioners, not Governors. None
of the Territories has expressed a desire for
independence from the UK.
The UK aims to provide the OTs with security and
political stability, ensure efficient and honest
government, and support their economic and
social advancement. The Overseas Territories
Economic Diversification Fund was established in
2001 to help the OTs to develop a sustainable
economic future. Offshore financial service
industries are of major importance in several of
the Territories. The UK Government’s policy is to
ensure that international standards of regulation
are met and that effective steps are taken to
combat financial crime and regulatory abuse.

New citizenship provisions under the British

citizenship from a connection with the British
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus) automatically
became British citizens with the right of abode in
the UK.2
An OT Department within the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (FCO - see below)
provides a single focus and direct point of contact
with the UK Government, although Gibraltar,
because of its EU status, is dealt with primarily by
the FCO’s European Departments. The
Department for International Development
(DFID - see page 71) also has an OT Department,
which administers development assistance to
Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat,
the Turks and Caicos Islands, St Helena (and
Tristan da Cunha) and Pitcairn. An OT
Consultative Council, comprising the Chief
Minister or equivalent from each territory and
British ministers (and chaired by the relevant FCO
minister), convenes annual meetings in
September.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a territorial
claim by Argentina. The UK Government does not
accept the Argentine claim and is committed to
defending the Islanders’ right to live under a
government of their own choice. This right of self-
determination is enshrined in the United Nations
Charter and is embodied in the 1985 Falkland
Islands Constitution. Nevertheless, the UK and
Argentina maintain good bilateral relations and
co-operate on practical issues of common interest
affecting the South Atlantic, such as conservation
of fish stocks and surveying of the continental
shelf.
Gibraltar
Having been captured by British-Dutch forces in
1704, Gibraltar was ceded by Spain to Britain in
perpetuity under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.
However, Spain has long sought its return. The

Gibraltar has an elected House of Assembly, and

common customs system and does not participate
in the Common Agricultural or Fisheries Policies
or the EU’s value added tax arrangements. The
people of Gibraltar have been declared UK
nationals for EU purposes.
Administration of foreign policy
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The FCO is in charge of foreign policy. It is
headed by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, who is responsible for the work of the
department and the Diplomatic Service (see page
50). Diplomatic, consular and commercial
relations are maintained with about 190 countries,
and the UK has over 230 diplomatic posts
worldwide. British diplomatic missions also
employ nearly 8,000 locally engaged staff. Staff
overseas deal with political, commercial and
economic work; entry clearance to the UK and
consular work; aid administration; and
information and other activities, such as culture,
science and technology.
The FCO’s executive agency, Wiston House
Conference Centre in West Sussex, contributes to
the solution of international problems by
organising conferences in the UK, attended by
politicians, business people, academics and other
professionals from all over the world.
An important function of the FCO is to promote
understanding of British foreign policies and to
project an up-to-date image of the UK worldwide,
beyond the sphere of government-to-government
diplomacy. Key elements of FCO-funded public
diplomacy work include:
■ publications, television and radio
programmes, and the FCO and Planet Britain
websites (www.fco.gov.uk and www.planet-
britain.org);
■ scholarship schemes for overseas students
(see page 121) and programmes for
influential foreign visitors;

■ the BBC World Service (see page 234);
■ the British Council (see below);
■ the London Radio Service and British
Satellite News, used extensively by overseas
radio and television broadcasters to
supplement their news coverage;
■ International Press Section, the FCO’s
specialist link with foreign journalists, both
visiting and based in the UK; and
■ the London Press Service, which supplies
material for publication overseas.
In 2000 the FCO, British Council, Design Council,
British Trade International (see page 368) and
British Tourist Authority established the Britain
Abroad Task Force to co-ordinate the projection
of a modern image of the UK overseas.
Other departments
Several other government departments are closely
involved with foreign policy issues. The DFID is
responsible for promoting poverty reduction
overseas. It is also responsible for the UK’s
relations with the World Bank and international
organisations concerned with development. The
Ministry of Defence maintains military liaison
with the UK’s NATO and other allies and has
defence relationships around the world. The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has an
important influence on international trade
policy and commercial relations with other
countries, including EU Member States. The joint
work of the FCO and DTI in support of British
trade and investment overseas is co-ordinated
through British Trade International. HM Treasury
is involved in British international economic
policy and is responsible for the UK’s relations
with the International Monetary Fund.
British Council
The British Council is the UK’s principal agency
for educational and cultural relations overseas.
Operating in 109 countries, its work includes
teaching English; promoting British education and
training; running information centres; supporting
good governance and human rights; and
encouraging appreciation of British science, arts,
literature and design.
It is financed partly by a grant from the FCO and
partly by income from revenue-earning activities,
such as English language teaching and the
administration of examinations. Some of the
programmes organised by the Council as part of
the British aid programme receive funding from
the DFID.
In 2000/01 the Council issued nearly 8 million
books and videos to 350,000 British Council
library members, and dealt with almost 2 million
enquiries in its libraries and information centres.
It also organised more than 1,500 science events in
over 60 countries; managed or supported 3,000
arts events worldwide; administered 700,000
professional and academic examinations; helped
13,000 young people take part in exchange
projects; and supported over 4,000 trainers and
trainees for vocational projects across Europe.
Educational exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by British
experts, encourages cultural exchange visits, and
organises academic interchange between British
universities and colleges and those in other
countries. Its Central Bureau for International
Education and Training aims to raise standards in
UK education and training through international
partnership and exchange. The Bureau is the UK
national agency for many EU education and
training programmes. It also hosts the Secretariat
of the UK National Commission for UNESCO
(UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation), inaugurated in 2001.
Human rights
The UK Government has stated its commitment to
working for improvements in human rights
standards across the world and, in September 2002,
published its fifth annual human rights report
describing the activities and initiatives pursued
during the previous year (from July 2001 to July
2002). The Human Rights Project Fund, launched
in 1998, provides direct financial assistance for
grass-roots human rights projects around the world.
International conventions
United Nations
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter. Expressions of
concern about human rights do not, therefore,
69
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
constitute interference in the internal affairs of
another state.
The UK Government supports the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted
by the UN General Assembly in 1948. Since this is
not a legally binding document, the General
Assembly adopted two international covenants on
human rights in 1966, placing legal obligations on
those states ratifying or acceding to them. The
covenants came into force in 1976, the UK
ratifying both in the same year. One covenant
deals with economic, social and cultural rights
and the other with civil and political rights. Other
international instruments to which the UK is
a party include those on:
■ the elimination of racial discrimination;
■ the elimination of all forms of discrimination
against women;
■ the rights of the child;
■ torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
■ the prevention of genocide;
■ the abolition of slavery; and
■ the status of refugees.
Council of Europe
The UK is also bound by the Council of Europe’s
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which
covers areas such as:
■ the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
■ the right to marry and have a family;
■ freedom of thought, conscience and religion;
■ freedom of expression, including freedom of
the press;
■ freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
■ the right to have a sentence reviewed by
a higher tribunal; and
■ the prohibition of torture and inhuman or
degrading treatment.
The rights and obligations of the ECHR were
enshrined in UK law upon the implementation of
the Human Rights Act 1998 in 2000 (see page 183).
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions
and Human Rights (in Warsaw) promotes
participating states’ adherence to commitments on
human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and
takes a lead in monitoring elections within the
OSCE area. The Office provides a forum for
exchanges of experts on the building of
democratic institutions and the holding of
elections in participating states. It also provides
expertise and training on human rights,
constitutional and legal matters, and promotes
practical measures to strengthen civil
administration.
International Criminal Court
The UK has supported the establishment of an
International Criminal Court to try cases of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes. The Government signed the Court’s
Statute in 1998 and ratification took place in
October 2001. Over 60 other states have also
ratified the Statute (although not the United
States, which does not recognise its jurisdiction),
enabling the Court to come into existence on
1 July 2002. Based in The Hague in the
Netherlands, its powers are not retrospective.
Development co-operation
The UK’s development aid policy is focused on its
commitment to internationally agreed
development targets - Millennium Development
Goals - such as halving the proportion of people
living in extreme poverty and providing universal
access to primary education and improved
healthcare by 2015. The UK Government believes
that globalisation - involving, for example,
increased flows of goods, services, capital and
trade - offer poor countries opportunities to
access knowledge and technology, new trade and
investment if they can be brought into the global
economy.
In 2000 the Government published a White Paper,
Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation
Work for the Poor, setting out its strategy to bring
sustainable benefits to those living in extreme
poverty. This includes working for fair trade and
70
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
international agreements to promote financial
stability and foreign investment in poor countries,
supporting worldwide environmental initiatives
and assisting countries that are introducing
economic and social policies while protecting
human rights.
In 2001/02 total Department for International
Development expenditure was £2.91 billion (see
charts on page 72): £1.51 billion on bilateral aid,
£1.31 billion on multilateral aid and £88 million
on administration. Official development assistance
is planned to rise from 0.26 per cent of gross
national income in 1997 to 0.33 per cent in
2003/04, when the projected budget of the DFID
is planned to be £3.7 billion. Further rises
announced in 2002 will take the budget to £4.6
billion by 2005/06. UK Official development
assistance is expected to increase to 0.4 per cent of
gross national income, reflecting the
Government’s continued commitment to make
progress towards meeting the United Nations
target of 0.7 per cent. The Government is
committed to increasing annual bilateral aid to
Africa to £1 billion by 2006.
Poverty reduction
The DFID considers that growth, equity and
security are the three central requirements to
achieve poverty reduction. Growth depends on
national market-based policies, supported by the
people, which will promote investment and deliver
effective macroeconomic management. This, in
turn, requires both a continuing commitment by
governments to economic reform and
liberalisation, and the establishment of strong
governance and institutions. Equity is also
fundamental if people are to be able to participate
in growth using their own assets and capabilities
and to have access to education, health,
information, transport and financial services.
Measures to redistribute income and assets can
also generate growth. Increased security against
physical and economic vulnerability is essential in
any poverty reduction programme. The UK is
shifting its assistance from individual projects to
direct support to governments implementing
agreed poverty reduction strategies and better
financial management.
Debt relief
The heavy burden of servicing debt reduces the
ability of the poorest countries to tackle poverty
effectively. The UK is focusing on accelerating the
implementation of the revised 1999 Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative,
which is designed to deliver wider and faster relief
to countries committed to poverty reduction. The
UK goes further than required under the HIPC
initiative and writes off 100 per cent of debt from
HIPC countries once they qualify for relief. The
Government is also providing full debt relief on the
remaining ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) debt - about £2 billion - for
countries that qualify for the HIPC initiative.
Good governance and human rights
The quality of governance has a major impact on
economic growth and the effectiveness of services.
The DFID is focusing on issues such as
democratic accountability (bringing poor people
into the democratic process); fundamental
freedoms (including rights to education, health
and an adequate livelihood); combating child
labour; tackling corruption and money
laundering; better revenue and public finance
management; access to basic services; and
personal safety and security in the community
with access to justice.
Women's empowerment
An estimated 70 per cent of the world’s poor are
female. Eliminating gender discrimination and
supporting measures to improve women’s equality
are crucial to reducing poverty and upholding
human rights. A priority in DFID assistance is the
promotion of equal access to education for all
girls and boys.
Health
Three of the eight Millennium Development
Goals involve health: the reduction of child
mortality, the improvement in maternal health
and the fight against diseases (including HIV,
tuberculosis, and malaria). The impact of these
major diseases on the poor is an important
obstacle to social and economic development. The
UK has worked with the G8 countries, developing
countries and the UN to establish a Global Health
Fund to increase access to effective treatments
against these diseases. Operational since
December 2001, the Fund has received pledges of
some US$2 billion over five years, including
US$200 million from the UK.
Since 1997 the DFID has committed around
£1.5 billion to improving basic healthcare in
developing countries. The improvement of poor
people’s access to healthcare and to new and

Education
Education is a fundamental right and the key to
economic and social development. More than 120
million children around the world do not go to
school and one child in five drops out before
completing five years of basic education. One in
five adults is illiterate, two-thirds of them women.
DFID resources are focused on basic and primary
education.

The UK is working with other governments to
develop well-integrated and sustainable education
systems, helping them to provide high-quality
primary education. Literacy skills (such as
reading, writing and numeracy) are an integral
part of many aid programmes. They give access to
information on, for example, health, education
and the market economy, and provide a vital link
to greater opportunities for improving people’s
livelihoods and their human rights.
p
The environment
Maintaining and improving the environment are
crucial to the elimination of poverty. The DFID’s
main priority is to promote better environmental
management, reverse environmental degradation,
and reduce poor people’s vulnerability to the
effects of global environmental trends
(particularly climate change).
Conflict and natural disasters
Conflict and natural disasters are major barriers to
reducing poverty. Many of the 40 poorest
countries are either in the middle of armed
conflict or have only recently emerged from such
conflict. The DFID’s objectives are to reduce the
tensions that lead to conflict, limit the means of
waging warfare and provide the early
humanitarian assistance and support needed for
long-term reconstruction. The UK has
contributed £60 million in aid towards the
humanitarian emergency and reconstruction of
72
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
Afghanistan (see also page 75), and is also
providing critical support in helping to re¬
establish stability in Sierra Leone.
The DFID’s humanitarian assistance is targeted
to improving the quality and speed of the response
to a disaster; promoting effective recovery and
early transition from emergency assistance to
rehabilitation and reconstruction; and helping
countries to reduce their vulnerability to natural,
environmental and industrial disasters. The DFID
is also continuing its commitment to strengthen
the response of the multilateral institutions to
humanitarian relief and crisis management.
During 2000/01 the UK responded to a number
of natural disasters, including flooding in
Mozambique and earthquakes in India and El
Salvador. It also funded winter relief for Serbia
and assistance for refugees in West Africa, Sudan,
Indonesia and the Middle East.
Peacekeeping and security
The UN is the principal body responsible for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
At the end of May 2002 there were some 45,100
military personnel and civilian police from 87
nations serving in 15 peacekeeping operations
around the world. The UK provides civilian
police, military observers and troops for a range
of UN missions and NATO deployments.
Cyprus
The UK has a contingent of about 390 troops in
the UN Force in Cyprus, established in 1964 to
help prevent the recurrence of fighting between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since the hostilities
of 1974, when Turkish forces occupied the
northern part of the island, the Force has been
responsible for monitoring the ceasefire and for
control of a buffer zone between the two
communities.
Iraq/Kuwait
In 1991 UN Security Council Resolution 687
established a demilitarised zone extending 10 km
into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter violations
of the boundary and to observe hostile or
potentially hostile actions. The UK, with the other
permanent members of the Security Council,
contributes 11 personnel to the UN Iraq/Kuwait
observer mission.
Sierra Leone
In May 2000 there was a serious deterioration in
the security situation in war-torn Sierra Leone as
members of the UN peacekeeping mission were
taken hostage by rebel forces. In response, the UK
Government rapidly deployed forces to the capital,
Freetown, to evacuate UK citizens and secure the
airport to allow the arrival of UN reinforcements.
FFaving achieved these aims, the British force was
withdrawn and British training teams were
deployed from June 2000 to help establish new,
accountable Sierra Leone armed forces and a
police force. Over 9,000 soldiers have since been
trained and equipped by the UK, which has
continued to help the Government of Sierra Leone
and UN forces to regain control over the whole
country and stage the peaceful elections held in
May 2002.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
The UK supports the consolidation of a peaceful,
multi-ethnic and democratic Bosnia and
FFerzegovina, and is helping to implement the
1995 Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement. The
Stabilisation Force (SFOR) comprises troops from
NATO nations and other contributing countries.
The UK contributes some 1,850 troops to SFOR
and around 80 British police officers to the
UN International Police Task Force in Bosnia.
While ensuring continuing compliance with the
military requirements of the Dayton Agreement,
SFOR also provides support to the main
organisations responsible for its civil aspects,
including the Office of the High Representative,
the International Police Task Force, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, the OSCE and the
UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The UK is helping the International Criminal
Tribunal in The Hague, which was set up to try
those indicted for war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia. British forces have been at the
forefront of SFOR’s efforts to detain those
indicted for war crimes. As well as contributing to
the funding of the Tribunal, the UK provides staff,
information and forensic science expertise.
Kosovo
Kosovo continues to be governed by a UN interim
civilian administration (UNMIK), which was set
up in the war-ravaged province of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia under a UN Security
Council resolution in 1999. The UK provides
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
some 200 civilian police, along with specialist
officers, local government administrators and
judicial experts to UNMIK, which is helping to
establish self-government in the province. The UK
maintains its commitment to the Kosovo Force
(KFOR), contributing some 2,500 personnel to
KFOR operations.
Macedonia
NATO forces were deployed to Macedonia in
August 2001 following months of internal conflict
between ethnic Albanian insurgents, led by the
National Liberation Army (NLA), and
Macedonian armed forces. The purpose of the
30-day NATO operation, including some 2,000
British personnel, was to collect weapons
volunteered by the NLA following a framework
agreement for a political settlement between
Albanian and Macedonian leaders. A new NATO
task force, to which the UK contributes 35
personnel, was subsequently deployed to ensure
the security of international monitors overseeing
the progress of the political process and the return
of police to the former areas of conflict.
Arms control
Because of the global reach of modern weapons,
the UK has a clear national interest in preventing
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
promoting international control. In addition, the
attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001
have reinforced the need to prevent terrorists from
obtaining such weapons.
Weapons of mass destruction
Nuclear weapons
The main instrument for controlling nuclear
weapons is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which entered into force
in 1970 and to which the UK Government
remains committed. The UK helped secure its
indefinite extension in 1995, and played an active
role in the sixth review conference in 2000 (where,
for the first time since 1985, all participants agreed
a final document which reviewed progress on
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament over
the previous five years, and set out an agenda for
the next five).
The UK was also involved in the negotiations on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
which it signed in 1996 and ratified in 1998. The
CTBT, with its permanent verification system, will
come into force upon ratification by the
remaining 13 of 44 named states. The UK
Government is also pressing for the negotiation of
a treaty banning the future production of fissile
material for use in nuclear weapons.
The UK welcomed the signing of the Treaty of
Moscow (Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty)
by the United States and Russia in May 2002,
which will reduce their respective strategic nuclear
warheads by two-thirds by 2012. Nevertheless,
while large nuclear arsenals and the risks of
proliferation remain, the Government considers
that the UK’s minimum nuclear deterrent (see
page 82) remains a necessary and continuing
element of the UK’s security.
Biological weapons
The 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons
Convention provides for a worldwide ban on such
weapons, but there are no effective compliance
mechanisms. The UK continues to look for ways
of strengthening the Convention.
Chemical weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which
came into force in 1997, provides for a worldwide
ban on these weapons. The Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is responsible
for verification. All the necessary British
legislation is in place to license the production,
possession and use of the most toxic chemicals
and to implement the Convention’s trade controls.
Conventional armed forces
The UK continues to work with its NATO
partners and other European countries to develop
and improve agreements to enhance stability in
Europe in the light of the changed security
environment. The main agreements reached are:
■ the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CEE) Treaty (signed originally in 1990 and
adapted at an OSCE summit in 1999), which
limits the numbers of heavy weapons in the
countries of NATO and the former Warsaw
Pact, and includes a verification regime. The
CEE Treaty is widely regarded as a linchpin of
European security;
■ the Vienna Document, developed under the
auspices of the OSCE, which is a politically
binding agreement on the promotion of
74
Government and foreign affairs
7 International relations
stability and openness on military matters in
Europe; revised in 1999, it contains
confidence- and security-building measures,
and verification arrangements; and
■ the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which provides
for the overflight and photography of the
entire territory of the 27 participating states
to monitor their military capabilities and
activities. The Treaty entered into force on
1 January 2002.
The UN Register of Conventional Arms, which
came into effect in 1992, is intended to allow
greater transparency in international transfers of
conventional arms and to help identify excessive
arms build-ups in any one country or region.
Landmines
The UK signed the Ottawa Convention banning
the use, production, trade, transfer and stockpiling
of anti-personnel landmines in 1997. The
Convention, which Britain ratified in 1998,
entered into force on 1 March 1999. The UK
destroyed its stockpile of anti-personnel mines by
October 1999. It has a programme to support
humanitarian demining activities, which is
focused on helping affected countries develop the
capacity to clear landmines and on improving the
co-ordination of international demining
resources.
Export controls
The UK is a founding member of all the
international export control regimes which govern
the export of conventional arms, technology
associated with weapons of mass destruction,
missiles, and ‘dual-use’ goods.
In 1997 the UK Government issued new criteria
for assessing licence applications for arms exports,
one of which is that licences will not be granted if
there is a clearly identifiable risk that weapons
might be used for internal repression or
international aggression. At the same time it
banned the export of certain items for which there
is clear evidence of use for torture or other abuses;
it also declared its commitment to preventing
British companies from manufacturing, selling or
procuring such equipment and to pressing for a
global ban. In 1998 EU Member States agreed on
a Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, setting
similar common standards to which all EU
members would adhere.
International terrorism
The UK Government is committed to eliminating
terrorism as a force in international affairs. It
regards acts of terrorism as unacceptable in all
circumstances and opposes concessions to any
terrorist demands. It works bilaterally with other
Afghanistan
Usama Bin Laden's Al Qaida terrorist network was
responsible for the seizure and crashing of civil
airliners in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania
on 11 September 2001. Al Qaida operated training
camps in Afghanistan and Bin Laden was sheltered
by the Taliban regime. Following the Taliban's refusal
to hand over Bin Laden, the US-led coalition began
military action in Afghanistan on 7 October 2001.
The UK was involved from the outset, initially
launching cruise missiles against terrorist training
camps and providing other naval and air support to
the coalition. In November a small force was also
deployed to help secure and maintain the airbase at
Bagram, near the Afghan capital of Kabul.
By December 2001 the Taliban regime had
collapsed. It was replaced by the Afghan Interim
Authority, created out of an Afghan-led peace
process (initiated at a meeting in Bonn, Germany)
designed to rebuild the country. To support the new
government the UN also authorised the dispatch of
a 5,000-strong International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) to Kabul to help stabilise the city. The
UK led the ISAF for its first six months and at one
point had some 2,100 troops serving with the force.
Eighteen other countries also contributed forces,
while the United States provided a liaison team. In
June 2002 command of ISAF was transferred to
Turkey and it was announced that the British
contingent would be scaled down to about 400.
Also in June, the Loya Jirga (grand council) of
representatives from across Afghanistan met in
Kabul to choose the future government of the
country.
Despite this progress, pockets of the Al Qaida and
Taliban remained active in Afghanistan. A 1,700-
strong British commando battle group was deployed
to Afghanistan at the request of the US to
undertake offensive operations from April 2002. On
the completion of its operations, it began a phased
withdrawal in July. However, the UK is retaining a
significant air, naval and ground force presence in
Afghanistan and the region.

like-minded governments and multilaterally

UK Government has stepped up assistance to
those countries that lack the means to tackle
terrorism themselves and is committed to
challenging the political, social and economic
conditions that are exploited by terrorists. The UK
has ratified all 12 United Nations terrorism
conventions, the most recent - the International
Convention for the Suppression of Financing of
Terrorism - in February 2001, upon the entry into
force of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Campaign against international
terrorism
The UK has played a leading part in the global
response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist
attacks in the United States, in which around
60 British people are thought to have died. The
unanimity of the international community in its
condemnation of the attacks was unprecedented,
and the UN Security Council mandated action to
suppress terrorism worldwide. The UK, which
chairs the UN Counter Terrorism Committee, has
been a leading member of the coalition against
international terrorism. The British Government
published a report on 9 September 2002 to update
Parliament on progress in the campaign against
terrorism, detailing actions taken by the
Government in the UK and overseas in the year
following the attacks in the United States.
International crime
The UK supports international efforts to combat
illegal drugs, working with producer and transit
countries, especially those where drug production
and trafficking represent a direct threat to the UK.
Over 60 drug liaison officers are stationed in UK
missions in key countries, in co-operation with
the host authorities. Working with its EU partners,
the UK is helping Fatin American, Caribbean and
Central Asian states to stem the transit of drugs
across their territories. It also participated in the
negotiation of the EU drugs strategy for 2000-04,
which was endorsed by the European Council in
1999. The UK Government contributed
£7.3 million to anti-drugs assistance overseas in
2001/02 and this will increase to over £10 million
in 2002/03. The UK is involved in the United
Nations drug control structure, and is one of the
largest contributors to the UN International Drug
Control Programme. Diplomatic efforts are
backed up by the UK’s overseas drugs assistance
programme.
The UK also contributes to international efforts to
counter financial crime, for example through its
membership of the Financial Action Task Force
against money laundering, and through its
support for regional anti-money laundering
groups.
Together with its EU partners, the UK is
confronting serious and organised international
crime through, for example, the European Police
Office (EUROPOL) which supports investigations
and operations conducted by national law
enforcement agencies. EU Member States also
belong to the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL). UK liaison with
INTERPOL is provided by the National Criminal
Intelligence Service (see page 196).
The UK participated in the negotiation of the UN
Convention Against Transnational Crime, and
three protocols covering the smuggling of
migrants, trafficking in human beings and illegal
firearms. The Convention was signed by 120
states, including the UK, in 2000.

UK security
Defence policy
The purpose of the Ministry of Defence and the
armed forces is to defend the United Kingdom
(UK), its Overseas Territories, and its people and
interests, and to act as a force for good by
strengthening international peace and security.
The defence of the UK, as well as its economic and
other wider interests, is linked with the security of
Europe. The primary means of ensuring that
security is the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO), of which the UK is a founder member
and to which most of its armed forces are
assigned. The Government is involved in the
development of European military capabilities to
strengthen Europe’s contribution to NATO and to
allow the European Union (EU) to conduct crisis
management operations where NATO as a whole
chooses not to be engaged (see page 79). The
armed forces also contribute to the peacetime
security of the UK and its Overseas Territories,
and assist in humanitarian and peacetime
operations worldwide.
The 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR) is the
foundation of the country’s defence policy and of
plans for reshaping and modernising the services
for this century. The SDR concluded that,
although there was no direct military threat to the
UK or its Overseas Territories following the
conclusion of the Cold War, there were new threats
such as the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, organised crime, and the
break-up of the old communist states with
attendant ethnic and religious conflict.
The SDR laid out a force structure in which the
armed services would be able to respond to a
major international crisis. This might involve
operations of a similar scale and duration to the
Strategic Defence Review implementation 82

Administration 85
Gulf War, or of more extended overseas
deployment on a lesser scale (such as in Bosnia
and Kosovo), while retaining the ability to mount
a second, substantial deployment (up to a combat
brigade with supporting naval and air forces).
War on terrorism: Afghanistan
Britain is one of a coalition of more than 20 nations
which have been contributing troops, equipment
and logistical support to the 5,000-strong
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in
order to assist the new Afghan Interim Authority in
bringing security and stability in Kabul. Britain has
also provided troops to the United States in
operations against Al Qaida terrorists in
Afghanistan. (See page 75 for the Government's
policy on terrorism.)
The number of UK forces on operations in
Afghanistan varied over time according to the
situation on the ground. Between October 2001
and July 2002, UK forces at their peak included:
■ an amphibious force including the helicopter
carrier HMS Ocean, two frigates and a nuclear-
powered submarine armed with Tomahawk land-
attack missiles;
■ some 2,100 troops in the ISAF;
■ an infantry battlegroup of 1,700 troops built
around 45 Commando, Royal Marines, and RAF
helicopters assisting US-led forces in offensive
operations; and
■ RAF reconnaissance, refuelling and Flercules
transport aircraft.
The 45 Commando group was withdrawn in
summer 2002, while the British contribution to the
ISAF was reduced to 400 personnel.

Government and foreign affairs
8 Defence
The growth and type of missions undertaken by
UK forces since the SDR assessment point to the
likelihood of the armed services conducting
smaller, but frequent assignments - often
simultaneous and sometimes prolonged, and
some at short notice. In response to the attacks
upon the United States in September 2001, an
update to the SDR, The New Chapter, was issued
in July 2002, highlighting the need to ensure that
the right forces, concepts and capabilities were in
place to deal with the new threats.
The strategy outlined in the SDR is also designed to
reinforce the UK’s contribution to international
peace and security through NATO and the EU, and
through other international organisations such as
the United Nations (UN - see page 61) and the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE - see page 63).
North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation
Membership of NATO is the cornerstone of British
defence policy, and most of the UK’s forces are
assigned to it. The Alliance embodies the
transatlantic relationship that links North America
and Europe in a unique defence and security
partnership. The number of members was
increased to 19 with the accession of the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999. The
Alliance remains open to new members willing and
able to assume the obligations and responsibilities
of membership. Ten countries (Albania, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) are preparing for
membership. NATO is expected to issue new
invitations to some of these countries to join the
Alliance at the Prague summit in November 2002.
NATO is adapting to the changed security
environment in Europe. This includes a
fundamental transformation in the Alliance’s
relationship with Russia after 11 September 2001.
A summit meeting in May 2002 established a
NATO-Russia Council to provide NATO allies and
Russia with a mechanism for consultation,
consensus-building, co-operation and joint action
on a wide range of security issues of common
interest, including terrorism, crisis management
and non-proliferation.
Following the 1999 NATO summit, measures were
put in place to increase the ability of the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council countries to
operate effectively in NATO-led crisis
management operations (see also page 63). These
include greater involvement of the 27 non-NATO
‘Partnership for Peace’ states in the political
consultation and decision-making process and in
operational planning and command
arrangements. NATO is also committed to the
development of its relationship with Ukraine,
following a consultation and co-operation
agreement signed in 1997.
NATO is undertaking internal restructuring,
including a major review of the military
command structure and the implementation of
the Combined Joint Task Force concept to ensure
that it remains an effective military alliance able to
meet the challenges of the post-11 September
world. At the 1999 summit the allies launched an
initiative to improve its military capabilities that
will lead to increased effectiveness of Alliance
operations. NATO is also reassessing its defence
policy in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on
the United States. NATO foreign ministers agreed
at Reykjavik in May 2002 that NATO forces should
be usable wherever they are needed to counter the
new threats of terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction.
European security and defence
While NATO is the primary means of ensuring
UK and European security and defence,
operations such as in Bosnia and Kosovo (see
page 73) have led the EU countries to initiate a
programme designed to improve their military
capabilities to enable the EU to undertake crisis
management operations where NATO is not
engaged. This programme will also help to ensure
that the European countries contribute more
effectively to the Alliance. At the Helsinki
European Council in 1999, EU Member States
committed themselves to the goal of modernising
their armed forces so that by 2003 they would be
able to deploy collectively up to 60,000 personnel,
together with appropriate air and naval elements,
within 60 days. This force would be used to carry
out humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and
peacemaking tasks, and would be sustainable for
at least a year. The UK contribution to an
individual operation could be up to 12,500
ground troops, 18 warships and 72 combat
aircraft. A crucial priority in achieving this
objective is the setting up of permanent
arrangements for consultation and co-operation
79
Government and foreign affairs
8 Defence
with NATO and for drawing on NATO planning
and other capabilities. Collective defence remains
the responsibility of NATO, which will also
continue to have a major role in crisis
management.
Defence tasks
The UK and its Overseas Territories
The armed forces are responsible for safeguarding
Britain’s territory, airspace and territorial waters.
They also provide for the security and
reinforcement of the Overseas Territories and
support to the civil authorities in both the UK and
the Overseas Territories.
Maritime defence
The Royal Navy aims to patrol, police and defend
the UK’s territorial waters and ensure the
protection of its rights and interests in the
surrounding seas (including offshore oil and gas
reserves), and of British interests around the
world. The maintenance of a 24-hour, year-round
presence in waters around the British Isles provides
reassurance to merchant ships and other mariners,
as well as security of the seas. In addition, threats
to British flagged ships overseas remain a national
responsibility, particularly in view of the
continuing global terrorist danger. The Royal Air
Force (RAF) also contributes to maritime
requirements, for instance through the Nimrod
force, which provides air surveillance of surface
vessels and submarines.
Land defence
The British Army aims to provide, through either
the deployment of the whole or appropriate
elements of its available forces, the capability to
defend the UK and its Overseas Territories. In
addition, the Army is committed to such tasks as
giving military aid to peace support and
humanitarian operations, responding to regional
conflict outside the NATO area and contributing
forces to counter a strategic attack on NATO.
Air defence
Air defence of the UK and the surrounding seas is
maintained by a system of layered defences.
Continuous radar cover is provided by the Air
Surveillance and Control System (ASACS)
supplemented by the NATO Airborne Early
Warning Force, to which the RAF contributes six
aircraft. The RAF also provides five squadrons of
Tornado F3 air defence aircraft, supported by
tanker aircraft and, in wartime, an additional F3
squadron. Royal Navy air defence destroyers can
also be linked to the ASACS, providing radar and
electronic warfare coverage and surface-to-air
missiles. Ground-launched Rapier missiles defend
the main RAF bases. Naval aircraft also contribute
to British air defence.
Overseas garrisons
The UK maintains garrisons in Gibraltar, the
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus, the Falkland
Islands and Brunei. Gibraltar contains support,
logistic, communications and training facilities in
the western Mediterranean, while Cyprus provides
basing facilities in the eastern Mediterranean. The
garrison on the Falkland Islands is a tangible
demonstration of the Government’s commitment
to uphold the right of the islanders to determine
their own future (see page 68). The garrison in
Brunei is maintained at the request of the Brunei
Government. In addition, a jungle warfare¬
training unit is maintained in Belize.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces provide support to the police in
Northern Ireland (see page 16) in maintaining law
and order and countering terrorism. The number
of units deployed at any one time is dependent on
the prevailing security situation. The Royal Navy
patrols territorial waters around Northern Ireland
and its inland waterways in order to deter and
intercept the movement of terrorist weapons. The
Royal Marines provide troops to meet Navy and
Army commitments, while the RAF provides
elements of the RAF Regiment and Chinook,
Wessex and Puma helicopters.
Other tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
■ military aid to other government
departments, for example support during the
foot-and-mouth outbreak and carrying out
fishery protection duties;
■ military aid to the civil power, such as
assisting the police in response to terrorist
threats and in helping in the fight against
drugs;
■ military aid to the civil community, including
during floods; and
■ military search and rescue.

8 Defence
Britain in NATO
Maritime forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to NATO.
Permanent contributions are made to NATO’s
Standing Naval Forces in the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, and to NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Forces. The UK also contributes to NATO’s
Maritime Augmentation Forces, which are held at
the lowest state of readiness and in peacetime
comprise ships mainly in routine refit or
maintenance.
The main components of the fleet available to
NATO are:
■ three aircraft carriers operating Joint Force
Harrier aircraft and Sea King or Merlin anti¬
submarine helicopters;
■ 32 destroyers and frigates, and 22 mine
counter-measure vessels;
■ 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines; and
■ amphibious forces, including a commando
brigade of the Royal Marines, and a
helicopter carrier.
Land forces
The multinational HQ of the Allied Command
Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) and its
supporting forces is the key land component of
NATO’s Rapid Reaction Forces. Capable of
deploying at short notice up to four NATO
divisions, the HQ ARRC is commanded by a
British general. The UK provides two of the ten
divisions available to the Corps - an armoured
division of three armoured brigades stationed in
Germany, and a division of three mechanised
brigades based in Britain. Up to 55,000 British
troops may be assigned to HQ ARRC for
operations. An air-mobile brigade, assigned to one
of the Corps’ multinational divisions, is also sited
in the UK.
Air forces
The RAF contributes to NATO’s Immediate and
Rapid Reaction Forces and its main defence forces.
Around 100 aircraft and 40 helicopters are
allocated to them. Tornado F3, Harrier and Jaguar
aircraft, and Rapier surface-to-air missiles form
part of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s
Immediate Reaction Force, while Harrier, Jaguar
and Tornado GR1/4 aircraft provide offensive
support and tactical reconnaissance for the Rapid
Reaction Force. Chinook and Puma helicopters, as
part of the Joint Helicopter Command, supply
troop airlift facilities for the ARRC or other
deployed land forces. The RAF provides Nimrod
maritime patrol aircraft, and search and rescue
helicopters. In addition, the RAF is the main
European provider of air-to-air refuelling and
strategic airlift, and contributes to the NATO
airborne early warning and control component.
Wider security interests
Military tasks to promote the UK’s wider security
interests may be undertaken by British forces
working within NATO, assisting the United
Nations, in coalition with allies, or acting alone.
Contingents are deployed on UN operations in
Cyprus, Georgia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia,
Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and on the Iraq/Kuwait border. Over Iraq (see
pages 64-5), Tornado GRl/4s and Jaguars,
supported by VC-10s, are policing the no-fly zones
to ensure that Iraq does not resume repression of
minorities and that it does not threaten its
neighbours. The Royal Navy is deployed to the
Gulf to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq. A large
British force was deployed in Afghanistan to
provide stability in Kabul, and to assist the US in
operations against terrorist elements (see
page 75).
The number of operations against trafficking in
illicit drugs has increased in recent years, for
example in the Caribbean, where a Royal Navy
destroyer or frigate works closely with the
authorities of the United States, the Overseas
Territories and the Regional Security System to
combat drug trafficking. The ship on station,
HMS Newcastle, seized £42 million worth of drugs
in an operation carried out in July 2002.
In recent years, British forces have taken part in
international evacuation or humanitarian relief
operations in Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Eritrea,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone,
Mozambique, East Timor, the Caribbean and
Central America.
Defence diplomacy is the use of defence assets to
build and promote stability and assist in the
development of democratically accountable armed
forces. British service personnel and civilians
working in defence are involved in a range of non-
operational activities including:
81
Government and foreign affairs
8 Defence
■ help in verifying arms control agreements
(see pages 74-5);
■ outreach programmes of bilateral assistance
and co-operation with other countries in
areas such as English language training,
defence management, and modernisation and
reform of armed forces; and
■ training of some 4,000 military and civilian
students from over 100 countries each year at
UK defence establishments.
UK intelligence and security services
The UK has three intelligence and security services:
the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), the Security
Service and the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ). The SIS and the GCHQ are
responsible to the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, and the Security Service is responsible to
the Home Secretary. The planned budget for these
agencies in 2002/03 is £893 million. The main role
of the SIS is the production of secret intelligence in
issues regarding Britain's vital interests in the fields
of security, defence, foreign and economic policies.
The Security Service (also known as 'MI5') is
responsible for the protection of Britain against
threats to national security, primarily from terrorism
and espionage. GCHQ carries out signals
intelligence to support national security, military
operations and law enforcement, and also helps
secure government communications and key
systems supporting the UK's national infrastructure.
The Ministry of Defence has its own Defence
Intelligence Staff, which provide intelligence
analyses, assessments, advice and strategic
warnings to the Ministry of Defence, the armed
forces and government.
Nuclear forces
Although the four Trident submarines are retained
as the ultimate guarantee of national security, the
UK and other members of NATO have radically
reduced their reliance on nuclear weapons. The
UK continues to support mutual, balanced and
verifiable reductions in the number of nuclear
weapons worldwide (see page 74). When the UK
Government is satisfied that sufficient progress
has been made to allow the inclusion of British
nuclear weapons in multilateral negotiations
without endangering UK security interests, the
Government will do so.
As a result of an examination of Britain’s
deterrence requirements, the Government
concluded that fewer than 200 operationally
available nuclear warheads were needed - a
reduction of one-third. Therefore, the UK now
has only one Trident submarine on patrol at
a time. It carries a reduced load of up to 48
warheads compared with the previous maximum
of 96. The submarine’s missiles are not targeted
and it is normally at several days’ ‘notice to fire’.
Strategic Defence Review
implementation
Over two-thirds of the SDR measures have been
implemented, which has increased the armed
forces’ capabilities. Progress towards the more
flexible and rapidly deployable expeditionary
forces also continues, with improvements in:
■ strategic transport capabilities by leasing four
C17 aircraft pending the introduction of 25
multinational A400M aircraft, by ordering six
roll-on, roll-off ferries in a Private Finance
Initiative (see page 350), and placing
contracts for four new landing ships;
■ tactical mobility through combining airborne
and airmobile forces with the new Apache attack
helicopter to form a highly capable air
manoeuvre formation (16 Air Mobile Brigade)
trained and equipped for long-range operations;
■ new long-range and strike ‘smart’ weapons;
and
■ measures against chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear warfare threats,
including the setting up of a joint nuclear,
chemical and biological defence regiment.
The strike capability is also being improved.
Replacement aircraft carriers will enter service
from 2012, and will be able to carry the Royal
Navy and RAF Future Joint Combat Aircraft
(planned to be the Joint Strike Aircraft), which
will also operate from land. Two other
replacement vessels, the amphibious assault ships
Albion and Bulwark, are scheduled to enter service
in 2003 and 2004.
Other SDR initiatives to co-ordinate service
activities more closely have been completed. These
include the establishment of:
82
Government and foreign affairs
8 Defence
■ the Joint Rapid Reaction Force, a more easily
deployed and better supported force that
includes 50 warships and support vessels,
four army brigades and 100 aircraft, elements
of which have been operating successfully in
Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone;
■ an additional brigade, 12 Mechanised
Brigade, created from the Army’s armoured
and mechanised formations;
■ the Joint Helicopter Command of tri-service
force of some 350 attack, troop-carrying and
heavy lift helicopters;
■ the Joint Force Harrier, an interim offensive
command of Royal Navy and RAF Harrier
aircraft;
■ the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO),
which provides a more streamlined logistic
service to the front line; and
■ the Joint Doctrine and Concepts Centre for
the development of defence doctrine.
In addition, the Territorial Army (see page 85) has
been reorganised. Its units and individuals are more
integrated into the regular army, concentrating on
specialist roles such as communications, equipment
maintenance, logistics and medical support.
Defence equipment
Modern equipment is essential if one of the key
aims of Britain’s force restructuring programme is
to be achieved, namely that of increasing the
flexibility and mobility of its armed forces.
Improvements for the Royal Navy equipment
programme include:
■ the Astute-class attack submarines;
■ two new aircraft carriers; and
■ the Type 45 destroyer, which will deploy an
anti-air missile system developed with France
and Italy.
The Army front line is being strengthened by:
■ the introduction of the Challenger 2 tank;
■ Apache attack helicopters equipped with new
anti-tank missiles; and
■ improved Rapier and new Starstreak air
defence missiles.
Improvements for the RAF include:
■ the upgrading of the Tornado GR1 fleet to
GR4 standard (nearing completion);
■ the introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon
combat aircraft;
■ new Nimrod maritime patrol and attack
aircraft;
■ the introduction of EH 101 and Chinook
support helicopters and improved Hercules
aircraft; and
■ the replacement of the Joint Force Harriers
with aircraft operating from the new aircraft
carriers and from land.
Defence procurement
Some £10 billion is spent each year on military
equipment. Responsibility for this budget lies with
the Defence Procurement Agency and Defence
Logistics Organisation. All defence acquisition
projects are run on a ‘smart’ acquisition
procedure. When assessing options, consideration
is given to the initial costs of a project and to the
cost of support throughout its service life.
Competition for contracts takes place wherever
possible. Once a contract is awarded, integrated
teams, including representatives from industry,
control the project throughout its life. Equipment
is acquired incrementally, with the basic
equipment entering into service quickly and then
being upgraded as technology improves. The
involvement of the private sector through public-
private partnerships (see page 350) is a major
element of procurement strategy. Under this
policy, capital investment with a value of some
£1.8 billion is being undertaken.
International procurement collaboration
The UK is a member of NATO’s Conference of
National Armaments Directors, which promotes
equipment collaboration between NATO nations.
It is also a founder member of OCCAR, an
armament co-operation organisation formed with
France, Germany and Italy for managing joint
83
Government and foreign affairs
8 Defence
procurement activities. Current collaborative
programmes in which the UK participates include:
■ development of the Eurofighter Typhoon
(with Germany, Italy and Spain);
■ a maritime anti-air missile system (France
and Italy);
■ a ‘beyond visual’ anti-air missile system
(France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Sweden);
■ the EH 101 helicopter (Italy);
■ a multi-role armoured vehicle (France and
Germany);
■ the large transport Airbus A400M aircraft
(Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
Turkey); and
■ the Joint Strike Fighter (US).
The armed forces
Commissioned ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the ranks
or by direct entry based on educational and other
qualifications, are granted for short, medium and
long terms. All three services have schemes for
school, university and college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training at the
Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth; the
Commando Training Centre, Fympstone (Devon);
the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; or the
Royal Air Force College, Cranwell. This is followed
by specialist training, which may include degree
courses at service establishments or universities.
Courses of higher training for officers, designed to
emphasise the joint approach to the tactical and
operational levels of conflict, are provided at the
Joint Services Command and Staff College at
Shrivenham (Wiltshire).
Non-commissioned ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks vary
widely in length and terms of service. Subject to a
minimum period, entrants may leave at any time,
giving 18 months’ notice (12 months for certain
engagements). Discharge may also be granted on
compassionate or medical grounds.
In addition to their basic training, non¬
commissioned personnel receive supplementary
specialist training throughout their careers. Study
for educational qualifications is encouraged, and
service trade and technical training leads to
nationally recognised qualifications. New
vocational training and educational initiatives
have been set up to improve recruitment and
retention. The Army Foundation College offers a
42-week course combining military training and
the opportunity to acquire national qualifications.
The course is intended to attract high-quality
recruits who will go on to fill senior posts in
front-line roles.
Reserve Forces
The Reserve Forces serve alongside the regular
forces and are integral to the ability to expand the
services in times of crises. For example, under the
current commitment, around 10 per cent of UK
forces in Bosnia are reservists at any one time. In
particular, reserves can provide skills and units not
available or required in peacetime. The reserves
include former members of the regular armed
forces liable for service in an emergency (regular
reserve) and volunteer reserves, recruited directly
from the civilian community - the Royal Naval
Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve, the Territorial
Army and the Reserve Air Forces (which comprise
the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air
Force Reserve).
To support the regular forces, the reserves - both
individuals and formed units - need to be fully
integrated into regular formations and readily
available for service, where necessary through
selective compulsory call-out during situations
short of a direct threat to the UK. Reserves are
also liable for service in peace support operations.
Training for this role is given at the Reserve
Training Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell near
Nottingham. Under the SDR, Royal Naval and
RAF volunteer reserve numbers will increase, and,

while the strength of the TA has been reduced
from 56,000 to 41,200, it is more closely integrated
with the Regular Army, with greater emphasis on
combat support. In the light of the terrorist attack
on the United States, the Government is
considering the creation of a reaction force of
some 6,000 personnel formed from the volunteer

The defence budget
The defence budget for 2002/03 is £29.4 billion,
rising to £30.9 billion in 2003/04, £31.8 billion in
2004/05 and £32.8 billion in 2005/06. The
Ministry of Defence believes that this growth in
defence spending - the largest sustained real
increase for 20 years - will provide necessary
investment in the armed forces’ capabilities and
structures to deal with extra priorities as outlined
in The New Chapter in the SDR, including the
demands of the war on terrorism.
Defence management
The Ministry of Defence is both a Department of
State and the highest-level military headquarters.
The Secretary of State for Defence is responsible
for the formulation and conduct of defence policy
and for providing the means by which it is
conducted. Three junior ministers support the
Secretary of State and have responsibilities for
operational, policy and service personnel issues;
defence equipment development, acquisition and
defence exports; and veterans, civilian personnel,
environmental and regulatory matters respectively.
Ministers are assisted by the Chief of the Defence
Staff (CDS) and the Permanent Secretary. The
CDS is the head of the armed forces and the
principal military adviser to the Secretary of State
and the Government. The Permanent Secretary is
the Government’s principal civilian adviser on
defence and has primary responsibility for policy,
finance and administration of the department.
A large proportion of the Ministry of Defence’s
support activities is undertaken by defence
agencies (see page 480), such as the Defence
Procurement Agency.

The population of the UK has grown and changed
significantly since the Queen came to the throne in
1952. Increased life expectancy and lower fertility
rates have produced an older population, while
immigration has led to ethnic diversity. Living
arrangements and relationships have changed.
More people are living alone, cohabitation before
marriage is now commonplace and there has been
a rise in births outside marriage. Many more
women are participating in the labour market,
although they still do most of the housework and
childcare. Living standards are much higher, but
there remain concerns about the relative
deprivation of some people and communities.
Population
The population of the United Kingdom was
estimated to be 58.8 million in mid-2001. This
estimate, which is based on results from the 2001
Census, indicates that the population is
approximately 1 million smaller than was
suggested by the estimates for mid-2000. It is very
difficult to get accurate information about people
leaving the country and this is thought to have
caused most of the discrepancy. Over the last 20
years more people have emigrated than was
previously thought, causing the population to
grow a little more slowly than expected.
Population projections, based on the previous
mid-2000 estimates, suggested that the population
of the UK might increase to nearly 65 million by
2025 and peak at almost 66 million in 2040 before
beginning a gradual decline.
Age and gender
The UK has an ageing population. Lower fertility
rates and lower mortality rates have both
contributed to this. In 2001 there were 10.8
million people over state pension age, and 11.9
million children aged under 16.
More boys are born each year than girls, and in
1981 men outnumbered women until around the
age of 48. Above this age there were increasingly
more women than men. Results from the 2001
Census indicate that women now outnumber men
from the age of 22. By age 90 and over there are
three times as many women as men. This reflects
the longer life expectancy of women. In 2001
projected average life expectancy at birth in the
Then and now - population
According to the 1951 Census, there were an
estimated 50.2 million people in the UK. Since then
the population has increased by 17 per cent. This
compares with an average growth for the EU of
23 per cent.
Some 8.3 million people were living in Greater
London in 1951. By the early 1990s this had fallen
to 6.9 million, but the population of the capital has
been increasing again and reached 7.2 million in
2001.
Over the last 50 years there has been a gradual
increase in the proportion of people over state
pension age and a fall in the proportion of working
age. In 1951, 14 per cent of the population were
over state pension age and 63 per cent were of
working age. By 2001, 18 per cent of the
population were over state pension age and 61 per
cent were of working age.

The ageing of the population is particularly evident
when the number of people aged 85 and over is
considered. In 1951 there were 0.2 million people in
this age group. This had grown to 1.1 million by 2001.

Then and now - births and deaths
Babies born in 2001 in the UK can expect to live an
average of nine years longer than their 1951
counterparts. Infant mortality rates (deaths of
infants under one year old per 1,000 live births) fell
by over 80 per cent between 1951 and 2001.

■ boys - 34 deaths per 1,000 live births
■ girls - 26 deaths per 1,000 live births
2001
■ boys - 6 deaths per 1,000 live births
■ girls - 5 deaths per 1,000 live births
Adult mortality
Over the same period the death rate for men aged
55-64 fell by 54 per cent, from 23.2 per 1,000 in
1951 to 10.6 per 1,000 in 2001. Among women of
the same age it fell by 49 per cent, from 12.9 to 6.6
per 1,000 women.
The 2001 Census
The 2001 Census was held on 29 April 2001 and is
estimated to have had a response rate of 94 per
cent in England and Wales. The first results - the
population on Census Day for each local authority
area by age and sex - were published at the end of
September 2002. The population of the UK on
Census Day 2001 was 58,789,194.
The release of more detailed results will start in
February 2003. Census reports and linked
publications will be available on the National
Statistics website and many will be part of the
Neighbourhood Statistics service (see page 98).
been a gradual reduction in the number of births
since 1990, when the figure was 798,000. In the last
50 years the highest number of births in any year
was in 1964, when there were over 1 million.
Over 604,000 deaths were registered in the UK in
2001, a crude death rate of 10.1 per 1,000
population. Despite population growth over the last
century the number of deaths has remained
relatively constant, due to large declines in mortality
rates. Rising standards of living and developments
in medical technology and practice help to explain
these declines. Death rates are higher for males than
females in all age groups, explaining some of the
gender imbalance among the older population.
Households and families
The number of households in Great Britain rose by
50 per cent between 1961 and 2002, from
16.3 million to 24.4 million. Many more people now
live alone: in spring 2002, 29 per cent of households
in Great Britain consisted of just one adult,
compared with 11 per cent in 1961 (see Table 9.2).
Most of the increase in one-person households since
1981 is attributable to people below pension age.
Despite the growth in the number of people living
alone, most households (57 per cent) are still
based on couples, although the proportion has
fallen from 74 per cent in 1961. These couple
households, however, are now less likely to contain
dependent children than in 1961 or 1981.
Lone parents with dependent children now
account for 6 per cent of households, compared
with 2 per cent in 1961. Lone parents have
increasingly become householders in their own

right: 40 years ago it would have been more
common for them to live with relatives.
Cohabitation, marriage and divorce
Patterns of partnership formation have also
changed. Most people still get married at some
stage, but the proportions who cohabit or live
outside a relationship have increased. It was
estimated that there were just over 1.5 million
cohabiting couples in England and Wales in 1996;
this number is projected to double by 2021.
Figures for Great Britain show that around 12 per
cent of adults aged 16 to 59 were cohabiting with
their partner in 2000/01. This was most likely
among men aged 25 to 34 and women aged 20 to
29. Cohabitation has become increasingly
common before marriage, although 14 per cent of
adults aged 16 to 59 reported at least one
cohabiting union that did not lead to marriage.
In 2000 there were 306,000 marriages in the UK, a
slight increase on the previous year’s figure of
301,000. Of the marriages that took place in 2000,
180,000 were first marriages for both partners,
almost half the number in 1950. First marriages
accounted for 81 per cent of all marriages in 1950
but only 59 per cent in 2000.
Around 155,000 divorces were granted in the UK
in 2000 - 14 per cent fewer than in 1993 (see
Figure 9.3). The divorce rate in England and Wales
peaked at 14.2 per 1,000 married people in 1993,
but has since fallen. The rate in 2000 was 12.7 per
1,000 married people, the lowest since 1984.

There were 766,000 conceptions in England and
Wales in 2000, a fall of 1 per cent from 1999.

9 The social framework
Registering vital events
Births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales
have been registered since 1837, The White Paper
Civil Registration: Vital Change, published by the
Government in January 2002, outlines plans to
modernise and improve the civil registration service.
These would:
■ enable people to register births and deaths
online, by telephone or in person at any register
office;
■ provide couples with more choice of where and
when to marry. It is currently possible to marry
in places approved by the relevant local
authority, such as hotels and stately homes. In
future, there would be standards and guidance
on suitable places for marriage ceremonies to
take place. These standards would cover
accessibility, health and safety, and maintain the
seemly and dignified nature of the ceremony.
The new proposals would also remove time
restrictions; currently weddings can only take
place between 8 am and 6 pm;
■ provide for new services, such as naming
ceremonies and reaffirmation of marriage vows;
and
■ create a central database of registrations of
births, marriages and deaths.
Similar proposals are being implemented in
Scotland.
Almost 80 per cent of these led to a maternity
(a live or still birth).
The UK fertility rate in 2000 was 55 live births per
1,000 women of childbearing age, a fall of 40 per
cent since 1961. Since the 1970s fertility rates have
been below the level needed for the long-term
natural replacement of the population. In England
and Wales women giving birth are now on average
three years older than those in the early 1970s - in
2001 the mean age of women at birth was 29.2
years, compared with 26.2 in 1972. In addition,
the proportion of women remaining childless has
risen. Sixteen per cent of women born in 1924
were still childless by the age of 45. It is projected
that over 20 per cent of women born in or after
1965 will remain childless.
Then and now - families
Britain 1952: An Official Handbook reported on
falling family sizes in comparison to Victorian
Britain. It was estimated that in the 1950s the
average number of children per family was 2.2.
Couples married in the mid-Victorian era had, on
average, five or six children. The decline was most
marked among those in the professional classes.
Average completed family size was expected to
continue declining and eventually to level off for
women born after 1970 at 1.8 children per woman.
Most children are born to married couples, but an
increasing proportion of births occur outside
marriage. Forty per cent of all births in the UK in
2001 occurred outside marriage, around four
times the proportion in 1971. Most of this growth
is accounted for by the increase in births to
cohabiting couples. Eighty-two per cent of births
outside marriage in England and Wales in 2001
were jointly registered by both parents. Over
three-quarters of these parents were living at the
same address. Teenage mothers are more likely to
give birth outside marriage - in England and
Wales 89 per cent of births to women under 20
were outside marriage. Twenty-six per cent of
births to teenage mothers were registered by the
mother alone, compared with only 4 per cent of
births to women in their late thirties or early forties.
Migration
Population movements occur both within the UK
and internationally. During the second half of the
20th century there was an internal movement of
population from the coal, shipbuilding and steel
industry areas in the north of England, Scotland
and Wales to the south of England and the
Midlands where the light industries and service
industries are based. Over the same period,
immigration from Commonwealth countries and
more recently by people seeking asylum increased
the cultural and religious diversity of the UK
population (see also chapter 15).
Internal migration
During the year to mid-2001, Wales and Scotland
gained 8,000 and 3,000 people respectively from
migration within the UK. England experienced
a net loss of 11,000 people, while the net change
in Northern Ireland was negligible. At a regional
level, the greatest fall in population occurred in

Nearly two-fifths of people leaving London for

Young adults are the most mobile age group.
Many people in their twenties leave their parental

19,000. The West Midlands experienced the
biggest net loss of people in this age group (over
4,000). London also experienced the largest net
losses among all the other age groups, particularly
those aged 35 to 44. The South West, East and
South East experienced the highest net gains in
this age group.
International migration
In the last 20 years net inward migration has
become an increasingly important factor in
population growth. Almost three-quarters of the
UK population increase between 1999 and 2000
was due to international migration. In 2000 an
estimated 183,000 more people migrated to the
UK than emigrated from the UK, almost double
the figure for 1997.
Immigration into the UK is largely governed by
the Immigration Act 1971. Rules made under this
Act set out the requirements to be met by those
who are subject to immigration control and seek
entry to, or leave to remain in, the UK. The 1971
Act has been amended by subsequent legislation,
including the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
In April 2002 the Government introduced
a Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill setting

out measures to reform the existing system. These
measures would:
■ require naturalisation applicants to
demonstrate knowledge of the English
language and life in the UK;
■ introduce a citizenship ceremony, including
a citizenship pledge (see page 92);
■ create a system of accommodation centres for
asylum seekers, with new arrangements for
detention, temporary release and removal;
and
■ tackle fraud, including a 14-year penalty for
people-trafficking or for facilitating illegal
entry to the UK.
In 2001, 106,800 people were accepted for
settlement, 18,300 fewer than in 2000 (see Table
9.5). Asia, which accounted for 40 per cent of total
acceptances in 2001, was the leading region,
followed by Africa and then Europe.
Under the Immigration Rules, nationals of certain
countries must obtain a visa before they can enter
the UK. Other nationals, subject to immigration
control, require entry clearance when coming to
work or settle in the UK. Visas and other entry
clearances are normally obtained from the nearest
Highly skilled migrant programme
Under this programme, skilled individuals who are
not British citizens can apply to come to the UK to
seek work. Applications are assessed on a points-
based system in the following areas:
■ educational qualifications;
■ work experience;
■ past earnings;
■ achievement in a chosen field; and
■ a special category for overseas doctors wishing
to work as general practitioners in the UK.

Iceland and Liechtenstein - are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may work
in the UK without restriction. Provided they are
working or able to support themselves financially,
EEA nationals have a right to reside in the UK.
Asylum
The UK has a tradition of giving asylum to those
in need of protection, and is a signatory to the
1951 United Nations Convention, and its 1967
Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. These
provide that lawful residents who have been
granted refugee status should enjoy treatment at
least as favourable as that accorded to the
indigenous population.
In the late 1980s applications for asylum (based on
the principal applicant) started to rise sharply from
around 4,000 a year in 1985 to 1988, to 44,800 in
1991, and reached a record 80,300 in 2000. There
were 71,400 applications in 2001, an 11 per cent
drop on the 2000 level. The main nationalities
applying for asylum in the UK in 2001 were:
■ Afghanistan (9,000 applicants);
■ Iraq (6,700 applicants);
■ Somalia (6,500 applicants);
■ Sri Lanka (5,500 applicants); and
■ Turkey (3,700 applicants).
In the first six months of 2002 applications for
asylum averaged 6,655 a month. This was 15 per
cent higher than in the same period a year earlier.
An estimated 119,000 initial asylum decisions
were made in 2001, a 9 per cent rise on the
number in 2000 and more than three-and-a-half
times the number in 1999, reflecting a drop in the
backlog of cases. In 2001, 10 per cent of these
decisions were grants of asylum, compared with
12 per cent in 2000. A further 17 per cent of
decisions in 2001 were grants of exceptional leave
to remain and 73 per cent of applicants were
refused. Many failed asylum seekers appeal against
their refusal decision. Independent adjudicators
determined 43,400 appeals in 2001, more than
double the number in 2000. Of these, 8,200 (19
per cent) were successful.

Social and cultural affairs
9 The social framework
Since April 2000 the National Asylum Support
Service has been responsible for the provision of
support for those asylum seekers who are destitute.
Support is provided until the asylum claim is finally
decided. Those granted refugee status or
exceptional leave to remain on humanitarian
grounds are entitled to claim public funds.
Until April 2002 support for people seeking
asylum took the form of vouchers. This system
has now been amended and the vouchers replaced
with cash benefits; a single adult aged 25 or over
receives approximately £38 a week. Accommodation
may also be provided to destitute asylum seekers.
This is on a ‘no choice’ basis at one of a number of
centres throughout the UK. Prior to July 2002
asylum seekers could apply for the right to work
after six months if their asylum application was
still outstanding; if they found work the cash
benefits were stopped. A reduction in the time
taken to make initial asylum decisions meant that
this concession was rarely used and it has now
been abolished. Children of compulsory school
age in families seeking asylum are entitled to
attend school, and all asylum seekers and their
dependants are eligible to receive free healthcare.
Legal advice for asylum seekers is available from
immigration law advisers and firms of solicitors
contracted to provide immigration services under
the Community Legal Services Fund (formerly the
Legal Aid scheme). They provide advice on the
initial claim and any appeal.
Citizenship
Under the British Nationality Act 1981, there are
three forms of citizenship:
■ British citizenship for people closely
connected with the UK, the Channel Islands
or the Isle of Man;
■ British Dependent Territories citizenship, for
people connected with the dependent
territories (now commonly referred to as
‘Overseas Territories’ - see page 66); and
■ British Overseas citizenship, for those citizens
of the UK and Colonies without connections
with either the UK or dependent territories.
British citizens have the right to live permanently
in the UK and are free to leave and re-enter the
country at any time. British citizenship is acquired
Economic effects of migration
In February 2002 the Home Office published
research on the impact of migrants to the UK on the
public purse. The main findings of the report were:
■ In 1999/2000 migrants made a net fiscal
contribution to the Exchequer estimated at £2.5
billion, paying an estimated £31.2 billion in
taxes and receiving £28.8 billion in benefits and

becoming British citizens:
'I, [name], swear by Almighty God that, on
becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear
true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the
Second, Her Heirs and Successors according to the
law.'
Proposed citizenship pledge:

respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its
democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully
and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British
citizen.'

Entitlement cards
In July 2002 the Home Office published
a consultation paper to assess public opinion on
entitlement cards. These cards would be used as
proof of identity for people who are legally resident
in the UK. Entitlement cards may be useful in
combating identity fraud, which the Cabinet Office
has estimated costs the UK economy more than
£1.3 billion a year, and illegal immigration. This
consultation will last for six months and aims to
consider the different types of card that could be
introduced, the information they may hold, and
issues of cost, effectiveness and the risk of abuse.

In 2001, 90,300 people were granted British
citizenship in the UK, compared with 82,200 in
2000. Of the applications in 2001, 9,500 were
refused, 2,700 more than in 2000. One in three
successful applications were from citizens of
countries in Africa, with the Indian subcontinent
accounting for 26 per cent and Europe about 12 per
cent (see Figure 9.6). Residence in the UK continued
to be the most frequent basis on which people were
granted British citizenship in 2001, amounting to 40
per cent of the total, while marriage to a British
citizen accounted for 30 per cent.
Ethnicity and identity
For centuries people from overseas have settled in
the UK, either to escape political or religious
persecution or in search of better economic
opportunities. Irish people have a long history of
migration and many Jewish refugees arrived
towards the end of the 19th century and in the
1930s. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent dates
principally from the 1950s and 1960s, when the
Government encouraged immigration to tackle
labour shortages. Many people of south Asian
descent also entered the UK from Kenya, Malawi
and Uganda in the 1960s and 1970s.
The Labour Force Survey estimated that over the
period 2001-02 around 4.5 million people in
Great Britain (8 per cent) described themselves
as belonging to an ethnic group other than
‘White’. In general, minority ethnic groups tend
to have a younger age profile than the White
population, reflecting past immigration and
fertility patterns.
In 2001-02, 97 per cent of people from minority
ethnic groups in the UK lived in England, with
relatively small numbers in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Thirty-eight per cent of the
total minority ethnic population lived in Greater
London, where they comprised 28 per cent of the
population. However, the extent to which
individual ethnic groups were concentrated in
London varied considerably; for example, 76 per
cent of people of Black African origin lived in the
capital compared with 20 per cent of people of
Pakistani origin.
The classification of ethnic groups
The recommended classification of ethnic groups for
National Statistics data sources has been changed
to bring it in line with the 2001 Census.
There are two levels to this classification. The first
level is a broad classification into five groups: White;
Mixed; Asian or Asian British; Black or Black British;
and Chinese or other ethnic background. The second
level is a more detailed classification: for example,
the Asian or Asian British group is subdivided into
Indian; Pakistani; Bangladeshi; and other Asian
background.

Statistics website at:

Outside London there were relatively high
concentrations of people of Indian origin in
Leicester, Wolverhampton and Birmingham, and
of Pakistani origin in Birmingham, Greater
Manchester and West Yorkshire.
Race equality issues
Many people from minority ethnic groups are
concentrated in the inner cities of the UK, a
number of which have problems of deprivation
and social disadvantage. Unemployment rates for
some minority groups are well above the national
average (see page 124).
However there are some wide variations between
ethnic groups. For example, people of Indian
ethnic origin are more likely to own their own
homes than either White people or people from
other minority ethnic groups; 81 per cent were
owner occupiers over the period 1998-2001 in
England, compared with 34 per cent of people of
Bangladeshi origin. Young people of Indian origin
are also more likely than White people or those
from other minority ethnic groups to achieve five
or more GCSE grades A* to C. In 2000, in
England and Wales, 60 per cent of 16 year old
school pupils of Indian origin achieved these
grades, compared with 50 per cent of White pupils
and 29 per cent of those from both the Pakistani
and Bangladeshi groups.
The percentage of people from minority ethnic
groups in professional and managerial positions is
increasing. Over 25 per cent of men of Indian
origin were employed at this level in 2000; this is
very similar to the percentage of White men.
Twelve MPs from minority ethnic groups were
elected in July 2001 and in May 2002 a Black
cabinet minister was appointed for the first time.
The Home Office has overall responsibility in the
Government for policy and legislation on racial
equality. Extra resources may be channelled into
specific projects, for example, to provide specialist
teachers for children needing English language
tuition. The Government also promotes equal
opportunities through training programmes, for
example through projects for unemployed people
who need training in English as an additional
language. The Northern Ireland Executive has set
up a unit to promote equal opportunities and
good relations between people of different ethnic
backgrounds.
Race relations legislation
In Great Britain the Race Relations Act 1976, as
amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act
2000, makes it unlawful for anybody to
discriminate on grounds of race, colour,
nationality (including citizenship), or ethnic or
national origins (referred to as ‘racial grounds’).
The Race Relations Act 1976 applies to
employment, training, education and the
Community cohesion
Following disturbances over the summer of 2001 in
a number of towns and cities in the north of
England, including Oldham and Bradford, the Home
Office published an official report identifying the
problems common to these communities. These
included poverty and deprivation, and a failure to
understand people from different backgrounds,
religions or cultures. The report made a number of
recommendations and proposed that there should
be an honest and open national debate in order to
develop shared principles on the rights and
responsibilities of citizenship.
94
Social and cultural affairs
9 The social framework
provision of goods and services. Legislation along
similar lines was introduced in Northern Ireland
in 1977.
The Race Relations (Amendment) Act extended the
scope of the 1976 Act to cover the way public
authorities carry out all their functions. The Act
now gives certain listed public authorities a
statutory general duty to work to eliminate
unlawful discrimination and promote equal
opportunities and good relations between people
of different racial groups. Most of the listed
authorities also have specific duties to fulfil,
including publishing a race equality scheme to
explain how they will meet the general and
specific duties. There are also specific duties to
monitor staff and applicants for jobs, promotion
and training, by ethnic group. The Commission
for Racial Equality (CRE) (see below) enforces the
specific duties. It published a statutory code of
practice in May 2002 to help public authorities to
meet the new duties.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created racially
aggravated versions of a number of existing
offences in England and Wales, including assault,
criminal damage and harassment. These racially
aggravated offences carry a higher maximum
penalty. Other provisions in criminal law prohibit
incitement to racial hatred and the publication or
dissemination of material that is likely to incite
racial hatred.
Commission for Racial Equality
The CRE was set up under the Race Relations Act
1976, with the duty to tackle racial discrimination
and promote equal opportunities and good race
relations in Great Britain. In 2001 around 10,000
people contacted the CRE for advice and 1,200
made formal applications for assistance. The
Commission has the power to investigate unlawful
discriminatory practices and to issue non¬
discrimination notices, requiring such practices to
stop. It also has an important role in promoting
racial equality and funds research. In Northern
Ireland equivalent responsibilities rest with the
Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, whose
remit covers other types of unlawful
discrimination.
In 2001/02 the CRE supported the work of 95
racial equality councils in Great Britain. These are
voluntary bodies, jointly funded by the CRE and
local authorities to promote good race relations
locally.
Equal opportunities
Employment and income
The economic and domestic lives of women
have changed considerably over time, and
women have taken an increasingly important role
in the labour market. In 1971, 56 per cent of
women of working age, compared with 91 per
cent of men, were economically active in the UK.
By spring 2002 the rate for women had increased
to 73 per cent of women of working age, while the
rate for men had declined to 84 per cent. The
number of women in the UK labour force
increased from 10 million in 1971 to nearly
13 million in spring 2002.
In spring 2002, almost 70 per cent of women were
in employment. The likelihood of being in
employment varied considerably according to
whether or not they had dependent children.
Employment rates were lowest for those with
a child under the age of five, at 53 per cent.
There is still a gap between male and female
earnings, although this has been declining (see
Figure 9.8). Female full-time employees earned
around 82 per cent of the male hourly rate in
2001. The average individual total weekly income1
of men was higher than that of women in all age
bands in 2000/01. Among women those aged 25 to
29 had the highest average income, whereas
income peaked in the 35 to 44 age group for men.
Overall, women’s weekly income was only 49 per
cent of that of men.
These gender differences in income are largely due
to differences in working hours and occupation.
Women tend to work shorter hours than men and
are more likely to work part time. They are also
more likely to take career breaks. Pay rates are
considerably lower in sectors dominated by
women. In spring 2002 women employees
outnumbered men in administrative and
secretarial occupations by nearly four to one, and
more than twice as many men were managers and
senior officials (see page 127).
Despite women’s increasing participation in the
labour market they still do the majority of the
housework and childcare. Recent ONS research
looked at time spent on these activities and

estimated the time spent on passive care2 of adults
and children. Fifty-nine per cent of all the time
spent on housework and care of others in the UK
was done by women. The type of household work
undertaken by women and men also differed;
women spent more time preparing meals and
washing and ironing clothes, while men were
more likely to undertake DIY and gardening.
Equal opportunities policy
There are two Ministers for Women, supported by
the Women and Equality Unit (WEU) in the
Department of Trade and Industry. They are
responsible for a wide range of gender equality
issues in Government, including issues of sexual
orientation. The WEU’s projects include:
■ aiming to increase women’s participation in
the labour market, including developing
policies which support flexible working and
are family friendly;
■ aiming to reduce the gender pay gap;
■ reviewing the existing equality legislation on
gender, race, age, beliefs, sexual orientation
and disability; and
■ aiming to reduce domestic violence.
2 This refers to time when an adult is not interacting directly with a
child or helping another adult, but they are still responsible or 'on
call'.
The Scottish Executive has established an Equality
Unit to take forward its work in this area. The
Northern Ireland Executive has set up a Gender
Policy Unit to promote equality between men and
women, people of different sexual orientation,
people with and without dependants and people
of different marital status.
Equal opportunities legislation
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which applies in
Great Britain, makes discrimination between men
and women unlawful in employment, education,
training and the provision of housing, goods,
facilities and services. Discrimination in
employment against married people and
discriminatory job recruitment advertisements are
also unlawful. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970,
women and men are entitled to equal pay when
doing work that is the same, or broadly similar,
work which is rated as equivalent, or work which
is of equal value. Parallel legislation on sex
discrimination and equal pay applies in Northern
Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), set
up under the 1975 Act in Great Britain, is an
independent statutory body which has the powers
to:
■ work towards the elimination of
discrimination on the grounds of sex or
marriage;
■ promote equality of opportunity between
women and men;
■ review, and propose amendments to, the Sex
Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act-, and
■ provide legal advice and assistance to
individuals who have been discriminated
against.
The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland
tackles discrimination and promotes gender
equality in Northern Ireland. The remit of this
Commission also includes race, religious and
political beliefs, age, marital status, sexual
orientation, disability and people with
dependants.
The Government is currently reviewing the
possibility of merging the Equal Opportunities
Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality
and the Disability Rights Commission to form

9 The social framework
a single equality body in Great Britain, responsible
for the promotion of equality in relation to sex,
race, disability, sexual orientation, religion and
age. Changes are unlikely to take place before the
next General Election.
Disability Rights Commission
The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) was
established in 2000 in Great Britain following the
Disability Rights Commission Act 1999. It is an
independent body with statutory duties to provide
information and advice to disabled people and
employers on their rights and duties under the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995. It gives
employers guidance on how to meet these duties
and undertakes formal investigations into
unlawful discrimination. The DRC promotes
equal opportunities for disabled people and
advises the Government on the working of the
disability legislation.
Under the Disability Rights Commission Act,
businesses have a duty to make reasonable
adjustments to the way they provide services to
the public, changing their policies, practices and
procedures where reasonable. From 2004 service
providers will have to take reasonable steps to
remove, alter or provide reasonable means of
avoiding physical features that make it impossible
or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to
use their services. A Code of Practice on the rights
of access that businesses and services must afford
disabled people was issued by the DRC in May
2002. The code also provides practical guidance
and information.
Living standards
The trend in the UK’s standard of living, using
gross domestic product (GDP) per head at
constant market prices as an indicator, has
generally been one of steady growth over the last
50 years. Since 1995 the annual rate of growth has
been in a relatively narrow range, from 1.9 per
cent to 3.1 per cent.
Real household disposable income (the total
resources available to households after
deductions) more than quadrupled between 1951
and 2001. There was a rise of 6.5 per cent in 2001,
which was above the long-term annual average
rise of 3.1 per cent between 1991 and 2001 and
the strongest rise since 1978.
The wealth of the household sector3 in the UK, net
of any loans outstanding, including those on the
purchase of assets such as housing, has shown
strong growth in recent years. It rose in real terms
by an average of 4.6 per cent a year between 1987
and 2000, although there was a fall in 2001. In
terms of value, at the end of 2001 the household
sector’s net worth totalled £4,573 billion: £2,562
billion of non-fmancial assets, of which residential
dwellings accounted for 83 per cent, and £2,011
billion of financial assets. During 2001 the value
of residential dwellings (excluding housing
association properties) rose by 8 per cent, in
contrast to household net financial wealth which
fell by 16 per cent, reflecting the effect of weak
equity markets (see page 462) on holdings of
shares, life assurance and pension funds.
Although there have been substantial long-term
improvements in the standard of living, there
remain concerns about the relative deprivation of
some people and communities. The distribution
of income and wealth is uneven. For example, the
latest available figures show that:
■ the average original income of the top fifth of
households in 2000/01 of £55,700 was 18
times the average of the bottom fifth, £3,100.
Benefits and, to a lesser extent, taxes reduce
this inequality so that the ratio for final
income is four to one;
■ in 2000/01, 17 per cent of the population of
Great Britain lived in households with low
income,4 before housing costs are taken into
account, although this has fallen since the
peak of 21 per cent in 1992. Lone parents,
pensioners and children are more likely to
live in a low-income household than people
of working age who do not have children;
and
■ the most wealthy 10 per cent of the
population of the UK owned 54 per cent of
marketable wealth in 2000, or 72 per cent of
marketable wealth excluding the value of
dwellings.
3 Including non-profit institutions serving households.
4 Low income is defined as below 60 per cent of the median
equivalised household disposable income - a measure in which
household disposable income is adjusted to take account of the
size and composition of the household.

9 The social framework
Social exclusion
Social exclusion is a term used to describe
individuals or areas suffering from a combination
of linked problems, such as unemployment, lack
of skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime,
bad health and family breakdown.
The Social Exclusion Unit (SEU), based in the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was set up in
1997 to reduce social exclusion in England by
working with government departments and external
organisations. It also liaises with the Scottish, Welsh
and Northern Ireland administrations, which have
their own strategies for tackling social exclusion.
The SEU is currently working on projects looking at
young runaways, children in care and education,
transport and social exclusion, and reducing re¬
offending by ex-prisoners. Previously published
reports have led to new policies to tackle, for
example, truancy, rough sleeping, teenage pregnancy
and neighbourhood renewal.
Neighbourhood renewal
The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit (NRU), based
in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was
set up in April 2001 to implement government
strategies to tackle unemployment, poor
educational achievement, poor health, inadequate
housing and crime in England’s most deprived
communities. The NRU aims to narrow the gap
between deprived areas and the rest of the
country, so that within 10 to 20 years no one
should be seriously disadvantaged by where he or
she lives. The Scottish Executive and the Welsh
Assembly Government have established similar
initiatives. These programmes focus on the most
deprived communities in their parts of the UK
and try to ensure that these communities play a
role in their own regeneration.
These problems in unemployment, educational
achievement, health, housing and crime are also
Neighbourhood Statistics
Neighbourhood Statistics
{www.statistics.gov.uk/neighbourhood) was created
as part of the National Strategy for Neighbourhood
Renewal. In partnership with many government
departments, it provides a web-based statistical
service to supply information to tackle local issues
of deprivation. The core of this information resource
will be the 2001 Census, expanded by other data
held across the public sector.
being monitored through the Government’s
sustainable development strategy (see page 268),
using quality of life indicators linked to each of
these aspects of poverty and social exclusion.
Social participation
There are over 500,000 voluntary and community
groups across the UK, ranging from national and
international bodies to small local groups. An
increasing number of public services are delivered
by voluntary organisations on behalf of the
Government. The 2002 Spending Review (see page
350) allocated £125 million for the creation of
a new investment fund to help voluntary and
community organisations in their public service
work.
In September 2002 the Treasury completed
a review of the role of this sector in the delivery of
public services. This review recommended
a number of ways in which the Government could
work more effectively with these organisations, for
example by:
■ involving voluntary and community
organisations in the planning, as well as
delivery, of services;
■ moving to a more stable funding relationship
and ensuring that the sector is equipped to
work effectively in partnership with
government; and
■ ensuring that the cost of contracts for services
reflects the full cost of delivery.
The Government’s voluntary and community
policies will be implemented by the Active
Community Unit at the Home Office.
Volunteering
Many voluntary and community organisations are
involved in activities that improve the quality of
life in the local community, working in areas as
diverse as social welfare, education, sport, heritage,
the environment and the arts.
Thirty-nine per cent of adults in England and
Wales interviewed in the Home Office’s 2001
Citizenship Survey had formally volunteered
(giving unpaid help to a group or organisation)
in the previous 12 months. A quarter of adults did

this at least once a month. These volunteers were
most likely to have raised money (22 per cent of
respondents) or organised or helped at an
activity or event (21 per cent). Sixty-seven per
cent of adults had volunteered informally (giving
unpaid help to an individual who was not a family
member) in the previous 12 months. A third did
this at least once a month. Informal volunteers
were most likely to have given someone advice
(31 per cent) or have looked after their property
or pets while they were away (28 per cent).
People living in the least deprived areas of
England were most likely to volunteer, formally or
informally, while those living in the most deprived
areas were least likely to volunteer (see Table 9.9).
Almost half of people living in the least deprived
areas formally volunteered compared with under a
third from the most deprived areas.
The Government is keen to encourage links
between the statutory, voluntary and community
sectors. The Youth Service is a partnership
between local government and voluntary
organisations concerned with the informal
personal and social education of young people
aged 11 to 25 (5 to 25 in Northern Ireland). Local
authorities manage their own youth centres and
clubs and provide most of the public support for
local and regional organisations.
Charities
The Charity Commission is the statutory
organisation responsible for the registration,
regulation and support of organisations that are
charitable under the law of England and Wales. It
does not make grants, but advises trustees about
administrative matters and has a statutory
responsibility to ensure that charities make
effective use of their resources.
In 2001/02, over 9,400 applications were received
for registration from organisations, of which 5,200
were accepted and placed on the Public Register of
Charities. There were approximately 186,000
registered charities in England and Wales at the
end of March 2002. Many other charitable
organisations are not required to register, for
example some churches and schools. Charities
elsewhere in the UK are not required to register
with a government organisation, but do need to
seek recognition of their charitable status with the
Inland Revenue, for tax purposes.
To become a registered charity in England and
Wales an organisation must have purposes that are
exclusively philanthropic, such as:
■ the relief of financial hardship;
■ the advancement of education;
■ the advancement of religion; or
■ other charitable purposes for the benefit of
the community, such as the promotion of
urban and rural regeneration or the relief of
unemployment.
The Charity Commission has the power to
investigate and supervise charities, including
measures to protect both charities and donors from
fraudulent fund-raisers. One of the Commission’s
duties is to investigate allegations of fraud or
dishonesty and evaluate them for cause for concern;
1,300 evaluations were carried out in 2001/02. Such
evaluations can lead to formal inquiries: over 200 of
these were completed during the same period.
Funding
At the end of March 2002, the total annual income
of all registered charities in England and Wales
was estimated at £27.8 billion. Approximately
6 per cent of registered charities receive nearly
90 per cent of the total annual income recorded,
while around 63 per cent have an income of
£10,000 or less a year and account for less than
1 per cent of the annual total. In 2000/01 the
average weekly donation made to charity was
£1.80 per household in the UK.

Voluntary organisations may receive income from
several sources, including:
■ central and local government grants;
■ contributions from individuals, businesses
and trusts;
■ earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
■ fees from central and local government for
services provided on a contractual basis.
The introduction of the National Lottery (see page
263) in 1994 has given charities and voluntary
organisations substantial funding for projects
across a range of activities. Another valuable
source of revenue for charities is through tax relief
and tax exemptions. The Gift Aid scheme provides
tax relief on one-off and regular cash donations of
any amount, while under the Payroll Giving
scheme employees and those drawing a company
pension can make tax-free donations from their
earnings. In 2001/02, over 0.5 million PAYE
employees gave in this manner, giving over £72.5
million, almost double the amount two years
earlier. In addition, gifts of listed stocks and
shares, and gifts of land and property can now be
offset against income for tax purposes.
The Charities Aid Foundation (CAP) is a
registered charity that works to increase resources
for the voluntary sector in the UK and overseas.
As well as providing services that are both
charitable and financial, CAP undertakes
a comprehensive programme of research and is
a leading source of information on the voluntary
sector.

Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive full-time education between the
ages of 5 and 16 in Great Britain and between 4
and 16 in Northern Ireland. About 70 per cent of
young people in the United Kingdom choose to
stay in full-time education after this age, either in
school or further education colleges. Around 8 per
cent of 16 year olds in Great Britain are on
government training programmes. About a third
of all young people enter universities or other
institutions of higher education.
Increasing emphasis is being placed on lifelong
learning as a way of creating skills and improving
employment prospects in a changing labour
market. If people are to move more frequently
between jobs and careers they will need to be able
to change and update their qualifications and skills.
Pre-school children
Pre-school education is expanding considerably in
order to ensure that all children begin school with
a basic foundation in literacy and numeracy. The
proportion of three and four year olds enrolled in
UK schools rose from 23 per cent in 1971/72 to 63
per cent in 2001/02 (see Figure 10.1). In 2001/02 a
further 30 per cent were enrolled in non¬
education settings, such as playgroups, in the
private and voluntary sectors.
Childcare
It is recognised that there is a need for good
quality affordable childcare for working parents.
To meet this need childcare strategies have been
implemented across the United Kingdom.
In England, since 1998, all four year olds have
been guaranteed a free, part-time early education
place if their parents want one. In 2002, 70 per
cent of three year olds had a place and the aim is
to provide a place for all of this age group by
September 2004.
The Welsh Assembly Government is committed to
expanding provision for three year olds. The
Scottish Executive has set a number of targets,
which include making a nursery place available to
every three year old by autumn 2002, training
more childcare workers and expanding provision
outside schools.
In Northern Ireland the aim is to provide a year of
pre-school education for every child whose
parents wish them to have one by March 2003. A
phased expansion programme has already
increased free provision from 45 per cent in
1997/98 to 85 per cent in 2001/02.

Sure Start
In the UK Sure Start projects aim to improve the
health and well-being of families and children
before and from birth. They are concentrated in
areas where a high proportion of children live in
poverty. Locally based programmes work with
parents and children to try to improve children’s
life chances through better access to family
support, advice on nurturing, health services and
early learning. Good practice learned from local
programmes is disseminated to others involved in
providing services for young children.
In England the aim is to establish 500 local
programmes by 2004, covering 400,000 children.
By July 2002, 522 programmes had been
announced, 300 of which were under way. In
Wales there are programmes in all 22 local
authority areas. Northern Ireland had 23 projects
by March 2001. Scotland has implemented Sure
Start differently and funds all 32 local authorities
to work in partnership with health services and
voluntary organisations. Sure Start Scotland was
implemented in 1999 and by 2000/01 over 15,000
additional children had received support, as had
over 6,000 parents.
Integrated early education and
childcare services
The distinction between early education and
childcare is becoming less significant with the
growth of extended or full day, integrated services
which best fit the shape of parents’ lives. In
England the Government has decided to bring
together the responsibility for Sure Start, childcare
and early years within one inter-departmental
unit, and establish children’s centres at the heart of
some of the most disadvantaged communities
(see page 148). It expects that by 2006 up to
650,000 children will be covered by children’s
centre services.
Schools
About 94 per cent of pupils in the UK receive free
education from public funds, while 6 per cent
attend independent fee paying schools.
State schools
In England and Wales state schools are classified
into three broad categories. Community schools
consist mainly of schools that were traditionally
owned and funded by Local Education Authorities
(LEAs). Foundation schools include many of the
former grant maintained schools. Voluntary
schools are divided into controlled and aided, of
which many are connected to a particular
religious faith. LEAs are responsible for employing
staff and for admission arrangements in
controlled schools and the governing body
performs this role in aided schools. In England in
2001, in the primary and secondary sectors, there
were 13,642 community schools, 854 foundation
schools and 7,059 voluntary schools. These
categories include state specialist and special
schools. There are 1,851 state primary and
secondary schools in Wales (excluding special
schools).
In Scotland, there are 2,845 state schools managed
by local authorities, nine grant aided schools, and
one self-governing school.
In Northern Ireland all schools must be open to
all religions. In practice, however, most Protestant
children attend one of the 641 controlled schools,
managed by education and library boards, while
most Catholic children attend one of the 540
voluntary maintained schools. There are, in
addition 54 voluntary grammar schools (which
tend to be Catholic or non-denominational in
character). The 46 integrated schools aim to
educate Catholic and Protestant children together;
these schools are controlled or grant maintained.
The Government has a statutory duty to
encourage integrated education as a way of
breaking down sectarian barriers. Publicly
financed schools can apply to become integrated,
following a majority vote by parents.

10 Education and training
Independent schools
Independent schools are not funded by the state
and obtain most of their finances from fees paid
by parents. Some of the larger independent
boarding schools are known as ‘public schools’. In
2001/02 there were 2,156 independent schools in
England, 56 in Wales, 122 in Scotland and 25 in
Northern Ireland. Independent schools providing
full-time education for five or more pupils of
compulsory school age are required to register
with the appropriate government department and
are subject to inspection.
The Independent Schools Council (ISC)
represents the seven independent schools’
associations in the United Kingdom and has
overall responsibility for the Independent Schools
Inspectorate (ISI). In England and Wales the ISI
inspects schools in the ISC every five or six years,
using criteria approved by OFSTED and Estyn
(see page 120) and the Government. Independent
schools have to pass an inspection to qualify for
membership of an association within ISC. All
other independent schools are inspected by the
relevant national inspectorates.
In England, the Independent/State School
Partnership (ISSP) Scheme, set up in 1997, aims to
encourage the sharing of experience and good
practice. The fifth round of ISSP included a
package of £778,000 which will fund 32 new
projects in 2002/03. In 2002/03, as well as general
projects, the scheme is funding projects which
specifically focus on citizenship and on music, and
projects aimed at gifted and talented pupils.
Specialist schools
The Government wishes to increase the number of
specialist schools in the belief that this will raise
standards and promote diversity in secondary
education. Specialist schools meet the full national
curriculum requirements (see page 105), but focus
on a chosen specialism. Any maintained secondary
school in England can apply to be designated as a
specialist school in one of the following subject
areas: technology, languages, sports, arts, science,
engineering, business and enterprise, or
mathematics and computing. Schools can also
combine two specialisms. The Government has set
a target to increase the number of specialist schools
from 685 in 2001/02 to 2,000 by 2006.
Special educational needs
A child is said to have special educational needs
(SEN) if he or she has significantly greater

difficulty in learning than other children of the
same age, or a disability which makes it difficult to
use normal educational facilities. Each SEN child
has the right to receive a broad and balanced
education. State schools must publish information
for parents about their SEN policy. In England, a
new SEN Code of Practice came into force in
January 2002. It includes new rights and duties
introduced by the Special Educational Needs and
Disability Act 2001 and associated regulations. In
December 2001 a SEN Code of Practice for Wales
was published and came into effect in April 2002.
In Northern Ireland legislation similar to the 2001
Act will be introduced following consultation.
In the UK in 2000/01 approximately 1.9 million
pupils were identified as having special
educational needs. If an education authority or
board believes that it should determine the
education for an SEN child, it must draw up a
formal statement of the child’s special needs and
the action it intends to meet them. About 300,800
children with SEN have these statements (called
Record of Needs in Scotland). Parents have a right
of appeal if they disagree with decisions about
their child. Over 60 per cent of SEN pupils with
statements are educated in mainstream schools
while most of the others are educated in special
schools.
Secondary schools
In 2001/02 around 88 per cent of the 3.3 million
state secondary pupils in England and all 212,000
pupils in Wales attended comprehensive schools.
104
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
These largely take pupils without reference to
ability or aptitude, providing a wide range of
secondary education for all or most of the
children in a district.
Scottish state secondary education is also non-
selective, without reference to ability or aptitude.
In 2001/02, 96 per cent of pupils attended state
secondary schools and 4 per cent (17,635)
independent schools.
Secondary education in Northern Ireland is
organised largely on selective lines, with grammar
schools admitting pupils on the basis of‘11-plus’
tests in English, mathematics and science. In
2001/02, 62,743 pupils attended grammar schools
(40 per cent of secondary pupils), of whom 9,247
were being educated in integrated schools. The
Burns Report, a review of post-primary education
in Northern Ireland, was published in October
2001. The main proposal was for the abolition of
the 11-plus and the ending of academic selection,
which has been part of the education system in
Northern Ireland since 1947. Following public
consultation, the minister for education intends
to bring forward proposals for change in post¬
primary education arrangements in autumn
2002.
Raising standards
City Technology Colleges
There are 15 City Technology Colleges situated in
urban areas across England. They are state-funded
independent schools run by private sponsors,
operating outside the normal local government
framework. They provide free education for 11 to
16 year olds in inner city areas with a curriculum
focusing on science and technology.
City Academies
City Academies are publicly funded independent
schools in England. They replace schools in
challenging circumstances or are set up as part of
a wider school reorganisation or where there is an
unmet demand for school places. Sponsors from
the private and voluntary sectors, church and
other faith groups help to set up and run these
schools. They provide free education to secondary
age pupils of all abilities, including provision for
children with special educational needs.
Academies aim to offer a broad and balanced
curriculum, including a specialism. By the end of
July 2002 there were 22 partnerships working to
establish academies. The first three opened in
September 2002. The Education Act 2002 (see page
118) extends the City Academy model into rural
areas, and allows for all-age, primary and sixth
form Academies. The Government intends to set
up at least 33 Academies in England by 2006.
Other initiatives
Excellence in Cities (EiC) tackles educational
problems facing children in English cities. Local
partnerships implement the EiC programme and
focus on the needs and aspirations of individual
pupils and their parents. The programme includes
about 1,000 secondary schools and one-third of
all secondary age pupils, and some 1,000 primary
schools.
The Beacon Schools initiative is intended to raise
standards by sharing and spreading good practice.
The initiative is supporting schools in the most
under-achieving areas. By September 2002 there
were 1,150 Beacon Schools in England of which
451 were in EiC areas.
Education Action Zones have been formed in
deprived areas in order to help raise educational
standards. Zones are built around groups of about
15 to 25 schools. An action forum runs each zone.
In 2002 there were 2,109 schools with 765,909
pupils participating in 175 zones.
International comparisons
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s (OECD - see page 63) Programme
for International Student Assessment assesses the
ability of 15 year olds to apply knowledge and
skills in three broad areas: reading, mathematics
and science. The OECD mean scores for each area
were set at 500. The mean scores for the UK in
2000 were significantly higher than for the OECD
as a whole (see Table 10.4). Within the EU,
Finland was the top performing country in all
areas; the UK was second for mathematics and
science and third for reading.
Curriculum
All state schools in the UK must provide religious
education, but parents have the right to withdraw
their children from these classes. In Northern
Ireland the main churches have approved a core
syllabus for religious education, which must be
taught in all grant-aided schools.

All state secondary schools in the UK are required
to provide sex education for all pupils, including
education about HIV/AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Children follow the National Curriculum in
England and Wales and the Northern Ireland
Curriculum in Northern Ireland. The curricula
contain programmes of study for age groups split
into key stages (see Table 10.5). These stages
outline what pupils should be taught and set out
expected standards of performance. There are four
key stages covering the ages of compulsory
schooling. Key stages 1 and 2 are studied in
primary schools, and stages 3 and 4 in secondary
school.
Subjects such as drama, dance and classical
languages are optional. It is intended that over
time every primary school child should have the
opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument
and explore one of a range of sports.
Scotland
There is no statutory national curriculum in
Scotland. There are five national priorities in
education set out under the following headings:
■ achievement and attainment;
■ framework for learning;

■ inclusion and equality;
■ values and citizenship; and
■ learning for life.
The content and management of the curriculum
are the responsibility of educational authorities
and individual headteachers. National guidelines
for pupils aged 5 to 14 set out the ground to be
covered and the way pupils’ learning should be
assessed and reported.
There are curriculum guidelines for languages,
mathematics, ICT, environmental studies,
expressive arts, religious and moral education,
health education, and personal and social
development. Pupils can study a modern
European language during the last two years of
primary education.
There are 59 units in primary schools where
education takes place through the Gaelic language.
There are some other schools where Gaelic can be
learned as a second language.
Attainment
In 2001, at key stage 1 over 80 per cent of both
boys and girls in England achieved the expected
level in English. By key stage 3 this had fallen to 57
per cent and 73 per cent respectively. The
proportion of boys in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland reaching the required standard
for English was lower than for girls at all key
stages, particularly stages 2 and 3. This was also
true of Welsh in Wales. Similar proportions of
boys and girls reached the expected level in tests
for mathematics and science at all key stages. The
proportion of pupils achieving the expected level
generally reduced with age for both sexes.
Scotland
The percentage of pupils attaining target levels
increased between 1999/2000 and 2000/01 for
most local authorities, across all subjects. As in the
rest of the UK, the proportions of pupils achieving

Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
the expected level was lower in the older age
groups.
Assessment
England and Wales
Pupils are assessed formally at the ages of 7, 11
and 14 by their teachers and/or by national tests in
the core subjects of English, mathematics and
science. In Wales there is no statutory national
testing at age 7. At age 14, pupils are also assessed
in other subjects.
Northern Ireland
Pupils are formally assessed at the ages of 8, 11
and 14. The requirements are broadly similar to
those in England and Wales. Pupils at key stages 1
and 2 are assessed in English and mathematics, and
also in science at key stage 3. Assessment takes the
form of teacher assessment and (at key stage 3)
tasks or tests.
Scotland
Progression is measured by attainment of five levels,
based on the expectation of the performance of the
majority of pupils at certain ages between 5 and 14
(see Table 10.5). Pupils are assessed by their
teachers and by tests in reading, writing and
mathematics which are selected and administered
from a national catalogue. Tests can take place at
any time during the school year and at any age.

(GCSE) is the main examination at the end of key
stage 4. GCSEs are generally taken at age 16 and
are graded A* to G. In Scotland students study for

(SCE)/National Qualifications (NQ) at Standard
Grade and are examined at the age of 16. These
qualifications are awarded on a scale of 1 to 7.
In 2000/01, 51 per cent of pupils in the United
Kingdom gained five or more GCSE grades A* to
C or equivalent, compared with 45 per cent in
1995/96.
In order to expand vocational opportunities in
England in line with the 14-19 consultation
exercise (see page 109), new GCSEs in vocational
subjects were introduced in September 2002 and
are designed to replace the General National
Vocational Qualification (GNVQ) Part One.
Northern Ireland also introduced vocational
GCSEs at this time. They are available in eight
subjects: Applied Art and Design; Applied
Business; Engineering; Health and Social Care;
Applied ICT; Leisure and Tourism;
Manufacturing; and Applied Science. In Scotland
the General Scottish Vocational Qualification
(GSVQ) is the equivalent.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
General Certificate of Education Advanced (GCE
A) Level is usually taken at the age of 18 after two
years of full-time study. The Advanced Subsidiary
(AS) qualification is equivalent to 50 per cent of
an A level and is designed to encourage the take-

10 Education and training
The Welsh Baccalaureate qualification
Wales is piloting a new broader post-16
qualification, the Welsh Baccalaureate. The pilot
project will incorporate existing qualifications and
will have a common core curriculum, including Key
Skills, Wales, Europe and the World (including a
language module), Work-related Education and
Personal and Social Education. The development of
the qualification and the pilot project is managed by
the Welsh Joint Education Committee. There are 19
pilot centres (schools and further education
colleges), with the first students due to start in
September 2003.
up of more subjects. The GCE A and AS levels are
graded A to E.
In Scotland, National Qualifications courses were
phased in from 1999/2000. NQs consist of five
main levels of award: Access (subdivided into
three levels); Intermediate 1; Intermediate 2;
Higher; and Advanced Higher. These courses are
mainly studied as post-16 qualifications though,
under arrangements for curricular flexibility, some
students may study NQs in addition to, or in place
of, Standard Grades.
GCE A/AS levels and GCSEs (or NQs in Scotland)
can also be taken in a school sixth form or in
further education institutions.
In 2000/01,36 per cent of young people in schools
and further education in the United Kingdom
achieved two or more GCE A levels or equivalent,
compared with 30 per cent in 1995/96 (see Figure
10.9). Female pupils obtained better results than
males. By contrast in 1965/66, 9 per cent of female
and 13 per cent of male school leavers had at least
two GCE A levels or equivalent.
All GCSE, GCE and other qualifications offered to
pupils in state schools must be approved by the
appropriate minister. Specifications and
assessment procedures must comply with national
guidelines and be accredited by the Qualifications
and Curriculum Authority (QCA) in England, by
its Welsh counterpart, Qualifications, Curriculum
and Assessment Authority for Wales/Awdurdod
Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru
(ACCAC), or the Northern Ireland Council for
Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment
(CCEA). These independent government agencies

New proposals for 14 to 19 year olds in
England
The Government published a Green Paper in
February 2002. Proposals include: a wide range of
high-quality vocational and academic options in
school, college and the workplace; reform of the
14-16 curriculum; more use of both accelerated and
slower paced learning; and more collaborative work
between schools, colleges, training providers and
employers. The Green Paper also suggests an award
to recognise the breadth and depth of student
achievement by the age of 19.
are responsible for ensuring that the curriculum
and qualifications are of high quality, coherent
and flexible. NQs in Scotland are managed by the
Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).
All secondary schools in England and Wales, and
primary and secondary schools in Northern
Ireland, provide leavers with a Record of
Achievement setting out their attainments,
including public examinations and National
Curriculum assessment results. The Record is not
compulsory in Scotland.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are entitled
to career information, advice and guidance.

10 Education and training
In England the Connexions Service is the support
service for 13 to 19 year olds. It provides
integrated advice, guidance and access to personal
development opportunities and aims to help
young people make a smooth transition to
adulthood and working life. The service co¬
ordinates careers, youth and other statutory and
voluntary services for young people. It is
delivered at a local level through Connexions
Partnerships, by a network of personal advisers
based in a variety of settings, including schools
and colleges.
The Learning and Skills Council (ESC - see page
111) is responsible for developing education
business links in England. The aim is to ensure
that all young people have high-quality work
experience during their time at school in order to
help raise standards of achievement, develop key
skills and prepare them more effectively for adult
and working life.
Careers Wales works with schools and colleges
to deliver information, advice and guidance to all
age groups. It also works with schools and
employers to facilitate work experience
placements and opportunities to learn about
business and enterprise. It provides additional
help to those most at risk of failing to realise their
potential.
In Northern Ireland careers education is a cross¬
curricular theme in secondary schools. Business
links to provide work experience for young people
are fostered through the Northern Ireland
Business Education Partnership, which supports a
network of local partnerships and five area
partnerships aligned to the five education and
library boards.
Careers Scotland commenced work in April 2002.
It offers a careers advisory service to all ages. Like
Careers Wales, it has a particular focus on
supporting vulnerable young people.
Young people and adults
Further education
After compulsory education is finished, young
people can choose to stay on at school, attend
college or take part in work-based learning. About
70 per cent of 16 year olds continue in full-time
education in school sixth forms, sixth form
colleges or further education colleges. Students

Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) aim
to provide the skills needed by employers across a
wide range of occupations. The ISC (see page 111),
which is implementing the programme across
England, aims to develop a network of at least 150
CoVEs by the end of March 2004. CoVEs are mainly
based in further education colleges, but the
programme has been extended to develop centres
in other organisations such as private or voluntary
training providers. In 2002, there were 85 CoVEs in
further education colleges and five non college
based centres.

the GCE A level) leading to higher education,
professional training or vocational qualifications.
They can also take non-examination courses.
Further education colleges
People over the age of 16 can take courses in
further education colleges with a choice of
academic and vocational provision. Many colleges

programmes. Most students attend part-time,
either by day release, block release from
employment or during the evenings. The sector
has strong ties with commerce and industry and
can play an important role in promoting
economic development and social inclusion.
Student support
Support for further education students in England
includes a subsidy towards course fees for 16 to 18
year olds, fee remission for those aged 19 or over
on low incomes and a discretionary access fund
(£92 million in 2002/03) to help meet the costs of
books, equipment, travel and fees. The Child Care
Support Fund (£30 million in 2002/03) provides
discretionary childcare support for students.
The Further Education Funding Council for Wales
and the Scottish Further Education Funding
Council provide help for eligible students in further
education. In 2002/03 the Welsh Assembly
Government introduced Assembly beaming Grants,
for which further education students are eligible
(depending upon age, income and course of study).
In Northern Ireland the Executive provides
funding and support through the Further
Education Funding Formula. Funding is also
provided to colleges and students through a
number of special budgets, which are designed to
widen access, increase participation, address skills
shortages and enhance the role of the sector in
supporting economic development.
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs)
NVQs, equivalent to Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (SVQs), are awards which recognise
work-related skills and knowledge in areas such as
business, engineering and health and social care.
They are based on national standards developed
by employer-led bodies, approved across the UK,
and accredited by the regulatory bodies (which
also accredit academic qualifications outside
higher education).
Types of vocational qualification
NVQs or SVQs are awarded at five levels.
Vocational GCSEs and Vocational A levels are an
alternative to GCSEs and GCE A levels in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland (see also page 108).
NQs in Scotland include vocational subjects
alongside traditional academic ones. Other
vocational qualifications include, for example, a
BTec Higher National Diploma or a City and
Guilds Craft award (see page 115).
Vocational and academic comparability
Vocational and academic qualifications are broadly
comparable at the following levels:
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 5 is equivalent to a Higher
Degree;
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 4 is equivalent to a First
Degree, an HND or HNC, a BTec Higher Diploma,
an RSA Higher Diploma, a nursing qualification
or other higher education;
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 3 is equivalent to two GCE
A levels, an RSA advanced diploma, a City and
Guilds advanced craft, an OND, ONC or a BTec
National Diploma; and
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 2 is equivalent to five
GCSEs at grades A* to C, an RSA diploma, a City
and Guilds craft or a BTec first or general
diploma.
NVQs or SVQs are achieved through assessment
and training. Assessment is normally through on-
the-job observation and questioning. These
qualifications are available for almost all
occupations, covering general, industrial and
commercial sectors.
Learning and Skills Council
In England, the Teaming and Skills Council is
responsible for planning and funding post-16
learning, up to but not including higher
education. Its remit includes further education,
work-based training, and adult and community
learning. It is now also responsible for funding
EEAs for their school sixth form provision. The
ESC is a single unitary body and operates through
a national office and 47 local arms, known as local
LSCs. The Council has a statutory duty to
encourage participation in learning and works
with employers and others to promote workforce
development.
National Council for Education and Training for
Wales
The National Council has a similar remit to the
ESC. It is responsible for post-16 education and
training, with the exception of higher education.
There are 21 local voluntary partnerships
(Community Consortia for Education and
Training) linking LEAs, schools, colleges,
voluntary organisations, private training

10 Education and training
Then and now
In 1952 there were 17 universities in England, 1 in
Wales, 4 in Scotland and 2 in Northern Ireland. In
2002 the figures were 72, 2, 14 and 2 respectively.
A number of new universities were endowed in the
1960s and 1970s. The number of universities
increased considerably after 1992, when
polytechnics were given degree awarding powers
and were allowed to call themselves universities as
a result of the Further and Higher Education Act
1992, In 2000/01 there were just over 2 million
students in full- or part-time higher education,
compared with around 222,000 in the mid-1950s.
providers, employers and trade unions. The
National Council and the Higher Education
Funding Council for Wales operate together under
the name Education and Learning Wales (ELWa).
Higher education
Around 30 per cent of young people in England
and Wales, 40 per cent in Scotland and 45 per cent
in Northern Ireland take degree and other
advanced courses in universities and other
colleges. An increasing number of mature students
also study for these qualifications.
Universities and higher education colleges
There are 90 university institutions in the UK,
including the Open University. This figure does
not include the constituent colleges of the
universities of London and Wales, both of which
have a federal structure. The UK’s universities
enjoy academic freedom, appoint their own staff,
admit students and award their own degrees. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from
the 13th century and the Scottish universities of St
Andrews, Glasgow and Aberdeen from the 15th
century. The University of Edinburgh was
established in the 16th century. All the other
universities were founded in the 19th and 20th
centuries.
In addition, there are 64 higher education colleges
which have different backgrounds and purposes.
Some are very specialised, such as art and design,
teacher education and agriculture colleges, while
others are multi-disciplinary. Some award their
own degrees and qualifications, while in others
these are validated by a university or national body.
Applications for full-time first degrees and HND
courses are usually made through the Universities
and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS). In 2001
nearly 360,000 applications were accepted to
higher education through UCAS. Around 28,000
students were accepted as deferred entrants -
nearly double the figure for 1994 and accounting
for nearly 8 per cent of accepted applications.
Students at university in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland usually spend three years of
study, leading to a Bachelor’s degree, such as a
Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science
(BSc). There are some four-year courses, especially
for those studying languages, and medical and
veterinary courses normally require five or six
years. A full-time first degree in Scotland (where
students usually start a year earlier) generally takes
four years for Honours and three years for the
broad-based Ordinary degree.
In 2001 some 265,300 students gained a first degree
in the UK compared with 232,200 in 1995. 32,600
graduated with a first degree in business and
administration in 2001, by far the highest category.
Some students go on to do postgraduate studies.
These usually lead to a Masters degree, such as a
Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MSc),
or to a doctorate (PhD). A Masters degree usually
lasts one year full-time or two years part-time. A
PhD usually lasts three years full-time or six years
part-time. The Government also launched the
‘New Route PhD’ in 2001 in response to the
changes in knowledge and skills demanded of
PhD graduates. It lasts four years and combines a
specific research project with a coherent
programme of formal coursework and
professional skills development.
Applications for postgraduate study are processed
separately by each institution and are made
directly to the university.
The Open University
The Open University (OU) is a non-residential
university offering 377 degree and other courses
for adult students who wish to study in their own
time. Teaching is through a combination of
printed texts, correspondence tuition, television
broadcasts, audio/video cassettes and, for some
courses, short residential schools. Some 160,000 of
its 218,400 students study online from home and
many OU learning resources are delivered on
interactive CD-ROM or computer software. There
is a network of local tutorial centres for contact
with part-time tutors and fellow students.
112
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
Distance learning
With the growth of the Internet, many UK
universities and colleges now offer study through
distance learning. This usually means learning at
home or work, with no need to visit the learning
centre. Distance learning courses are available at
many levels, including degree and postgraduate
qualifications. The Department for Education and
Skills (DfES) offers advice on which institutions are
recognised as having degree awarding powers and
recommends that a check is made before applying
for an online course.
UK eUniversities Worldwide is a public-private
initiative. The venture will aim to provide an e-
learning platform to deliver high-quality education,
principally via the Internet. The first courses will be
available in January 2003.
Students do not need any formal academic
qualifications to register for most courses.
The OU’s first degrees are the BA (Open) and the
BSc (Open), which are awarded on a system of
points for each course completed. Either degree
can be awarded with honours. The OU offers
honours degrees in named subject areas and an
MEng degree to enable students to achieve the
highest professional status of Chartered Engineer.
There are a number of certificates and diplomas.
Higher degrees are also available.
Finance
In 2000/01 LEAs and central government spent
£6 billion on higher education in the United
Kingdom. Government finance is distributed to
higher education institutions by higher education
funding councils in England, Wales and Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland by the Department for
Employment and Learning. The private
University of Buckingham does not receive public
funds.
Institutions also charge tuition fees, which are
partly funded by students. In addition, they
provide paid training, research or consultancy for
commercial firms. Many establishments have
endowments or receive grants from foundations
and benefactors.
Student support
Support for full-time higher education students in
England and Wales is provided in several ways.
The maximum student contribution towards
tuition fees in 2002/03 is £1,100, but the amount
actually paid depends on student and family
income. Half of students do not pay any fees.
Student loans are the main form of help for
students in meeting living costs. The maximum
loan in 2002/03 for full-time students living away
from home was £3,905 (£4,815 for those in
London). Loans are repaid on the basis of income
after the student has completed his/her course,
and only when he or she starts earning over
£10,000 a year.
Student support in Scotland
In 2001 the Scottish Executive introduced a new
support scheme for full-time higher education.
Student loans and supplementary grants are still the
main source of help with living costs. The main
feature of the new system is that young students
from low income families are entitled to have up to
£2,000 of their annual loan entitlement replaced by
a non-repayable bursary. Most graduates who start
courses from 2001/02 are required to make a one-
off payment to the Graduate Endowment, of
£2,000, when they complete their course and start
earning over £10,000 a year (mature students, lone
parents and students with a disability are exempt).
Since 2000/01 tuition fees have not been payable
by eligible full-time Scottish-domiciled students or
EU students studying in Scotland.
Support is also available for part-time students on
low incomes. Eligible applicants who wish to
pursue a course of part-time study can obtain
help towards the cost of tuition fees, and also a
one-off loan payment of £500 per academic year.
For both full- and part-time study, extra, non¬
repayable help is available to those with disabilities
or dependants, and to some of those entering
higher education from low income families. Help
may also be available from higher education
institutions for those who get into financial
difficulties as students.
In 2002/03 the Welsh Assembly Government
introduced a scheme of means-tested Assembly
Learning Grants. This provides grants for poorer
students from Wales wherever they study in the
UK.
In Northern Ireland support for higher education
students generally operates on a similar basis to
113
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
England and Wales. However, from September
2002 means-tested bursaries of up to £1,500
became available to low-income families.
Postgraduate support
Most postgraduates have to pay a significant
contribution towards tuition fees. The average fee
for a one-year Masters programme is £2,805,
although the figure varies with the programme of
study and the institution. Some postgraduates
receive an award from a public body, some
support themselves through a mixture of public
and private finance, and others receive funding
through scholarships and bursaries. Most public
funding is provided by the Research Councils (see
chapter 25, page 379), the Arts and Humanities
Research Board, the Students Awards Agency for
Scotland and the Department for Employment
and Learning in Northern Ireland. Employers may
offer support by paying for all or part of the
tuition fees and/or other costs such as
examination fees and books, and by allowing paid
leave for study.
Adult education
Education for adults is carried out in a wide range
of locations, including LEAs’ own premises, local
community centres, libraries, museums, schools
and both adult and further education colleges.
Overall, about half of LEAs provide Adult and
Community Learning through direct delivery; the
other half are through contracts with other
providers, predominately community schools and
colleges. The duty to secure such education rests
with the LSC in England and the National Council
for Education and Training for Wales (see page
111). Adult education in Scotland is a statutory
duty of education authorities and is generally
known as community learning or community
education. In Northern Ireland it is provided by the
further education sector, supplemented by the work
of a range of non-statutory providers. General
adult education courses include languages, physical
education/sport/fitness and practical craft skills,
such as embroidery or woodwork.
The National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education and the Basic Skills Agency jointly
manage the Adult and Community Learning Fund
on behalf of the DfES. The Fund supports
innovative learning opportunities and aims to
encourage people who have been reluctant to
participate in learning and who may be
disadvantaged as a result.
Literacy and numeracy
The Adult Basic Skills Strategy Unit, based in the
DfES, is responsible for the implementation of
‘Skills for Life’, the national strategy for improving
adult literacy and numeracy. Around 7 million
adults in England have literacy levels below level 1
(equivalent to GCSE grades D-G) or what is
expected of 11 year olds, and even more have a
problem with numeracy. Skills for Life was
launched in March 2001. The strategy caters for
the literacy, language (English for Speakers of
Other Languages - ESOL) and numeracy needs of
all post-16 learners, including those with learning
difficulties or disabilities. From pre-entry level up
to and including level 2 (equivalent to GCSE
grades A*-C), it provides free tuition for learners.
The Scottish Executive Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning Department is responsible for improving
adult literacy and numeracy in Scotland. A
National Training Project was set up in 2001 and
is part of Communities Scotland, which is the lead
agency for improving adult literacy and numeracy.
In Northern Ireland a framework and
consultation paper on Adult Literacy was
launched in July 2002. It aims to tackle low levels
of literacy and numeracy.
Training and learning programmes
Several programmes are available to help increase
work-related skills. These are offered as
alternatives to academic education for 16 to 19
year olds or as part of an existing employee’s
training. The Government has several initiatives to
help young people train for work and achieve
NVQs, such as the New Deal and Modern
Apprenticeships. See chapter 11 for more
information on these initiatives and other work-
related training.
Modern Apprenticeships (MAs)
MAs provide structured learning programmes for
young people which combine work-based training
with off-the-job learning. MAs are available
throughout the UK. They offer a chance to train
in an industry as well as the educational
qualifications of an NVQ or SVQ to level 3 and in
some cases above. The quality of MAs is being
improved through technical certificates that
develop knowledge and understanding, and
through an Apprenticeship diploma or equivalent.
Every young person with the necessary aptitude
and ability will be entitled to an MA and there will
be better access from an MA to higher education.
114
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
More than 80 sectors of business and industry
already offer MAs, ranging from accountancy to
sport. Each industry has its own guidance on
entry requirements.
BTecs and City and Guilds qualifications
Business and Technology Education Council
(BTec) and City and Guilds qualifications can be
studied for in business and finance, leisure and
tourism, engineering, and catering. In order to
take a BTec National, which takes two years to
complete, students usually need four GCSEs at
grades A*-C. For the BTec Higher Nationals, the
requirement is usually a BTec National or one
GCE A level.
Other training schemes
Other workplace training includes:
■ the right for 16 and 17 year old employees
with few, if any, qualifications to reasonable
paid time off work to study or train for an
approved qualification at NVQ level 2 or
equivalent;
■ career development loans to help people pay
for vocational education or learning in Great
Britain. Loans of between £300 and £8,000
are provided through major banks; interest
payments on the loan during training and
one month after training are funded by the
Government. They help to pay for courses
lasting up to two years and, if relevant, for up
to one year’s practical work experience where
it forms part of the course. Since the scheme
began in 1988, over 169,000 loans have been
made with an average value of £3,462. In
2001/02, around 16,000 loans were taken out;
■ Small Firms Training Loans, which help firms
with 50 or fewer permanent employees to
meet a range of vocational training related
expenses, including training consultancy.
Loans of between £500 and £125,000 are
available through high street banks and
repayments can be deferred for between six
and 12 months. Since the scheme began in
1994, nearly £4.1 million has been lent to 621
small firms. In 2001, £298,705 was lent and
37 small firms took up loans; and
■ work-based learning for adults, open to those
aged 25 and over who have been unemployed
for six months or longer.
In Wales, SkillBuild, targeted at those young people
who are most at risk in the labour market, aims to
develop social skills, literacy, numeracy, ICT and
other skills. A new programme - the Modern Skills
Diploma for Adults - was introduced in April 2001
to provide high-level (level 3 and above) skills
training for people aged over 25, including those in
employment. In the first year of operation over 700
people joined the programme. The Welsh Assembly
Government, in collaboration with ELWa, is
developing a new series of‘all age’ work-based
programmes for introduction in April 2004.
In Scotland all young people aged between 16 and
17 are entitled to training under the government-
funded Skillseekers scheme. Its key elements are:
■ training leading to a recognised qualification,
up to SVQ level 3;
■ an individual training plan; and
■ employer involvement.
Around 78 per cent of Skillseekers are in paid
employment, with the remainder on work
placements and in receipt of a training allowance.
A network of Local Enterprise Companies is
responsible for the delivery of the Scottish Executive’s
national training programmes. They run under
contract to two non-departmental public bodies:
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise.
In Northern Ireland the Jobskills Programme is
available to all 16 to 17 year olds. It provides
training to NVQ level 2 with progress routes to
NVQ level 3 through Modern Apprenticeship
arrangements.
Learning initiatives
Sector Skills Councils
From April 2002 a new Sector Skills Council
(SSC) network, replacing National Training
Organisations, has been established by the Sector
Skills Development Agency. SSCs are independent
UK-wide organisations developed by groups of
employers in industry and business sectors. They
bring together employers, trade unions and
professional bodies working with government to
develop the skills that UK business needs.
New Technology Institutes
In May 2002 the locations of 18 New Technology
Institutes (NTIs) were announced. The NTIs will
115
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
include higher education institutions, further
education colleges, and private sector partners,
and provide training in advanced technology skills
both to businesses and students. The Higher
Education Funding Council for England is
working in partnership with the ESC to establish
the institutes by autumn 2002. All the NTIs
should be fully operational by 2004/05.
learndirect
The online network, learndirect, provides learning
opportunities to people at home, in the workplace
and at over 1,760 centres throughout England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Its primary objective
is to stimulate demand for lifelong learning
among adults and small and medium-sized
enterprises, and to increase the availability of high
quality learning through the use of ICT. There is a
learndirect telephone helpline and a learndirect
website (www.learndirect.co.uk). Learndirect
Scotland now has 300 learning centres. The
network underpins 6,000 UK online centres,
which aim to reduce the gap between those who
have access to ICT and those who do not.
Individual Learning Accounts
In September 2000 the Government and the
devolved administrations launched a programme
to help people plan and pay towards the cost of
their learning. Qualifying applicants were able to
receive funding through Individual Learning
Accounts (ILAs). Over 2.6 million accounts were
opened and some 8,910 organisations registered as
learning providers. The programme was
suspended in 2001 following allegations that a
small minority of providers had been involved in
potential fraud and theft from ILAs. Replacement
schemes are under consideration.
Information and communications technology
The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) is a
government initiative to help learners and
educators in the UK benefit from ICT. Launched in
1998, its aim is to increase and widen access to
learning opportunities in both formal and informal
environments, such as schools, colleges, libraries,
homes and workplaces. The NGfL involves the
development of educational material, a programme
for the delivery of ICT infrastructure, and training
to develop good ICT practice.
By 2002, 96 per cent of primary schools in the UK
and 99 per cent of secondary schools were
connected to the Internet. Computer to pupil
ratios were about 1:12 and 1:7 respectively. Over
96 per cent of eligible teachers have registered for
ICT teacher training through the New
Opportunities Fund and over 99 per cent of
schools have now signed up for the training.
The British Educational Communications and
Technology Agency is the Government’s lead
agency on the use of ICT in education and
manages the NGfL in England and Wales.
Learning and Teaching Scotland and the Northern
Ireland Network for Education manage the NGfL
in their respective areas.
Teachers and other staff
In 2000/01 the average UK pupil to teacher ratios
for state nursery, primary and secondary schools
were 26.5, 22.3 and 16.5 respectively. In the
younger age groups the work of qualified teachers
is more likely to be supplemented by teaching
assistants (see page 117).
England and Wales
New teachers in state primary and secondary
schools must be graduates and hold Qualified
Teacher Status (QTS). There are two main ways of
achieving this: by taking a Bachelor of Education
degree (four years) at a university or college of
higher education; or by taking a one-year Post
Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) course
leading to QTS. A third route into the profession
allows undergraduates on traditional academic

degree courses to take education modules and so
gain part of a teacher education qualification.
Other programmes, available in England only,
offer the opportunity for people aged 24 and over
to earn a salary while following a teacher training
programme in a school. These programmes are
particularly suitable for overseas-trained teachers
who do not hold QTS, mature career changers,
school support staff and people who have had
previous teaching experience.
All teachers working in state schools must be
registered with the General Teaching Council for
England or Wales. These are teachers’ professional
bodies which, among other things, have the power
to strike a teacher from the register on grounds of
professional misconduct or incompetence.
Figure 10.11 shows the number of teachers in
maintained schools in recent years.
Northern Ireland
All entrants to teaching in grant-aided schools are
graduates and hold an approved teaching
qualification. Initial teacher training is integrated
with induction and early in-service training, the
latter covering a period of three years. The
General Teaching Council in Northern Ireland,
which has similar duties to those in England and
Wales, is due to hold its first full meeting of
elected and appointed members in October 2002.
As with the rest of the UK, the main teacher
training courses are the Bachelor of Education
degree and the PGCE. The education and library
boards have a statutory duty to provide curricular
support services and in-service training.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools must
be registered with the General Teaching Council
for Scotland. The Council gives advice to the
Scottish Executive on teacher supply and the
professional suitability of teacher training courses.
It is also responsible for disciplinary procedures
under which a teacher guilty of professional
misconduct may be removed temporarily or
permanently from the register.
Teacher qualification procedures are similar to
those in England and Wales, including the
Bachelor of Education degree and the PGCE.
There is also a combined degree, sometimes
known as a concurrent degree. All pre-service
courses are validated by a higher education
institution accredited by the Council and
approved by the Scottish Executive. The Education
Inspectorate has powers to inspect teacher
education and training.
Teaching assistants
The term teaching assistant refers to those whose
primary role is either to assist the teacher in the
classroom, or to provide support for individual
pupils. There are no nationally set qualifications
for this role, although some local authorities have
their own requirements. National Occupational
Standards for teaching assistants have been
published and NVQs (levels 2 and 3) based on the
standards are being developed.
Headteachers
In England the National College for School
Leadership (NCSL) was launched in 2000. The
college is responsible for the three national
headship training programmes: the National
Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH)
for aspiring headteachers; the Leadership and
Management Programme for New Headteachers;
and the Leadership Programme for Serving
Headteachers. The DIES and the NCSL recently
consulted on proposals to make the NPQH
mandatory for all those seeking their first
headship post from April 2004.
Wales and Northern Ireland have their own
versions of the NPQH, adapted to suit their
respective school systems. The Scottish Executive
announced in December 2001 its intention to
make the Scottish Standard for Headship
mandatory in Scotland from August 2005. At
present, the only route to gaining the Standard is
through the Scottish Qualification for Headship.
Teacher recruitment and retention
The purpose of the Teacher Training Agency is to
raise standards in schools in England by attracting
able and committed people to teaching and by
improving the quality of teacher training.
Government measures to tackle teacher
recruitment and retention issues include:
■ an increase (from 1,500 to 2,000) in the
number of flexible training places for people
wanting to train while still working;
■ a £4,000 ‘golden hello’ for those who train in
and then go on to teach in subjects in which
there are shortages of teachers; and
117
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
■ proposals to pay off, over time, the student
loans of newly qualified teachers in shortage
subjects, such as mathematics, science,
English, modern languages and technology.
Allied professions
A range of other professions are involved in
education and training. Examples are given below.
Childcare
There are a range of relevant qualifications for
those working in this sector. For example, in
nursery work, trainees under supervision work
towards a level 2 qualification on the National
Qualifications Framework in Early Years
Education, Childcare and Playwork. On-the-job
progression can then be made to level 3.
Careers advisers
In England and Wales fully qualified advisers are
required to hold a relevant qualification at NVQ
or SVQ level 4 or equivalent. In England advisers
must also complete specific Connexions training:
there are four main programmes.
Further and higher education
There were 55,000 full-time further education
lecturers and 76,000 full-time higher education
lecturers in the UK in 1999/2000. With the
exception of Northern Ireland, professional
teaching qualifications are not essential in this
sector, although prospects tend to be better for
those who have them. In Northern Ireland a
Postgraduate Certificate in Further and Higher
Education is required if an approved teaching
qualification is not already held.
Administration and
management
State schools in England and Wales are maintained
by local government education authorities. With a
few exceptions, this is also the position in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland five education and library
boards fund all controlled and maintained schools
and the Department of Education funds voluntary
grammar and grant-maintained integrated schools.
Further education colleges in the UK are controlled
by autonomous governing bodies, with
representation from businesses and the local
community. Universities and higher education
colleges are legally independent corporate
institutions with individual governing bodies.
Education Act 2002
Key provisions of the Education Act 2002, which
covers England and Wales, include:
■ opportunities for schools and LEAs to experiment
with new ways of raising standards;
■ more autonomy for schools that perform well, in
order to encourage innovation;
■ a more flexible curriculum allowing tailoring of
provision to individual needs;
■ powers for schools to offer community facilities,
form companies, and decide upon models of
school governance that suit them best;
■ measures to support a more flexible framework
for the staffing of schools;
■ enhanced provisions to tackle under¬
performance; and
■ greater transparency for school finance.
A number of central government departments are
responsible for education policy:
■ the Department for Education and Skills
(DfES) in England;
■ the Welsh Assembly Government Training
and Education Department;
■ the Scottish Executive Education Department
(primary and secondary education) and the
Scottish Executive Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning Department; and
■ the Department of Education and the
Department for Employment and Learning in
the Northern Ireland Executive.
The education service in Great Britain is financed
in the same way as other local government
services (see chapter 6, page 53), with education
authorities funding schools largely on the basis of
pupil numbers. Specific central government grants
are made to LEAs in Great Britain in order to
improve school performance in literacy, numeracy
and ICT. The Government also allocates some
resources directly to schools for them to use as
they wish. The costs of education and library

2002 Spending Review
Under the 2002 Spending Review (see page 350),
published in July 2002, a record increase in
education spending is envisaged in the UK over the
next three years with spending forecast to rise to
5.6 per cent of GDP by 2005/06. For example in
England the Review set out that:
■ spending will rise by an average of 6 per cent a
year in real terms over the next three years, to
£57.8 billion in 2005/06;
■ payments directly to schools will be at least
£165,000 for a typical secondary school, and
£50,000 for a primary school: increases of
£50,000 and £10,000 respectively; and
■ from September 2004, Education Maintenance
Allowances of up to £30 a week, will be
available to 16-19 year olds, depending on
parental income, with additional bonuses for
attendance and achievement.
Further investment will also be made in childcare
and early years learning, further education,
improving the basic skills of adults, and expanding
Modern Apprenticeships and work-related
qualifications.
boards are met directly by the Northern Ireland
Executive.
School management
England and Wales
All state schools work in partnership with, and
receive recurrent funding from, LEAs, while
managing 85 per cent of their budgets and
staffing. They are run by governing bodies,
comprising parents, school staff, LEA and local
community representation.
LEAs and school governing bodies responsible for
pupil admissions are expected to take part in local
discussions with headteachers, churches and
others, in order to co-ordinate admission
arrangements, taking account of statutory codes of
practice. Any disagreements on school
organisation or admissions in England are
referred to an independent adjudicator; those
regarding religious or denominational admission
criteria are referred to the Secretary of State for
Education and Skills. In Wales the Assembly
Government decides all cases of disagreement.
Admission authorities are not allowed to introduce
selection by ability, unless it is for sixth form
admission or is designed to ensure that pupils of all
abilities are admitted and that no one level of
ability is over- or under-represented. Where
existing partial selection by ability is challenged, the
Adjudicator (in Wales the Assembly Government)
decides whether it should continue.
In England there are 164 designated grammar
schools which select pupils on ability. Local parents
are allowed to petition for a ballot and (if sufficient
numbers locally wish it) to vote on whether to
keep these selective admission arrangements.
Scotland
Nearly all Scottish schools are education authority
schools financed by the authorities and central
government. The headteacher is responsible for
decision-making on at least 80 per cent of school-
level expenditure.
In May 2000, 83 per cent of eligible education
authority schools had a school board consisting of
elected parents and teachers and members co¬
opted from the local community. In addition to
promoting contact between parents, school and
community, they are involved in procedures to
appoint senior staff and to determine the
community use of school premises. They may also
take on further executive functions by delegation
from their education authority.
Nine grant-aided schools, one primary, one
secondary, and seven for children with special
educational needs, are run by boards of managers
who receive government grants.
Northern Ireland
Boards of governors are responsible for the
management of individual schools and include
elected parents and teachers among their
members. Virtually all schools have delegated
budgets under which school governors determine
spending priorities.
Rights of parents
England and Wales
Parents have a statutory right to information
about schools and to express a preference for a
school for their child. There is an appeal system if
119
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
their choice is not met. Parents must be given a
copy of the annual report from the school
governors, which includes summaries of the
school’s results in National Curriculum assessment
tests, public examinations, vocational qualifications
(if applicable) and rates of pupil absence.
Parents must be given a written annual report on
their child’s achievements in all subjects, including
results of tests and examinations. Arrangements
must also be made for the discussion of reports
with teachers.
Parents are also entitled to see or be provided with
a copy of their child’s pupil record within 15
school days of making a written request. Unless
there is a court order preventing it, all parents
have a right to participate in decisions about their
child’s education.
Home/school agreements set out the responsibilities
of schools, pupils and parents and are a statutory
requirement for all maintained schools.
Scotland
Parents have a statutory right to express their
choice of school and the education authority must
meet this request except in certain circumstances
set out in law. Information is published on school
costs, examination results, pupil attendance or
absence, 5-14 attainment targets and results, and
the destinations of school leavers. Schools are
required to provide parents with information
about their children’s attainment in each subject,
pupil attainment targets and teachers’ comments
on their progress.
Northern Ireland
The system of reporting to parents is broadly
similar to that in England and Wales, except that
no annual performance tables on a school-by¬
school basis are published.
Educational standards
England and Wales
The Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED)
in England and the Office of Her Majesty’s Chief
Inspector in Wales (Estyn) aim to improve the
quality and standards of education through
independent inspection and advice.
Schools are inspected at least once in six years, but
more often where weaknesses have been identified
in an earlier inspection. They must produce an
action plan to address the key issues raised in the
inspection report. A school failing to provide an
acceptable standard of education is deemed to
need Special Measures and remains subject to
regular monitoring visits by inspectors.
The Education Act 2002 allows for earlier and wider
intervention in weak and failing schools. The Act
introduced new powers to replace a governing body
with an interim executive board if the governing
body is part of the problem. LEAs will also be
expected to invite external partners to help turn
round weak and failing schools. These could be
successful schools, other LEAs, other educational
establishments, voluntary, faith or private bodies.
In April 2001 OFSTED acquired responsibility for
inspecting all 16 to 19 education and training in
sixth form and further education colleges, which it
carries out with the Adult Learning Inspectorate.
From September 2001 OFSTED also became
responsible for the regulation of all early years
childcare providers.
The Adult Learning Inspectorate performs the
same function as OFSTED for post-19 provision
in colleges and for work-based learning and LEA-
secured adult and community learning. Estyn
already has responsibility for these areas as well as
adult education and work-based training.
Scotland
Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education began
operating as an executive agency of the Scottish
Executive in April 2001. It inspects, reviews and
reports on state and independent schools, further
education colleges and the education functions of
local authorities. Reports are published and are
usually followed up within two years.
Northern Ireland
The Education and Training Inspectorate
monitors, inspects and reports on standards of
education and training provided by schools,
colleges and other grant-aided organisations, and
provides information and policy advice to the
Department of Education, the Department of
Culture, Arts and Leisure, and the Department for
Employment and Learning.
International links
Large numbers of people from other countries
come to the UK to study, and many British people
120
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
work and train overseas. The British Council (see
chapter 7) encourages links between educational
institutions in the UK and developing countries.
European Union schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU’s
Socrates-Erasmus programme which provides
grants enabling university students from the EU,
Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and all the
Associated Countries in Central and Eastern
Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, to study in
other states (Turkey is expected to participate in
2003). All academic subjects are covered, the study
period normally lasting between three and 12
months. About 9,000 UK students take part each
year. Since it began in 1987 more than 1 million
students have participated in the programme, of
whom almost 120,000 were from the UK.
No UK students on Erasmus exchanges who come
under the student support arrangements and who
go abroad for a full academic year (nine months
or more) have to pay any tuition fee contribution,
regardless of family income. In addition to any
student support entitlements, Erasmus students
may also be eligible for an Erasmus grant that
contributes towards the extra costs arising from
studying abroad.
The Socrates programme also supports
partnerships between schools, language learning,
mobility opportunities for educational staff and a
range of multinational projects, including open
and distance learning and adult education.
Competence in another European language is
supported in all activities.
The Leonardo da Vinci programme supports
vocational training policies and practices through
The Commonwealth Education Fund
This fund was launched in 2002 to mark the
Queen's Golden Jubilee year. It aims to highlight the
need for universal primary education in the
Commonwealth and to raise children's awareness of
development issues. Actionaid, Oxfam and Save the
Children administer the fund. The Government has
announced a grant of £10 million to the fund over
the years to December 2005, and will match
contributions by businesses and others. There are
estimated to be 75 million children in the
Commonwealth who do not complete a basic
education.
multinational pilot projects, placements and
exchanges, and research projects. The Youth
Programme supports youth exchanges and
volunteering activities. It gives young people from
the age of 15 upwards the chance to broaden their
horizons and develop their sense of initiative
through projects at home or abroad.
Overseas students and teachers
in the UK
In 1999/2000 there were 114,600 overseas students
in further education institutions in the UK; and in
higher education in 2000/01 there were 229,900.
Most of them pay fees covering the full costs of
their courses. Nationals of other EU states
generally pay the lower level of fees applicable to
British home students.
In order to teach in maintained schools in
England, it is generally necessary to hold QTS (see
page 116) and be registered with a General
Teaching Council. Regulations do not allow for
the automatic recognition of teaching
qualifications gained abroad unless the teacher is a
national of the EEA (see page 60). Other nationals
can be appointed under certain circumstances
through the Overseas Trained Teachers
programme. Some 6,000 UK work permits were
issued to teachers in 2001.
Government scholarship schemes
The Government makes provision for foreign
students to study in the UK through its Chevening
programme and other scholarship schemes. In
2001 about 4,000 students from overseas received
awards from scholarship schemes funded in part
by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (ECO),
and other government departments. These are the
Chevening programme, Commonwealth
Scholarships and Fellowships Plan, Department
for International Development Shared
Scholarships, Marshall Scholarships, and North
Atlantic Fellowships. The ECO is also increasing
the number of scholarships jointly funded with
British or foreign commercial firms, and with
academic and other institutions.
Other schemes
The Overseas Research Students Award Scheme,
funded by the higher education funding councils,
provides help for overseas full-time postgraduate
students with outstanding research potential. In
addition, most British universities and colleges
offer bursaries and scholarships for which
121
Social and cultural affairs
10 Education and training
graduates of any nationality are eligible. Other
public and private scholarships are available to
students from overseas and to British students
who want to study in other countries.
The Teachers’ International Development
Programme aims to provide teachers with
opportunities for international study visits or
exchanges which will enable them to experience
good practice, develop international educational
links with other schools, carry out research and
share information with a network of other
participants. Around 3,900 teachers have
participated in the programme since its launch in
May 2000.

For almost a decade, the number of people
employed in the United Kingdom labour market
has been growing, and now exceeds 28 million.
Both full-time and part-time employment have
risen. The increase has been predominantly in the
service sector, in which over three-quarters of
employees now work. At the same time
unemployment has fallen considerably since the
last peak at the end of 1992 and in 2001 reached
its lowest level since the introduction of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) measure
of unemployment in 1984. Since spring 2001,
however, unemployment has been increasing
slightly.
Patterns of employment
The Labour Force Survey (LFS)1 2 carried out by the
Office for National Statistics shows that, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, over 30 million people
aged 16 and over were economically active in the
UK in spring (March to May) 2002, comprising
28.5 million in employment and 1.6 million ILO
unemployed (see Table 11.1). The economic
activity rate was 63.5 per cent for all persons aged
16 and over and 78.9 per cent for those of working
age (men aged 16 to 64 and women aged 16 to
59). Among the working age group, some 7.8
million people were economically inactive, of
whom 5.5 million people did not want a job and
2.3 million people wanted a job but were either
not seeking work or not available to start work.
The number of people aged 16 and over in
employment-1 in the UK rose by 179,000 in the
year to spring 2002 to 28.5 million: some 15.7
1 All LFS data quoted are based on pre-2001 Census totals and will
be subject to revision.
2 There are two main measures of employment: the number of
people in employment and the number of jobs; they differ because
one person can have more than one job.
Measures of unemployment
The ILO measure of unemployment is based on LFS
estimates of the number of people without a job
who are seeking work. It refers to the number
available to start work within two weeks who have
either looked for work in the previous four weeks or
are waiting to start a job they have already
obtained. It is based on internationally agreed
definitions and is the official measure of
unemployment in the UK.
An alternative measure is the claimant count.
This is a count of the number of people claiming
unemployment-related benefits.
Economic activity
The labour market can be divided into two groups:
the economically active and inactive. The
economically active are defined as those who are
either in employment (employee, self-employed,
unpaid family worker or on a government-supported
training programme) or unemployed and actively
seeking work. The economically inactive are people
who are not in work, but who do not satisfy all the
criteria for ILO unemployment; it includes those in
retirement and those not actively seeking work.
million men and 12.8 million women. This
represented an increase of 0.6 per cent during the
year: 1.1 per cent for women and 0.3 per cent for
men. The employment rate among those of
working age was 74.7 per cent, close to the
previous high achieved in 1990 (see Figure 11.2).
One of the main long-term trends in the labour
market is the increased participation of women in
employment. In spring 2002, nearly 70 per cent of
working age women were in employment,
compared with 47 per cent in 1959 (the year for
which estimates are first available). Among many
reasons for their greater involvement is that more
women delay having children until their thirties

and are then more likely to return to work
afterwards, making use of a range of childcare
options. Other reasons include the increasing
levels of educational attainment among women
and changing social attitudes to women working.
Older workers
There were 6.0 million people aged between 50
and state pension age in employment in spring
2002, representing 21 per cent of all employed
people. Their employment rate was unchanged
from the previous year at 68 per cent, as was their

economic inactivity rate (30 per cent). The
economic inactivity rate among men aged 50 to 64
increased from 23 per cent in 1984 to peak at
29 per cent in 1995 and has since declined to
27 per cent from 1999 to 2002. In contrast, the
rate for women aged 50 to 59 declined from 41
per cent to 33 per cent between 1984 and 2002.
In spring 2002, 15 per cent of the ILO
unemployed were over 50, of whom 36 per cent
had been unemployed for more than 12 months,
a decrease of 4 percentage points since spring
2001. For details on the New Deal 50 Plus for this
age group see page 131.
Age Positive website
The Government has launched an Age Positive
website {www.agepositive.gov.uk) to promote the
Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment.
The code highlights the business benefits of an age-
diverse workforce and sets the standard for non-
ageist approaches to recruitment, selection, training,
promotion, redundancy and retirement. The website
includes good practice guides with case studies
illustrating how organisations have tackled some of
the issues.
Over 90 per cent of people above retirement age
were economically inactive in spring 2002, but
886,000 of them were in employment, an increase
of 9 per cent on the previous year.
Young people
The economic activity of 16-19 year olds is closely
linked to their participation in full-time education
(FTE). Of those not in FTE in spring 2002,
85 per cent were economically active, of whom
18 per cent were ILO unemployed. For those in
FTE, 44 per cent were economically active.
There has been an increase in youth ILO
unemployment, with 406,000 people aged 18 to
24 unemployed in spring 2002, 5 per cent higher
than a year earlier. Flowever, the number who had
been out of work for more than a year fell by
19 per cent, suggesting that long-term
unemployment among younger people continues
to fall.
Ethnicity and the labour market
In spring 2002 there were estimated to be 3.1
million people aged 16 and over from minority
ethnic groups in the UK, of whom 1.7 million
were in employment. The working age
124
Social and cultural affairs
11 The labour market
employment rate for all minority ethnic groups
was 58.3 per cent, compared with 75.8 per cent for
the White group. There were differences between
the employment rates of people from different
minority ethnic groups, ranging from 67.0 per
cent and 65.3 per cent for those from the Indian
and Black Caribbean groups to 47.0 per cent and
35.5 per cent for those from the Pakistani and
Bangladeshi groups. These figures are affected by
the comparatively low employment rates of
women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin
(27.9 per cent and 17.7 per cent respectively),
compared with 71.2 per cent for White women
and 64.0 per cent for Black Caribbean women.
In spring 2002 the ILO unemployment rate for all
minority ethnic groups was 10.7 per cent, more
than double the rate for the White group
(4.7 per cent). There were wide variations between
minority ethnic groups: for example, 24.2 per cent
for those from the Bangladeshi group; 14.6 per
cent for those from the Black African group and
6.2 per cent for those from the Indian group. The
overall ILO unemployment rate among women
from minority ethnic groups was 9.7 per cent,
compared with 11.4 per cent for men.
Disability and the labour market
In spring 2002 there were 7 million people of
working age with long-term disabilities (using the
LFS definition) in the UK, of whom just over half
were economically active. The rates of ILO
unemployment among disabled people were
higher than for those not long-term disabled
(8.6 per cent compared with 4.7 per cent). Among
the economically inactive, those with disabilities
were more likely to want a job than those without
a disability. For details on the New Deal for
Disabled People see page 131.
Then and now
The workforce has grown by about a fifth over the
last 50 years. However, while the number of men in
employment has barely risen, the female workforce
has grown by two-thirds. As a result, almost half of
the workforce is now female, compared with around
a third in 1952.
Households with no one in work
The number of workless households (among
households where at least one adult was of
working age) was 3.1 million in spring 2002, an
increase of 70,000 since spring 2001 but 138,000
fewer than five years earlier. This represented a
rate of worklessness of 16.4 per cent in spring
2002, compared with 17.9 per cent in 1997.
Unemployment
The trend in the unemployment rate was steadily
downward from 1993 to spring 2001. Fiowever,
the latest estimates point to a slight increase. The
UK ILO unemployment rate in spring 2002 was
5.2 per cent, an increase of 0.3 percentage points
since the same period in 2001. The new rate
represents nearly 1.6 million ILO unemployed
people (see Table 11.1) and compares with the EU
average of 7.6 per cent and the G7 group of
nations average of 6.5 per cent. Within the UK,
the rate fell by 0.8 percentage points in Northern
Ireland (to 5.4 per cent), and rose by 1.0
percentage points (to 6.9 per cent) in Scotland.
Within England, London and the North East had
the highest ILO unemployment rates, at 6.9 per
cent. In addition, there can be significant
variations in unemployment rates within regions.
In recent years there have been substantial falls in
long-term unemployment. In spring 2002 some
343,000 people aged 16 and over had been ILO
unemployed for a year or more, of whom 183,000
had been out of work for two years or more.
These figures represent falls of 10 per cent and
16 per cent respectively since spring 2001.
In April 2002 the claimant count was 951,600,
representing 3.2 per cent of the total UK
workforce. Around two-thirds had been claiming
benefits for less than six months and 44 per cent
for less than 13 weeks.
Redundancies
Redundancy levels in the UK have remained
roughly constant since the statistical series began
in 1995. In spring 2002, 201,000 people were made
redundant, representing a redundancy rate of
8.1 per 1,000 employees. Redundancy rates were
highest in manufacturing and transport, and
lowest in the public administration, education and
health sectors.
Working patterns
Over the past decade, three-quarters of those in
employment have been permanent full-time
workers. In spring 2002 there were 21.4 million
people in full-time employment, an increase of
nearly 2 million since 1993 (see Table 11.3).
Significant numbers of people have alternative

Economic inactivity
In spring 2002, there were 7.8 million
economically inactive people of working age in the
UK, of whom 2.3 million wanted a job but were
either not seeking work or were not available to
start work. Sickness and disability are the major
reasons for economic inactivity among men.
Looking after the family or home is the most
common reason for inactivity among women -
44 per cent of women who wanted a job gave this
as their main reason for inactivity. Government
policy is aimed at helping those who are currently
inactive to make the transition towards activity,
primarily through the New Deal programme (see
page 131) and the introduction of Jobcentre Plus
(see page 130).
employment patterns, such as part-time working
and second and temporary jobs.
Part-time work
There were over 7 million people in part-time work
in the UK in spring 2002 (see Table 11.3), of whom
80 per cent were women. Over the past decade the
number of people working part time has increased
by over 1 million, but as a proportion of all those in
employment it has remained at around 25 per cent.
People work part time for a variety of reasons. In
spring 2002 nearly 75 per cent did not want a full¬
time job while 8 per cent were working part time
because they could not find full-time work, a
proportion which has steadily decreased over the
past decade.
Secondary and temporary work
Just under 1.2 million people had a second job in
spring 2002, a small decrease over the year. About
1.6 million people (6 per cent of all employees)
were engaged in temporary jobs in spring 2002,
8 per cent fewer than in spring 2001. Temporary
employment is lower in the UK than in most
other EU countries. Of temporary employees in
spring 2002, a quarter worked in a temporary job
because they could not find a permanent one and
almost a third because they preferred to do so.
Overseas workers
More temporary overseas workers would be able to
come to the UK under plans announced by the
Home Office in May 2002. The Government is
consulting on expanding two existing foreign
workers schemes - the Working Holidaymakers
Scheme (WHS) and the Seasonal Agricultural
Workers Scheme - to meet recruitment difficulties
and demand for short-term and seasonal workers.
The Government wants to encourage young people
from all Commonwealth countries to take part and
is proposing a number of changes aimed at
increasing participation, such as increasing the
upper age limit and relaxing the restrictions on the
type and amount of work holidaymakers can do
during their stay.

11 The labour market
Self-employment
In spring 2002, 3.2 million people (three-quarters
of whom were men) were self-employed in the
UK. This represented 11 per cent of those in
employment, a small increase since spring 2001.
Agriculture and fishing, and construction had the
highest proportions of self-employed people,
while relatively few of those engaged in
manufacturing and public administration were
self-employed.
Homeworking
Homeworking (defined as those who work mainly
in their own home) is growing, but remains at a
low level. In winter 2001/02, the LFS estimated
that there were 650,000 people working as
homeworkers in their main job, representing
2.3 per cent of all people in employment. Of
these, 54 per cent worked part time and 63 per
cent were women. Those in personal services were
most likely to be homeworkers, and almost three-
quarters of these were women working in
childcare-related occupations.
Occupations
There has been a long-term growth in managerial
and professional occupations and a decline in
skilled trades, elementary occupations3 and
process, plant and machine operatives.
The patterns of occupations followed by men and
women are quite different (Table 11.4). Nearly a
quarter of women employees are in administrative
and secretarial work, while men are most likely to
be employed as managers and senior officials or in
skilled trades. Only the professional and associated
occupations, and elementary occupations, are
followed by similar proportions of men and
women.
Employment by sector
The major long-term trend in employment by
sector in the UK has been a big increase in
employment in service industries (see Table 11.5).
Between March 1982 and March 2002 the number
of workforce jobs in service industries increased
from 17 million to 23 million, a rise of 38 per
cent, compared with a rise in the total number of
jobs of 16 per cent. Growth in finance and
business services was particularly strong, up by
91 per cent in this period, although there were
falls in the year to March 2002.

In recent years most other sectors have
experienced falling levels of employment,
particularly the traditional manufacturing
industries, such as steel, shipbuilding and textiles.
Between 1982 and 2002 the total number of
manufacturing jobs declined by 33 per cent.
Agriculture and fishing have also declined, and in
the year to March 2002 jobs in the sector fell by
3.9 per cent. The biggest long-term decline though
has been in energy and water with a reduction of
70 per cent between 1982 and 2002, reflecting,
among other things, a large fall in jobs in the coal
industry.
Workforce skills
In its Green Paper Towards Full Employment in
a Modern Society (see page 129), published in
2001, the Government outlined three goals in its
strategy to help raise employability and
productivity in the UK through the development of
skills:
■ to ensure that young people have the skills
and rounded education to progress in
employment and that adults can acquire the
skills needed to get, keep and progress in
decent jobs;

formal qualifications, but usually have a period of formal on-the-

performance and raise productivity, and a
system in which people are able to change
and improve as jobs change; and
■ to ensure, in consultation with employers and
the network of Sector Skills Councils (see
page 115), that the skills people acquire are
those which are needed in the labour market
as well as for their personal development.
According to the LFS, in spring 2002 an estimated
3.9 million employees of working age received
job-related training, representing 16 per cent of all
employees.
England
The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) was set up
in April 2001, with an annual budget of £7.4
billion, to replace the Training and Enterprise
Councils and the Further Education Funding
Council. Its key objectives include increasing
engagement of employers in workforce
development, maximising the achievement and
participation in education and training of young
people, and increasing the demand for learning by
adults. One of its early tasks is to develop a
measure to assess the participation of employers
in the provision of education and training for
post-16 year olds.
Scotland
Two organisations, Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), deliver a
similar programme to the LSC in Scotland.
Scottish Enterprise was set up in 1991 with a remit
that includes highlighting the importance of
developing skills, primarily through Local
Enterprise Companies. The HIE lists among its
key objectives improving the operation of the
labour market and assisting in the development of
the training and learning infrastructure.
Wales
The National Council for Education and Training
for Wales and the Higher Education Funding
Council for Wales are responsible for all post-16
education and training in Wales. This includes the
delivery of training for adults and developing
strategies for reducing the proportion of adults
with no qualifications. Together these
organisations are known as Education and
Learning Wales (ELWa).
Northern Ireland
The Department for Employment and Learning
(DEL) of the Northern Ireland Executive is
responsible for higher and further education,
employment, skill development and lifelong
learning. The department’s Learning and Skills
Advisory Board was formed in January 2002 to
advise on the business development of education,
training and employment services.
Changes in skill requirements
The Skills in England Survey 2001 for the
Department for Education and Skills (DIES)
128
Social and cultural affairs
11 The labour market
highlighted a growth in jobs that require higher
level skills, and a subsequent decline in those
requiring lower level skills. The fastest growing
occupational groups are professional occupations,
such as information technology (IT) and software
professionals, scientists and teachers; associate
professional and technical occupations (such as
nurses, police and estate agents); and personal
service occupations (such as care assistants,
travel agents and sports/leisure staff). According
to the survey, there is an increasing need for
specific technical skills as well as a greater demand
for basic and generic skills (including verbal,
numerical, planning and communication skills).
The Learning and Training at Work 2001 survey
for the DfES (see Figure 11.6) found that IT is the
most common course offered by employers and
that training is also given in the generic skills
identified by the Skills in England Survey. Overall,
88 per cent of employers had provided some job-
related training to their employees in the previous
12 months.
The demand for different types of skill varies
across regions and this is reflected in the
organisational structure of skills management
organisations, such as the ESC and Scottish
Enterprise. Both organisations have a network of
local learning and skills councils whose remit is to
reflect the needs of the local economy. For
information on attainment of qualifications, see
chapter 10, page 108.
Investors in People
Investors in People (liP) is the National Standard
which sets a level of good practice for improving
an organisation’s performance through its people.
It is designed to improve business performance by
linking the training and development of
employees to an organisation’s business objectives.
Reported benefits include increased productivity,
higher profits, lower rates of absenteeism and
improved morale. Investors in People UK, which
is responsible for the promotion, quality assurance
and development of the Standard, has carried out
an extensive review to simplify the Standard and
make it more accessible, especially for small firms.
liP celebrated its tenth anniversary in autumn
2001, by which time 25,595 organisations in the
UK had been recognised as Investors in People.
Almost 6 million employees work in recognised
organisations, covering just over a fifth of the UK
workforce.

Labour market policy
The Government’s strategy for ensuring
employment opportunity for all was set out in its
Green Paper, Towards Full Employment in
a Modern Society, published in 2001. It is based
on:
■ helping people to move from welfare to work,
through extending the series of New Deals
(see page 131);
■ easing the transition to work by removing
barriers to working and ensuring that people
are financially secure when moving from
welfare to work;
■ making paid work more attractive, through
promoting incentives to work and reforming
the tax and benefits system (see chapters 23
and 12); and
■ securing progression in work through lifelong
learning, in order to ensure that people are
well trained and able to adapt to changing
economic circumstances.
New Deal
The Government’s welfare-to-work programme is
delivered throughout the UK primarily through a
129
Social and cultural affairs
11 The labour market
number of‘New Deal’ programmes, targeted at
specific groups (see page 131).
In 2002/03 the provision for expenditure on New
Deals includes £354 million for young people,
£302 million for the 25 plus programme, £142
million for lone parents and £58 million for
disabled people.
Welfare-to-Work
In February 2002 the DWP announced a series of
measures to help people into work, including:
■ Step Up-a £40 million programme, from April
2002, to provide guaranteed jobs in areas of
high unemployment;
■ Progress2work- a £40 million programme
helping drug misusers find employment;
■ Adviser Discretion Fund - which gives New Deal
advisers access to up to £300 per jobseeker to
help with the practical aspects of starting work,
including buying clothes for interviews, travel to
interviews and to work, and necessary
equipment; and
■ Ambition Programmes - industry-specific
training and recruitment programmes in sectors
such as IT, retailing and construction.
Existing programmes include:
■ Employment Zones - these have been piloted as
an alternative for the New Deal 25 plus client
group in 15 areas where there are high
concentrations of unemployment. Introduced in
April 2000, new approaches in these areas
include the use of personal job accounts, which
allow for a more flexible use of available funds.
■ Action Teams for Jobs - Action teams in 63
areas in Great Britain aim to remove the barriers
to employment faced by jobless people and, by
working with employers, to move them into
suitable vacancies. The teams look at innovative
ways of achieving their aim, and lessons learned
are incorporated in the main Jobcentre Plus
services. The Budget in April 2002 provided
£15 million a year to support transport schemes
where travel is a barrier to work.
Recruitment and job finding
There are a variety of ways in which people look
for work in the UK. According to the LFS, in
winter 2001/02, more than half of all employees
found out about the vacancy for their current job
by hearing from someone who worked there or by
replying to an advertisement.
Jobcentre Plus
In April 2002 parts of the Benefits Agency and
Employment Service in Great Britain were
replaced by the Jobcentre Plus network
(www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk), which provides help in
finding jobs and pays benefits to people of
working age. It has responsibility for running local
offices formerly managed by the Employment
Service and the Benefits Agency, including
Jobcentres and social security offices. A similar
programme to combine jobcentre and social
security offices is under way in Northern Ireland.
The new offices are known as ‘Jobs and Benefits’.
In 17 areas in Great Britain Jobcentre Plus
‘pathfinder’ offices are already offering a fully
integrated work and benefit service and there are
plans to open further Jobcentre Plus offices from
October 2002. The Department for Work and
Pensions expects 225 new pathfinder offices to be
opened by mid-2003. However, it will take several
years to integrate the entire local office network of
Jobcentres and Benefits Agency offices fully.
During this time, services will continue to be
provided in local social security offices and
Jobcentres, which will be part of the Jobcentre
Plus network.
All Jobcentre Plus vacancies are now available over
the Internet, on one of the largest job banks in the
world. Vacancies are also available through
electronic touch-screen kiosks, known as
‘Jobpoints’, which are replacing traditional vacancy
display boards in Jobcentres. Employers with a
vacancy can now use the Employer Direct service,
which provides a single national telephone
number for employers to have their vacancies
advertised on the Internet and on all Jobpoint
terminals.
Advisory services
Most customers who make a claim for a working
age benefit have to take part in a meeting with a
personal adviser, for example to discuss help to
find work or support such as training or childcare.

11 The labour market
If the individual is claiming benefits other than
jobseeker’s allowance (JSA) (see chapter 12, page
153), it is his or her decision whether or not to
look for work.
Jobcentre Plus advisers see all jobseekers when a
claim is made for JSA to assess their eligibility and
to provide advice about jobs, training and self-
employment opportunities. To receive the
allowance, each unemployed person has to
complete a Jobseeker’s Agreement, which sets out
his or her availability for work, the types of job for
which he or she is looking, and the steps which, if
taken, offer the best chance of securing work.
Jobseekers are required to attend a job search
review each fortnight and periodic intensive
advisory interviews to assess their situation and
see what additional help, if any, is needed and, if
appropriate, to revise the Jobseeker’s Agreement.
A modular approach to job search courses is being
developed, which takes more account of
individual needs and local conditions. Other
programmes include Jobclubs (offering guidance
on jobseeking, interview skills and other practical
assistance), Jobplan workshops (a five-day
programme of individual assessment) and work
trial, where jobseekers spend up to 15 days in an
actual vacancy.
Employment agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with significant
branch networks. The law governing the conduct
of employment agencies is less restrictive in the
UK than in many other EU countries, but agencies
must comply with legislation which establishes a
framework of minimum standards designed to
protect agency users, both workers and hirers.
The Recruitment and Employment Confederation
is the association for the private recruitment and
staffing industry in the UK. It has a membership
of over 6,000 recruitment agencies and over 8,000
recruitment consultants. All members must abide
by a code of good recruitment practice.
Pay and conditions
Earnings
According to the New Earnings Survey, average
gross weekly earnings for all employees in Great
Britain were £356 in April 2001. This represented
a 5.3 per cent increase since April 2000. Weekly
earnings for full-time adult workers whose pay
was not affected by absence were £444, an increase
of 5.9 per cent since April 2000.
Average hourly pay for full-time male adult
employees whose pay was not affected by absence
was £11.97 in April 2001, compared with £9.76 for
female employees. The pay gap between men and
women has been narrowing in recent years (see
page 95).
Average gross weekly earnings for full-time
employees ranged from £381 in the North East to
£594 in London.
According to the New Earnings Survey, the
average gross weekly pay of treasurers and
company financial managers was six times that of
those working as retail cash desk and check-out
operators (see Table 11.7). The weekly pay of the
former increased by 11.4 per cent in the year to
April 2001 and the latter by 5.4 per cent.

National minimum wage
The statutory national minimum wage (NMW)
took effect from 1 April 1999. Minimum wage
rates, from 1 October 2002, are:
132
Social and cultural affairs
11 The labour market
■ £4.20 an hour for those aged 22 or above; and
■ £3.60 an hour for workers aged 18 to 21, and
for those aged 22 or over receiving accredited
training in the first six months of a new job
with a new employer.
Almost all workers who are 18 or over are covered
by the NMW - there are no exemptions for casual
workers, agency workers, part-time workers,
overseas workers or workers in small businesses.
The only workers to whom it does not apply are
the self-employed, people under 18 years of age,
prisoners, voluntary workers, members of the
armed forces, family members of the employer
living in the employer’s home, and unrelated
people living in their employer’s home who are
treated as part of the family (for example, au
pairs). Apprentices and trainees are exempted for
the first year of their training.
The NMW is enforced through a combination of
measures. For example:
■ employers are required to keep NMW records;
■ Inland Revenue Compliance Officers
investigate all complaints about non-payment
of the NMW, visit other employers thought
to be likely to pay below the minimum wage,
and take enforcement action where necessary;
and
■ individuals can take action through an
employment tribunal or civil court.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and
Inland Revenue work to publicise employer
obligations and employee rights, principally
through direct advertising, the DTI employment
rights website {www.tiger.gov.uk) and the NMW
helpline.
Fringe benefits
Fringe benefits are used by many employers to
provide additional rewards to their employees.
They include schemes to encourage financial
participation by employees in their companies,
pension schemes, medical insurance, subsidised
meals, company cars and childcare schemes.
Many companies have adopted employee share
schemes, known as share incentive plans, where
employees receive free shares or options to buy
shares at a discount from their employer without
paying income tax. A new all-employee share
ownership plan was introduced in 2000, allowing
employees to buy shares from their pre-tax salary
and to receive free shares, with tax incentives for
longer-term shareholding.
Hours of work
In spring 2002 the average weekly hours worked
by full-time workers in the UK in their main job
was 38 hours: 40 hours for men and 34 hours for
women. For part-time workers the average was 16
hours.
Flours worked tend to be longest in agriculture,
energy and water, and transport and
communications, and shortest in public
administration, education and health. The
differences between industries also reflect the mix
of part-time and full-time workers, as well as any
difference in the standard working week. Self-
employed people work, on average, longer hours
than full-time employees.
Regulations implementing two EC Directives on
working time and on young workers (in relation
to rest and health assessments for adolescents)
came into force in the UK in 1998. They apply to
full-time, part-time and temporary workers,
although workers in certain sectors - including
transport, sea fishing, other work at sea, and
doctors in training - are currently exempt. They
provide for:
■ a maximum working week of 48 hours (on
average), although individual workers can
choose to work longer;
■ a minimum of four weeks’ annual paid leave;
■ minimum daily, weekly and in-work rest
periods;
■ a limit for night workers of an average eight
hours’ work in a 24-hour period; and
■ a right for night workers to receive free health
assessments.
There are specific provisions for adolescent
workers in respect of the entitlement to rest and
health assessments. Specific working time and
night work limits are planned to come into force
later in 2002.

Industrial relations
Individual employment rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For example,
most employees have a right to a written
statement setting out details of the main
conditions, including pay, hours of work and
holidays.
Employees with at least two years of continuous
employment with their employer are entitled to
lump sum redundancy payments if their jobs
cease to exist and their employers cannot offer
suitable alternative work.4
Minimum periods of notice are laid down for both
employers and employees. Most employees who
believe they have been unfairly dismissed have the
right to complain to an employment tribunal (see
page 135), subject to the general qualifying period
of one year’s continuous service. If the complaint is
upheld, the tribunal may make an order for re¬
employment or award compensation.
Legislation prohibits discrimination, in
employment, training and related matters, on
grounds of sex or marital status, disability, or race,
nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or
national origin (see pages 94-5). The disability
discrimination legislation applies to employers
with 15 or more employees. In Northern Ireland
discrimination in employment, training and
related matters on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is also unlawful. Legislation is
currently being introduced to implement the EC
Article 13 Employment Directive, which will
extend protection against discrimination in
employment and training to cover sexual
orientation and religion by 2003 and age by 2006.
The purpose of the Equal Pay Act 1970 is to
eliminate pay discrimination between women and
men, when doing work that is the same or broadly
similar, work which is rated as equivalent, or work
which is of equal value.
The Disability Rights Commission, the Equal
Opportunities Commission and the Commission
4 The statutory redundancy payment is calculated according to a
formula based on a person's age, the number of years of
continuous service up to a maximum of 20 years and his or her
weekly pay up to the current maximum of £250 per week.
However, many employers pay more than the statutory amount.
for Racial Equality have powers to investigate cases
of discrimination at work in Great Britain. The
Equality Commission in Northern Ireland has
similar powers.
All pregnant employees have the right to statutory
maternity leave with their non-wage contractual
benefits maintained, and to protection against
detriment and dismissal because of pregnancy.
Statutory maternity pay is payable by an employer
for up to 18 weeks to women with at least six
months’ service with that employer (see chapter 12,
page 147).
Employment Act 2002
The main areas covered by this Act are paternity and
adoption leave and pay, maternity leave and pay,
flexible working for parents of young children,
employment tribunal reform and dispute resolution
in the workplace. It includes provisions for:
■ six months paid, and a further six months
unpaid, maternity leave for mothers;
■ two weeks paid paternity leave for fathers;
■ six months paid, and six months unpaid, leave
for working adoptive parents;
■ reforms of the employment tribunals system,
including provision for cost recovery for
management time in vexatious cases;
■ requirements on employers to provide statutory
grievance procedures at the workplace to help
resolve disputes;
■ requirements on employees, in most cases, to
begin these procedures before taking a
complaint to a tribunal;
■ changes to the way tribunals calculate awards,
to take into account whether the procedures
have been used; and
■ rights to time off for trade union learning
representatives.
An Employment Bill making similar provision for
maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay in
Northern Ireland is currently before the Northern
Ireland Assembly.

Employment tribunals
Employment tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints covering a range of
employment rights, including unfair dismissal,
redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex and race
discrimination. New tribunal regulations,
including provisions designed to deter cases with
weak claims and defences, took effect in July 2001.
Further reforms will be brought about by the
Employment Act 2002 when the provisions in Part
Two of the Act are brought into force. Tribunals
received over 112,000 applications in 2001/02.
Northern Ireland has a separate tribunal system.
Labour disputes
In the past 20 years there has been a substantial
decline in working days lost through labour
disputes. In the year to March 2002 there were 165
stoppages of work arising from labour disputes in
the UK, and 584,400 working days were lost as a
result. Stoppages over working conditions
accounted for 43 per cent of days lost, compared
with 34 per cent due to disputes over pay. During
this period 51 per cent of working days lost were
in the public administration and defence sector,
with the next highest sector being transport,
storage and communication, at 17 per cent.
Trade unions and employers'
organisations
Trade unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. As well as negotiating pay and other
terms and conditions of employment with
employers, they provide benefits and services, such
as educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases.
In autumn 2001 there were 7.6 million trade
union members in the UK according to the
Labour Force Survey, a reduction of 30,000 since
20007 The proportion of employees who are
union members was 29.1 per cent (compared with
32.3 per cent in 1995), and the proportion among
5 There are two main sources of information on trade union
membership: the ONS Labour Force Survey and data provided by
trade unions to the Certification Office. Differences in coverage
can result in different estimates. For example, the Certification
Officer's figure for trade union membership in 2000/01 was
7.8 million, compared with the Labour Force Survey figure in
autumn 2001 of 7.6 million members among those in
employment.
those in employment was 26.8 per cent
(29.0 per cent in 1995).
Trade union membership is more prevalent
among older employees, those with long service
and those in the public sector. By occupation,
union membership is highest among
professionals, nearly half of whom were trade
union members in 2001. The long-term decline
in membership has been particularly noticeable
where membership has traditionally been high -
among male employees, manual workers and
those in production industries. Public
administration has the highest density of union
members, around 60 per cent of all employees.
Sectors with relatively few union members
include agriculture, forestry and fishing, hotels
and restaurants, and wholesale and retail trade.
The largest union in the United Kingdom is the
public service union UNISON which has around
1.3 million members. Other unions with
membership over 500,000 are:
■ Amicus - a new union formed in January
2002 by the merger of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union and the
Manufacturing, Science and Finance union;
■ the Transport and General Workers Union;
and
■ the GMB - a general union with members in
a wide range of industries.
At the end of March 2002 there were 199 trade
unions on the list maintained by the Certification
Officer, who, among other duties, is responsible
for certifying the independence of trade unions.
Entry on the list is voluntary but to be eligible a
trade union must show that it consists wholly or
mainly of workers and that its principal purposes
include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers or between workers and
employers’ associations. A further 20 unions were
known to the Certification Officer.
Trades Union Congress
The national body of the trade union movement
in England and Wales is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), founded in 1868. In autumn
2001 its affiliated membership comprised
71 trade unions, which together represented some
6.7 million people.
135
Social and cultural affairs
11 The labour market
There are six TUC regional councils for England
and a Wales Trades Union Council. The TUC
annual Congress meets in September to discuss
matters of concern to trade unionists. A General
Council represents the TUC between annual
meetings.
In Scotland there is a separate national body, the
Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which UK
unions usually affiliate their Scottish branches.
Nearly all trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland Committee
of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU).
Most trade unionists in Northern Ireland are
members of unions affiliated to the ICTU, while
the majority also belong to unions based in Great
Britain, which are affiliated to the TUC.
The TUC participates in international trade union
activity, through its affiliation to the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also
nominates the British workers’ delegation to the
annual International Labour Conference.
The TUC initiated the TUC Partnership Institute
in 2001 to provide an advisory and training
service to help unions and employers establish
partnerships at work.
Trade union and industrial relations law
Among the legal requirements governing trade
unions are:
■ All individuals have the right not to be
dismissed or refused employment (or the
services of an employment agency) because
of membership or non-membership of a
trade union.
■ Where a union is recognised by an employer
for collective bargaining purposes, union
officials are entitled to paid time off for
undertaking certain trade union duties and
training. The employer is also obliged to
disclose information to the union for
collective bargaining purposes.
■ A trade union must elect every member of its
governing body, its general secretary and its
president. Elections must be held at least
every five years and be carried out by a secret
postal ballot under independent scrutiny.
■ If a trade union wishes to set up a political
fund, its members must first agree in a secret
ballot a resolution adopting those political
objectives as an aim of the union. The union
must also ballot its members every ten years
to maintain the fund. Union members have a
statutory right to opt out of contributing to
the fund.
■ For a union to have the benefit of statutory
immunity when organising industrial action,
the action must be wholly or mainly due to a
trade dispute between workers and their own
employer. Industrial action must not involve
workers who have no dispute with their own
employer (so-called ‘secondary’ action) or
involve unlawful forms of picketing. Before
calling for industrial action, a trade union
must obtain the support of its members
in a secret postal ballot.
Employers' organisations
Many employers in the UK are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters, while
others are also trade associations concerned with
commercial matters in general. Employers’
organisations are usually established on an
industry basis rather than a product basis, for
example, the Engineering Employers’ Federation.
A few are purely local in character or deal with a
sector of an industry or, for example, with small
businesses; most are national and are concerned
with the whole of an industry. At the end of
March 2002, there were 94 employers’ associations
on the list maintained by the Certification Officer
and a further 90 were known to the Certification
Officer.
Most national organisations belong to the CBI
(see page 345), which represents around 200,000
businesses.
ACAS
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory body
with a general duty of promoting the
improvement of industrial relations. ACAS aims
to operate through the voluntary co-operation of
employers, employees and, where appropriate,
their representatives. Its main functions are
collective conciliation; provision of arbitration
and mediation; advisory mediation services for
preventing disputes and improving industrial
relations through the joint involvement of
employers and employees; and the provision of a
136
Social and cultural affairs
11 The labour market
public enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights, and in
April 2001 introduced a new voluntary arbitration
system for resolving unfair dismissal claims. The
overall number of complaints was 105,304 in
2000/01. In 2000/01 there were a total of 17,657
complaints of discrimination on the grounds of
sex, race or disability, compared with 14,543 in
1999/2000. Over 70 per cent of all cases handled
by ACAS were settled at the conciliation stage or
were withdrawn and did not reach a tribunal.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations Agency,
an independent statutory body, provides services
similar to those provided by ACAS in Great
Britain.
Health and safety at work
There has been a long-term decline in injuries to
employees in the UK, partly reflecting a change in
industrial structure away from the traditional
heavy industries, which tend to have higher risks.
In Great Britain in 2001/02 there were 249 deaths
of employees and the self-employed from injuries
at work, which represented a fatal injury rate of
almost one per 100,000 workers. Falls from a
height, being struck by a moving/flying object and
being struck by a moving vehicle continue to be
the three most common kinds of accident,
accounting for 27 per cent, 17 per cent and 16 per
cent of fatal injuries respectively.
The principal legislation in this area is the Health
and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes
general duties on everyone concerned with work
activities, including employers, the self-employed,
employees, and manufacturers and suppliers of
materials for use at work. Associated Acts and
regulations deal with particular hazards and types
of work. Employers with five or more staff must
prepare a written statement of their health and
safety policy and bring it to the attention of their
staff.
The Department for Work and Pensions has lead
responsibility for the sponsorship of the Health
and Safety Commission and Health and Safety
Executive. Other government departments have
specific health and safety responsibilities, for
example, the Department of Trade and Industry
for civil nuclear matters and the Department for
Transport for rail passenger safety.
Northern Ireland
The regulatory regime for health and safety at
work in Northern Ireland broadly mirrors that of
Great Britain. The principal legislation is
contained in the Health and Safety at Work
(Northern Ireland) Order 1978 as amended by the
Health and Safety at Work (Amendment)
(Northern Ireland) Order 1998. The Health and
Safety Executive for Northern Ireland has primary
responsibility for enforcing legislation. In 2001/02
there were nine fatal accidents in the workplace.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) has
responsibility for developing policy on health and
safety at work in Great Britain, including
proposals for new or revised regulations and
approved codes of practice. Recent work has
concentrated on a simpler and more effective
system of regulation.
The HSC has advisory committees covering
subjects such as toxic substances, genetic
modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each covering a specific
sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the
primary instrument for carrying out the HSC’s
policies and has day-to-day responsibility for
enforcing health and safety law.
In premises such as offices, shops, warehouses,
restaurants and hotels, legislation is enforced by
inspectors appointed by local authorities, working
under guidance from the HSE.
The HSE issued 11,058 enforcement notices in
2000/01, compared with 11,340 in 1999/2000.
About 70 per cent of these notices were issued in
the manufacturing and construction industries.
The HSE’s Technology Division provides technical
advice on industrial health and safety matters. The
Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), an agency of
the HSE, aims to ensure that risks to health and
safety from work activities are properly controlled.
This involves HSL in two main areas: operational
support through incident investigations and
studies of workplace situations; and longer-term
work on analysis and resolution of occupational
health and safety problems.

certain needs or stages of the life cycle. Help may
be provided to children and families; older people
and survivors (such as widows); those who are
physically disabled or sensorily impaired; people
with learning disabilities or mental health
problems; and low earners and the unemployed.
Social protection by central government and local
authorities is principally provided through the
social security system and personal social services.
The social security system is designed to secure a
basic standard of living for people in financial
need. It provides income during periods of
inability to earn (including periods of sickness and
unemployment), pensions for retired people,
financial help for low-income families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement.
The provision of these benefits is administered by
the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in
Great Britain and the Social Security Agency of the
Department for Social Development in Northern
Ireland. Tax credits are administered by the Inland
Revenue.
Since April 2002 the DWP has administered
benefits and provided advice principally through
the Jobcentre Plus network and the Pension
Service, which replaced elements of the Benefits
Agency and the Employment Service (see page
130).
Personal social services refers to the assessment for
and provision of practical help and support for
older people, people with disabilities, vulnerable
children and young people, those with mental
health problems or learning disabilities, and their
families and carers. Major services include
residential, day care, short-break and domiciliary
services (provided for people needing support to
live in their own homes). In certain circumstances,
direct cash payments may be made to enable
individuals to obtain relevant services for
themselves.
In Great Britain, these services are predominantly
provided by local authorities with social services
responsibilities and by the voluntary and not-for-
profit sectors. The social services departments of
local authorities are responsible for ensuring the
direct provision or commissioning of services and
ensuring that people receive a high-quality service,
regardless of the provider. In Northern Ireland
services are provided by Health and Social Services
(HSS) Trusts.
Central government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and overseeing
standards. There are plans, subject to
parliamentary approval, for establishing a new
body to be called the Commission for Social Care
Inspection, which will inspect all aspects of
personal social services.
Various voluntary and charitable organisations also
offer care, assistance and support to vulnerable
members of society. Examples include the Anchor
Trust, which provides retirement housing,
residential and home care services to older people,
and Barnardo’s, which aims to enable children to
address problems like abuse, homelessness and
poverty, and to tackle the challenges of disability.
Citizens Advice Bureaux (see page 476) offer free,
confidential, impartial and independent advice on
many social issues including benefits, housing,
debt, legal matters, employment, and immigration.
They also use evidence from this work to try to
influence policies and improve services.

Expenditure
Average social protection expenditure per head
within the EU was € 5,793 in 1999. UK expenditure
per head was just above this average, at €5,872 (see
Figure 12.1). These figures include government
expenditure on social security and personal social
services, sick pay paid by employers, and payments
made from occupational and personal pension
schemes. They are expressed in purchasing power
parities (which take account of the general level of
prices within each country) in order to allow
direct comparisons. Different levels of expenditure
therefore reflect differences in social protection
systems, demographic structures, unemployment
rates and other social, institutional and economic
factors.
Social security is the largest single area of UK
government spending. Spending on social security
benefits, including tax credits, was £110 billion in
2001/02. Figure 12.2 shows how social security
benefits expenditure (excluding tax credits) is
distributed between different kinds of recipients
within Great Britain. In the 2002 Budget it was
announced that resources for social security
benefits and tax credits in the UK would increase
to £136 billion in 2005/06.
General taxation provides over half the income for
the social security programme, employers’
National Insurance contributions (NICs) around a
quarter and employees’ NICs about a fifth.
In 2000/01 gross expenditure on personal social
services by local authorities was £13 billion in
England. Expenditure on older people accounted
for 46 per cent of the total and children accounted
for 22 per cent (see Figure 12.4). In Scotland
expenditure on social work services was
£1.6 billion. Local authorities in Wales spent
£681 million.
In the 2002 Budget the Chancellor of the
Exchequer announced that resources for personal
social services in England would grow by 6 per
cent a year in real terms over the next three years,
and that spending on the National Health Service
(NHS) would rise by 7.4 per cent a year for five
years (see page 167).

Beveridge Report
The 60th anniversary of the publication of the
Social and Allied Services Report (usually called the
'Beveridge Report', after its author) occurred in
2002. The report led to a complete overhaul of the
social security system.
Large-scale unemployment in the 1930s had exposed
the weaknesses of piecemeal provision. The report
recommended a comprehensive system of National
Insurance, to be topped up where necessary by
national assistance and voluntary insurance. Benefit
rates would be raised and cover extended to a wider
range of people and risks. This 'social security' system
would:
■ replace earnings when they were lost or
interrupted by unemployment, sickness or
accident;
■ contributory, paid to people who have made
the required contributions to the National
Insurance Fund (see below); and
■ benefits which are neither means-tested nor
contributory (mainly paid to cover extra
costs, for example of disability, or paid
universally, for example Child Benefit).
Most benefits are increased annually in line with
percentage increases in retail prices. The main
benefits (payable weekly) are described on pages
142 and 152. Table 12.3 gives the numbers of
recipients of key benefits and tax credits.

■ provide for retirement after a certain age;
■ provide against loss of support by the death of
another person; and
■ meet the cost of events such as birth, death or
marriage.
The report recommended a flat rate of subsistence
benefit - everyone would receive the same
regardless of previous earnings. Similarly, there
would be a flat rate of contribution, regardless of
earnings or of the assumed degree of risk for
particular individuals or forms of employment. This
security was designed to provide the minimum
income needed for subsistence. It left room for
additional voluntary insurance, but did not assume
it.
The post-war Government adopted many of the
Beveridge Report's recommendations and it
represents a key milestone in the development of
social protection within the UK.
National Insurance contributions (NICs)
With the exception of a small National Health
Service allocation, all National Insurance
contributions are paid into the National Insurance
Fund. All contributory benefits and their
administrative costs are paid out of the Fund.

Selected key benefits and tax credits
(at April 2002)
The basic State Retirement Pension is a taxable
weekly benefit payable, if the contribution conditions
have been met, to women from the age of 60 and
men from the age of 65 (from 2020, the state
pension age for both men and women will be 65).
The basic pension is £75.50 for a single person and
£120.70 for a married couple - lower rates apply for
those who have not paid full contributions. It is not
possible for people in work to choose to contract out
of the basic scheme. There is an additional state
pension scheme (see page 145), although many
people contract out of this and belong instead to
occupational schemes (run by employers), or personal
pension plans (see page 145).
A non-contributory retirement pension of £45.20 a
week is payable to people who are over 80 years of
age, satisfy certain residence conditions and receive
little or no state pension. People whose pensions do
not give them enough to live on may be entitled to
the Minimum Income Guarantee (see below).
Child Benefit \s a tax-free, universal, non-contributory
payment of £15.75 a week for the eldest qualifying
child and £10.55 for each other child. It is not
affected by income or savings and is payable for
children up to the age of 16, and for those up to 19
who continue in full-time, non-advanced education.
Income Support \s payable to certain people aged 16
or over who are not required to be available for work,
and whose savings are below £8,000 (£12,000 for
people aged over 60 and £16,000 for people in
residential care or a nursing home). Those eligible
include lone parents, pensioners, carers, and long¬
term sick and disabled people. Income Support is
based on circumstances, including age and whether
the claimant is single, a lone parent or has a partner.
The current rates are £32.50 for a person aged
16-17, £42.70 for someone aged 18-24 and £53.95
a week for people aged 25 or over. Couples aged 18
or over receive £84.65. There are additional
allowances for dependent children and premium
payments for those with extra expenses, for example,
people with disabled children.
Minimum Income Guarantee is a benefit for those
aged 60 or over. It tops up a person's income to
£98.15 a week for a single person or £ 149.80 for a
couple. The top-up may be higher for people with
disabilities, carers or for those with dependent
children.
Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) gives working
families with children additional financial help. It is
administered by the Inland Revenue and either paid
directly or through workers' pay packets. Families
(couples or lone parents) on low or middle incomes
are eligible if they:
■ have one or more children;
■ work at least 16 hours a week;
■ are resident and entitled to work in the UK; and
■ have savings of £8,000 or less.
WFTC is made up of:
■ basic credit - £62.50 per week;
■ credit for working over 30 hours per week -
£11.65; and
■ tax credit for each child of £26.45 (aged up to 15
years) and £27.20 (aged 16 to 18).
contributory Jobseeker’s Allowance, is dependent
upon the payment of NICs. Employers, employees
and self-employed people are all liable to pay
contributions once their earnings exceed a certain
amount. Where an employer operates an
occupational pension scheme, the employee and
his or her employer pay a reduced rate of
contribution. The current NIC rates are set out
on the Inland Revenue website
(www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/rates). In general, self-
employed people make smaller payments and
receive fewer benefits.
In the 2002 Budget the Chancellor of the
Exchequer announced that there would be an
increase in the rates of NICs from April 2003. This
will be an additional 1 per cent contribution by
employers, employees and the self-employed on all
earnings above £89 per week.
Social care providers
Providers of care range from families, friends and
volunteers to large statutory, voluntary and private

sector organisations. In England and Wales, the
Care Standards Act 2000, and, in Scotland the
Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001
established independent bodies to inspect and
regulate social care services. Their remit includes a
wide range of care services such as care homes
and children’s homes, private hospitals and clinics.
The National Care Standards Commission
(NCSC), the Scottish Commission for the
Regulation of Care and the Care Standards
Inspectorate for Wales all took over their
regulatory powers in April 2002.
Informal carers
Much of the care given to older people and
disabled people comes from families, volunteers
and self-help groups. In 2000 one in six adults in
Britain was caring for a sick, disabled or elderly
person, and nearly one in ten was the main
support for the person being looked after. Around
7 million adults in 5 million homes were
providing care to their relatives or friends. Women
were more likely to be carers than men (18 per
cent compared with 14 per cent).
Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) is paid to full-time
carers who are:
■ aged 16 or over and under 65; and
■ spending at least 35 hours a week looking
after someone who is getting Attendance
Allowance, Disability Living Allowance at the
middle or highest rate for personal care or
Constant Attendance Allowance.
The rate in April 2002 was £42.45 a week. For
every complete tax year it is received, this is
counted as a contribution to the State Second
Pension (see page 145). ICA is not paid if the carer
is earning above £75 a week.
The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000,
implemented in England and Wales from 2001,
provides carers with the right to have their need
for services assessed by the local authority, and for
the local authority to provide services direct to
carers. The Act also extends the power of local
authorities to offer direct payments to carers.
The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act
2002 (see page 147) entitles carers to have their
ability to provide care assessed independently of
the needs of the person receiving care. The Act
also provides carers in Scotland with the right to
have their views taken into account when any
assessment of needs is carried out.
Local authorities
Local authority social services departments
provide a wide range of support and services to
children and their families, older people and those
with learning disabilities, physical disabilities or
mental health needs. This includes the assessment
of needs, the provision of help, such as meals on
wheels and home help, and the running of day
centres and residential homes. Efforts are made
in the provision of services to promote
independence and choice, and to help disabled
people live as independently as possible. A new
framework for delivering housing support
services, the Supporting People Programme, will
begin in England and Wales in 2003 (see page
293).
In September 2001 social services departments in
England employed 211,300 staff (full-time
equivalent). This was 3 per cent fewer than in
September 2000 and 10 per cent fewer than in
September 1996. These reductions mainly reflect
the transfer of some children’s posts to education
directorates and the greater use of the private
sector for residential care and home care (see
Table 12.5). In Scotland total numbers of staff
were 34,700 for October 2001. This was 1.5 per
cent higher than October 2000. In Wales there
143
Social and cultural affairs
12 Social protection
were 18,675 full-time equivalent staff in social
service departments in September 2001, a 3 per
cent increase since September 2000.
The Care Standards Act 2000 established separate
bodies in England and Wales to regulate the social
care workforce. The General Social Care Council
in England and the Care Council for Wales have
responsibility for promoting high standards of
conduct and training for social care workers by
agreeing and issuing statutory codes of practice,
setting up a register of social care workers, dealing
with matters of conduct, and regulating and
supporting social work education and training.
The Scottish equivalent, the Scottish Social
Services Council, was set up by the Regulation of
Care (Scotland) Act 2001. The Council became
operational in 2001.
Residential and nursing homes
Care homes provide a range of care for people
who cannot manage at home. Residents who need
regular and frequent care from a registered nurse
are cared for in homes which are registered to
provide nursing care. Most care homes are run by
the independent sector. Residents’ care and
accommodation is funded in a number of ways:
by the NHS where the person’s primary need is for
Social services star ratings
In May 2002 the Social Services Inspectorate
published the first-ever star ratings for local councils
in England. Each council's performance across all
social services was rated on a scale of zero to three
stars. The ratings are intended to improve public
information about the current performance of
services. Eight councils (5 per cent) achieved a
three-star rating, 50 (33 per cent) were awarded
two stars and 82 (55 per cent) got a one-star
rating. Ten councils (7 per cent) received a no-star
rating.

the individual themselves following a means test.
The elements covered by the means test vary in
England, Scotland and Wales (see page 147).
Older people
People aged 65 and over represent the fastest
growing section of the community (see chapter 9).
About 52 per cent (£55.8 billion) of social security
benefit expenditure in Great Britain is on older
people (see Figure 12.2).

Pensions
Additional state pension
It is possible to build up an additional state
pension based on National Insurance
contributions and earnings. Until recently this was
known as the State Earnings-Related Pension
Scheme (SERFS), but on 6 April 2002 the State
Second Pension was introduced to reform SERFS.
Any SERFS entitlement that has already been built
up is protected, both for those who have already
retired and for those who have not yet reached
pensionable age.
The State Second Pension provides a more
generous additional state pension for low and
moderate earners, and for certain carers and
people with a long-term illness or disability who
have not been able to make contributions.
According to the Pension Service, around 18
million people will benefit from the reforms.
Occupational pensions
In 2000/01, according to the DWP’s Family
Resources Survey, 56 per cent of employees and
43 per cent of the self-employed were contributing
to either an occupational or a personal pension
scheme or both. About 10.3 million employees in
the UK are acquiring rights to occupational
pensions.
An occupational pension scheme is an
arrangement employers make to provide pensions
for their employees when they retire. These
schemes may also provide a tax-free lump sum on
retirement, and benefits for the dependants of an
employee if he or she dies. Many employers
provide occupational pension schemes and
contribute more to them than the employee does.
Two-thirds of large private sector employers
(those with 20 or more employees) offer some
form of pension provision. All employers with five
or more employees are required to provide their
employees with access to a stakeholder pension
scheme (see below) if they do not provide access
to an occupational scheme or to a personal
pension with an employer contribution of at least
3 per cent.
There are two main types of occupational pension
scheme:
Final salary schemes, which offer a predetermined
level of pension benefit, expressed as a fixed
proportion of the employee’s final salary for every
complete year as a scheme member. The scheme
gives the member the option to convert part of the
pension to a tax-free lump sum or may specifically
provide a separate tax-free lump sum; and
Money purchase schemes, in which the
contributions of the employer and the employee
are invested. The size of the fund depends on the
amount of these contributions and the
performance of the investment. When an
employee retires or leaves the scheme, he or she
can receive a proportion of the fund as a tax-free
lump sum, while the remainder must be used to
purchase an annuity. An annuity is an
arrangement by which a life assurance company
pays a regular income, usually for life, in return
for a lump-sum premium.
All pension rights built up after 6 April 1997 using
final salary or money purchase schemes are
protected against inflation.
Since 6 April 2001 members of occupational
pension schemes have also been able to take out a
personal pension or a stakeholder pension (see
below) to build up extra pension provided they
meet certain conditions. The main condition is
that earnings from all employment do not exceed
£30,000 a year.
Personal pensions
Personal pensions provide another way of making
regular savings for retirement. Financial services
companies, such as insurance companies, banks,
investment companies and building societies, offer
these plans and employers may make
contributions in addition to those of employees.
The money in the fund is invested to provide a
pension when the owner retires.
Stakeholder pensions are a form of personal
pension introduced by the Government in April
2001 to provide a pension option for people who
do not have access to a good occupational or
personal pension. Regulations provide that
transfers can be made without charge from one
stakeholder pension to another arrangement
(including a different stakeholder) and for people
to vary the amount that they contribute to the
scheme. The annual administration charge must
not exceed 1 per cent of fund value.
According to the Association of British Insurers,
over 815,000 stakeholder pensions were sold
between 6 April 2001 and 1 April 2002. Of these,
145
Social and cultural affairs
12 Social protection
around 100,000 were used to contract out of the
additional state pension.
Regulation
The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority
(OPRA) is the regulator of pension arrangements
offered by employers and the registrar for
occupational and personal pension schemes in the
UK. It ensures that pension schemes comply with
the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions (Northern
Ireland) Order 1995, which aimed to make
pensions more secure. OPRA’s Pension Schemes
Registry maintains a register of all UK tax-
approved occupational and personal pension
schemes with two or more members, and offers a
service for tracing pension schemes when people
have lost touch
(www.opra.gov.uk/registry/regmenu.shtml).
The Pensions Ombudsman deals with complaints
of maladministration against occupational and
personal pension schemes and adjudicates on
disputes. The Office of the Pensions Advisory
Service (OPAS) gives help and advice to people
who have problems with their pensions.
The Pension Service
In April 2002 the Department for Work and
Pensions set up new arrangements to improve the
service received by pensioners and those who are
planning for their retirement. The Pension Service
works out and pays the amount of State Retirement
Pension and Minimum Income Guarantee to which
people are entitled. It also offers advice, and works
in partnership with local organisations to help
deliver related services.
Pension review
An independent review by Alan Pickering,
published in July 2002, made a number of far-
reaching recommendations for the simplification
of pension legislation, including a new Pensions
Act which would repeal or consolidate existing
legislation on private pensions. The Government
will consider the report, a related report on the
commercial savings market (see page 461) and a
forthcoming Inland Revenue report on the tax
rules regarding pensions, and produce a set of
proposals for pension reform. It has announced its
intention to issue a Green Paper with these
proposals in autumn 2002.
Other financial support
In addition to the State Pension (see page 142),
people aged 60 or over are eligible for other
benefits.
A Winter Fuel Payment of £200 is available to
people aged 60 and over. It provides help towards
the extra costs of keeping warm in winter. A Cold
Weather Payment is also available to those on
Minimum Income Guarantee (see page 142). This
helps towards extra heating costs when there is a
spell of cold weather in the claimant’s area. Both
payments are paid automatically. Free NHS
prescriptions and eye tests are provided to those
aged 60 or over. People on Minimum Income
Guarantee can also get free NHS dental treatment,
wigs and fabric supports, vouchers towards the
cost of glasses or contact lenses, and refunds of
necessary travel costs to hospitals for NHS
treatment (including check-ups). Pensioners aged
75 and over can claim a free television licence.
In Great Britain men and women aged 60 or over
and a range of people with disabilities are entitled
to a minimum of half fare travel on public
transport. Local authorities may provide more
generous concessions and some offer free travel.
In April 2002 free bus travel was introduced across
the whole of Wales, entitling all women over 60,
men over 65 and registered disabled people to free
transport on local buses. The Northern Ireland
Concessionary Fares Scheme currently offers free
travel on all public transport in Northern Ireland
to men and women aged 65 or over, those who are
registered blind and those in receipt of a war
disabled pension. The Northern Ireland Scheme is
currently under review, with the aim of
considering how it could be extended to more
groups of people.
Care services for older people
In England spending by local authorities on older
people amounted to £5.9 billion in 2000/01, 46
per cent of total local authority spending on
personal social services. The largest single category
of expenditure is for ‘residential provision’, which
accounts for 61 per cent of all expenditure on
older people. A third of this residential provision
is accounted for by nursing home placements and
just under two-thirds by residential care home
placements. In Wales £284 million was spent by
local authorities on older people. Residential

Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act
2002
Among other things, this Act:
■ provides for free personal care for older people
and nursing care for all who need it from July
2002;
■ allows people to make top-up payments if they
wish to enter more expensive accommodation
than that which the local authority would
normally pay for (they may also defer these
payments until their home is sold after death);
and
■ expands access to direct payments for non-
residential service users, giving people the ability
to purchase their own services.
Over the past few years there has been a fall in the
number of residential places provided for older
people in England by the public sector and an
increase in independent sector provision (see
Table 12.5). In 1996 the public sector in England
provided 24 per cent of places for older people,
but this fell to 17 per cent by 2001.
Wherever possible, services are designed to help
older people live at home. These services may
include advice and help given by social workers,
domestic help, the provision of meals in the
home, sitters-in, night attendants and laundry
services, as well as direct payments, day centres,
lunch clubs and recreational facilities.
Following publication of Improving Health in
Wales-A Plan for the NHS with its Partners and the
introduction of the Health and Social Care Act 2001,
the Welsh Assembly Government implemented a
policy to ensure that the services of a registered
nurse are free of charge in all care settings. Funding
has been set at a level of £100 a week per individual
self-funder who is assessed as needing nursing care.
Families and children
Financial support
Pregnant employees have the right to take a
minimum of 18 weeks’ maternity leave. Most
receive Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18 weeks to
any woman who has been working for the same
employer for 26 weeks and who earns on average
at least £75 a week. Most women receive at least
90 per cent of their average weekly earnings for
the first six weeks and a flat rate of £75 a week for
the remaining 12 weeks.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are self-
employed or have recently changed jobs or left
their job, may qualify for a weekly Maternity
Allowance, which is payable for up to 18 weeks at a
standard rate of £75.
From April 2003 Statutory Maternity Pay and
Maternity Allowance will be extended to 26 weeks
and the flat rate after the first six weeks will be
increased to £100 per week (or 90 per cent of
average weekly earnings if this is less). Ordinary
maternity leave will also be extended from 18
weeks to 26 weeks and additional (unpaid)
maternity leave will be extended to a further 26
weeks - giving most mothers the possibility of up
to one year off in total.
Fathers will have a new right to two weeks of paid
paternity leave, which can usually be taken within
two months of the child’s birth. Statutory
Paternity Pay will be at the same standard rate as
Statutory Maternity Pay - £100 per week (or 90
per cent of average weekly earnings if this is less)
from April 2003.
People who adopt a child after April 2003 may be
eligible to new rights to time off work. Those
eligible will be able to take 26 weeks of paid
adoption leave followed by a further 26 weeks of
additional (unpaid) leave. This will give adoptive
parents the same length of leave - a total of one
year - as mothers on maternity leave. Statutory
Adoption Pay will be at the same standard rate as
Statutory Maternity Pay - £100 per week (or 90
per cent of average weekly earnings if this is less)
from April 2003.
At the same time, the Government will be
introducing a right for parents of children aged
under six or of disabled children aged under 18 to
request flexible working patterns. Their
employers will have a duty to consider these
requests seriously.
Subject to certain qualifying requirements, both
mothers and fathers are entitled to 13 weeks
unpaid parental leave, up until the child’s fifth
birthday (18 weeks until the child’s 18th birthday
for disabled children).

12 Social protection
Families who receive a low-income benefit or tax
credit may be able to get a Sure Start Maternity
Grant of £300 to help with the cost of buying
things for the new baby.
The main social security benefit for children is
Child Benefit. Additional financial help to families
is available through the Working Families’ Tax
Credit (see page 142).
The introduction of a Child Tax Credit to provide
a single system of income-related support for
families with children was announced in the 2002
Budget. It will begin in April 2003 and will bring
together the support for children currently
provided through the Working Families’ and
Disabled Person’s Tax Credits, the Children's Tax
Credit, Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance.
It was also announced in the Budget that personal
mentors would be introduced to help lone parents
into work. Eligibility for Childcare Tax Credit
would be extended.
Other support for families and children
Local authorities in England and Wales and
FFealth and Social Services Trusts in Northern
Ireland are required to safeguard and promote the
welfare of any children in need and, so far as is
consistent with that, to promote the upbringing of
children by their parents, by providing a range of
services to meet their assessed needs. The services
which may be provided include advice, guidance,
counselling, help in the home and family centres.
Help can be provided to the immediate family of
the child in need or to any other member of the
family, if it is done with a view to safeguarding
and promoting the child’s welfare. Local
authorities can provide these services directly or
arrange them through another agency such as a
voluntary organisation. They are also required to
publicise the help available to families in need.
Local authorities also help people fleeing domestic
violence, often working with specialist voluntary
organisations that provide refuges where women
and children receive short-term accommodation
and support pending a more permanent solution.
In July 2002 the Government announced a
combined £1.5 billion budget by 2005/06 for Sure
Start,1 Early Years and Childcare in England. It
also announced the creation of a single
1 The Sure Start Programme (see also page 103) supports local
projects for families with children under four years of age.
interdepartmental unit, which has the following
tasks:
■ to establish children’s centres in
disadvantaged areas, combining childcare
with early education, family support, health
services, and training and employment advice.
Children’s centres will build on existing
programmes like Sure Start, neighbourhood
nurseries and early excellence centres;
■ to support the existing and planned 522 Sure
Start programmes, nine pilots and 50 Mini
Sure Starts in rural areas and pockets of
deprivation;
■ to create a further 250,000 new childcare
places by 2006, in addition to the existing
target of new places for 1.6 million children
by 2004;and
■ to ensure parents are better informed about
childcare opportunities.
Day care for children
Day care facilities are provided for young children
by childminders, voluntary agencies, private
nurseries and local authorities. In 2001 in England
and Wales there were 318,000 childminder places
for children under eight, 297,000 day nursery
places, 161,000 out-of-school clubs, and 354,000
playgroup and pre-school places. Northern Ireland
has 20,000 funded playgroup and pre-school
places and around 40,000 registered childcare
places.
According to the 2001 Childcare Workforce
Survey, published by the Department for
Education and Skills in April 2002:
■ there were 274,520 professionals working in
the childcare sector in England, an increase of
21 per cent since 1998;
■ the number of providers of childcare rose,
with an increase in the number of nursery
schools from 5,500 to 7,800, and in out-of
school providers from 2,640 to 4,900; and
■ two-thirds of childminders had completed an
approved pre-registration course.
In Scotland there were 2,079 nursery schools and
2,249 out-of-school providers of day care in 2001.
The Early Education and Childcare Workforce
148
Social and cultural affairs
12 Social protection
Survey estimated that in April/May 2000 there
were 32,000 people working in the childcare sector
in Scotland.
In September 2001 the Office for Standards in
Education (OFSTED) (see page 120) took over
responsibility from local authorities for the
regulation of day care providers for children in
England. The newly formed Early Years
Directorate of OFSTED now registers and inspects
nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools, creches,
out-of-school care and childminders for children
up to the age of eight. Childcare Inspectors
inspect the suitability of premises, the suitability
of the people who will be with the children, and
the welfare and development of the children.
In Scotland, local authority responsibility for
regulation of day care providers for children
transferred to the new Scottish Commission for
the Regulation of Care in April 2002. New
national care standards for early education and
childcare up to the age of 16 have been published,
and HM Inspectorate of Education and the
Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care
are developing an inspection regime to be used in
conjunction with these standards and other key
documents. Local HSS Trusts in Northern Ireland
are responsible for the regulation of day care
providers. Regulation covers provision for
children up to the age of 12.
Child Support Agency
The function of the Child Support Agency
(www.csa.gov.uk) is to ensure that parents who live
apart meet their financial responsibilities to their
children. It:
■ assesses claims for child support
maintenance;
■ traces and contacts non-resident parents;
■ helps conclude paternity disputes when a
man denies he is a child’s father; and
■ collects and passes on maintenance payments
to the parent who is caring for the child,
taking action to make the non-resident
parent pay if necessary.
Assessments for child support maintenance are
made using a formula which takes into account
each parent’s income and makes allowance for
essential outgoings.
Child protection
Child protection is the joint concern of a number
of different agencies and professions. Local
authority area child protection committees
determine how the different agencies should co¬
operate to help protect children from abuse and
neglect in their area.
In England and Wales a child may be brought
before a family proceedings court if he or she is
suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm.
The court can commit children to the care of the
local authority under a care order or a supervision
order. Certain pre-conditions have to be satisfied
to justify such an order. These are that significant
harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to a
lack of reasonable parental care or because the
child is beyond parental control. However, an
order is made only if the court is also satisfied that
this will positively contribute to the child’s well¬
being and be in his or her best interests. All courts
have to treat the welfare of children as the
paramount consideration when reaching any
decision about their upbringing. There is a general
principle that, wherever possible, children should
remain at home with their families.
Victoria Climbie and Kennedy McFarlane
Two recent cases have caused concern about various
aspects of the child protection system. Eight year old
Victoria Climbie died of hypothermia in London in
February 2000. Her great-aunt, to whom her parents
had entrusted her care, and her great-aunt's boyfriend
were convicted of her murder in 2001. During the trial
it became apparent that, despite being brought to the
attention of social vvorkers, doctors and the police,
Victoria had not been protected from several months
of abuse and neglect. An independent public inquiry is
looking at the role played by these agencies in order
to make recommendations to prevent such a tragedy
happening again. The final report of the inquiry is
expected towards the end of 2002.
In Scotland a review of child protection was
announced in March 2001, following the death of
three year old Kennedy McFarlane who died after
being hit by her mother's boyfriend. An independent
inquiry concluded that her death could have been
prevented if action had been taken following concerns
raised from repeated referrals and hospital admissions.
An audit of child protection processes across Scotland
will be carried out to assess the consistency and
quality of practice of the agencies involved.

Social and cultural affairs
12 Social protection
In Scotland, children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection may
be brought before a Children’s Hearing, which can
impose a supervision requirement on a child. In
some cases, the supervision requirement will have
a condition attached to it that the child must live
away from home, either with foster parents, in a
children’s home or at a special residence where the
Hearing believes the child will receive the right
help or supervision. Supervision requirements are
reviewed at least once a year until ended by a
Children’s Hearing.
Local authority social services help children who
are considered to be at risk of abuse and hold a
central register of such children. There were
around 30,000 children on child protection
registers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
at 31 March 2001.
Fostering and children's homes
When a child is made the subject of a care order,
the local authority has legal responsibility for the
child. Although it consults with the child’s parents
about where the child should live, the local
authority makes the final decision. Children can
also be accommodated by a local authority
through a voluntary agreement with their parents.
In the year ending 31 March 2001 there were some
38,400 children in foster care and 6,800 in
children’s homes in England (see Table 12.6).
Local authorities and HSS Trusts in Northern
Ireland must also provide accommodation for
children who have no parent or guardian, who
have been abandoned, or whose parents are
unable to provide for them. They have a duty to
ensure that the welfare of children being looked
after away from home is properly safeguarded.
This includes protecting their health, providing
for their education and ensuring contact with
their families. They are as far as possible expected
to work in partnership with the parents of
children who are in their care.
The Children Leaving Care Act 2000 came into
force in England and Wales in October 2001. It is
intended to ensure that young people who leave
care continue to receive the support they need to
make the most of their life chances. Young people
aged 16 and 17 who qualify under the Act will
have a written plan (called a Pathway Plan) agreed
with their responsible authority (and with the
parents where possible) and will be allocated a
personal adviser.

Younger children are placed wherever possible
with foster carers, sometimes as a short-term
measure (for example when parents are
temporarily unable to look after their child
because of illness in the family) or, if necessary, in
the longer-term. Children’s homes can be run by
local authorities, or by private or voluntary
organisations such as Barnardo’s.
Under the Care Standards Act 2000 (see page 144),
all children’s homes are required to register with
the NCSC or its equivalent bodies in Scotland and
Wales. The Commission is responsible for
inspecting all children’s homes to assess the
quality of care provided.
Adoption
There were 5,036 adoption orders in England and
Wales in 2001. An adoption order gives parental
responsibility for a child to the adoptive parent(s).
Under the Adoption Act 1976, adoption orders can
be granted to applicants by the High Court,
County Courts and Magistrates’ Courts.
In August 2001 the National Adoption Standards
for England were published. These standards are
intended to ensure that children, prospective
adopters, adoptive parents and birth families
receive a consistent and high-quality adoption
service no matter where they live. Adoption
standards for Scotland were published in March
2002 and will come into force in 2003. Draft
standards and guidance for Wales were issued in
2001 and standards for Northern Ireland will be
issued at a later date.

Adoption and Children Bill
The Adoption and Children Bill is intended to
replace the Adoption Act 1976 and modernise the
existing legal framework for domestic and inter¬
country adoption. The aim is to improve the
adoption service and promote greater use of
adoption. Among its provisions are measures to:
■ align adoption law with the Children Act 1989
so as to make the child's welfare the paramount
consideration in all decisions to do with
adoption;
■ introduce a new duty on local authorities to
provide an adoption support service and a right
for people affected by adoption to request and
receive an assessment of their needs for such a
service;
■ allow unmarried couples to adopt together - at
present only married couples and single people
are legally allowed to adopt children;
■ reduce delays by providing legal support for the
Adoption Register to suggest matches between
children and approved adopters and through
measures requiring courts to draw up timetables
for adoption;
■ provide for a more consistent approach to the
way in which people can gain access to
information held in adoption agency records, so
that the release of identifying information about
adopted people and birth families happens in a
proper manner and takes account of their views
wherever possible; and
■ improve the legal controls on inter-country
adoption, and the legal controls on arranging
adoptions and advertising children for adoption.
The majority of provisions in the Bill relate to
England and Wales only, but some provisions also
extend to Scotland and/or Northern Ireland.
The Adoption Register for England and Wales
holds information on children waiting to be
adopted and approved adoptive families waiting to
adopt. The aim is to tackle delays in finding
suitable adoptive families where a local family
cannot be found, or the child needs to move away
from the area.
People with a sickness or
disability
The Disability Rights Commission (DRC),
established in Great Britain in April 2000, aims to
eliminate discrimination against disabled people,
promote equal opportunities, encourage good
practice and advise the Government on the
operation of the Disability Discrimination Act
1995 (see page 97). The Equality Commission
(see page 96) has a similar role in Northern
Ireland.
Under the Act, service providers have a duty to
make reasonable adjustment to the way they
provide services to the public, changing their
policies, practices and procedures where
reasonable. From 2004 service providers will have
to take reasonable steps to remove, alter or
provide reasonable means of avoiding physical
features which make it impossible or unreasonably
difficult for disabled people to use their service. A
Code of Practice on the rights of access that
businesses and services must afford disabled
people was issued by the DRC in May 2002. The
Code also provides practical guidance and
information.
From April 2002 new rules apply to people who
want to do paid work while getting Incapacity
Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance (see page
152), Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit (see
page 154) or Income Support (see page 142),
because of illness or disability. The new
arrangements allow claimants to try some paid
work without the need for prior approval from a
doctor.
Care services for people with physical
disabilities
Over the past decade there has been increasing
emphasis on the provision of support services that
enable disabled people to live independently in the
community whenever possible.
Local authority social services departments and
HSS Trusts in Northern Ireland help with social
rehabilitation and adjustment to disability. They
are required to identify the number of disabled
people in their area and to provide and publicise
services. These may include advice on personal
and social problems arising from disability, as well
as occupational, educational, social and
recreational facilities, either at day centres or
elsewhere.

Main benefits available to sick and disabled
people (at April 2002)
Employers are responsible for paying Statutory Sick
Pay to employees up to a maximum of 28 weeks.
There is a single rate of Statutory Sick Pay (£63.25 a
week) for all qualifying employees provided their
average gross weekly earnings are at least £75.
Incapacity Benefit is for people out of work, who have
an incapacity or disability that means it would not be
reasonable to expect them to find work. Entitlement
begins when entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay ends
or, for those who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay,
from the fourth day of sickness. Payments, which
depend on age and the length of illness, range from
£53.50 to £70.95 a week. Older claimants may
receive extra benefits.
Severe Disablement Allowance is a tax-free benefit for
people who have not been able to work for at least
28 weeks because of illness or disability but who
cannot get Incapacity Benefit because they have not
paid enough NICs. The benefit is £42.85 a week, plus
additions of up to £14.90 depending on the person's
age when he or she became incapable of work.
Additions for adult dependants and for children may
also be paid. In April 2001 this Allowance was
abolished for new claims. People under 20, or 25 if
they were in education or training before reaching 20,
may now be able to receive Incapacity Benefit
without having to satisfy the contribution conditions.
Disabled Person's Tax Credit is an allowance for
people who are working but who have an illness or
disability that puts them at a disadvantage in getting
a job. Claimants must be 16 or over, working on
average 16 hours a week or more and be restricted in
the type of work, number of hours or amount they
can earn because of illness or disability. Savings over
£3,000 affect the amount that can be claimed, and
those with savings over £16,000 are not entitled to
the credit.
Disability Living Allowance is a non-contributory tax-
free benefit to help severely disabled people aged
under 65 with extra costs incurred as a result of
disability. Entitlement is measured in terms of
personal care and/or mobility needs. There are two
components; a care component which has three
weekly rates - £56.25, £37.65 and £14.90 - and a
mobility component with two weekly rates, of £39.30
and £14.90. It is payable to those aged three or over
who have severe difficulty walking, or aged five or
over who need help getting around.
Attendance Allowance (AA) is paid to people who
need help to look after themselves. It is paid if a
person becomes ill or disabled on or after his or her
65th birthday and needs help for at least six months.
There are different rates depending on whether the
claimant needs care during the day, during the night,
or both, and on the extent of the disability. However,
AA is not affected by savings or income under normal
circumstances. AA ranges from £37.65 to £56.25 a
week depending on circumstances.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is a benefit for
people who have been disabled by an accident at
work or through a prescribed disease caused by a
particular type of employment. It is usually paid after
a qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is at least
14 per cent or more physically or mentally disabled.
The rate is between £14.07 and £70.35 a week
depending on the level of disablement
People with disabilities may also be eligible for cold
weather payments (see page 142). People injured as
part of activity in the armed forces may be entitled to
War Disablement Pension (WDP) (see page 155).
Other services provided may include adaptations
to homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, stairlifts
and ground-floor toilets), the delivery of cooked
meals, support with personal care at home and
direct payments with which disabled people can
purchase support to meet their assessed need.
Local authorities and voluntary organisations may
provide severely disabled people with residential
accommodation, either on a permanent basis or
temporarily in order to relieve their existing
carers. Special housing may be available for those
able to look after themselves. Some authorities
provide free or subsidised travel for disabled
people on public transport, and they are
encouraged to provide special means of access to
public buildings.
Care services for people with learning
disabilities
The Government encourages the development of
local services for people with learning disabilities
and their families through co-operation between
152
Social and cultural affairs
12 Social protection
health authorities, local authorities, education and
training services, and voluntary and other
organisations.
Local authority social services departments and
HSS Trusts in Northern Ireland are the leading
statutory agencies for planning and arranging
such services. They provide or arrange short-term
care, support for families in their own homes,
residential accommodation and support for
various types of activity outside the home. People
with learning disabilities may also be able to
receive direct payments from local authorities to
let them buy for themselves the support that they
have been assessed as needing. The main aim is to
ensure that, as far as possible, they can lead full
lives in the community. They form the largest
group for local authority-funded day centre places
and the second largest group in residential care.
The National Health Service provides specialist
services when the ordinary primary care services
cannot meet healthcare needs. Residential care is
provided for those with severe or profound
disabilities whose needs can effectively be met
only by the NHS.
People with a mental health problem
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental health problems should have access to
all the services they need as locally as possible.
Under the Care Programme Approach in England,
each service user should receive an assessment
leading to the formulation of an agreed care plan.
A care co-ordinator is appointed to keep in
contact with the service user, and review his or her
care plan regularly in the light of the individual’s
changing needs. The separate Welsh Mental
Health Strategy employs many of the same
principles in delivering services in Wales.
In Scotland, mental health is a clinical priority for
the NHS and each NHS board works with its local
authority care partners, with users of mental
health services and with their carers in order to
develop joint strategies and provide local and
comprehensive mental health services. These plans
are expected to conform with the Framework for
Mental Health Services and to comply with
standards set by the Clinical Standards Board for
Scotland. Northern Ireland has an integrated
health and social services structure allowing a
multi-disciplinary approach to care management.
Arrangements made by social services authorities
for providing care in the community include
direct payments, day centres, social centres and
residential care. Social workers are increasingly
being integrated with mental health staff in
community mental health teams under single
management. These teams include assertive
outreach, crisis resolution, home treatment and
early intervention teams. Assertive outreach is a
way of managing the care of severely mentally ill
people in the community by visiting service users
at home and liaising with other services such as
the GP or social services. Help is usually provided
to find housing, secure an adequate income, and
sustain basic daily living - shopping, cooking, and
washing. Social workers help patients and their
families with problems caused by mental illness.
In certain circumstances they can apply for a
person with a mental disorder to be compulsorily
admitted to and detained in hospital. There are
safeguards for patients to ensure that the law is
used appropriately.
Unemployed people
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is a benefit for
unemployed people seeking work. Claimants must
be capable of, available for, and actively seeking
work. They must normally be at least 18 years of
age and under pension age. JSA can be either
contribution-based or income-based:
■ Contribution-based JSA is available to those
who have paid enough NICs. They are
entitled to a personal JSA for up to six
months (£53.95 a week for a person aged 25
or over), regardless of any savings or partner’s
income.
■ Income-based JSA: those on a low income are
entitled to an income-based JSA, payable for
as long as the jobseeker requires support and
continues to satisfy the qualifying conditions.
The amount a claimant receives comprises an
age-related personal allowance (£53.95 a week
for a single person aged 25 or over), plus
other allowances. Income-based JSA’s benefit
rates are determined by circumstances on a
basis similar to Income Support (see page
142).
Recipients of JSA and people aged under 60 who
receive Income Support can benefit from a Back to
Work Bonus. The aim of this scheme is to
encourage people to keep in touch with the labour
market by undertaking small amounts of work

while claiming benefit. It allows people to accrue a
tax-free lump sum of between £5 and £1,000 if
working part-time while in receipt of Income
Support or JSA. There are a number of other
financial benefits for unemployed people to help
them back into employment, including various
New Deals (see chapter 11).
A pilot scheme for extending eligibility for the
New Deal 25 plus to jobseekers who have been out
of work for 18 months in the previous three years
was also announced in the 2002 Budget.
People on low incomes
People on low incomes can claim Income Support
(see page 142) or, for those over 60, Minimum
Income Guarantee. Other benefits for which
unemployed people and those on low incomes
may be eligible include exemption from NHS
charges, vouchers towards the cost of spectacles,
publicly funded legal help and free school meals
for their children. People on low incomes,
pensioners, widows, widowers and long-term sick
people on Incapacity Benefit may be eligible for
extra help to meet the cost of VAT (value added
tax) on their fuel bills.
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-free
benefit which helps people on low incomes meet
the cost of rented accommodation. The amount
paid depends on personal circumstances, income,
savings, rent and whether other people are sharing
the home. It also normally depends on the general
level of rents for properties with the same number
of rooms in the locality. Most single people under
25 years old who are not lone parents and who are
renting privately have their Housing Benefit
limited to the average cost of a single non-self-
contained room (that is, with shared use of
kitchen and toilet facilities) in the locality.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to meet their
council tax payments (the tax set by local councils
to help pay for services - see page 357). The
scheme offers help to those claiming Income
Support and income-based JSA and others with
low incomes. In Northern Ireland, where council
tax was not introduced, Housing Benefit helps
with the cost of rent and/or rates.
It was announced in the Budget 2002 that a new
Working Tax Credit would be introduced from
April 2003. It will integrate the support currently
available for adults under the Working Families’
and Disabled Person’s Tax Credits. The Working
Tax Credit is designed to help tackle poor work
incentives and persistent poverty among working
people and extend in-work support to people on
low incomes without children or a disability.
The Social Fund provides payments, in the form of
loans or grants, to people on low incomes to help
with expenses which are difficult to meet out of
regular income. These payments can be:
■ budgeting loans for intermittent expenses;
■ community care grants to help, for example,
people resettle into the community from care,
or to remain in the community, to ease
exceptional pressure on families, to set up
home as part of a planned resettlement
programme or to meet certain travel
expenses; and
■ crisis loans to help people in an emergency or
as a result of a disaster where there is serious
risk to health or safety.
Budgeting loans and community care grants are
available only to people who are receiving social
security benefits and some tax credits.
The Social Fund can also provide payments to
help people with the costs of maternity or
funerals, or to help older people with heating
during very cold weather.
Widows and widowers
A new system of bereavement benefits for men
and women was introduced in April 2001.
However, it does not affect men or women who
were already receiving benefits under the previous
scheme as long as they continue to qualify under
the rules.
Bereavement Payment is a one-off payment to
widows under the age of 60, and widowers under
the age of 65 - or those over 60/65 whose spouses
were not entitled to a basic State Retirement
Pension when they died. It is payable as long as
their spouses paid a minimum number of
National Insurance contributions.
Widowed Parent’s Allowance is a regular payment
for widows or widowers bringing up children. It is
154
Social and cultural affairs
12 Social protection
based on the late spouse’s NICs and continues
while the children are still dependent. Bereavement
Allowance is a regular payment, also based on the
late spouse’s NICs, which is payable for 52 weeks.
A number of charities and voluntary organisations
advise and support people who have been bereaved.
In 2001 a consortium of some of the leading bodies
published a set of national standards for
bereavement care. This work will be taken forward
by a new body, the Bereavement Care Standards:
UK Council, the aim of which will be to promote
and share good practice in this area.
War pensioners
In April 2002 the War Pensions Agency was
renamed the Veterans Agency (VA). It is part of
the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and provides
advice and help with new and ongoing claims for
war disablement pensions and war
widows/widowers pensions. The Agency also
provides a single point of contact within the MoD
to obtain information or advice on a diverse range
of veterans' issues, such as service records, medals,
military graves and welfare issues.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service (WPWS),
through working closely with ex-Service
organisations and other statutory and voluntary
organisations, provides a comprehensive advice
and support service for all war pensioners and war
widows/widowers living in the UK and the Irish
Republic.
There are approximately 280,000 beneficiaries of
War Disability and Widows’ Pensions, of whom
22,000 live outside the UK. The majority are
Second World War veterans, but there are also small
numbers of First World War veterans, ex-National
Servicemen and those disabled in recent conflicts
such as Northern Ireland, the Falklands, Bosnia and
the Gulf War. War Disablement Pension is payable
to ex-members of the armed forces as a result of
disability due to service. War Widows’/Widowers’
Pension is payable to widows/widowers of ex¬
members of the armed forces where death is due to
or hastened by service. War Disablement Pension
can also be claimed by civilians, merchant seamen
and members of the Polish forces under British
command, although special conditions apply in
these cases.
The Royal British Legion is a UK charity for those
who have served in the UK armed forces and
their dependants. It provides financial, social and
emotional support, such as advice about benefits
or grants for the purchase of household
appliances.
Asylum seekers
Asylum seekers receive limited cash benefits and
may qualify for other services (see page 92).
Psychological treatment is available for victims of
torture.
In April 2002 the Government introduced the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill (see
page 93), which includes measures to reform the
asylum system.
Arrangements with other
countries
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour, regulations
provide for equality of treatment and the
protection of benefit rights for people who move
between Member States. The regulations also
cover retired pensioners and other beneficiaries
who have been employed, or self-employed, as
well as dependants. Benefits covered include Child
Benefit and those for sickness, maternity,
unemployment, retirement, invalidity, accidents at
work and occupational diseases.
The UK has reciprocal social security agreements
with a number of other countries which also
provide cover for some national insurance benefits
and family benefits.

The state of public health
Current government healthcare strategies
throughout the United Kingdom aim to reduce
avoidable ill health with particular emphasis on
cancer, heart disease and mental illness. Sedentary
lifestyles, obesity, smoking, and excessive
consumption of alcohol have been identified as
significant factors contributing to avoidable ill
health in the UK.
Life expectancy
The increase in life expectancy is one of the most
striking indications of how the nation’s health
improved during the 20th century. Improvements
in the population’s nutrition and housing, and
advances in medicine and technology led to the
prevention or successful treatment of many
diseases which were commonplace, and often fatal,
less than 100 years earlier.
Since the middle of the 19th century the
expectation of life at birth for both females and
males has almost doubled. Neither males nor
females born in England and Wales in 1841 had an
average life expectancy from birth much beyond
40, mainly because of high infant and child
mortality. By 1998-2000 life expectancy at birth
for females in the United Kingdom had risen to
80, and for males to just over 75 years. The local
authority with the highest life expectancy at birth
for males was East Dorset at 79.0 years, while
Westminster (London) had the highest life
expectancy at birth for females at 83.5 years.
Glasgow City had the lowest life expectancy at
birth for both males and females, at 68.7 and 75.7
years respectively.
aged over 65. As average life expectancy in the
United Kingdom has risen, the population at risk
of cancer has grown. About a third of people will
be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and
about a quarter will die from the disease. There are
over 200 different types of cancer but the four
major types - lung, colorectal, breast and prostate
- account for over half of all cases diagnosed.
The incidence of all the major cancers (apart from
breast cancer and malignant melanoma of the
skin) is higher among males than females in all
parts of the UK. The rates for all types of cancer
combined is highest in Scotland and lowest in
England, for both males and females, although the
difference is more marked among males.
Lung cancer is the most common cancer
diagnosed in men and the third most common in
women, with the most significant risk factor being
smoking. Although about twice as many men as
women die from lung cancer, there has been a
notable contrast in the trends of age-standardised1
death rates since the 1970s. By 2000 there were 61
deaths per 100,000 men, compared with 111 per
100,000 in 1974. Among women, lung cancer
deaths rose from 18 per 100,000 in 1971 to 31 per
100,000 in 1988, since when there have been
around 30 deaths per 100,000 each year.
Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly
diagnosed cancer in the United Kingdom in men
and the second for women. Deaths from this form
of cancer have been gradually declining, from 34
per 100,000 men and 26 per 100,000 women in
1971 to 25 and 15 deaths per 100,000 respectively
in 2000.
Cancer
Cancer is a disease that affects mainly older
people, with two-thirds of cases occurring in those

over time (and between the genders) which are independent of
changes in the age structure of the population.
157
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
The recorded incidence of breast and prostate
cancer has risen considerably, partly because
increased awareness and screening have led to
earlier diagnosis. Breast cancer is the most common
cancer diagnosed in women. Between 1986 and
2000 the death rate in the United Kingdom fell by
26 per cent to 31 deaths per 100,000. For prostate
cancer, the slight fall in the death rate since the
early 1990s was preceded by a 51 per cent rise
between 1971 and 1992. Prostate cancer is the
second most common cancer among men.
Circulatory disease
The United Kingdom has one of the highest
premature death rates from circulatory disease
(which includes heart disease and strokes) in
Europe. In 1998 for those aged under 65, the rate
for the United Kingdom was almost twice the rate
in France, the country with the lowest death rate
(see Figure 13.1). A number of risk factors have
been identified, including drinking alcohol,
smoking, obesity and lack of regular exercise.
In 2000 coronary heart disease (CHD) killed
around 156,000 people in the United Kingdom.
Death rates from CFID are higher in Scotland,
Northern Ireland and northern England than they
are in southern England.
Diabetes
Diabetes is a condition that can result in
potentially debilitating complications and
increases the risk of developing other illnesses. It
affects around 1.3 million people in the United
Kingdom. If not properly managed, diabetes can
result in a range of long-term complications, such
as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness,
and foot problems that may lead to amputation.
Figures for 1994 to 1998 showed that prevalence
rates for people with insulin treated diabetes in
England and Wales increased steadily with age and
peaked in the 65 to 74 year old age group.
Prevalence rates for people with non-insulin
treated diabetes increased markedly from the age
of 55, with a peak in the 75 to 84 year old age
group, reflecting the high proportion of late onset
cases.
Asthma
Asthma is a disease of the lungs in which the
airways are unusually sensitive to a wide range of
stimuli, including inhaled irritants and allergens.
The National Asthma Campaign’s 2001 UK
Asthma Audit estimated that 5.1 million people in
the United Kingdom (1 in 8 children and 1 in 13
adults) were being treated for asthma. Research

into the causes and distribution of asthma has
indicated that some of the main factors leading to
recent increases are infections and allergens, these
being far more significant than air pollution.
Infectious diseases
Trends in infectious diseases have changed
considerably over the last 30 years. There has been
a significant decline in the types of infectious
diseases that children tend to suffer. For example,
between 1971 and 2000, the number of cases of
measles notified in the United Kingdom declined
from 155,000 to 3,000. There has been a similar
trend in cases of whooping cough, with 900 cases
in 2000, compared with peaks of 71,000 in 1978
and 1982.
Immunisation
The decline in the occurrence of measles can be
mainly attributed to the number of children
receiving vaccination. The uptake of the measles
vaccine rose from 50 per cent in the mid-1970s
to 80 per cent in 1988, the year in which the
combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
vaccine was introduced. Since then the number
of notifications of measles has fallen
dramatically.
Current government immunisation targets are for
95 per cent of children to be immunised by the
age of two against diphtheria, tetanus, polio,
whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae b
(Hib), meningitis C and measles, mumps and
rubella. In the light of public concerns about the
safety of the MMR vaccine, coverage in 2000/01
fell to 88 per cent, the lowest level since 1990.
In 1999 the United Kingdom was the first country
in the world to introduce immunisation against
Group C meningococcal disease, which had been
progressively rising throughout the 1990s.
Between 1998 and 2001 there was a decline of over
90 per cent in the number of cases and deaths.
Tuberculosis
In the 40 years to 1987 notifications of
tuberculosis (TB) in England and Wales fell
considerably, from around 51,700 in 1947 to
around 5,700 in 1987. However, over the next 14
years they increased by 26 per cent, so that in 2001
there were around 7,200 notifications. The rise has
been particularly noticeable in London and
among young men.
Sexually transmitted diseases
Infections that can be sexually transmitted have
been increasing in recent years. The Public Health
Laboratory Service (PHLS) reported that by June
2001, 46,100 cases of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) had been diagnosed in the United
Kingdom. In recent years the way in which those
with HIV contracted the infection has changed
(see Ligure 13.2). In the late 1990s the number of
diagnoses of infections acquired through sex
between men and women overtook those due to
sex between men. In 2001 around 4,400 people
were diagnosed with HIV, over half of whom
contracted the virus through heterosexual sex,
more than double the proportion ten years earlier.
Over 80 per cent of these heterosexually acquired
infections in 2001 were estimated to have
occurred abroad, with over 1,500 attributed to
infection in Africa.

diagnosis and route of transmission,

1 The number of diagnoses recorded, particularly for
recent years, will rise as further reports are received.
Those where the probable route of infection was not
known, particularly for recent years, will fall as follow¬
up continues.

Recent trends for other sexually transmitted
infections diagnosed in the United Kingdom also
show increases. Between 1995 and 2000 the
number of cases among people aged 19 and under
more than doubled. In 2001 genital chlamydia
infection became the most common sexually
transmitted infection diagnosed in genito-urinary
medicine clinics with a total of just over 71,000
cases. Diagnosis of uncomplicated gonorrhoea
was the second most common infection. Between
159
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
2000 and 2001, cases in males rose by 8 per cent to
15,900, and in females cases rose by 6 per cent to
6,785. During this period diagnosis of primary
and secondary syphilis showed the largest relative
increases, rising by 144 per cent in males to 614
cases, and by 36 per cent in females to 102 cases.
Mental health
Mental health problems are a major cause of ill
health. In 2000/01 there were 2.0 million
attendances at NHS outpatient facilities for
psychiatric specialties in England, 285,000 of
which were new attendances. In 2001/02 mental
health drugs dispensed in the community in
England cost £531 million, representing 8 per cent
of the net ingredient cost of all prescription
medicines dispensed.
Research carried out by the Office for National
Statistics in 1999 found that about 10 per cent of
children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years have
some form of mental disorder. The proportion
was greater among boys than girls and in those
families without a working parent. A survey
carried out by the ONS in 2000 found that one in
six adults aged 16 to 74 living in private
households in Great Britain had a neurotic
disorder, such as depression, anxiety or a phobia.
Substance misuse
Alcohol
The consumption of alcohol in excessive amounts
can lead to ill health and an increased likelihood
of problems such as high blood pressure, cancer
and cirrhosis of the liver. The current Department
of Health advice on alcohol is that consumption
of between three and four units2 a day for men
and two to three units a day for women should
not lead to significant health risks. Consistently
drinking more is not advised because of the
progressive health risks. In the United Kingdom
39 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women had
exceeded the recommended amount of alcohol on
their heaviest drinking day in the week prior to
being interviewed during 2000/01.
A survey commissioned by the Department of
Health in 2001 found that, while the proportion of
children aged 11 to 15 in England who reported
2 A unit of alcohol is 8 grams by weight or 10 millilitres (ml) by
volume of pure alcohol. This is the amount contained in half a pint
of ordinary strength beer or lager, a single measure of pub spirits
(25 ml), one glass of ordinary wine and a small pub measure of
sherry or other fortified wine.
having a drink in the previous week had increased
slightly since 1990 (but was still around a quarter),
the amount of alcohol consumed per drinker had
doubled. In 2001, among those who drank, the
average number of units consumed during a week
was 10.6 for boys and 8.9 for girls, compared with
5.7 and 4.7 units respectively in 1990.
Smoking
More cancer deaths in the United Kingdom can be
attributed to smoking tobacco than to any other
single risk factor. Over the past 30 years, the
reduction in lung cancer deaths can be closely
linked to the fall in the proportion of the
population who smoke. In 1974, 51 per cent of
men and 41 per cent of women in Great Britain
reported that they were regular cigarette smokers.
By 2000/01 these proportions had fallen to 29 per
cent of men and 25 per cent of women.
The prevalence of smoking varies by social class.
For both men and women, the proportion of
smokers is higher among those in the manual
socio-economic groups than among those in the
non-manual groups. In 2000/01, while only 15 per
cent of male professionals and 13 per cent of female
professionals smoked, 39 per cent of unskilled
males and 34 per cent of unskilled females did so.
Similar trends are shown in women who smoke
during pregnancy. In 2000, 8 per cent of women
in higher occupations reported smoking
throughout pregnancy, compared with 29 per cent
from the lower occupations.
Drugs
Findings from the 2000 British Crime Survey (see
page 184) indicate that 9 per cent of 16 to 24 year
olds in England and Wales had used Class A
drugs’ in the previous 12 months, and 5 per cent
had done so during the previous month. The most
commonly used illegal drug in 2000 among both
young men and women was cannabis, which had
been used by 29 per cent of men and 23 per cent
of women aged 16 to 24 in the previous year.
Some drug use also occurs among those under the
age of 16. According to a survey in 2001, 20 per
cent of 11 to 15 year old children in England had
used one or more illegal drugs in the previous
year. Cannabis was again the most commonly
used drug taken by 13 per cent of this age group.

mushrooms, LSD and unprescribed use of methadone.

The number of deaths due to drug-related
poisoning in England and Wales rose from around
2,300 in 1993 to almost 3,000 in 2000, an increase
of about one-third. The increase was far higher for
males than females (50 per cent compared with 3
per cent). Deaths from paracetamol overdose have
declined following 1998 legislation which limited
the maximum amount of paracetamol allowed in
a pack, although more research is needed to
ascertain whether the decline is related to the
legislation. In 2000 the number of deaths
involving heroin or morphine rose to over 900, a
fivefold increase on the 1993 figure.
Diet and nutrition
Since the early 1970s there have been marked
changes in the British diet. One feature has been
the long-term rise in consumption of poultry,
while that of red meat (such as beef and veal) has
fallen. Consumption of fresh fruit has increased
since 1970, while consumption of fresh green
vegetables was lower in 2000 than in 1970. In
addition, the use of convenience food - both
frozen and ready meals - has increased.
Despite these changes, the British diet is still
noticeably different from that in other countries
such as those in the Mediterranean, being
relatively low in fruit, vegetables and fish. Health
considerations appear to have been influencing
some aspects of diet in recent years, such as the
fall in sales of red meat and the rise in
consumption of low-fat spreads. Nevertheless, 21
per cent of men and women aged 16 and over in
England were classified as obese in 2000.
The Department of Health recommends that a
healthy diet should include at least five portions of
a variety of fruit and vegetables a day. During
2001 the Department of Health piloted five local
‘five a day’ community projects and the lessons
learned have been incorporated into an evidence-
based handbook to support the delivery of new
local ‘five a day’ initiatives.
Following successful pilots in 2000 and 2001, the
National School Fruit Scheme is being expanded
region by region. By the end of 2002 over 500,000
children aged four to six will be receiving free fruit
each school day. By 2004 the scheme will be
available across the whole of England.
The Scottish Diet Action Plan - Eating for Health -
provides the framework for wide-ranging action to
tackle Scotland’s poor health, with a particular focus
on children and young people. The most recent
initiatives in this area include fruit for infants,
breakfast clubs, and school fruit and salad bars.
The National Health Service
The National Health Service (NHS) was created in
1948 to provide healthcare for the UK’s resident
population, based on need, not the ability to pay.
It is made up of a wide range of health
professionals, support workers and organisations.
The NHS is funded by the taxpayer and is
accountable to Parliament. All taxpayers,
employers and employees contribute to the cost,
so that members of the community who do not
require healthcare help to pay for those who do.
Most forms of treatment are provided free, but
others may incur a charge, such as prescription
drugs and sight tests.
In England the NHS is managed by the
Department of Health, which is responsible for
developing and implementing policies and overall
regulation and inspection of health services. The
Welsh Assembly Government, the Scottish
Executive Health Department and the Department
of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in
Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities for
health provision in their respective countries.
NHS Direct
In 1998 NHS Direct, a nurse-led telephone
helpline, was launched in England. NHS Direct
aims to provide people at home with fast and

13 Health
In a typical week:
■ more than 800,000 people are treated in NHS
hospital outpatient clinics;
■ 700,000 visit an NHS dentist for a check-up;
■ NHS district nurses make more than 700,000
visits;
■ over 10,000 babies are delivered by the NHS;
■ NHS chiropodists inspect over 150,000 pairs of
feet;
■ NHS ambulances make over 50,000 emergency
journeys;
■ pharmacists dispense approximately 10 million
items on NHS prescriptions; and
■ NHS surgeons perform around 1,200 hip
operations, 3,000 heart operations and 1,050
kidney operations.
convenient access to health information and
advice. The service helps people to be better able
to care for themselves and their families, when it is
appropriate to do so, and to direct them to the
most appropriate level of care when they need
professional help. During 2001/02 NHS Direct
handled around 5 million calls.
Wales has a similar service, NHS Direct Wales,
which offers advice in both English and Welsh. In
Scotland, a new service - NHS 24 - was launched
in May 2002 (see page 166). NHS Direct Online
(www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk), an Internet extension of
the telephone-based services, receives around
230,000 visitors a month. The website features an
electronic version of the NHS Direct self-help
guide, an encyclopedia of over 450 health topics
and an interactive enquiry service for health
information. During 2001/02 the Department of
Health piloted four schemes exploring the
potential for using digital television as another
means of providing people with home access to
health information and services. Results from the
pilot schemes are being evaluated.
Health Action Zones
There are 26 Health Action Zones (HAZs) in
deprived areas of England, including inner city,
rural and ex-coalfield communities. A further ten
associated HAZs have been established in south¬
east England. The zones are local partnerships
between the health service, local councils,
voluntary groups and local businesses, and receive
government funding. Their aim is to make
measurable improvements in the health of local
people and in the quality of treatment and care.
Working closely with the Department of Health,
the participants co-operate to tackle inequalities
and deliver better services and healthcare. They
focus on areas such as programmes to stop
smoking, children’s and young people’s health,
mental health, CHD and cancer, older people’s
health, and the health of minority ethnic groups.
HAZs play an important role in the development
of Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) and the
NHS modernisation agenda.
Four HAZs have been established in Northern
Ireland and an initiative to encourage local
healthcare partnerships has been launched in
Scotland. The Scottish Executive is also seeking to
reduce health inequalities via Social Inclusion
Partnerships.
Electronic initiatives
The NHS is making increasing use of new
technology in patient care and is undertaking a
major information technology (IT) development
programme. This is focusing on improving the IT
infrastructure and developing electronic national
services for prescribing, patient records and
booking appointments.
In England, a six-month evaluation of electronic
prescription pilot schemes began in June 2002.
Preliminary conclusions will be reported to the
Department of Health by the end of 2002, with a
final report due in spring 2003. Following
evaluation, the aim is that there will be electronic
transmission of half of all prescriptions
throughout England by the end of 2005.
NHSnet is a range of voice and data services used
by the NHS, covering radio, telephone and
computer-based communications. Health
authorities and trusts are connected to NHSnet, as
are a number of major NHS suppliers and all GPs
in Scotland. By April 2002 every GP practice in
England was connected to NHSnet and able to
send and receive e-mails.
NHSnet will support the longer-term goal of
providing an electronic booking system and
introducing electronic health records to replace
162
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
the paper-based records. The Government has said
that by 2005 every patient in England will be able
to access his or her own electronic health record -
a summary of key personal and health data about
the patient. NHSnet will also give doctors secure
access to patients’ records in an emergency when
they are away from home. An equivalent scheme,
HPSSnet, has been set up in Northern Ireland by
Northern Ireland Health and Personal Social
Services (HPSS).
NHS Plus
NHS Plus was established in November 2001 as a
national network providing occupational health
services to the private sector, in particular focusing
on small and medium-size businesses. Services
provided by NHS Plus include workplace risk
assessment, health surveillance, medical advice on
sickness absence and retirements, stress counselling
and drug and alcohol screening. Over 115 NHS
Trusts have signed up to provide this service.
England
In July 2000 the Government set out in its NHS
Plan, a ten-year programme of reform and
investment for healthcare in England, aimed at
improving clinical performance and health service
productivity. Many of the Plan’s legislative
proposals were implemented through the Health
and Social Care Act 2001. The NHS Plan includes a
number of targets for the NHS to achieve by 2004.
Among these are:
■ patients to be able to see a general
practitioner within 48 hours;
■ hospital consultants to deliver approximately
4 million outpatient consultations a year,
working additionally in primary care and
community settings;
■ GPs to be able to refer patients to around
1,000 ‘specialist’ GPs instead of referring
them to hospital; and
■ waiting time in accident and emergency
departments in hospitals to fall to 1 hour 15
minutes on average.
Targets to be met by the NHS by the end of 2005
include:
■ the replacement of waiting lists for
appointments and admission by booking
systems;
■ a reduction in the maximum waiting time for
a routine outpatient appointment from six to
three months; and
■ a reduction in the maximum waiting time for
inpatient treatment from 18 to 6 months.
Fundamental to the programme of reform is the
way in which the NHS will be structured, and the
roles and responsibilities of the organisations
within it. The NHS Reform and Health Care
Professions Act 2002 includes provisions which
will:
■ devolve power over NHS resources to doctors
and nurses, allocating NHS resources directly
to Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) (see page 164).
By 2004, 75 per cent of NHS spending will be
directly controlled by doctors and nurses in
local communities;
■ strengthen the independence of the
Commission for Health Improvement (CHI),
which provides independent advice to the
NHS on developing and improving the
quality of NHS services, by giving it new
powers to designate failing health services as
in need of special measures. The CHI would
in future assess and publish star ratings for
NHS organisations;
■ establish a Commission for Patient and Public
Involvement in Health, to encourage public
participation on hospital trusts and PCTs and
ensure that public consultations are effective
and inclusive throughout the NHS; and
■ create a Council for the Regulation of Health
Care Professionals, to oversee the activities of
the various regulatory bodies of the
healthcare professions, including the General
Medical Council.
Strategic Health Authorities
In April 2002 the 95 former English Health
Authorities were abolished and 28 larger and more
strategic Health Authorities were established. The
NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002
provided for these to be called Strategic Health
Authorities (StHAs) from October 2002. The
StHAs, with typical populations of between 1.5
and 2.4 million (see Figure 13.3), have taken on
some of the Department of Health’s operational
functions. They are responsible for creating, in
consultation with stakeholders, a framework for
local health services, building capacity, supporting
163
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
performance improvement and managing the
performance of PCTs and of NHS Trusts in their
areas. The Department of Health continues to
have responsibility for policy development and
overall regulation and inspection of the NHS. The
Department has established four directorates of
health and social care to oversee the development
of the NHS and provide a link between NHS
organisations and the Government. The
Department’s eight regional offices are being
disbanded.
Primary Care Trusts
The structural reorganisation established 302 local
PCTs across England, replacing the 481 Primary
Care Groups and taking over many of the
responsibilities of the former 95 Health
Authorities. PCTs are groups of between 50 and
100 CP practices and healthcare professionals.
They are responsible for deciding which health
services the local population needs and ensuring
the provision of these services.
Appropriate provision of all other services,
including hospitals, dentists, mental health
services, Walk-in Centres, NHS Direct (see page
161), patient transport (including accident and
emergency), population screening, pharmacies
and opticians, is also the responsibility of PCTs. In
addition, they develop health improvement
programmes and ensure that local NHS
organisations work effectively with local
authorities and social services.
Health Improvement and Modernisation Plans
Health Improvement and Modernisation Plans
(HIMPs) are three-year strategic plans for local
health organisations. They focus on priorities for
health improvement and reducing health
inequalities, and aim to modernise health service
planning and delivery. From October 2002 each
PCT will be required to lead the development of an
HIMP, ensuring the involvement from the outset of
local organisations, including NHS Trusts, local
authorities, the voluntary sector and local
communities.
Care Trusts
Care Trusts are NHS bodies that work in both
health and social care and can be established
where NHS organisations and local authorities
agree to work together. A Care Trust is usually set
up where it is felt that closer integration between
health and social care is needed or would be
beneficial at a local level. Four Care Trusts were set

up in April 2002 and six more should be
established by April 2003.
NHS Trusts
NHS trusts are the organisations responsible for
running most NHS hospitals. There are currently
273 NHS Trusts in England. Although the
statutory functions of the Trusts were not changed
following the NHS reorganisation, they are now
overseen by the StHAs.
NHS Walk-in Centres
NHS Walk-in Centres are a network of nurse-led
centres - where no appointment is necessary -
offering quick access to a range of services,
including healthcare advice and information, and
treatment for minor ailments and injuries. They
are intended to complement CP surgeries and
help reduce pressure on CPs. By the end of 2001,
42 NHS Walk-in Centres had opened in England.
National Institute for Clinical Excellence
The National Institute for Clinical Excellence
(NICE) was established in 1999 to develop
national standards for best practice in clinical care
within the NHS in England and Wales. This
includes drawing up guidelines based on clinical
164
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
and cost effectiveness and ensuring that they apply
to all parts of the NHS. The Institute’s
membership is drawn from the health professions,
the NHS, academics, health economists and
patients. It appraises new drugs and technologies,
and produces clinical guidelines.
In March 2002 the Department of Health
consulted on how topics are selected for appraisal
by NICE, with the main objective of making it
easier for interested parties to put topics forward.
Among the drugs referred to NICE for appraisal
in its work programme, starting in April 2003 is
the use of cannabis derivatives for the treatment
of various conditions, including management of
pain relief in multiple sclerosis.
Health education
Responsibility for health education lies with
separate NHS authorities working alongside the
national health departments. The Health
Development Agency (HDA) works to improve
the health of people and communities in England,
and in particular to reduce health inequalities. In
partnership with others, it gathers evidence of
what works, advises on standards and develops the
skills of all those working to improve health.
In March 2002 Health Promotion England, which
had run national campaigns on a number of
subjects, including childhood immunisation,
drugs, alcohol and sexual health, was closed. Its
core functions were transferred to the Department
of Health.
Wales
In Wales, the operation of the NHS is the
responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government.
Its ten-year health programme - Improving Health
in Wales - A Plan for the NHS with its Partners -
was published in 2001. Effective partnership
working is an important theme of the Welsh Plan.
At a national level, a Health and Well-being
Partnership Council has been established, chaired
by the Health and Social Services Minister. The
Council brings together key personnel from the
NHS, local government, the voluntary and
independent sectors, staff and professional groups,
and patients’ representatives, to ensure the direction
and leadership of the agenda for health and well¬
being. The council is supported by a network of
similar partnerships at a local level.
The Assembly Government has the power to make
changes to the structure of the NHS in Wales
through secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation (see
page 40). Through this means specific Welsh
clauses were introduced in the NHS Reform and
Health Care Professions Act 2002. In relation to
Wales, the Act provided for the creation of 22
Local Health Boards (LHBs), to replace the
existing five Health Authorities in Wales on 31
March 2003. The new structure will result in
changes at two levels:
■ at a local level, Local Health Groups will be
developed into the new LHBs and their role
strengthened, and they will take on new
responsibilities for commissioning and
delivering healthcare in their localities;
and
■ at a national level, the Assembly Government
will hold both LHBs and NHS Trusts fully
accountable for the services they provide and
commission.
The Act also placed a duty on each LHB and local
authority in Wales to formulate and implement a
‘health and well-being’ strategy for the population
in the area. This will include agreeing joint
investment priorities and co-operation with other
organisations, such as NHS Trusts, Community
Health Councils, voluntary bodies and local
businesses.
Since devolution, the Welsh Assembly
Government also has some control over the
finances of the NHS in Wales. In February 2001 it
announced additional investment, so that by
2003/04 the health budget is planned to be £3.6
billion, an increase of £1 billion on 1999/2000.
The health budget for 2001/02 was £3.1 billion.
Much of this new investment is being directed
towards tackling the priorities outlined in
Improving Health in Wales: coronary heart disease,
cancer services, mental health services, intensive
care, primary and community care, children’s
services and local priorities in Health
Improvement Programmes. Other areas targeted
are integrated working methods to address waiting
lists and waiting times, pressures on admissions,
human resource development for the NHS
workforce, and the establishment of a new
Inequalities in Health Fund.
Scotland
The Scottish Executive Health Department is
responsible both for the executive leadership of
165
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
NHSScotland and for the development and
implementation of health and community care
policy.
Prior to devolution in 1999, healthcare in Scotland
was already distinct from healthcare in England
and Wales in many ways. In December 2000 the
Scottish Executive Health Department published
the Scottish Health Plan - Our National Health: A
plan for action, a plan for change - which
described its priorities. These are to:
■ improve Scotland’s health, and narrow the
health gap between rich and poor;
■ set national standards of care to be delivered
locally across Scotland;
■ improve patient access to health services;
■ give patients and communities a voice in the
running of the NHS;
■ provide better care for the young, and for
older people;
■ reduce coronary heart disease, cancer and
poor mental health; and
■ change the ways in which the NHS works
with its staff so as to improve care and
standards.
To achieve these aims, the Executive’s core
spending on health is planned to rise from £6.2
billion in 2002/03 to £6.7 billion in 2003/04 - this
represents approximately a third of the devolved
Scottish budget. In addition, a new way of sharing
NHS funds across Scotland is now in place to
address relative healthcare needs, including those
caused by deprivation and by geographical
remoteness.
In September 2001 the decision-making powers of
the 15 Health Boards and 28 NHS Trusts were
brought together in 15 new unified NHS Boards,
each of which is responsible for all NHS services
in its area. The introduction of the new NHS
Boards aims to unify local health services and
ensure that national clinical and service standards
are delivered in all parts of Scotland. The Boards
are required to show how they are involving the
public, and how this has affected the provision of
services. Local Health Councils also provide a
voice for the local public in each area. The Scottish
Executive intends to announce further reform of
NHSScotland early in 2003.
The 15 NHS Boards and 32 local authorities work
together to strengthen the localised focus of health
provision, and every local authority has a seat on
its principal NHS Board. Acute services and
primary care continue to be delivered through
NHS Trusts, and the Island Boards remain as
integrated structures with no separate Trusts.
Other NHS bodies, such as the Scottish
Ambulance Service, the Health Education Board
for Scotland and the Clinical Standards Board for
Scotland, provide services on a national basis. The
Scottish Executive is investing £14 million in
improving NHSScotland’s ability to communicate
and work with patients. One such initiative is the
Patients’ Project, a systematic assessment of
patient information which aims to disseminate
best practice and to act as a national source of
patient information and advice.
The Scottish Health Plan includes the same
clinical priorities as the NHS Plan for England:
CHD, cancer and poor mental health. In July
2001 the Scottish Executive published Cancer in
Scotland: Action for Change, a comprehensive
cancer plan for Scotland. In November 2001 the
Minister for Health and Community Care
announced an extra £40 million investment for
improving cancer care, and set out the first
annual investment plan prepared by the regional
cancer advisory groups in partnership with local
NHS Boards and Trusts and the Scottish Cancer
Group. In spring 2002 the Scottish CHD Task
Force published a CHD and Stroke Strategy for
Scotland.
The Executive sponsors the work of a number of
organisations and initiatives aimed at improving
the quality of healthcare provided in Scotland.
These include the Clinical Standards Board for
Scotland, the Health Technology Board for
Scotland, the Scottish Needs Assessment
Programme and the Scottish Medicines
Consortium. The Clinical Standards Board is
responsible for developing and running a national
system of quality assurance in health care for the
NHS in Scotland. The Health Technology Board is
a single source of national advice on the most
clinically and cost-effective health technologies,
playing a similar role to NICE in England and
Wales (see page 164).
In May 2002 NHS 24 was launched in Scotland.
This is a nurse-led telephone advice service similar
to NHS Direct in England (see page 161). The first
166
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
call centre covers the Grampian region. The
service will be fully operational across Scotland by
the end of 2004. There are also plans to introduce
an NHS 24 online service.
Northern Ireland
The Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety (DHSSPS) is responsible for the
development and implementation of health and
community care policy in Northern Ireland. In
March 2002 it published a public health strategy,
Investing for Health. This focuses on the key
objectives of preventing ill health and reducing
health inequalities among different groups in the
population. In order to meet these objectives, the
strategy recognises the importance of working
alongside other departments with responsibilities
for housing, the environment and education. By
2010 it aims to:
■ increase life expectancy by at least three years
for men and two years for women;
■ halve the gap in average life expectancy
between those living in the fifth most
deprived wards and the population as a
whole; and
■ reduce by a fifth the gap in the proportion of
people with a long-standing illness in the
lowest and the highest socio-economic groups.
Northern Ireland’s equivalent bodies to health
authorities are the four health and social services
boards. They are responsible for identifying the
healthcare needs of people in their area, securing
hospital and community health services, providing
primary care services, and administering
contracts. The boards have a major role to play in
the implementation of Investing for Health. They
are responsible for establishing an ‘Investing for
Health Partnership’, reflecting the main public,
voluntary and community interests in their area.
They are also responsible for producing ‘Health
and Well-being Investment Plans’.
The Health Promotion Agency plays a key role in
identifying needs and in developing and
implementing programmes designed to promote
health and prevent ill health. It co-ordinates
regional health promotion activities throughout
Northern Ireland, undertakes public education
campaigns, evaluates and disseminates research
findings, provides training and works with the
wider health and personal social services and
other bodies in helping to implement the
Government’s public health policies.
One of the wider impacts of the Belfast (Good
Friday) Agreement in 1999 (see page 17) was the
setting up of bodies for cross-border co-operation
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
Co-operation on health matters was identified as
an area suitable for consideration by the
North/South Ministerial Council. Joint Working
Groups have been set up in five areas: accident
and emergency services, emergency planning, high
technology equipment, cancer research and health
promotion. These groups are looking in detail at
where co-operation can yield the greatest benefit
for people in both Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic. Joint ventures have included the
production of an all-Ireland cancer incidence
report, a folic acid advertising campaign,
promotion of physical fitness, and training and
research initiatives.
The Food Safety Promotion Board is involved in
supporting North/South scientific co-operation,
and promoting links between institutions working
in the field of food safety, such as laboratories,
food safety enforcement agencies and research
bodies.
Finance
The NHS is financed mainly through general
taxation, along with an element of National
Insurance contributions (see chapter 12) paid by
employed people, their employers and self-
employed people. In 2001/02 an estimated 78 per
cent of the NHS was financed through general
taxation, with 12 per cent from National
Insurance contributions and 10 per cent from
charges and other receipts.
In the April 2002 Budget, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer announced increases in National
Insurance contributions from April 2003 to
provide extra funding for the NHS. As a result,
spending on the NHS will increase from £68.1
billion in 2002/03 to £109.4 billion in 2007/08.
This will result in the proportion of the UK’s GDP
spent on health services increasing from 7.7 per
cent to 9.4 per cent over this five-year period.
Government spending plans for the next three
financial years are set out in Table 13.4.
The extra funding is to be allocated mainly to
training new health professionals and to a

programme for modernising NHS infrastructure
and information technology. Following the
Budget, the Health Secretary published Delivering
the NHS Plan - next steps on investment; next steps
on reform, a five-year investment plan for the
NHS. It sets targets, due to be achieved by 2008,
of:
■ 15,000 more GPs and consultants;
■ 30,000 more scientists and therapists;
■ 35,000 more nurses, midwives and health
visitors; and
■ waiting times for operations to fall from a
maximum 15 months in 2002 to six months
by 2005 and three months by 2008.
Some NHS funding is raised from other, non¬
government, sources. For example, some hospitals
increase revenue by taking private patients, who
pay the full cost of their accommodation and
treatment. Hospitals can also use private finance
for NHS capital projects, under the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI), which aims to promote
commercial partnership between the public and
private sectors (see page 350). This involves new
NHS facilities being designed, built, maintained
and owned by the private sector, which then leases
them back to the NHS. The NHS retains control
of key planning and clinical decisions.
Less than a third of hospitals now pre-date the
formation of the NHS in 1948. While much has
been done to improve existing hospital buildings,
the largest building programme in the history of
the NHS is currently in progress, including several
major PFI schemes. Altogether over 100 new
hospital schemes are planned between 2000 and
2010.
Review of NHS resources
A review commissioned by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to examine future health trends and the
resources required over the next two decades was
published in April 2002. The Wanless Report -
Securing our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term
View- included the following recommendations:
■ the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP)
spent on health to rise from 7.7 per cent in
2002 to 12.5 per cent by 2022;
■ NHS spending to increase by 7.7 per cent a year
over the next five years, to £96 billion by 2007;
■ a one-third increase in the number of nurses and
two-thirds increase in the number of doctors;
■ a maximum two-week waiting time for hospital
appointments by 2022;
■ a doubling of spending on information
technology;
■ a major increase in the new hospitals building
programme;
■ the introduction of charges for non-clinical
services; and
■ greater co-operation between the NHS and the
private sector.
The Government accepts the conclusions of the
review and has decided to allocate additional
spending to the NHS (see page 167).
Charges
Around 587 million prescription items, worth
around £6.1 billion, were dispensed in the
community in England in 2001. The proportion of
items provided free of charge was 85 per cent.
The following groups are exempt from
prescription charges: people aged 60 and over;
children under 16 and full-time students under
19; women who are pregnant or have given birth
in the previous 12 months; and people with
certain medical conditions. In addition, people
168
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
who receive (or whose partners receive) certain
social security benefits (see chapter 12), or who
otherwise qualify on low income grounds, do not
have to pay prescription charges. There are
charges for most types of NHS dental treatment,
including examinations. However, the following
people are entitled to free treatment: women who
begin a course of treatment while pregnant or
within 12 months of having a baby; children
under 18; full-time students under 19; and adults
on low incomes or receiving the same benefits or
tax credits as for free prescriptions.
Free NHS sight tests are available for people aged
60 and over, children, full-time students under the
age of 19, adults on low incomes or receiving the
same benefits or tax credits as for free
prescriptions, and people who have, or are at
particular risk of, eye disease. Around 10.5 million
sight tests were paid for by health authorities in
England and Wales in the year to 31 March 2002.
Fraud prevention
The NHS Counter Fraud Service was set up in
1998 to counter all fraud and corruption in the
Department of Health and NHS, with a specific
priority on the Family Health Services. In 2000/01
losses to pharmaceutical and dental patient fraud
in England were estimated at £99 million, a 37 per
cent decrease on the 1999/2000 figure of £157
million. A system requiring patients to provide
evidence that they are exempt from NHS charges
has played a significant part in reducing fraud
since it was introduced in 1999. Dentists and
opticians are also now using a similar approach.
NHS workforce
The NHS is one of the largest employers in the
world. In 2000 there were the equivalent of just
over a million full-time direct care employees in
NHS hospital and community health services in
the United Kingdom (see Table 13.5).
Doctors and dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’ registers
may practise as doctors or dentists in the NHS.
University medical and dental schools are
responsible for undergraduate teaching, and the
NHS provides hospital and community facilities
for training.
Full registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school, in a hospital
and in the community, with a further year’s
hospital experience. The regulating body for the
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children
150th anniversary
Great Ormond Street Hospital is a specialist centre
for the treatment of sick children, and was the first
in the United Kingdom to offer inpatient care to
children only. It has pioneered research into bone
marrow transplant operations and the development
of new drugs for epilepsy, arthritis and HIV.
Key dates in its history:
■ 1852: Dr Charles West opens the hospital with
just ten beds;
■ 1875: the first purpose-built hospital building
was completed;
■ 1895: hospital's medical school established;
■ 1929: J M Barrie, the author of Peter Pan
donates the rights of the play to the hospital;
■ 1946: Institute of Child Health (an international
centre of research into childhood diseases)
founded;
■ 1966: new Institute of Child Health building
opens;
■ 1987: Wishing Well Appeal launched to raise
money for new hospital building;
■ 1994: Variety Club Building opens, funded by the
Wishing Well Appeal;
■ 2001: Gene therapy laboratory opens and
clinical trials of gene therapy begin; and
■ 2002: 150th anniversary.
The hospital:
■ treats over 22,000 inpatients and 77,000
outpatients each year;
■ performs 10,600 scheduled and 2,365
unscheduled operations a year;
■ has 315 doctors, 900 registered nurses and
healthcare assistants, and 135 allied medical
professionals;
■ provides overnight accommodation for 1,000
parents a week; and
■ performs between 550 and 600 child heart
operations each year.

medical profession in the United Kingdom is the
General Medical Council (GMC), and the main
professional association is the British Medical
Association. As a result of high-profile cases, such
as that of Harold Shipman,4 clinical governance
has become an increasing concern.
In April 2002 it became obligatory for all GPs,
excluding locums and assistants, to be appraised
by a fellow GP, who will undergo training for the
role. The appraisal system will also play an
important role in five-yearly revalidation for
doctors, which is due to be introduced by the
GMC. The National Clinical Assessment Authority
(NCAA) was established in April 2001. It provides
a rapid objective assessment of a doctor’s
performance where necessary and advice about
the handling of local cases.
For a dentist, five years’ training at a dental school
and satisfactory completion of one year’s
mandatory vocational training are required before
permission is granted to work as a principal in the
General Dental Services of the NHS. All general
dental practitioners are paid by a combination of
capitation fees for children registered with the
practice, continuing care payments for adults
registered, and a prescribed scale of fees for
individual treatments. The regulating body for the
dental profession in the United Kingdom is the
General Dental Council, and the main
professional association is the British Dental
Association.
4 In January 2000, a Manchester GP, Harold Shipman, was convicted
of murdering 15 elderly patients. An ongoing public inquiry was
established by Parliament in January 2001, with public hearings
into individual cases beginning in June 2001.
Nurses, midwives and health visitors
The majority of nursing students undertake the
pre-registration Diploma in Higher Education
programme, which emphasises health promotion
as well as care of the sick and enables students to
work either in hospitals or in the community. The
programme lasts three years and consists of
periods of university study combined with
practical experience in hospital and in the
community.
In 2000 the first nurse consultant posts were
introduced. The NHS Plan committed the
Government to establishing 1,000 such posts by
2004, and by June 2002 over 750 posts had been
approved. The positions combine specialist
practice with leadership, consultancy, education
and research responsibilities.
In April 2001 the first ‘modern matron’ posts were
created. Every hospital will have matrons, each in
overall charge of a group of wards. They will help
ensure high standards of care, set and monitor
standards for cleaning and catering, and have
authority to take action where these are not met.
The Government’s target is to have 2,000 matrons
on wards by 2004. By April 2002, 1,895
appointments had already been made.
Midwifery education programmes for registered
general/adult nurses take 18 months, while the
direct entry programme lasts three years. Health
visitors and district nurses are registered adult
nurses who have a further specialist qualification
and care for clients in the community.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is
responsible for regulating and registering nurses,
midwives and health visitors throughout the
United Kingdom. In April 2002 it formally
170
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
replaced the United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting and the
four National Boards for England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Its key responsibilities are to:
■ maintain a UK register of qualified nurses,
midwives and health visitors;
■ set standards for education, practice and
conduct;
■ provide advice to nurses, midwives and health
visitors; and
■ consider allegations of professional
misconduct or unfitness to practice due to ill
health.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists. Registration
requires four years’ training in a school of
pharmacy, followed by one year’s practical
experience in a community or hospital pharmacy
approved for training by regulatory bodies for the
profession - the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland.
Community pharmacists are paid professional fees
for dispensing NHS prescriptions, as well as being
reimbursed for the cost of the drugs and
appliances concerned. In April 2002 the
Government outlined proposals for extending
prescribing powers to pharmacists and nurses.
This would mean that after diagnosis patients may
no longer need to revisit their doctors for repeat
prescriptions on items such as inhalers and
hormone replacement therapy. Like nurses,
pharmacists will need to undergo training to
become supplementary prescribers. It is envisaged
that the first training programmes for pharmacists
will be in place by late spring 2003.
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of optometrists (ophthalmic
opticians) and dispensing opticians. Only
registered ophthalmic opticians may test sight.
Their training takes four years, including a year of
practical experience under supervision.
Dispensing opticians take a two-year full-time
course with a year’s practical experience, or follow
a part-time day-release or distance learning course
while employed with an optician.
Other health professions
The Health Professions Council (HPC) was
established in April 2002 as a new UK-wide
regulatory body responsible for setting and
monitoring the standards of professional training,
performance and conduct of 12 healthcare
professions: arts therapists, chiropodists, clinical
scientists, dietitians, medical laboratory
technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists,
paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists and
orthotists, radiographers, and speech and
language therapists. The HPC replaced the
Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine and its 12 professional boards.
Recruitment
The NHS is seeking to attract more recruits to
train as nurses, midwives and allied health
professionals, such as physiotherapists and
occupational therapists. Between September 1999
and September 2001 an extra 20,740 nurses joined
the NHS. The NHS is also seeking to attract
former staff under the ‘Return to Practice’
initiative. By September 2002 over 11,900 nurses,
midwives and health visitors had returned to the
NHS since February 1999. Affordable staff
accommodation has also been prioritised. In
September 2001 the Starter Home Initiative was
launched (see page 296). This scheme provides
key public workers with equity loans and shared
ownership arrangements. By 2004 it is expected
that around 5,000 NHS staff will have benefited
from the scheme.
The NHS is also recruiting from abroad, and in
2000 set a target of recruiting 1,000 doctors and
2,000 nurses from abroad by March 2005,
particularly from countries where there are
surpluses of suitably qualified staff.
International Fellowship Scheme for the NHS
In February 2002 the Government launched a
scheme, which by 2005 aims to attract up to 450
expert heart and lung surgeons, histopathologists,
psychiatrists, radiologists and other top specialists
from abroad. The fellowships will last for up to two
years and allow the selected specialists
opportunities to take part in clinical research and
teaching, and study visits to hospitals at the
forefront of their field.

Services for children, women
and men
Children
Important activities in promoting the health of
children include:
■ prevention of childhood accidents;
■ immunisation and vaccination (see
page 159);
■ screening and health surveillance; and
■ health education on diet and exercise.
Babies and pre-school children
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance, provided for pre-school children
(under five years of age), is run by community
health services and GPs, who receive an annual
payment for every child registered on the
programme (in Scotland this is carried out by the
Community Paediatric Service, which may be
based in the primary care or acute services trust).
Health visitors have a central role in health
promotion, in identifying the healthcare needs of
under-fives and helping to ensure access to the
services necessary to meet those needs. They visit
new-born babies at home between 10 and 14 days
after birth. Later checks take place usually at:
■ six to eight weeks (with a physical
examination by a health visitor, GP or clinic
doctor);
■ six to nine months (including hearing and
sight assessments);
■ 18 months to two years; and
■ pre-school at three to four-and-a-half years.
New hearing tests for babies in the first few days
of life were launched in 20 English pilot areas in
autumn 2001. The new scheme, Universal
Neonatal Hearing Screening, is intended to replace
the current Infant Distraction Test, normally
performed at seven to eight months.
School health services
Children attending state schools have access to the
school health service, and are usually registered
with a GP and a dentist. In addition to providing
health advice to children and young people, the
service assists teachers with pupils who have
medical needs.
School nurses check hearing, sight, speech and
weight, and administer vaccinations including
Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG),
diphtheria, tetanus and polio boosters. They are
also involved in health education, counselling and
sex education.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services
provide help and advice to families and children
with psychological or emotional problems. In
recent years efforts have been made to improve
co-operation between community-based child
health services and local authority education and
social services for children. This is particularly
important in the prevention of child abuse and for
the health and welfare of children being looked
after by local authorities (see page 149).
Children's National Service Framework
In 2001 the Secretary of State for Health
announced the development of a new Children’s
National Service Framework (NSF) in England.
This will be aimed at developing new national
Public inquiry into children's heart surgery at
Bristol Royal Infirmary
The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry was set up in
1998 to investigate the deaths of 29 babies
undergoing heart surgery at the hospital in the late
1980s and early 1990s. The report of the public
inquiry was published in July 2001. Its
recommendations include the:
■ appointment of a national director for children's
services to lead the development of children's
healthcare;
■ introduction of appraisal and revalidation for all
healthcare professionals;
■ implementation of national standards of clinical
and hospital care;
■ creation of an independent monitoring service to
identify good and failing hospitals; and
■ more openness about clinical performance,
allowing patients to access information about
the relative performance of hospitals, services
and consultants.
172
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
standards across the NHS and social services. Six
external working groups have been established to
help develop the framework, each focusing on
different issues. The standards will aim to ensure
better access and smoother progression in the
provision of services for children, from initial
contact with the NHS, via a GP surgery or NHS
hospital, through to social services support.
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services
(CAMHS)
In 1998, 24 CAMHS projects were set up. They
will receive £4 million annual funding from the
Department of Health until March 2004. The
services are a partnership between health and local
authorities and aim to provide early intervention
to prevent serious mental health or behavioural
difficulties. They also provide innovative services
for young people often excluded from mainstream
services.
Women
Women have particular health needs related to
pregnancy and certain forms of cancer.
Screening
Screening programmes are in operation for breast
cancer and cervical cancer. At present, under the
United Kingdom’s breast cancer screening
programme, every woman aged between 50 and
64 is invited for mammography (breast X-ray)
every three years by computerised call-up and
recall systems. This facility is to be extended to
women aged 65 to 70 by 2004 in England. In
Scotland, the extension to women aged 65 to 70
will begin in 2003/04 and be implemented over a
three-year round of screening. In addition, all
women over the age of 64 can refer themselves for
screening. In England, 1.3 million women of all
ages were screened and 8,345 cases of cancer were
diagnosed in 2000/01. In Scotland 120,000 women
were screened with 847 cases of cancer diagnosed.
National policy for cervical screening is that
women should be screened every three to five
years (three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years in
Scotland) so as to detect indications of the long
developmental stage which may proceed to
invasive cancer. The programme invites women
aged 20 to 64 (20 to 60 in Scotland) for screening.
However, since many women are not invited
immediately when they reach their 20th birthday,
the age group 25 to 64 is used to give a more
accurate estimate of coverage of the target
population in England. By the end of March 2001,
83 per cent of women aged 25 to 64 had been
screened at least once in the previous five years in
England, 87 per cent in Scotland, 81 per cent in
Wales and 70 per cent in Northern Ireland.
Maternity
Nearly all births take place in hospital, although
there was a slight increase during the 1990s in the
popularity of home births. These accounted for
around 2 per cent of births in England and Wales
in 2000, compared with around 1 per cent during
the 1980s. Home births in Scotland remain
relatively constant at under 1 per cent.
A woman is entitled to care throughout
pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period. Care
may be provided by a midwife, a community-
based GP, a hospital-based obstetrician, or a
combination of these. Special preventive services
are provided under the NHS to safeguard the
health of pregnant women and mothers with
young children. Services include free dental
treatment; health education; and vaccination and
immunisation of children against certain
infectious diseases (see page 159).
There is a welfare food scheme for mothers on low
income, providing formula feed and vitamins free
of charge. The NHS Plan envisages that the
scheme will be reformed by 2004 to improve
access to a healthy diet for children in poverty. As
part of the drive to tackle health inequalities,
breastfeeding is encouraged by the Infant Feeding
Initiative in England and the Scottish
Breastfeeding Group and the National
Breastfeeding Adviser in Scotland.
In England, The Pregnancy Book, a complete guide
to a healthy pregnancy, labour and giving birth as
well as life with a new baby, and Birth to Five, a
guide to the early stages of development,
nutrition, weaning and common childhood
ailments, are both made available to all first-time
mothers free of charge. The Scottish equivalent is
Ready, Steady, Baby!, produced by the Health
Education Board for Scotland. New mothers also
receive a Personal Child Health Record. This helps
parents to keep a record of immunisation, tests,
birth details and health checks.
In 2001 the Scottish Executive published the
national Framework for Maternity Services in
Scotland, designed to ensure choices for women
and their families while recognising the need for
173
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
clinical safety. It sets out a basis against which
each NHS Trust and NHS Board should judge its
own service provision, and covers key aspects of
maternity care, the organisation of maternity
services, and women’s and parents’ information
needs. In England, the Children’s NSF (see
page 172) will include standards for maternity
services, with an extra £100 million being invested
to fund capital improvements to modernise the
facilities in maternity units, as well as separate
additional investment to provide 2,000 extra
midwives by 2005.
Teenage pregnancy
The Social Exclusion Unit’s report on teenage
pregnancy, published in 1999, set out a national
strategy for England to halve the rate of under 18
conceptions by 2010, with an interim reduction of
15 per cent by 2004. It also aims to increase the
participation of teenage parents in education and
work to 60 per cent by 2010. To ensure delivery of
the national strategy aims, every top-tier local
authority area has a ten-year local teenage
pregnancy strategy and detailed three-year action
plan. Between 1999 and 2000 the conception rate
for women aged under 18 in England and Wales
declined from 45.0 to 43.8 per 1,000.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a time
limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest category of
abortion - risk to the physical or mental health of
the pregnant woman - and also to abortion
because of a similar risk to any existing children of
her family. There are three categories in which no
time limit applies: to prevent grave permanent
injury to the physical or mental health of the
woman; where there is a substantial risk of serious
foetal handicap; or where continuing the
pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the
pregnant woman greater than if the pregnancy
were terminated. The Act does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
Between 2000 and 2001 the number of legal
abortions performed on women resident in
England and Wales rose by 0.5 per cent to
186,000. The overall age-standardised rate
remained at 17 abortions per 1,000 women aged
between 15 and 44.
Men
Men, particularly younger men, tend to use
primary care services less than women. A 1998
Department of Health Survey showed that 69 per
cent of men aged 18 to 24 in England had visited
their GP in the preceding 12 months, compared
with 90 per cent of women in the same age group.
Lower life expectancy (see page 157) is the most
significant indication of the health inequalities
that exist between men and women. The two main
reasons for this are that men tend to have less
healthy lifestyles in terms of diet and higher
alcohol and drug intake, and are involved in more
accidents. They also risk later diagnosis and
treatment because they do not consult a doctor as
quickly as women when a problem arises.
To address the health inequalities that exist between
men and women, Health Action Zones (see page
162), Health Improvement and Modernisation
Plans (HIMPs) (see page 164) and Healthy Living
Centres are developing programmes to improve
men’s health. The Health Development Agency
(see page 165) has also commissioned research into
young men’s health activities.
The NHS Cancer Plan set out the Government’s
intention to introduce prostate cancer screening
when screening and treatment techniques have
developed sufficiently. In the meantime, a prostate
cancer risk management programme has been
launched. One element of this is a project for
prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing.
Hospital and specialist services
District general hospitals offer a broad spectrum
of clinical specialities, supported by a range of
other services, such as anaesthetics, pathology and
radiology. Almost all have facilities for the
admission of emergency patients, either through
accident and emergency departments or as direct
referrals from CPs. Treatments are provided for
inpatients, day cases, outpatients and patients who
attend wards for treatment such as dialysis.
Some hospitals also provide specialist services
covering more than one region or district, for
example for heart and liver transplants and rare
eye and bone cancers. There are also specialist
hospitals, such as the Hospital for Sick Children at
Great Ormond Street (see page 169), Moorfields
Eye Hospital, and the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery, all in London.
These hospitals combine specialist treatment
facilities with the training of medical and other
students, and international research.

13 Health
Organ transplants
United Kingdom Transplant (a special health
authority of the NHS) provides a 24-hour support
service to all transplant units in the UK and the
Irish Republic for the matching and allocation of
organs for transplant. In many cases transplants
are multi-organ.
In the UK during 2001, 1,743 kidney transplants
were performed, and at the end of that year there
were 6,223 patients waiting for this operation. At
the end of 2001 there were seven designated
thoracic transplant centres in England, and one in
Scotland. During that year, 166 heart, 93 lung, and
32 heart/lung transplants were performed. There
are six designated liver transplant units in England
and one in Scotland. In 2001, 675 liver transplants
were performed.
People who are willing to donate their organs after
death carry a donor card. The NHS Organ Donor
Register contained around 9 million names at
December 2001. The Government aims to have 16
million people registered by 2010. In February
2001 the Department of Health published a draft
action plan for consultation, Organs and Tissue
Transplantation - A plan for the future. This looks
at ways of improving transplant services and
increasing organ donation. In Scotland the
Scottish Transplant Group published a report in
July 2002 making recommendations for increasing
organ donation rates.
Blood services
Blood services are run by the National Blood
Services in England and north Wales, the Welsh
Blood Service, the Scottish National Blood
Transfusion Service and the Northern Ireland
Blood Transfusion Agency. The United Kingdom
is self-sufficient in blood components.
Over 3 million donations are made each year by
voluntary unpaid donors in the UK. These are
turned into many different life-saving components
and products for patients. Red cells, platelets and
other components with a limited ‘life’ are prepared
at blood centres, while the production of plasma
products is undertaken at the Bio Products
Laboratory in Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the
Protein Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national blood services co¬
ordinates programmes for donor recruitment,
retention and education, and donor sessions are
organised regionally, in towns and workplaces.
Donors are aged between 17 and 70. Blood centres
are responsible for blood collection, screening,
processing and supplying hospital blood banks.
They also provide laboratory, clinical, research,
teaching and specialist advisory services and
facilities. These blood centres are subject to
nationally co-ordinated quality audit
programmes, through the Medicines Control
Agency (see page 179).
Ambulance and patient transport
services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free to
the public through the 999 telephone system for
medical emergencies and accidents, as well as for
doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid response services, in
which paramedics use cars and motorcycles to
reach emergency cases, have been introduced in a
number of areas, particularly major cities with
areas of high traffic density. Helicopter
ambulances, provided through local charities,
serve many parts of the country and an integrated
NHS-funded air ambulance service is available
throughout Scotland. In England, between
2000/01 and 2001/02 the number of emergency
calls to the NHS rose by 7 per cent to 3.8 million
and the number of emergency patient journeys
grew by 6 per cent to 3.1 million.
Non-emergency patient transport services are free
to NHS patients considered by their doctor,
dentist or midwife to be medically unfit to travel
by other means. In many areas the ambulance
service organises volunteer drivers to provide a
hospital car service for non-urgent patients.
Patients on low incomes may be eligible for
reimbursement of costs of travelling to hospital.
Hospices
Hospice (or palliative) care is a special type of care
for people whose illness may no longer be curable,
enabling them to achieve the best possible quality
of life during the final stages. It was first
developed in the United Kingdom in 1967 by
voluntary hospices. Most care continues to be
provided by them, but is also increasingly
provided within NHS palliative care units, and by
hospitals and community palliative care teams.
The care may be provided in a variety of settings:
at home (with support from specially trained
staff), in a hospice or palliative care unit, in
hospital or at a hospice day centre.
175
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
Palliative care focuses on controlling pain and
other distressing symptoms, and on providing
psychological support to patients, their families
and friends, both during the illness and into
bereavement. Palliative care services mostly help
people with cancer, although patients with other
life-threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, motor
neurone disease and heart failure, are also cared
for. Currently 22 specialist hospice inpatient units
provide respite care for children from birth to 16
years of age. Palliative care networks for children
are being established across the country to co¬
ordinate how and where services are provided. In
Scotland there is currently one children’s hospice.
A second is being built and will be operational by
April 2004.
The National Council for Hospices and Specialist
Palliative Care Services brings together voluntary
and health service providers in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland, in order to provide a co¬
ordinated view of the service. Its Scottish
counterpart is the Scottish Partnership for
Palliative Care.
Additional funding for palliative care
services
In March 2002 the Government launched a £70
million programme of palliative care services for
adults and children in England. Funds of £48 million
for children's palliative care and £22 million for
adult services were made available though the New
Opportunities Fund, which uses money from the
National Lottery to support good causes. Palliative
care providers, including Primary Care Trusts, social
services and voluntary sector organisations, are able
to apply for funding and will be informed of the
outcome in January 2003.
Sexual health
The Government’s public health strategy aims to
ensure the provision of effective sexual health
services. Free contraceptive advice and treatment
are available from GPs, family planning clinics and
tailored services for young people. Clinics are able
to provide condoms and other contraceptives free
of charge. The Department of Health has
developed a national sexual health and HIV
strategy to bring together current initiatives in
these areas, including work on chlamydia, the
incidence of which has been increasing (see page
159). The Scottish Executive is also developing
plans for a sexual health strategy. The Welsh
Assembly Government’s Strategic Framework for
Promoting Sexual Health, launched in 2000, is now
being implemented. Local sexual health strategies
are in place, and a two-year HIV prevention
campaign targeted at homosexual men has been
commissioned.
Alcohol
Part of the funds allocated for health promotion in
England is for promoting the Government’s sensible
drinking guidelines (see page 160), and equivalent
bodies are similarly funded in other parts of Britain.
‘Drinkline’ provides confidential telephone advice
about alcohol problems and services in England and
Wales. Treatment and rehabilitation within the NHS
includes inpatient and outpatient services in general
and psychiatric hospitals and some specialised
alcohol treatment units.
There is also close co-operation between statutory
and voluntary organisations. In England, Alcohol
Concern plays a prominent role in improving
services for problem drinkers and their families,
increasing public awareness of alcohol misuse, and
improving training for professional and voluntary
workers. The Scottish Council on Alcohol has a
similar function in Scotland.
In January 2002 the Scottish Executive published a
Plan for Action on Alcohol Misuse. A national
campaign involving television advertisements was
launched, aimed at raising public awareness of the
health risks associated with excessive drinking.
In Northern Ireland, a Regional Drug Strategy Co¬
ordinator was appointed in 2001 to take forward
the Drug Strategy and the Strategy for Reducing
Alcohol Related Harm.
Tobacco
The NHS Plan envisages an expansion in smoking
cessation services for those smokers who need
extra help to give up. Since April 2001 nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) has been available on
prescription from GPs. NRT can provide the body
with nicotine in decreasing doses until the craving
can be coped with. This complements buproprion
which was made available on NHS prescription on
its launch in 2000. Both of these treatments were
endorsed by the NICE (see page 164) in April
2002.
Drugs
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and
amphetamines, is a serious social and health

Smoking cessation services
NHS smoking cessation services are now available
across England. The services offer information,
counselling and motivational support to smokers
wanting to stop. They have received funding of £76
million over four years, including £23 million in
2002/03. The target for 2002/03 is for 100,000
smokers to have quit at the four-week follow-up
stage. In 2001/02 around 119,800 smokers had
successfully quit.
problem (see page 160). In response, the
Government launched its ten-year anti-drugs
strategy Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain in
1998. The strategy acknowledged the link between
drug misuse and social conditions and problems;
signalled a change in spending priorities in order to
stop the problem happening, rather than reacting
to it when it does; and developed targets for
reducing drug misuse based on evidence and
experience. The UK strategy sets out four key aims:
■ encouraging young people to resist taking
drugs in the first place;
■ helping communities to protect themselves
from drug-related anti-social and criminal
behaviour;
■ providing treatment to help people overcome
their drug addiction; and
■ tackling the availability of drugs.
Government targets for 2008 are to:
■ reduce the use of Class A drugs and the
frequent use of illicit drugs by those under
the age of 25, especially among the most
vulnerable;
■ double the number of drug misusers in
treatment;
■ reduce the level of re-offending by drug
misusing offenders; and
■ reduce the availability of the most dangerous
drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, on the
streets.
Within the overall UK strategy, there are separate
detailed strategies for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The Welsh Assembly’s anti¬
drugs strategy was published in May 2000 in
Tackling Substance Misuse in Wales: a Partnership
Approach. Scotland’s drugs strategy is set out in
Tackling Drugs in Scotland - Action in Partnership,
published in 1999, and in the Scottish Executive’s
Drug Action Plan, published in May 2000. The
strategy for Northern Ireland is set out in Drug
Strategy for Northern Ireland, published in 1999.
A feature of the UK drug strategy is the close link
between the agreed national policy and the
programmes delivered at a local level by Drug
Action Teams (DATs).5 In England there are
currently 150 DATs, composed of all those
involved in drugs issues at a local level (for
example PCTs, the social and probation services,
and the police). They agree a local strategy that
applies the national policy to the particular
conditions in their area, and report annually to
the Home Office on the progress achieved.
Medical standards
Standards of care
NHS Charters
In 2001 a new NHS Charter for England - Your
Guide to the NHS - replaced the Patient’s Charter.
It provides information on how patients can
access appropriate services to meet their
healthcare needs, sets out a series of standards for
each stage in the patient’s care, and lists
improvements patients can expect in the future. In
Wales, a Health and Social Care Charter was
launched in 2001, backed up with local charters at
local health group level. A revised Charter for
NHSScotland is planned
NHS complaints system
Under the current NHS complaints system,
complaints should be resolved speedily at local
level, but if the complainant remains dissatisfied
with the local response he or she can request an
independent review. Where such an investigation
takes place, a report setting out suggestions and
recommendations is produced. Complainants who
remain dissatisfied, or whose request for a panel
investigation is turned down, can refer their
complaint to the Health Service Commissioner.
5 These comprise DATs in England and Scotland, Drug and Alcohol
Action Teams (DAATs) in Wales, and Drug and Alcohol Co¬
ordination Teams (DCTs) in Northern Ireland. The arrangements in
Scotland are mixed, including DATs, DAATs, and some teams which
also have responsibility for smokers.
177
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
In 2000/01, 95,994 written complaints were made
about hospital and community health services in
England, and 44,442 complaints (covering general
medical and dental services and family health
services administration) were made about family
health services. In Scotland in 1999/2000 there
were 7,027 written complaints about hospital and
community health services and 2,581 about family
health services.
Health Service Commissioners
England, Wales and Scotland have Health Service
Commissioners. They are responsible for
investigating complaints from members of the
public about health service bodies which have not
been dealt with to their satisfaction by the body
concerned. The English and Welsh posts are at
present held by one person (with a staff of about
250), who is also Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the Ombudsman - see page 55).
As Health Service Commissioner, he reports
annually to Parliament and to the Welsh Assembly
Government.
The Health Service Commissioner for Scotland is
also the parliamentary and housing commissioner,
and reports to the Scottish Parliament. In
Northern Ireland complaints about health and
social services bodies are investigated by the
Commissioner for Complaints.
Health Service Commissioners can investigate
complaints that a person has suffered hardship or
injustice as a result of a failure in a service
provided by a health service body; complaints of a
failure to provide a service to which the patient
was entitled; maladministration by an NHS
authority; or action by health professionals arising
from the exercise of clinical judgement.
National Service Frameworks
National Service Frameworks (NSFs) have been
introduced in England to raise quality and reduce
variations in service within the NHS. By mid-2002
there were NSFs for cancer, paediatric intensive
care, mental health, coronary heart disease and
older people. NSFs for diabetes and for children’s
services (see page 172) are being developed, and
NSFs for renal services and long-term conditions
(with a particular focus on neurological
conditions) will follow.
In Scotland, the Scottish Diabetes Framework was
published in April 2002. A Scottish Diabetes
Group has been established to support and
monitor its implementation.
Performance and safety
Inspection and regulation
The Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry (2002) (see
page 172) recommended that the number of bodies
inspecting and regulating health and social care
should be rationalised and that the regulation of
the public and private health sectors should be
brought together. In line with these
recommendations, the Government proposes to
establish by 2004 the Commission for Healthcare
Audit and Inspection (CHAI). The CHAI will have
complete independence from the Department of
Health to investigate the performance of all NHS
organisations and private hospitals in England and
Wales. Separate arrangements will continue in
Scotland (see page 166).
CHAI will bring together the financial monitoring
work of the Audit Commission within the NHS,
the work of the Commission for Health
Improvement (see page 163) and the private
healthcare role of the National Care Standards
Commission (see page 181). Following
assessments, the CHAI will publish star ratings for
all NHS organisations and be able to recommend
special measures where there are persistent
problems. It will also publish an annual report to
Parliament on national progress on health care
and how resources have been used.
NHS Foundation Trusts
In May 2002 proposals to establish free-standing
NHS Foundation Trusts were announced. Hospitals
attaining a three-star rating in the Department of
Health's annual performance tables will be eligible
to apply. The new trusts will no longer come under
the direction of the Health Secretary and will be
able to make independent decisions on investment
and staff pay. They will also be able to retain the
proceeds from land sales to invest in new services.
The first trusts should start operating in shadow
form in July 2003 and, subject to legislation, will
become fully operational from April 2004.
Medical equipment
The Medical Devices Agency is responsible for
safeguarding the interests of patients and users by
ensuring that medical devices and equipment
meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and
performance, and that they comply with relevant
178
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
EC Directives. Medical devices cover all products,
except medicines, used in healthcare. The range of
products is very wide and includes contact lenses,
heart valves, hospital beds, radiotherapy machines,
surgical instruments, wheelchairs and walking
frames.
Medicines
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued by the European
Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products
or the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) may be
supplied to the public. Marketing authorisations
are issued following scientific assessment on the
basis of safety, quality and effectiveness.
The MCA’s Enforcement Group has responsibility
for enforcing medicines legislation in England,
and does so in Scotland and Wales on behalf of
the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly
Government. The Enforcement Group investigates
any illegal activities involving medicines and their
availability, manufacture, import, sale and supply.
In April 2003 the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will be
established, replacing the MDA and MCA. The
single agency will be responsible for the regulation
of both medicines and healthcare products.
Food safety
Under the Food Safety Act 1990, it is illegal to sell
or supply food that is unfit for human
consumption or falsely or misleadingly labelled.
The Act covers a broad range of commercial
activities related to food production, the sources
from which it is derived, such as crops and
animals, and articles which come into contact
with food. There are also more detailed
regulations, which apply to all types of food and
drink and their ingredients. Local authorities are
responsible for enforcing food law in two main
areas: trading standards officers deal with the
labelling of food, its composition and most cases
of chemical contamination; and environmental
health officers deal with hygiene, cases of
microbiological contamination of foods, and food
which is found to be unfit for human
consumption.
The Food Standards Agency (ESA), which began
operating in 2000, is responsible for all aspects of
food safety and standards in the UK. The Agency
has set a target to reduce foodborne disease (see
box) and is seeking new ways to help
disadvantaged consumers improve their diets. It
also sets and audits standards for the enforcement
of food law by local authorities.
National Food Hygiene Campaign
In February 2002, the FSA launched a £20 million
five-year national campaign to reduce food
poisoning by 20 per cent by 2006. In order to tackle
inadequate hygiene standards in catering
businesses, the campaign is initially targeted at the
370,000 catering businesses in the UK, before being
extended to consumers and food safety in the home
at a later date. Information on how to improve
standards has been sent to businesses and
employees have been reached by television, radio
and press advertising.
Research
The Medical Research Council (MRC) (see also
chapter 25) supports medical research in the
United Kingdom by providing funding for research
programmes and infrastructure, and by investing
in training and employment, both in universities
and in its own research centres. The MRC receives
an annual grant from the Office of Science and
Technology (OST - part of the Department of
Trade and Industry). In 2001/02 the MRC received
a grant of £345 million and realised a further £71
million from external sources, such as joint¬
funding initiatives and commercial funds.
The MRC advises the Government on matters
relating to medical research, and co-operates with
health departments throughout the UK, the NHS
and other government departments concerned
with biomedical and health service research. It
also works closely with other research councils,
medical research charities, industry and
consumers, to identify and respond to current and
future health needs.
Human fertilisation and embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in the
UK in 1978, as a result of the technique of in vitro
fertilisation. The social, ethical and legal
implications were examined by a committee of
inquiry and led eventually to the passage of the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority
(HFEA) licenses and inspects centres providing
certain infertility treatments, undertaking human
embryo research or storing gametes or embryos.
179
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
Since it was established in 1913, the MRC has been
responsible for many significant medical discoveries
and achievements. In the past ten years these have
included:
■ the production of artificial haemoglobin (1992);
■ the discovery of the gene for Huntingdon's
disease (1993);
■ a new combination drug therapy for AIDS
sufferers (1995);
■ the discovery of a new treatment for malaria
(1996);
■ the development of 'DNA chip' technology
(1997);
■ the determination of the molecular structure of
cells' 'energy engine' (1999); and
■ research into the cellular manufacture of
proteins and how this is disrupted in bacteria by
antibiotics (2001).
The HFEA maintains a code of practice giving
guidance to licensed centres and reports annually
to Parliament.
In 2001 Parliament approved regulations made
under the 1990 Act to extend the purposes for
which research on human embryos could be
permitted. The decision allowed scientists to seek
approval from the HFEA to extract embryonic
stem cells for research aimed at increasing
knowledge about serious disease and applying
such knowledge to the development of treatments.
The first two licence applications made under the
2001 regulations were approved in February 2002
and involved research into Parkinson’s Disease and
pancreatic disease. To support research in this
area, the MRC is to establish a UK stem cell bank
which will provide researchers with adult foetal
and embryonic stem cell lines.
Cancer Research UK
Cancer Research UK was established in February
2002 through the merger of the Cancer Research
Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund
to create the largest volunteer-funded cancer
research organisation in the world. It has 3,000
scientists and an annual scientific budget of more
than £175 million, raised almost entirely through
public donations.
Health arrangements with other
countries
The member states of the European Economic Area
(EEA - see page 60) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals resident
in a member state are entitled to receive emergency
treatment, either free or at a reduced cost, during
visits to other EEA countries. These arrangements
also now apply in Switzerland. Treatment is
provided, in most cases, on production of a valid
Form El 11 which people in the United Kingdom
normally obtain from a post office before travelling.
There are also arrangements for people who go to
another EEA country specifically for medical care,
or who require continuing treatment for a pre¬
existing condition.
Unless they are in an exempted category (for
instance those persons engaging in employment,
taking up permanent residence or seeking asylum
in the UK), visitors to the United Kingdom are
generally expected to pay for all non-emergency
treatment. The United Kingdom also has a number
of separate bilateral agreements with some other
countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.
NHS patients travelling abroad for treatment
Following the rulings of the European Court of
Justice in July 2001, the Secretary of State for
Health announced that treatment for patients in the
EEA is one of the options open to NHS bodies
seeking to increase the number of patients treated
and reduce waiting times. Between January and
April 2002, 190 patients from south-east England
were treated in France and Germany in a pilot
scheme. Draft guidance for the NHS has been issued
and commissioning arrangements have been set up
to assist NHS bodies wishing to refer patients to
other countries in the EEA.
Health provision outside the
NHS
Private healthcare
As an alternative to the NHS, people are entitled
to pay for their own health and social care, by
joining a private healthcare organisation. In
addition, there is the option of private medical
insurance, which, depending on the premium
paid, will cover people’s healthcare in times of
need. In 2000, 6.9 million people in the United
Kingdom were covered by private medical
180
Social and cultural affairs
13 Health
insurance, more than three times the number in
1971 (2.1 million). The overall cost of claims to
private medical insurers rose by 5.5 per cent
between 1999 and 2000 to £1,934 million.
Regulation of the private healthcare sector is now
primarily undertaken by the National Care
Standards Commission (NCSC). This is an
independent public body set up under the Care
Standards Act 2000 to regulate social care (see
chapter 12) and private and voluntary health care
services in England, in institutions such as care
homes, children’s homes, private hospitals and
private clinics. The NCSC will assume its
registration and inspection responsibilities in
January 2003. This role had previously been the
responsibility of local authority and health
authority inspection units. The NCSC will carry
out regular inspections of services and will have
the power to ensure that standards meet national
minima. In Wales, these functions are being
performed by the Care Standards Inspectorate for
Wales, a new division within the Welsh Assembly
Government.
Partnerships
The Government is beginning to work formally in
partnership with the private sector. In 2000 the
Department of Health signed an agreement with
the independent healthcare sector (which
comprises the private and voluntary sectors),
under which English health authorities are able to
bring private sector providers into the planning of
local healthcare on a systematic and long-term
basis. The agreement covers care, workforce
planning and service planning. It involves the
NHS using the private sector’s spare capacity;
transfer of patients between the two sectors;
exchange of information; and joint working on
preventive and rehabilitation services.
Complementary and alternative
medicine
There is a growing interest in complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM). In November 2000
the House of Lords Select Committee on Science
and Technology reported its findings on CAM,
and in March 2001 the Government published its
response. The Government agreed that
acupuncture and herbal medicine were early
candidates for regulation on a statutory basis, and
that others, such as chiropractic, homeopathy and
osteopathy, might also be regulated in due course.
Information on CAM is now available through
NHS Direct Online.

Between 1996 and 2000, crime recorded by the
police in England and Wales fell by 8 per cent,
compared with a 1 per cent rise in all EU Member
States. Survey evidence (see page 184) also
suggests that crime in England and Wales was
declining during this period. Since 2000/01,
however, crimes recorded by the police have
increased, while survey evidence indicates that the
number of crimes has been relatively stable.
The UK has three legal systems (operating in
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland) and three systems of criminal justice.
Unlike many countries, there is no single criminal
or penal code that sets out the principles on which
the justice system operates, but there is emphasis
on the independence of both prosecuting
authorities and the judiciary.
Civil law is concerned primarily with regulating
disputes between individuals or corporate bodies
and requires a case to be proved on the balance of
probabilities, rather than the ‘beyond reasonable
doubt’ standard that is applied in criminal cases.
In both criminal and civil cases, the courts make
their decisions on an adversarial rather than an
inquisitorial basis.
Statutes passed by the Westminster or Scottish
Parliaments are the ultimate source of law, but
there is also a legal duty to comply with European
Community law, and courts in the UK are obliged
to apply the latter in cases where the two conflict.
A statute may confer power on a minister, local
authority or other executive body to make
delegated legislation (see page 40).
In all three legal systems many areas of law have
developed over the centuries through the decisions
of the courts. Consistency is achieved because the
decisions of higher courts are binding on those
lower down the hierarchy. The House of Lords is
the ultimate appeal court in the UK, except for
Scottish criminal cases.
EC law, which applies in the UK as a member of
the European Union (see page 59), is derived from
the EC treaties, from the Community legislation
adopted under them, and from the decisions of
the European Court of Justice. That court has the
highest authority, under the Treaty of Rome, to
decide points of EC law. Where a point arises
before a British court, it may refer the point of law
to the Court of Justice for it to decide. Sometimes
a court is obliged to make a reference to the
European Court.
The European Convention on Human Rights was
incorporated into UK law under the Human Rights
Act 1998. This covers, among other things, the
right to a fair trial, to freedom of thought and
expression, and to respect for family and private
life. All public authorities, including the courts,
must act compatibly with these rights. The rights
in the Convention do not take precedence over an
Act of Parliament. Where they conflict, the higher
183
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
courts may make a declaration of incompatibility
and Parliament then decides what action to take.
Crime
There are two main measures of the scale of crime
in the UK: the recording of crimes by the police;
and surveys of victims, such as the British Crime
Survey (BCS) - covering England and Wales - and
the Scottish Crime Survey. It is difficult to
compare or combine crime statistics from
England and Wales, Northern Ireland and
Scotland because of the different legal systems (see
pages 200 to 205). Most of the information below
therefore relates to England and Wales.
Recorded crime
In England and Wales the term ‘recorded crime’
refers to notifiable offences recorded by the
police according to rules set down by the
Home Office. Recorded crime includes a wide
range of offences from homicide to minor theft
and criminal damage, but does not include most
of the ‘summary’ offences (such as motoring
offences) that are dealt with by magistrates.
Changes in recording practice since 1998 have
made it difficult to compare trends over time
(see box).
Overall recorded crime totalled 5.5 million
offences in the year to 31 March 2002,
representing an increase of 7 per cent over the
previous 12 months. The overall detection rate
was 23 per cent.

In Scotland 421,093 crimes were recorded by the
police in 2001, a decrease of just under 0.5 per
cent compared with 2000. The overall clear-up
rate was 45 per cent. (In Scotland crimes detected
are referred to as crimes cleared up.)
Recorded crime in Northern Ireland in 2001/02
totalled 140,000 offences. This was an increase of
17 per cent over the previous year. The overall
clear-up rate was 20 per cent.
How crime is recorded
Home Office counting rules for recorded crime in
England and Wales have been revised over the
years, both to promote greater consistency between
police forces and to ensure a more victim-oriented
approach. In 1998 a 'one crime per victim' rule was
introduced, which means, for example, that if an
offender wounds three people in the course of one
incident, three crimes are recorded. Since 2000, the
police have been changing their systems to record
the allegations of victims unless there is credible
evidence that a crime has not taken place. In April
2002, a new National Crime Recording Service
(NCRS) formalised these changes across England
and Wales.
Detection or dear-up rates
Under the counting rules, a crime is 'detected' or
'cleared up' if a suspect has been identified and
interviewed and there is sufficient evidence to bring
a charge. There does not have to be a prosecution;
for example, the offender may accept a caution or
ask for the crime to be taken into consideration by
the court, or the victim may not wish to give
evidence.
Crime surveys
Unlike crime data recorded by the police, the
British Crime Survey is restricted to crimes
against people aged 16 or over who are living in
private households at the time of the interview,
and does not include some types of crime (for
example, fraud, murder and so-called victimless
crimes). In other ways the BCS is more
comprehensive, however, because it asks
respondents whether they have experienced
certain personal and household crimes in the
preceding year, regardless of whether or not they
reported the incident to the police. On the basis of
answers given, it is estimated that there were 13
million incidents of crime in England and Wales
in 2001/02 (see Figure 14.2). The chances of being
184
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
a victim of crime over the course of a year have
remained stable at just below 28 per cent, around
the lowest level since the BCS began in 1981.
The survey also covers such issues as whether the
respondents are concerned or worried about
crime. Individuals from Black and Asian groups
have consistently shown higher levels of concern
about crime than individuals from other ethnic
groups and women of all ages and ethnic groups
were more likely to be concerned than men.

The 2000 Scottish Crime Survey estimated that
around 843,000 crimes were committed against
individuals and private households in Scotland
during 1999. This was 13 per cent fewer than the
number (estimated in the 1996 survey) of 969,000
crimes in 1995.
Offenders
Analysis of the latest available statistics for
England and Wales (see Table 14.3) indicates that:
■ more than four times as many males as
females were found guilty of or cautioned for
an offence. This ratio is much higher for
some categories of crime (such as burglary
and sexual offences);
■ 37 per cent of male offenders and 60 per cent
of female offenders were found guilty of, or
cautioned for, theft-related offences, the most
commonly committed offence; and
the combined conviction and caution rate
was much higher for those aged 16 to 24 than
for other age groups.
Young offenders - then and now
Attitudes to crime have changed considerably over
the last 50 years. Then some of the increases in
juvenile delinquency were attributed to a 'failure to
recognise and treat early enough children who are
of sub-normal intelligence or who develop unstable,
anti-social characters'; along with 'the temptation
offered by the display in shops of goods which
attract children'. Nowadays, research into causes of
crime is more likely to identify poor parenting and
the quality of a young person's home life as
contributory factors in youth criminality.
Current issues of concern
An aim of the Home Office and the devolved
administrations is to reduce crime and the fear of
crime. As well as tackling the overall level of
crime, particular concern is being paid to issues
such as drug misuse and the threat of terrorism.
Crime reduction
A wide range of measures are being taken to try to
reduce the overall level of crime. For example,
there are 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction
Partnerships in England and Wales bringing
together the police, local authorities and other
relevant agencies, such as youth offending teams,
drug action teams, the courts and the prison
service and others, in order to develop local
strategies. The partnerships are monitored by ten
crime reduction directors.
The Home Office has funded a range of initiatives
under its Crime Reduction Programme over a
three-year period from 1999. Over £340 million
has already been allocated to around 1,470
projects, including closed circuit television
surveillance systems in public areas such as
housing estates, shopping centres, railway stations
and car parks. The initiatives have been aimed at
reducing crime and gathering evidence on what
works in tackling crime and its causes. A website
{www.crimereduction.gov.uk) has been developed
with the aim of helping practitioners around the
country and abroad. A number of toolkits can be
found on the website.

Within the Scottish Executive Justice Department,
the Crime Prevention Unit has responsibility for
developing crime prevention, community safety
and domestic abuse policy on behalf of Scottish
Executive ministers. All 32 local councils in
Scotland have formed community safety
partnerships. The Scottish Executive has formed a
Scottish Forum on Community Safety.
Street crime
The Street Crime Initiative was launched in April
2002 with the aim of targeting recent increases in
street crime. Street crime, defined as robbery,
snatch theft, carjacking and gun-related crime, is
concentrated in a relatively small number of
mainly urban areas. The Initiative is running in
ten police force areas, which in 2001/02 accounted
for 83 per cent of street crime. Several government
departments are involved as well as the police,
courts and the Crown Prosecution Service (see
page 189). Among the measures included are:
■ the nomination of specialist street crime
courts in the relevant police force areas,
allowing street crime cases a speedier
progress through the criminal justice system;
and providing separate facilities and support
to victims and witnesses;
■ the provision of video identification
equipment to enable more video
identification parades to replace ‘live’ parades,
reducing potential delays; and
■ enabling lawyers and other professionals
within the criminal justice system to form a
dedicated investigation and prosecution
service.
Elements of the initiative aimed at crime
prevention are:
■ funding from the Department for Education
186
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
and Skills (DfES) for truancy sweeps, for
provision of full-time education for excluded
pupils, and for new or expanded learning
support units; and
■ the provision, within 24 hours of their arrest
or release from custody, of drug treatment
services for street crime offenders with drug
problems.
Drug misuse
The UK drugs strategy, introduced to co-ordinate
the fight against illegal drugs, focuses on Class A
drugs' which cause the most harm. It has four
main aims:
■ helping young people resist drug misuse in
order to achieve their full potential in society;
■ enabling people to overcome drug problems
through treatment;
■ protecting communities from drug-related
anti-social and criminal behaviour; and
■ reducing the supply of illegal drugs on the
streets.
Scotland has its own drugs strategy within the UK
framework and has also introduced national
standards for drugs services. In an effort to reduce
the availability of drugs in Scotland and to target
organised drug crime, the Scottish Drug
Enforcement Agency was launched in June 2000.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced drug
treatment and testing orders, targeted at persistent
offenders (aged 16 and over) who show a willingness
to co-operate with treatment and are before the
court for an offence that is sufficiently serious to
attract a community sentence as a penalty. While
subject to the drug treatment and testing order,
offenders are closely supervised and follow an
individually tailored treatment programme for
several hours a day for the first 13 weeks of the
order. After 13 weeks have elapsed, time spent under
supervision may subsequently be reduced. There are
also mandatory testing and court review
requirements through which offenders’ progress can
1 The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 classifies drugs according to a
scientific assessment of their harmfulness. The most dangerous
drugs are Class A drugs, such as heroin and cocaine. Class B drugs
include amphetamine and Class C drugs include steroids. This
legislation applies across the UK.
be effectively monitored. Drug treatment and testing
order pilots ran from October 1998 to March 2000
in three areas and were managed by the relevant
local probation services (see page 198). After
evaluation of the pilot scheme, the orders were
introduced in England and Wales in October 2000
and are being introduced on a phased basis in
Scotland, where the use of drug courts is also being
piloted. By April 2002 over 6,000 orders had been
made in England and Wales.
The Drugs Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS)
promotes community-based drugs prevention at
local, regional and national level. DPAS teams
have been established in each of the nine
Government Regions in England.
Under provisions in the Criminal Justice and Court
Services Act 2000, the drug testing of offenders will
be extended across the criminal justice process in
England and Wales. These provide for testing:
■ of persons (for specified Class A drugs) in
police detention after charge;
■ of offenders under probation supervision
through a new drug abstinence order; and
■ as a condition of release on licence or notice
of supervision.
The initial programme for the testing of offenders
will run until 2004.
Drug misuse in England and Wales costs society up
to £17.4 billion a year, according to recent research.
Problem drug users - mainly hardcore heroin and
cocaine addicts - account for 99 per cent of the bill,
each costing the State a minimum of £10,400 a
year. In 2001 the Government announced a
programme to tackle drugs and drug-related crime
in communities - Communities Against Drugs -
and channelled over £200 million to Crime and
Disorder Reduction Partnerships and drug action
teams with the aim of tackling local drugs markets
and cutting drug-related crime.
The Government intends to reclassify cannabis
across the UK from Class B to Class C under the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. As a result, the
maximum penalty for the possession of cannabis
will fall from five years to two years’
imprisonment. Simultaneously, the Government
also intends to increase the maximum penalty for
supplying Class C drugs from 5 to 14 years’
imprisonment. This means that, on reclassification,
187
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
the maximum penalty for supplying cannabis will
remain at 14 years’ imprisonment.
Under the proposals expected to apply in England
and Wales, for most offences of cannabis
possession, a police warning will be sufficient,
together with confiscation of the drug. Where
there are additional considerations, or where there
is repeat offending, the case could proceed to
court. The police will retain the power of arrest, to
be used in exceptional circumstances. Similar
proposals are expected to apply in Scotland.
Terrorism
In the light of the attacks in the United States in
September 2001 (see page 76), the Government
announced its intention to strengthen the existing
counter-terrorism provisions of the Terrorism Act
2000. Further measures were contained in the Anti-
Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001. Taken
together, the two Acts have resulted in new
permanent UK-wide anti-terrorist legislation
(replacing the system of separate and temporary
legislation for Northern Ireland and Great Britain),
while a new definition of terrorism has been adopted
covering ideological and religious motivation for
terrorist acts. Provisions in the Acts include:
■ a new offence of inciting terrorist acts abroad
from within the UK;
■ new powers to seize suspected terrorist cash
at borders;
■ a new judicial authority to consider
applications for extensions of detention of
terrorist suspects;
■ specific offences relating to training for
terrorist activities;
■ new offences on weapons of mass
destruction;
■ better security at airports and nuclear sites; and
■ an extension of police powers to detain and
question those suspected of terrorist offences.
England and Wales
Policing
The following section deals with police powers
only. The structure of the police service in
England and Wales is described on page 196.
Police powers and procedures are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of practice.
Evidence obtained in breach of the codes may be
ruled inadmissible in court. The codes must be
available in all police stations.
Stop and search
Police officers can stop and search people and
vehicles if they reasonably suspect that they will
find stolen goods, offensive weapons or
implements that could be used for burglary and
other offences. The officer must record the
grounds for the search and the person searched is
entitled to a copy of the officer’s report. Some
714,000 stop and searches were carried out by the
police in England and Wales in 2000/01.
Arrest
The police may arrest a suspect on a warrant
issued by a court, but can also do so without a
warrant for arrestable offences (those for which
the sentence is fixed by law or for which the term
of imprisonment is five years or more).
Detention and questioning
Suspects must be cautioned before the police can
ask any questions about an offence. For arrestable
offences, a suspect can be detained in police
custody without charge for up to 24 hours.
Someone suspected of a serious arrestable offence
can be held for up to 96 hours, but not beyond 36
hours unless a warrant is obtained from a
magistrates’ court.
Charging
Once there is sufficient evidence, the police have
to decide whether a detained person should be
charged with an offence. If the police institute
criminal proceedings against a suspect, the Crown
Prosecution Service (see page 189) then takes
control of the case.
For minor offences, the police may decide to
caution an offender rather than prosecute.
A caution is not the same as a conviction, and will
only be given if the person admits the offence.
Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998,
cautioning for young offenders has been replaced
with the final warning scheme.
If the police decide to charge someone, that
person may be released on bail to attend a
magistrates’ court. If not granted police bail, the
defendant must be brought before a magistrates’
188
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
court (or, if under 18, a youth court) as soon as
possible. There is a general right to bail, but
magistrates may withhold it. If bail is refused, an
accused person has the right to apply again,
subject to some limitations, to the Crown Court
or to a High Court judge. In certain
circumstances, the prosecution may appeal to a
Crown Court judge against the granting of bail by
magistrates.
Complaints
Members of the public can make complaints
against the police if they feel they have been treated
unfairly or improperly. Of the 31,000 complaints in
England and Wales completed in 2000/01, roughly
a third were resolved locally without investigation,
one-third were dispensed with without
investigation and one-third were investigated.
The investigation of the more serious cases in
England and Wales is supervised by the Police
Complaints Authority. A new independent body,
intended to be the core component of a new
complaints system, will replace the Police
Complaints Authority from April 2004.
Community relations
Measures introduced to promote better relations
between the police and the communities they
serve include:
■ an extension of the race relations legislation -
through the Race Relations (Amendment) Act
2000 (see pages 94-5). This outlaws direct
and indirect discrimination in all public
authorities (including the police), and places
a duty on them to promote race equality;
■ citizenship classes in schools, to be
introduced into the National Curriculum
(see pages 105-7) in England and Wales in
2002, to ensure that pupils are taught about
the cultural diversity of Britain;
■ enforcing specific criminal offences of racially
aggravated violence, harassment and criminal
damage; and
■ a programme to reform the use by the police
of their powers to stop and search people
(with the aim of ensuring these powers are
used fairly).
In 1999 the Government set employment targets
for the recruitment, retention and progression of
minority ethnic police officers in England and
Wales. The targets are intended to ensure that by
2009 forces will reflect their local population. At
the end of September 2001 there were 3,386
officers from minority ethnic backgrounds
(representing 2.6 per cent of the police service in
England and Wales).
Statistics on race and the criminal justice system
can be found on the Home Office website
(www.homeoffice.gov. uk/rds/index).
The prosecution process
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is
responsible for prosecuting people in England and
Wales who have been charged by the police with a
criminal offence. Although it works closely with
the police, it is a governmental body independent
of them. Its role is to:
■ advise the police on possible prosecutions;
■ review prosecutions started by the police to
ensure that the right defendants are
prosecuted on the correct charges before the
appropriate court;
■ prepare cases for court;
■ prosecute cases at magistrates’ courts; and
■ instruct counsel to prosecute cases in the
Crown Court and higher courts.2
When deciding on whether to go ahead with a case,
Crown Prosecutors must first be satisfied that there
is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of
conviction against each defendant on each charge.
If there is enough evidence, prosecutors must then
decide whether it is in the public interest to
proceed. A prosecution will usually take place
unless there are public interest factors against it
clearly outweighing those in favour.
Court procedures
There are two types of criminal offence. Summary
offences are the least serious and may be tried
only in a magistrates’ court. Indictable offences are
subdivided into ‘indictable only’ (such as murder,
manslaughter or robbery) which must be tried on
indictment1 at the Crown Court by judge and jury,
2 A number of CPS lawyers are qualified to appear in some cases in
the Crown Court and other higher courts.
3 An indictment is a written accusation against a person, charging
him or her with serious crime triable by jury.

Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
and ‘either-way’, which may be tried either
summarily or on indictment.
Either-way offences, such as theft and burglary,
can vary greatly in seriousness and a magistrates’
court must decide whether the case is serious
enough to be sent to the Crown Court. If the
magistrates decide in favour of summary trial, the
accused person currently has the right to a trial by
jury in the Crown Court if he or she chooses.
Where an either-way case is to be tried on
indictment, the magistrates’ court commits it to
the Crown Court for trial if it is satisfied that
there is a case to answer. In most cases this is
accepted by the defence and the magistrates do
not need to consider the evidence, but if the
defence challenges the case, the magistrates
consider the documentary evidence, without
witnesses being called.
Magistrates may impose a fine of up to £5,000
and/or a maximum sentence of six months’
imprisonment, but can send the offender to the
Crown Court if they feel their sentencing powers
are not sufficient. These arrangements are
currently under review.
Youth courts are specialist magistrates’ courts,
which sit separately from those dealing with
adults. They handle all but the most serious
charges against people aged at least ten (the age of
criminal responsibility) and under 18. Young
offenders may also be tried in an adult
magistrates’ court or in a Crown Court,
depending on the type of offence they have
committed. Only Justices of the Peace who have
been specially trained for the job sit in youth
courts. Proceedings are held in private.
Trial
The law presumes an accused person is innocent
until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt by
the prosecution. Accused people have a right at all
stages to stay silent; however, when questioned,
failure to mention facts which they later rely upon
in their defence may not be helpful to their case. If
the defendant pleads guilty, the judge will simply
decide upon the appropriate sentence.
Criminal trials normally take place in open court
(that is, members of the public and press are
allowed to hear the proceedings) unless there are
specific reasons why this would not be
appropriate. If a not guilty plea is entered, the
prosecution and defence form opposing sides in
an ‘adversarial’ system. They call and examine
witnesses and present opposing versions of the
case. Strict rules of evidence govern how this may
be done. Written statements by witnesses are
allowed with the consent of the other party or in
limited circumstances at the discretion of the
court. Otherwise evidence is taken from witnesses
testifying orally on oath. Child witnesses may
testify without taking the oath and their evidence
must be received by the court unless the child is
incapable of giving intelligible testimony. A child
in some circumstances can testify via a live TV
link or the court may consider a video-recorded
interview, subject to the defence having the right
to question the child in cross-examination.
Publicly funded legal services
Advice and assistance are available without
reference to an individual’s means to anyone who
is arrested and held in custody at a police station,
or other premises, or who appears before a court.
Where a defendant is charged with a criminal
offence, he or she may apply for a representation
order which will entitle him or her to the services
of a solicitor and/or barrister depending on the
type of case. There is no means test to decide
eligibility for representation. The court must be
Support for victims and witnesses
The Victim's Charter sets out how victims of crime in
England and Wales should be treated and what they
can expect from the criminal justice system. There is
also a charter for court users, which describes how
the courts work and spells out the standards of
service that should be reached in the higher courts.
A government-funded voluntary sector organisation,
Victim Support, provides practical help and
emotional support to victims of crime with the aid
of around 13,000 volunteers. It also runs the
Witness Service, which provides income and support
to victims and witnesses attending criminal courts in
England and Wales. Similar schemes operate in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Blameless victims of violent crime in England, Wales
and Scotland may be eligible for compensation from
public funds under the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme. In Northern Ireland there
are separate statutory arrangements for
compensation for criminal injuries, and for malicious
damage to property.

satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that
publicly funded representation should be granted.
At the end of the case, the trial judge has power to
order the defendant to pay back some or all of the
costs of his or her defence.
In criminal proceedings the Legal Services
Commission (see page 199), through the Criminal
Defence Service, makes arrangements for solicitors
to assist unrepresented defendants in the
magistrates’ courts and advocacy assistance is also
available in some other specified circumstances.
During 2001 over 1.2 million acts of assistance,
including offering advice and payment of legal
bills, were granted at a total cost of around
£360 million.
The jury
In jury trials in England and Wales the judge
decides questions of law, sums up the case to the
jury, and discharges or sentences the accused. The
jury is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
The jury’s verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’
and the latter would result in an acquittal. Juries
may, subject to certain conditions, reach a verdict
by a majority of at least 10-2.
If an accused person is acquitted, there is no right
of appeal from the prosecution, and the accused
cannot be tried again for that same offence.
However, an acquittal may be set aside and a
retrial ordered if there is proof that a juror has
been interfered with or intimidated.
A jury is independent of the judiciary and any
attempt to interfere with its members is a criminal
offence. People aged between 18 and 70 whose
names appear on the electoral register are liable to
be chosen at random for jury service. People in
certain occupations, such as police officers,
lawyers and doctors, are exempted from serving.
Sentencing and appeals
The court will sentence the offender after
considering all the relevant information it has on
the case, which may include a pre-sentence or any
other specialist report, and a mitigating plea by
the defence. A fine is the most common
punishment, and most offenders are fined for
summary offences. A court may also make
compensation orders, which require the offender
to pay compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence; or impose a
conditional discharge, where the offender, if he or
Criminal Justice White Paper
In July 2002 the Government published the criminal
justice White Paper Justice For All, outlining a
programme for reform of the criminal justice system
which the Government intends to introduce in
England and Wales over the coming years. The
White Paper includes proposals designed to
rebalance the system in favour of victims, witnesses
and communities and to deliver justice for all, by
building trust and credibility in the criminal justice
system. Among its proposals, it aims to:
■ extend sentencing powers of magistrates from 6
to 12 months and require them to sentence all
those they have found guilty, rather than
committing some to be sentenced in the Crown
Court;
■ allow defendants to have the right to ask for
trial by judge alone in the Crown Court;
■ allow trial by judge alone in serious and complex
fraud trials, and the possibility of allowing this
for some other complex and lengthy trials, or
where the jury is at risk of intimidation;
■ allow witnesses to refer to their previous and
original statements and change the laws on
reported evidence ('hearsay');
■ introduce an exception to the double jeopardy
rule (which prevents defendants from being tried
twice for the same offence) in serious cases,
where there is compelling new evidence;
■ integrate the management of the courts within a
single courts administration; and
■ codify criminal statutes so as to avoid
inconsistencies and overlapping.
she offends again, may be sentenced for both the
original offence and for the new one.
A range of community sentences (see box
overleaf) are used in cases where a fine or
custodial sentence would not be appropriate. A
community rehabilitation order requires offenders
to maintain regular contact with their probation
officer. The aim is to secure the rehabilitation of
the offender, protect the public and prevent
re-offending. The order can last from six months
to three years; an offender who fails to comply
without good reason with any of the requirements
can be brought before the court again.

Community sentences
■ community rehabilitation orders (involving
supervision in the community);
■ community punishment orders (unpaid work
within the community);
■ community punishment and rehabilitation orders
(elements of both probation supervision and
unpaid work);
■ curfew orders (requiring the offender to remain
at a specified place for specified periods, usually
monitored by electronic tagging);
■ drug treatment and testing orders
(see page 187);
■ drug abstinence orders (currently being piloted)
which require an offender to abstain from
misusing Class A drugs and to undertake drugs
tests when instructed; and
■ exclusion orders (likely to be introduced in 2003
and monitored by electronic tagging) requiring
offenders to stay away from a certain place for
specified periods.
The National Probation Service for England and
Wales dealt with around 122,100 new offenders in
2001. just under half this total were starting
community rehabilitation orders; a similar
proportion was beginning community
punishment orders.
Prohibitive anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs)
may be applied to individuals or groups whose
threatening and disruptive conduct harasses the
local community. Anyone in breach of such an
order is guilty of a criminal offence. ASBOs are
applicable throughout the UK.
The type of sentence received by offenders has
recently been the subject of much debate,
stimulated in part by an official report into
sentencing options employed by the courts.
Proposals in the report have formed part of a
wider review of the criminal justice system (see
page 192). Table 14.5 shows that 30 per cent of
offenders sentenced for indictable offences were
given a community sentence in 2000, 25 per cent
were given a fine, and 25 per cent a custodial
sentence.
Young offenders
The main custodial sentence for 12 to 17 year olds
is the detention and training order. It is a two-part
sentence which combines a period of custody with
a period under supervision in the community. It
may last for a minimum of four months to a
maximum of two years and there is provision for
the custodial element to be shortened or
lengthened depending on the young offender’s
progress.

There are a range of non-custodial penalties for
young offenders (see box). Those aged 16 or 17
may also be subject to most of the adult
community sentences.
Non-custodial penalties for young offenders
Penalties include:
■ fines and a compensation order, with the
offender's parents having to pay;
■ a supervision order, where the offender must
comply with specific requirements, such as
staying in local authority accommodation;
■ an attendance centre order, where the offender
is required to attend a centre for two to three
hours on alternate Saturdays for specific
activities;
■ a curfew order with electronic tagging;
■ a reparation order, requiring young offenders to
compensate the victim or victims (if they wish it)
of their offence or the community which they
have harmed, in some non-financial way; and
■ an action plan order, where young offenders are
required to comply with an individually tailored
programme designed to address their offending
behaviour and the factors associated with it.
A new sentence, the referral order, was introduced
in 2002 for young offenders convicted in court for
the first time and pleading guilty. The court refers
the young person to a youth offender panel led by
members of the local community who agree a
contract with the young person to repair the harm
done and prevent further offending.
Complementing the non-custodial penalties for
young offenders are parenting orders, which
require a parent or guardian to attend counselling
and guidance sessions, and may direct them to
comply with other requirements; and child safety
orders, which place a child under ten who is at
risk of becoming involved in crime or is behaving
in an anti-social manner under the supervision of
a specified, responsible officer.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may
appeal to the High Court, on points of law, and to
the Crown Court, for his or her trial to be re¬
heard. Appeals from the Crown Court go to the
Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A further
appeal can be made to the House of Lords on
points of law of public importance, if permission
is given. A prosecutor cannot appeal against an
acquittal, but there is a system for reviewing
rulings of law and sentences which are too
lenient.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is
independent of both government and the courts,
reviews alleged miscarriages of justice. Referral of
a case to this body depends on some new
argument or evidence coming to light, not
previously raised at the trial or on appeal.
During 2001, a total of 7,440 applications for leave
to appeal were received, of which 1,943 were
against conviction in the Crown Court and 5,497
against the sentence imposed.
Prison
The Prison Service in England and Wales is an
executive agency of the Home Office. There are
currently 138 prison establishments (nine of
which are run by private contractors).
One in four of those convicted of an indictable
offence in 2001 in England and Wales received a
custodial sentence (see Table 14.5). Life
imprisonment is the mandatory sentence for
murder, and is also available for certain other
serious offences. The death penalty is no longer
available for any offence; it has not been used
anywhere in the United Kingdom since 1965.
Prison accommodation ranges from open prisons
to high-security establishments. Sentenced
prisoners are classified into different risk-level
groups for security purposes. Women prisoners
are held in separate prisons or in separate
accommodation in mixed prisons.
In England and Wales, there have been recent
increases in the prison population, which now
numbers over 66,000. Measures taken to alleviate
potential overcrowding in prisons include greater
use of community (non-custodial) sentences for
minor offenders; expanding the capacity of
prisons and further opportunities for the granting
of early release to prisoners (see below).
Prisoners throughout the UK may write and
receive letters, be visited by relatives and friends,
and make telephone calls. Privileges include a

personal radio; books, magazines and newspapers;
and watching television. Earnable privileges,
dependent on good behaviour, include extra and
improved visits, higher rates of pay, community
visits, and longer periods out of the cell. People
awaiting trial in custody have certain rights and
privileges not granted to convicted prisoners.
Measures to counter drug misuse in prisons
include mandatory drug testing.
There are statutory arrangements governing the
early release of prisoners. Offenders serving shorter
terms (less than four years) may be automatically
released at specific points in their sentences, while
those detained for longer require Parole Board
approval or the consent of a government minister.
Criminal justice agencies
The criminal justice system in England and Wales is
made up of personnel working in a number of
different agencies, reporting to the Home Office, the
Lord Chancellor’s Department and the Attorney
General’s Office, as illustrated in Figure 14.6.
The police service
There are 43 police forces organised on a local
basis in England and Wales. The Metropolitan
Police Service and the City of London force are
responsible for policing London.
Police forces are maintained in England and Wales
by local police authorities. In the 41 police areas
outside London they normally have 17 members -
nine locally elected councillors, three magistrates
and five independent members. The authorities
set local policing objectives in consultation with
the chief constables and local community, while
the Government sets ministerial priorities for the
police as a whole.
Each force is headed by a chief constable (in
London the Commissioner of the City of London
Police, and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police) appointed by their police authorities with
government approval. Independent inspectors of
constabulary report on the efficiency and
effectiveness of police forces. In 2002 there were in
England and Wales 127,231 police officers, 12,068
special constables (part-time volunteers who work
in support), and 58,957 civilian staff (including
traffic wardens).
National crime bodies
The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS)
is responsible for collecting and analysing criminal
intelligence for use by police forces and other law
enforcement agencies in the UK. NCIS co¬
ordinates the activities of the Security Services in
support of the law enforcement agencies against
organised crime, and liaises with the International
Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL), which
promotes international co-operation between
police forces. It also provides the channel for
communication between the UK and EUROPOL
(see page 76).
The role of the National Crime Squad is to prevent
and detect organised and serious crime across
police force and national boundaries in England
and Wales and to support provincial forces in
their investigation of serious crime. It is headed by
a Director General, who is accountable to a body
known as the Service Authorities.
The Forensic Science Service (ESS) is an executive
agency of the Home Office that provides scientific
support to police forces through its six regional
laboratories. It also operates the national DNA
database in England and Wales, which is used to
match DNA profiles taken from suspects to
profiles from samples left at scenes of crime.
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutes cases of
serious or complex fraud, with teams of lawyers,
accountants, police officers and other specialists
conducting investigations. The Office has wide
powers that go beyond those normally available to
the police and prosecuting authorities.
The courts
About 98 per cent of criminal cases are dealt with
by magistrates. A magistrates’ court usually
comprises three representatives of the local
community who do not have professional legal
qualifications, known as lay magistrates or justices
of the peace (JPs). They sit with a court clerk who
advises them on law and procedure. In some areas
a paid professional District Judge (Magistrates’
Courts) sits alone instead of the JPs. District
Judges (Magistrates’ Courts) - who were formerly
known as stipendiary magistrates - are becoming
more common, although most cases are still dealt
with by lay magistrates.
Magistrates’ courts committees (MCCs), made up
of magistrates selected by their colleagues, are
responsible for running the magistrates’ courts
service locally. During 2000/01 the MCCs were
reorganised and their number reduced,
improving efficiency and bringing their
196
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
boundaries into closer alignment with those of
other criminal justice agencies, such as the police
and the CPS.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues in
England and Wales, in six regional areas called
circuits, and is presided over by High Court
judges, circuit judges and part-time recorders. The
type of judge dealing with a case and instructing
the jury of 12 members of the general public will
depend on which Crown Court the case is being
heard in. Not all Crown Courts handle cases of the
same level of seriousness. Judges sat for 87,688
days in the Crown Court in 2001: the bulk of this
time was spent by circuit judges (71 per cent) and
recorders (23 per cent).
A coroner (usually a senior lawyer or doctor) must
hold an inquest if a person died a violent or
unnatural death, or died suddenly while in prison
or in other specified circumstances. He or she may
also need to hold an inquest if the cause of death
remains unknown following a post-mortem
examination. The coroner’s court establishes how,
when and where the death occurred. A coroner
may sit alone or, in certain circumstances, with a
jury.
The judiciary
Judges are appointed from the ranks of practising
barristers and solicitors. They have independence
of office and can be removed only in rare and
limited circumstances involving misconduct or
incapacity. They are not subject to ministerial
control or direction. Full-time judges are generally
expected to have previously sat in a part-time
capacity (for about 15 days a year) in the same or
a similar jurisdiction. Lay magistrates (JPs) are
trained in order to give them sufficient knowledge
of the law, including the rules of evidence, and of
the nature and purpose of sentencing. They are
currently advised by legally qualified clerks of
court.
The Lord Chancellor heads the judiciary and sits as
a member of the judicial committee of the House
of Lords. He also presides over the upper House in
its law-making role and, as a senior Cabinet
minister, is in charge of the Lord Chancellor’s
Department (see page 45).
The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales is
second in rank to the Lord Chancellor in the
judicial hierarchy. He has some responsibilities for
the organisation and work of the criminal courts,

including issuing practice directions to the courts
and members of the legal professions on criminal
law and court procedures.
The Home Secretary has overall responsibility for
criminal law, the police service, the prison system,
the probation service, and for advising the Crown
on the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General are
the Government’s main legal advisers, providing
advice on a range of legal matters, including
proposed legislation. They may also represent the
Crown in difficult or publicly important domestic
and international cases.
A wide range of statutory and non-statutory
bodies advise the Government. These include the
police inspectorates, the Magistrates’ Courts
Service, the Audit Commission, the Criminal
Justice Consultative Committee, law reform bodies
such as the Law Commission and ad hoc Royal
Commissions and departmental committees. The
Youth Justice Board for England and Wales
monitors the youth justice system, promotes good
practice and advises the Home Secretary on its
operation and the setting of national standards.
Prosecution authorities
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS - see also
page 189) is headed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP), who reports to the Attorney
General.
Other prosecuting authorities include the Serious
Fraud Office (see page 196), which also answers to
the Attorney General, and bodies such as the
Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise
Commissioners, local authorities and trading
standards departments, all of which prosecute
cases in their own discrete areas of work.
Individual citizens may bring private prosecutions
197
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
for most crimes, but some need the consent of the
Attorney General and these cases may be taken
over by the DPP.
An Independent Inspectorate (HM Crown
Prosecution Service Inspectorate) reports on the
performance of the Crown Prosecution Service
and the prosecution Group of HM Customs and
Excise.
The legal profession
Although people are free to conduct their own
cases if they so wish, barristers and solicitors, or
other authorised litigators, generally represent the
interests of parties to a dispute. Barristers practise
as individuals, but join a group of other barristers
in Chambers. Solicitors usually operate in
partnership with other solicitors, but some are
self-employed. Large firms of solicitors employ
not only qualified staff, but also legal executives
and support staff.
The Bar Council is the professional body
representing barristers and the Law Society of
England and Wales represents solicitors. The
professions are self-regulating, with the
professional bodies exercising disciplinary control
over their members.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for England and
Wales oversees the way in which the relevant
professional bodies handle complaints about
barristers, solicitors and other legal practitioners.
The Probation Service
In 2001 a unified National Probation Service for
England and Wales was formed, led by a National
Director who reports directly to the Home
Secretary. The service is based in 42 areas, each of
which, outside London, has the same boundaries
as a police force and Crown Prosecution Service
area. The service supervises offenders in the
community under direct court orders and on
release on licence from custody. It also prepares
reports for the courts to assist them in deciding on
the most appropriate sentence. Certain young

strategy which will build on the existing provision of
accredited alcohol and substance misuse
programmes and provide a co-ordinated approach
to tackling the alcohol misuse and related offending
of those offenders under probation supervision.
offenders are supervised by local authority social
services departments or youth offending teams.
HM Inspectorate of Probation has both an
inspection and an advisory role, and also
monitors any work that the Probation Service
carries out in conjunction with the voluntary and
private sectors.
The Prison Service
Every prison establishment in England and Wales
has a board of visitors, comprising volunteers
drawn from the local community appointed by
the Home Secretary. Boards, which are
independent, monitor complaints by prisoners
and the concerns of staff, and report as necessary
to ministers.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report on the
treatment of prisoners and prison conditions, and
submit annual reports to Parliament. Each prison
establishment is visited about once every three
years.
Prisoners who fail to get satisfaction from the
Prison Service’s internal request and complaints
system may complain to the independent Prisons
Ombudsman.
Civil justice
Jurisdiction in civil matters in England and Wales
is administered mainly by the county courts and
the High Court, the latter handling the more
substantial and complex cases. County courts also
handle family proceedings, such as divorce,
domestic violence and matters affecting children.
Most civil disputes do not go to court at all, and
most of those which do, do not reach a trial. Many
are dealt with through statutory or voluntary
complaints mechanisms, or through mediation
and negotiation. Arbitration is common in
commercial and building disputes. Ombudsmen
have the power to determine complaints in the
public sector and, on a voluntary basis, in some
private sector activities (for example, banking,
insurance and pensions).
A large number of tribunals exist to determine
disputes. Most deal with cases that involve the
rights of private citizens against decisions of the
State in areas such as social security, income tax
and mental health. Some tribunals deal with other
disputes, such as employment. In all, there are
some 80 tribunals in England and Wales which
together deal with over 1 million cases a year.

Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
Successful actions taken in the civil courts can
result in damages being awarded to the
individual pursuing the claim. The amount
awarded in each case varies according to the
circumstances.
Courts
The High Court is divided into three Divisions:
■ The Queen’s Bench Division deals with
disputes relating to contracts, general
commercial matters (in a specialist
Commercial Court), and breaches of duty -
known as ‘liability in tort’ - covering claims
of negligence, nuisance or defamation. The
Administrative Court has special
responsibility for dealing with applications
for judicial review of the actions of public
bodies, and has the power to declare the
action of an individual, department or public
body unlawful.
■ The Chancery Division deals with disputes
relating to land, wills, companies and
insolvency.
■ The Family Division deals with matrimonial
matters, including divorce, and the welfare of
children.
There are 228 county courts handling claims in
contract and in tort (and 179 of these also deal
with family issues). The majority of claims dealt
with concern the recovery and collection of debt.
The next most common types of claims relate to
recovery of land and personal injury. Magistrates’
courts have limited civil jurisdiction: in family
matters (when they sit as a Family Proceedings
Court) and in miscellaneous civil orders.
Appeals in most civil cases were reformed by the
Access to Justice Act 1999. The general principle is
that appeal ‘lies’ to the next level of judge in the
court hierarchy. A county court appeal lies from a
district judge to a circuit judge and from a circuit
judge to a High Court judge.
In the High Court appeal lies from a master or
district judge of the High Court to a High Court
judge and from a High Court judge to the Court
of Appeal.
As in criminal cases, appeals from magistrates’
courts in civil matters go to the High Court, on
matters of law, or to the Crown Court, if the case is
to be re-heard. A further appeal on points of law of
public importance would go to the House of Lords.
Proceeding with a claim
There is currently a system of three tracks to
which disputed claims are assigned by a judge
according to the value and complexity of the case.
These are:
■ the small claims track, for cases worth less
than £5,000, at an informal hearing by a
district judge;
■ the fast track, for cases from £5,000 to £15,000,
with a fixed timetable from allocation to trial;
and
■ the multi-track, for cases worth over £15,000
or of unusual complexity, which are
supervised by a judge and given timetables
tailored to each case.
The Civil Justice Council oversees the working of
the civil justice system, and makes proposals for its
improvement.
Publicly funded legal help
The Legal Services Commission administers the
Community Legal Service (CLS), which brings
together organisations offering legal and advice
services into local networks throughout England
and Wales. These include solicitors’ firms, Citizens
Advice Bureaux (see page 476), law centres, local
authority services and other independent advice
centres. The CLS Fund provides legal help and
representation to qualifying applicants, depending
on their personal financial circumstances and the
nature of their case. It supports eligible people in
cases of divorce, mediation and other family
issues, welfare benefits, credit and debt problems,
housing and property disputes, immigration and
nationality issues, clinical negligence cases,
challenges to decisions by government
departments and other public bodies, and actions
against the police and others.
Recipients may be asked to make a contribution,
depending on their personal financial
circumstances and the outcome of the case.
During 2000/01 there were 1.1 million acts of
assistance under the CLS and the total net
expenditure was £792 million.
199
Social and cultural affairs

Scotland
The Scottish Executive Justice Department, under
the Minister for Justice, is responsible for civil and
criminal law and justice, social work services,
police, prisons, courts administration, legal aid,
and liaison with the legal profession in Scotland.
The Department also has responsibility for all
matters of the law of Scotland and its operation as
it relates to international law and relations with
other legal systems, including those of other parts
of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Court
Service, an executive agency of the Scottish
Executive Justice Department, deals with the work
of the Supreme Courts and the sheriff courts.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for
Scotland provide the Scottish Executive with
advice on legal matters and represent its interests
in the courts. Since devolution, the Advocate
General for Scotland has provided advice on Scots
law to the UK Government.
The role of the Scottish Parliament is to make laws
on matters devolved to it (see chapter 4). In these
areas, it is able to amend or repeal existing Acts of
the UK Parliament and to pass new legislation for
Scotland of its own. It can also consider and pass
private legislation, promoted by individuals or
bodies (for example, local authorities).
Policing
The police in Scotland can arrest someone
without a warrant, under wide common law
powers, if suspects are seen or reported as
committing a crime or are a danger to themselves
or others. They also have specific statutory powers
of arrest for some offences. In other cases they
may apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant.
The police may search anyone suspected of
carrying an offensive weapon. Someone suspected
of an imprisonable offence may be held for police
questioning without being arrested, but for no
more than six hours without being charged. If
arrested, suspects must be charged and cautioned.
The case is then referred to the procurator fiscal.
HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland
considers representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have handled
their complaints. A consultation paper with
proposals for strengthening the independence of
the police complaints system in Scotland was
published in July 2001.
Distinguishing features of the Scottish legal
system
■ The Scottish Parliament has legislative
competence over most aspects of the law and
the legal system in civil and criminal matters,
including the prosecution system, the courts
administration and certain judicial appointments.
■ The Lord Advocate is responsible for the
investigation of crime through the Crown Office,
and for prosecutions in the High Court, sheriff
court and district court.
■ Unlike in England, there is no general right of
prosecution in Scotland. The prosecution is
undertaken by the Lord Advocate in the interests
of the public as a whole, and not on behalf of
the police or individual citizens.
■ The police report details of alleged crimes to the
procurator fiscal, who has discretion whether or
not to prosecute. Procurators fiscal are also
responsible for the investigation of all sudden
and suspicious deaths, as there are no coroners
in Scotland.
■ Scottish juries contain 15 people and reach a
verdict by simple majority.
The Scottish Crime Squad performs the same role
as the National Crime Squad in England and
Wales (see page 196). Forensic services are
provided by four regional laboratories, the largest
of which is based in Dundee. Police authorities in
Scotland are composed of elected councillors.
Criminal justice
Prisons
The Scottish Prison Service is an executive agency.
There are currently 17 prison establishments, and
an average prison population of around 6,100.
Prison accommodation, and the rights and
privileges afforded to prisoners in Scotland, are
broadly comparable with England and Wales (see
page 194).
Prisoners who exhaust the internal grievance
procedure may apply to the independent Scottish
Prisons Complaints Commissioner.
There are statutory arrangements governing the
early release of prisoners. As in England and
200
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
Wales, offenders serving terms of less than four
years may be automatically released at specific
points in their sentences. Those detained for
longer require Parole Board approval. In Scotland,
ministers are statutorily obliged to give effect to
the Parole Board’s directions.
Legal aid
The Scottish Legal Aid Board manages legal aid in
Scotland. Its main tasks are to grant or refuse
applications for legal aid; to pay solicitors or
advocates for the legal work that they do; and to
advise Scottish ministers on legal aid matters.
Where legal aid is granted to the accused in
criminal proceedings, he or she is not required to
pay any contribution towards expenses.
Scottish law
The legal principles, rules and concepts of Scots
law can be traced from diverse sources, including
Roman law, canon law and the influences of other
European systems. The main sources are judge-
made law, certain legal treatises having
‘institutional’ authority, legislation and EC law.
The first two sources are sometimes referred to as
the common law of Scotland. Legislation, as in the
rest of the UK, consists of statutes (Acts of the UK
or Scottish Parliament) or subordinate legislation
authorised by the Scottish or UK Parliament.
Advocates (broadly speaking the Scottish
equivalent of barristers) have audience in the
Supreme Courts. Solicitor-Advocates who are
accredited specifically for civil or criminal
business also have audience in the Supreme
Courts. Solicitors in Scotland (numbering 8,700 in
October 2001) have audience in the sheriff and
district courts and in the other courts and
tribunals. They practise largely in partnerships
throughout the country.
The professional body for advocates is the Faculty
of Advocates. For solicitors the regulator is the
Law Society of Scotland. The Scottish Legal
Services Ombudsman oversees the way in which
these bodies handle complaints.
Prosecution
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service
provides Scotland’s independent public
prosecution and deaths investigation service. The
Department is headed by the Lord Advocate,
assisted by the Solicitor General for Scotland (who
are the Scottish Law Officers and members of the
Scottish Executive). The Crown Agent, a senior
civil servant, is responsible for the running of the
Department.
Procurators fiscal and Crown Office officials
prepare prosecutions in the High Court which are
conducted by the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland; they in turn delegate the
bulk of their work to advocates depute, collectively
known as Crown Counsel, of whom there are 18.
The police report gives details of alleged crimes to
the local procurator fiscal who has discretion
whether or not to prosecute. He or she may
receive instructions from the Crown Counsel on
behalf of the Lord Advocate.
The office of coroner does not exist in Scotland.
Instead the local procurator fiscal inquires into
sudden or suspicious deaths. When appropriate, a
fatal accident inquiry may be held before the
sheriff; this is mandatory in cases of death
resulting from industrial accidents and deaths in
custody. The inquiry has two purposes: to
establish the causes of death; and to make
recommendations as to how in future the causes
and circumstances which led to individual deaths
could be avoided.
Criminal courts
There are three criminal courts in Scotland: the
High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court and the
district court. Cases are heard under one of two
types of criminal procedure:
In solemn procedure in both the High Court of
Justiciary and the sheriff court, an accused
person’s trial takes place before a judge sitting
with a jury of 15 people selected at random from
the general public. The judge decides questions of
law and the jury decides questions of fact and may
reach a decision by a simple majority. They may
decide to find the accused ‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or
‘not proven’; the last two are acquittals and have
the effect that the accused cannot be tried again
for the same offence.
In summary procedure in sheriff and district
courts, the judge sits without a jury and decides
questions of both fact and law.
Pre-trial hearings (called ‘diets’) in summary and
solemn cases are intended to establish the state of
readiness of both the defence and the prosecution.

14 Crime and justice
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme
criminal court in Scotland, sitting in Edinburgh,
Glasgow and on circuit in other towns. It tries the
most serious crimes and has exclusive jurisdiction
in cases involving murder, treason and rape.
The 49 sheriff courts deal mainly with less serious
offences committed within their area of
jurisdiction. These courts are organised in six
sheriffdoms; at the head of each is a sheriff
principal. There are over 100 permanent sheriffs,
most of whom are appointed to particular courts.
The sheriff has jurisdiction in both summary and
solemn criminal cases. Under summary procedure,
the sheriff may impose prison sentences of up to
three months (although more in some cases) or a
fine of £5,000. Under solemn procedure, the sheriff
may impose imprisonment for up to three years
and unlimited financial penalties.
District courts, which deal with minor offences, are
the administrative responsibility of the local
authority. The longest prison sentence which can
be imposed is generally 60 days and the maximum
fine is £2,500. The bench of a district court will
usually be made up of one or more Justices of the
Peace. A local authority may also appoint a
stipendiary magistrate, who must be a
professional lawyer of at least five years’ standing,
and who has the same summary criminal
jurisdiction and powers as a sheriff. At present,
only Glasgow has stipendiary magistrates sitting in
the district court. A government review of the
operation of the district courts was announced in
May 2000.
A total of 136,800 persons were proceeded against
in Scottish criminal courts in 2000; 4 per cent
were dealt with under solemn procedure, 60 per
cent in sheriff summary courts and 37 per cent in
district courts.
Sentencing
In Scotland a court must obtain a social enquiry
report before imposing a custodial sentence if the
accused is aged under 21 or has not previously
served a custodial sentence. A report is also
required before making a probation or
community service order, or in cases involving
people already subject to supervision.
Non-custodial sentences available to the courts
include fines, probation orders, community
service orders, restriction of liberty orders
(monitored by electronic tagging) and supervised
attendance orders (which provide an alternative to
imprisonment for non-payment of fines, and
incorporate aspects of work and training). In 2000
approximately 10 per cent of those sentenced by
Scottish courts received either a probation or
community service order, and 13 per cent received
a custodial sentence.
Children
Criminal proceedings may be brought against any
child aged eight or over, but the instructions of
the Lord Advocate are necessary before anyone
under 16 years of age is prosecuted. Most children
under 16 who have committed an offence or are
considered to be in need of care and protection
may be brought before a Children’s Hearing. The
hearing, consisting of three people who are not
lawyers, determines whether compulsory measures
of care are required and, if so, the form they
should take. In 2000/01, a total of 2,100 children
aged under 16 were referred to a Children’s
Hearing on offence grounds. Young people aged
between 16 and 21 generally serve custodial
sentences in young offender institutions.
Probation
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation,
community service and other community
disposals - equivalent to community sentences -
and ex-prisoners subject to statutory supervision
on release from custody.
Appeals
The High Court of Justiciary sits as the Scottish
Court of Criminal Appeal. In both solemn and
summary procedure, a convicted person may
appeal against conviction, or sentence, or both.
The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside a
conviction. There is no appeal from this court in
criminal cases. The Scottish Criminal Cases
Review Commission is responsible for considering
alleged miscarriages of justice and referring cases
meeting the relevant criteria to the Court of
Appeal for review. Just over 3,100 appeals against
conviction or sentence were concluded in 2000,
equivalent to 3 per cent of the total number of
convictions in that year. Of these appeals, 2 per
cent resulted in a conviction being quashed and
11 per cent in a reduction of sentence.
Civil justice
The bulk of the civil business in Scotland is
conducted in the sheriff court which has general
jurisdiction and sits throughout the country.
202
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh, and may
hear cases from the outset or on transfer from
sheriff courts and tribunals on appeal. A leading
principle of the court is that cases starting there
are both prepared for decision, and decided, by
judges sitting alone whose decisions are subject to
review by several judges.
In addition to its criminal jurisdiction, the sheriff
court deals with most civil law cases in Scotland.
There is, with very few exceptions, no upper limit
to the financial level with which the court can
deal, and a broad range of remedies can be
granted. Cases may include debts, contracts,
reparation, rent restrictions, actions affecting the
use of property, leases and tenancies, child
protection issues and family actions. There is a
right of appeal in some cases from the sheriff to
the sheriff principal and then, in some cases, to
the Court of Session.
The House of Lords hears relatively few appeals in
civil matters from Scotland but, since devolution,
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
(JCPC) has had jurisdiction to consider disputes
involving devolution issues. When dealing with
Scottish cases, the JCPC usually includes at least
two Scottish judges and can sit in London or
elsewhere as appropriate.
Civil proceedings
The formal proceedings in the Court of Session
are started by serving the defender with a
summons or, in sheriff court cases in ordinary
actions, an initial writ. A defender who intends to
contest the action must inform the court; if he or
she fails to do so, the court normally grants a
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer. Where
a case is contested, both parties must prepare
written pleadings, after which a hearing will
normally be arranged.
In summary cause actions involving sums between
£750 and £1,5004 in the sheriff court, a summons
incorporates a statement of claim. The procedure
is designed to let most actions be settled without
the parties having to appear in court. Normally,
they, or their representatives, need appear only
when an action is defended.
Where actions are raised for sums up to £750
there is a special procedure for small claims which
allows those who do not have legal advice to raise
4 These levels are currently under review.
the claims themselves in the sheriff court. These
are broadly restricted to payment actions. The
procedure is intended to be simple and to allow
for negotiated settlement at the earliest possible
time - new rules on summary cause and small
claims came into effect in June 2002.
The Scottish Land Court deals with agricultural
matters and some environmental issues. The Lands
Tribunal for Scotland deals with matters relating to
land conditions, right to buy and valuation issues.
The Children’s Hearing deals with children in need
of measures of supervision or care. Other tribunals
common to the rest of the United Kingdom deal
with unemployment, social security, and asylum
and immigration matters.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s legal system is similar to that of
England and Wales. Jury trials have the same place
in the system, except in the case of offences
involving acts of terrorism. In addition, cases go
through the same stages in the courts and the legal
profession has the same two branches.
People accused of offences specified under
emergency legislation (see page 16) are tried in
the Crown Court without a jury. The prosecution
must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and the
defendant has the right to be represented by a
lawyer of his or her choice. The judge has to set
out in a written statement the reasons for
conviction and there is an automatic right of
appeal to the Court of Appeal against conviction
and/or sentence on points of fact as well as of
law.
The probation service in Northern Ireland is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
The Northern Ireland Prison Service is an
executive agency. There are currently three prison
establishments, and an average population (based
on monthly counts) in 2001 of 910. Prison
accommodation, and the rights and privileges
afforded to prisoners in Northern Ireland, are
broadly comparable with England and Wales (see
page 194).
Every prison has a board of visitors comprising
volunteers from the local community appointed
203
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland.
In Northern Ireland, voluntary drug testing in
prisons has already been implemented and
evaluation of a system of laboratory testing of
drug samples will provide the basis for the
introduction of mandatory drug testing.
Policing
In November 2001 the Royal Ulster Constabulary
became the Police Service of Northern Ireland
(PSNI), as part of a series of reforms to the police
following the report of the Patten Commission set
up under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement peace accord (see chapter 3). The
Chief Constable is accountable to a new Policing
Board, made up of ten political nominees and
nine independent members appointed by the
Secretary of State.
Unlike the rest of Great Britain, police officers in
Northern Ireland are issued with firearms for their
personal protection. Complaints against the police
are investigated by an independent Police
Ombudsman.
Administration of the law
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for court
administration, while the Northern Ireland
Office, under the Secretary of State, deals with
policy and legislation concerning criminal law, the
police and the penal system. The Lord Chancellor
has general responsibility for legal aid, advice and
assistance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern
Ireland, who is responsible to the Attorney
General, prosecutes all offences tried on
indictment, and may do so in other (summary)
cases. Most summary offences are prosecuted by
the police.
Civil legal aid is administered by the Law Society
for Northern Ireland. Where legal aid is granted
for criminal cases it is free.
Superior courts
The Supreme Court of Judicature comprises the
Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Crown
Court. All matters relating to these courts are
under the jurisdiction of the UK Parliament.
Judges are appointed by the Crown.
The Court of Appeal consists of the Lord Chief
Justice (as President) and two Lords Justices of
Appeal. The High Court is made up of the Lord
Chief Justice and five other judges. The practice
and procedure of the Court of Appeal and the
High Court are virtually the same as in the
corresponding courts in England and Wales.
Both courts sit in the Royal Courts of Justice in
Belfast.
The Court of Appeal has power to review the
civil law decisions of the High Court and the
criminal law decisions of the Crown Court, and
may in certain cases review the decisions of
county courts and magistrates’ courts. Subject to
certain restrictions, an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal can go to the House of
Lords. The Criminal Cases Review Commission,
which is independent of both government and
the courts, reviews alleged miscarriages of
justice.
The High Court is divided into a Queen’s Bench
Division, dealing with most civil law matters; a
Chancery Division, dealing with, for instance,
trusts and estates, title to land, mortgages and
charges, wills and company matters; and a Family
Division, dealing principally with such matters as
matrimonial cases, adoption, children in care and
undisputed wills.
The Crown Court deals with all serious criminal
cases.
Inferior courts
The inferior courts are the county courts and the
magistrates’ courts, both of which differ in a
number of ways from their counterparts in
England and Wales.
County courts are primarily civil law courts. They
are presided over by one of 14 county court
judges, two of whom - in Belfast and
Londonderry/Derry - have the title of recorder.
Appeals go from the county courts to the High
Court. The county courts also handle appeals
from the magistrates’ courts in both criminal and
civil matters. In civil matters, the county courts
decide most actions in which the amount or the
value of specific articles claimed is below a certain
level. The courts also deal with actions involving
title to, or the recovery of, land; equity matters
such as trusts and estates; mortgages; and the sale
of land and partnerships.
204
Social and cultural affairs
14 Crime and justice
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with
minor local criminal cases is carried out in
magistrates’ courts presided over by a full-time,
legally qualified resident magistrate (RM). The
magistrates’ courts also exercise jurisdiction in
certain family law cases and have a very limited
jurisdiction in other civil cases.

The United Kingdom is a multifaith society in
which everyone has the right to religious freedom.
Religious organisations and groups may conduct
their rites and ceremonies, promote their beliefs
within the limits of the law, own property, and run
schools and a range of other charitable activities.
Although religious faith in the UK is
predominantly Christian, most of the world’s
religions are practised. There are large Hindu,
Jewish, Muslim and Sikh communities, and also
smaller communities of Baha’i, Buddhists, Jains,
and Zoroastrians, as well as followers of new
religious movements. On the other hand, many
people do not practise any religion and some
reject all forms of religious belief. Organisations
such as the British Humanist Association and the
National Secular Society represent some of the
latter views.
Religious traditions in the UK
A distinction is often drawn between ‘community
size’ and ‘active membership’: the former
represents identification with a religion, or a
religious ethic, in the broadest sense, and the latter
a much closer association. There are an estimated
7.9 million active adult members of religious
groups in the UK. Many other people take part in
formal religious ceremonies at times of crisis or to
mark significant life events such as birth, marriage
and death. The 2001 Census of Population
included, for the first time throughout the UK
since 1851, a question on religion.1 When the
answers to this question have been analysed, they

Church and state
Christianity has been the most influential religion in
the UK, and it remains the declared faith of the
majority of the population. Two Churches have a
special status with regard to the State. In England,
since the rejection by Henry VIII of the supremacy of
the Pope in 1534, the Anglican Church of England
has been legally recognised as the official, or
'established', Church. The Monarch is the 'Supreme
Governor' of the Church of England and must
always be a member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. A similar position was occupied by the
Presbyterian Church of Scotland until the early 20th
century. This continues to be recognised as the
national Church in Scotland, but the Monarch holds
no constitutional role in its government, although
she is represented at the General Assembly (see
page 210) in the office of the Lord High
Commissioner. Neither of the established Churches
are funded by the State. There are no established
Churches in Wales or Northern Ireland. In Wales, the
Anglican Church is known as the Church in Wales.

patterns of religious identity in the United
Kingdom. In the meantime, Table 15.1 gives some
indication of religious identity in Great Britain.
It suggests that just over half of the population
(54 per cent) regard themselves as Christian and
41 per cent regard themselves as belonging to no
religion.
The Christian community
The Christian community in the UK consists of
many denominations. Of these, the Anglican and
Catholic Churches have the largest congregations.
Other denominations include Presbyterians,
Methodists and Baptists.
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
Communion of Anglican churches, 38 in all. The
four Anglican churches in the UK are the Church
of England, the Church in Wales, the Scottish
Episcopal Church, and the Church of Ireland
(Northern Ireland). The Church of England has
an average weekly church attendance of
1.3 million.
The Catholic Church has an average estimated
weekly Mass attendance of over 1 million in
England and Wales, around 200,000 in Scotland
and 400,000 in Northern Ireland.
The Presbyterian Church of Scotland has an adult
communicant membership in the UK of over
610,000.
The rise of the Puritan movement in the 16th and
17th centuries led to a proliferation of
nonconformist2 churches. The term ‘Free
Churches’ is often used to describe these
Protestant churches in the UK which, unlike the
Church of England and the Church of Scotland,
are not ‘established’ Churches. The major Free
Churches include Methodist, Baptist, United
Reformed, Salvation Army and a variety of
Pentecostal churches.
The British Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, originated in the 18th century
following the evangelical revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). It has 327,000 adult full
members. The present Church is based on the
1932 union of most of the separate Methodist
Churches.
2 One who does not conform to the doctrine or discipline of an
established Church.
The Baptists first achieved an organised form in
the UK in the 17th century. Today they are mainly
organised in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great
Britain (re-formed in 1812) with about 139,000
members. There are also separate Baptist Unions
for Scotland, Wales and Ireland, and other
independent Baptist Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is the
United Reformed Church, with some 92,000
members. It was formed in 1972 from the union
of the Congregational Church in England and
Wales with the Presbyterian Church in England.
In 1982 and 2000 there were further unions with
the Reformed Churches of Christ and the
Congregational Union of Scotland.
Among the other Free Churches are the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, which has around
300,000 members in Northern Ireland; the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of
Wales, with 42,000 members and the largest of the
Free Churches in Wales; the Union of Welsh
Independents, with 35,000 members; and a
number of independent Scottish Presbyterian
churches which are particularly active in the
Highlands and Islands.
The Salvation Army was founded in the East End
of London in 1865 by William Booth (1829-1912)
and has a membership of nearly 51,000. It runs
over 800 local church and community centres, and
has a strong musical tradition.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with
about 16,000 adult members, was founded in the
middle of the 17th century under the leadership
of George Fox. Other Unitarians and Free
Christians, whose origins go back to the
Reformation, belong to a similar tradition. There
are two branches of the Christian Brethren,
founded in the 19th century: the Open Brethren
and the Closed or Exclusive Brethren.
The rich tradition of people of different cultures
coming to settle in the United Kingdom since the
Middle Ages has also contributed to the diversity of
Christian denominations. Christian communities
founded by migrants include those of the
Orthodox, Lutheran and Reformed Churches of
various European countries, the Coptic Orthodox
Church, Armenian Church and a number of
Churches originating in Africa, such as the
Cherubim and Seraphim Churches. These tend to
207
Social and cultural affairs
15 Religion
be concentrated in the larger cities, particularly
London, and use a variety of languages. The largest
is the Greek Orthodox Church, many of whose
members are of Cypriot origin.
Other developments within the Christian
tradition have included the rise of Pentecostalism
and the charismatic1 movement. A number of
Pentecostal bodies were formed in the UK at the
turn of the 20th century. The two main
Pentecostal organisations in the UK today are the
Assemblies of God, and the Elim Pentecostal
Church. Since the Second World War immigration
from the Caribbean has led to a significant
number of Black Majority Pentecostal churches,
and these are a growing presence in British (and
especially English) church life. The Christian
‘house church’ movement (or ‘new churches’)
began in the 1970s when some of the charismatics
began to establish their own congregations.
Inter-Church co-operation
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland is the
main co-ordinating body for the Christian
Churches in the UK. It co-ordinates the work of
its 33 member organisations, in the areas of social
responsibility, international affairs, church life,
world mission, racial justice, care of international
students and inter-faith relations. Its international
aid agencies - Christian Aid, CAFOD and
SCIAF3 4 - are major charities. Member Churches
are also grouped in separate ecumenical bodies,
according to country: Churches Together in
England, Action of Churches Together in
Scotland, Churches Together in Wales (Cytun),
and the Irish Council of Churches.
The Free Churches Group, with 18 member
denominations, was incorporated into Churches
Together in England in 2001. It promotes
co-operation among the Free Churches, especially
in hospital chaplaincy and in education matters.
The Evangelical Alliance, with a membership of
individuals, churches or societies drawn from 20
denominations, represents over 1.3 million
evangelical Christians.
Inter-Church discussions about the search for
Christian unity take place internationally, as well

as within the UK, and the main participants are
the Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist,
Orthodox, Reformed and Catholic Churches. The
Church of England and the Methodist Church
published a report in December 2001 on moves
that could lead to greater unity between the two
Churches. In Scotland, several Churches, including
the Church of Scotland, have been pursuing unity
through the Scottish Churches’ Initiative for
Union. Among them is the United Reformed
Church, itself the outcome of previous unions. In
Wales, recent moves towards a United Free Church
have made some progress towards establishing -
in one small area - an ecumenical bishop.
Other faith communities
The United Kingdom is home to adherents of
many world religions. Immigrants and their
descendants are among those who continue to add
to this diversity.
The Buddhist community has around 52,000
active members in the UK, including people of
British, South Asian and South East Asian
background. Various strands of Buddhism from
the Mahayana and Theravada traditions are
represented.
The Hindu community in the UK originates
largely from India. Most British Hindus are of
Gujarati or Punjabi origin with smaller numbers
from Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and the southern
states of India and Sri Lanka. Others have come
from countries to which earlier generations of
Indians had previously migrated such as Kenya,
Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The size
of the Hindu community is thought to be around
500,000, although some representatives suggest a
considerably higher figure (of close to 1 million).
Jews first settled in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest. They were banished by royal
decree in 1290, but readmitted following the
English Civil War (1642-51). Sephardic Jews, who
originally came from Spain and Portugal, have been
present in the UK since the mid-17th century. The
majority of the 283,000 Jews in the UK today, while
British born, are Ashkenazi Jews, of Central and
East European origin, who emigrated or fled
persecution in the Russian Empire between 1881
and 1914, or Nazi persecution in Germany and
other European countries from 1933 onwards.
A Muslim community has existed in the UK since
the 16th century. By the early 19th century
208
Social and cultural affairs
15 Religion
Muslim seamen, mainly from Yemen and the
Indian subcontinent, had established settlements
in several parts of the country, including Cardiff,
South Shields and the London Docklands. There
was further settlement after the First World War,
and again in the 1950s and 1960s as people arrived
to meet the shortage of labour following the
Second World War. The 1970s saw the arrival of
significant numbers of Muslims of Asian origin
from Kenya and Uganda. There are well-
established Turkish Cypriot and Iranian Muslim
communities, and more recently Muslims from
Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo have sought
refuge in the UK. In addition, there are smaller
numbers of English, West Indian and Chinese
Muslims. In total, there are thought to be around
1.5 million people who identify themselves as
Muslims, the majority of whom are now British-
born. Sunni and Shi’a are the two principal
traditions within Islam and while both are
represented among the Muslim community in the
UK, most belong to the Sunni tradition. Sufism,
the spiritual aspect of Islam, can be found in both
traditions, and members of some of the major
Sufi traditions have also developed branches in
British cities.
Most of the Sikh community in the UK are of
Punjabi origin. A minority came from East Africa
and other former British colonies to which
members of their family had migrated, but the
majority came to the UK directly from the Punjab.
There are between 400,000 and 500,000 Sikhs in
the UK, making it the largest Sikh community
outside the Indian subcontinent.
Jainism is an ancient religion brought to the UK
mainly by immigrants from the Gujarat and
Rajasthan areas of India. The Zoroastrian religion
is mainly represented in the UK by the Parsi
community from India. The founders of the UK
community originally settled here in the 19th
century. The Baha’i movement originated in
Persia in the 19th century. Rastafarianism, with its
roots in the return-to-Africa movement, emerged
in the West Indies early in the 20th century. It
arrived in the UK with immigration from Jamaica
in the 1950s.
Other religious groups in the UK were originally
founded in the United States in the 19th century,
including a number deriving from the Christian
tradition. Examples are the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church), the
Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Christadelphians, the
Christian Scientists, and the Seventh-day
Adventists.
A number of newer religious movements,
established since the Second World War and often
with overseas origins, are now active in the UK.
Examples include the Church of Scientology, the
Transcendental Meditation movement, the
Unification Church and various New Age groups.
INFORM (Information Network Focus on
Religious Movements) carries out research and
seeks to provide information about new religious
movements.
Organisation
The Church of England is divided into two
geographical provinces, each headed by an
archbishop: Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses,
including the Diocese in Europe; and York, with
14 dioceses. The dioceses are divided into
archdeaconries and deaneries, which are in turn
divided into about 13,000 parishes, although in
practice many parishes are grouped together.
Church of England archbishops, bishops and the
deans of some cathedrals are appointed by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. The
Crown Appointments Commission, which
includes lay and clergy representatives, plays a key
role in the selection of archbishops and diocesan
bishops. The Archbishops’ Council is the centre of
an administrative system dealing with inter-
Church relations, inter-faith relations, social
questions, recruitment and training for the
ministry, and missionary work.
The Anglican Archbishops of Canterbury and
York, the Bishops of Durham, London and
Dr George Carey will retire as Archbishop of
Canterbury on 31 October 2002 after holding office
for 11 'A years. The Most Revd Rowan Williams,
Archbishop of Wales and Bishop of Monmouth, has
been nominated as his successor. The main roles of
the Archbishop of Canterbury include Diocesan
Bishop of Canterbury (Dr Williams will be the
104th), Primate of All England and leader of the
Anglican Communion. The Archbishop of Canterbury
takes the lead in respect of Anglican relationships
with other Christian churches in the UK and abroad,
and he also leads in respect of Anglican
relationships with other faiths.

Winchester, and the 21 senior diocesan bishops
from other dioceses of the Church of England
have seats in the House of Lords (see page 34).
With assets of approximately £4 billion, the
Church Commissioners are responsible for the
management of a large part of the Church of
England’s invested assets. The Crown appoints a
Member of Parliament from the governing party
to the unpaid post of Second Church Estates
Commissioner, to represent the Commissioners in
Parliament. The Church Commissioners currently
meet some 20 per cent of the Church of England’s
total running costs, providing support for parish
ministry and the pensions of the clergy. Parishes
and dioceses meet the remainder of the Church of
England’s running costs.
The Church of Scotland has a Presbyterian form of
government - that is, government by church courts
or councils, composed of ministers, elders, and
deacons. The 1,550 congregations are governed
locally by courts known as Kirk Sessions. The
courts above these are the ‘Presbyteries’, responsible
for a geographical area made up of a number of
parishes. The General Assembly, or Supreme Court,
meets annually under the chairmanship of an
elected moderator, who serves for one year.
There are eight provinces of the Catholic Church
in the UK - four in England, two in Scotland, one
in Wales and one which includes Northern
Ireland. There is a Bishops’ Conference of England
and Wales, and a Bishops’ Conference of Scotland.
The Irish Episcopal Conference includes the whole
of Ireland. The Bishops’ Conference is a
permanent institution of the Catholic Church
whereby the bishops of a country exercise together
pastoral, legislative and teaching offices as defined
by the law of the Church.
There are 22 territorial Catholic dioceses in
England and Wales and eight in Scotland.
Northern Ireland is covered by seven dioceses,
some of which have territory in the Irish Republic.
Each diocesan bishop is appointed by the Pope
and governs according to Canon Law and through
reference to a Council of Priests, College of
Consultors and a Pastoral Council.
The Network of Buddhist Organisations links
various Buddhist educational, cultural, charitable
and teaching organisations. The Buddhist Society
promotes the principles, but does not adhere to
any particular school of Buddhism.
The main administrative bodies for Hindus are
the National Council of Hindu Temples (UK) and
the Hindu Council UK. Other national bodies
serving the Hindu community include Vishwa
Hindu Parishad (UK).
The Board of Deputies of British Jews is the
officially recognised representative body for the
Jewish community. Founded in 1760, it is elected
mainly by synagogues, but a growing number of
community organisations are also represented. The
Board serves as the voice of the community to both
government and the wider non-Jewish community.
Of the total number of synagogue-affiliated
households, most Ashkenazi Jews (60 per cent)
acknowledge the authority of the Chief Rabbi.
The Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, the
Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues and
the Assembly of Masorti Synagogues together
account for most of the remaining synagogue-
affiliated community membership.
The Muslim Council of Britain, founded in 1997,
represents over 350 established national and
regional Muslim bodies as well as local mosques,
professional associations and other organisations.
The Council aims to promote co-operation,
consensus and unity on Muslim affairs in the UK.
A number of other representative bodies, such as
the Union of Muslim Organisations, aim to
develop the social, cultural and economic aspects
of Muslim life in the UK. The British Muslim
community also has a number of associations of
religious scholars - ulema - and shariah councils
that provide religious legal rulings on matters
such as matrimonial disputes.
The Network of Sikh Organisations (NSO) was
formed in 1995 to facilitate co-operation between
British Sikhs. It provides a forum for organising the
celebration of major events in the Sikh calendar,
and works with government departments and a
number of national organisations to represent Sikh
interests at a national level.
Places of worship
There are 16,000 Anglican churches (the earliest
dating from the seventh century) and 42 Anglican
cathedrals, which serve as focal points of the
dioceses. They have a rich history and significance
in British architecture. Examples include Salisbury
Cathedral, which has the tallest spire in England at
123 metres.

Social and cultural affairs
15 Religion
The Church of Scotland and the Church in Wales
both have over 1,500 churches. There are also
a large number of churches belonging to other
Christian denominations.
Since 1969 over 1,500 churches in England have
become redundant and from their disposal,
around £31.3 million has been raised. Redundant
churches are increasingly being used for
residential property or as civic, cultural and
community centres. The Churches Conservation
Trust, funded jointly by the Government and the
Church of England, preserves Anglican churches
of particular cultural and historical importance
that are no longer used as regular places of
worship. At present over 325 churches are
maintained in this way. Many outstanding
buildings from other denominations and faiths
are cared for by the Historic Chapels Trust. The
Friends of Friendless Churches is a voluntary
organisation also caring for a number of
redundant Anglican churches and for chapels and
churches in Wales.
In the UK there are numerous Buddhist centres at
which meditation or worship take place, although
it is not considered essential to go to a temple and
worship can take place at home.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was opened in
London in the 1950s and there are now over 160
in the UK; many are affiliated to the National
Council of Hindu Temples (UK). The
Swaminarayan Hindu Temple in north London is
the largest and was the first purpose-built Hindu
temple in Europe.
Jewish synagogues in the UK number slightly
fewer than 300, but there are additional
congregations that do not have their own
synagogue.
There are over 1,000 mosques and numerous
community Muslim centres throughout the UK.
Mosques are not only places of worship; they also
offer instruction in the Muslim way of life, and
facilities for education and welfare. They range
from converted buildings in many towns and
suburbs to the Central Mosque in Regent’s Park,
London, with its associated Islamic Cultural
Centre. The main conurbations in the Midlands,
North West and North East of England, and
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have
their own central mosques with a range of
community facilities.
Continuity and change
Walking tours of the East End of London often
pause outside a building on the corner of Fournier
Street and Brick Lane. It was originally built in 1742
as a chapel for the Protestant Huguenots who had
settled in the area after escaping persecution in
France. By 1809 many of the Huguenots had moved
on and it became a Methodist chapel. In 1897 it
was bought by the Machzikei Hadath society and
became the Spitalfields Great Synagogue. The
Jewish population in this part of the East End was
eventually replaced by Bengalis and in 1975 the
building became the London Jamme Masjid
(Mosque).
There are over 200 gurdwaras or Sikh temples in
the UK, the vast majority being in England and
Wales. The largest is in Southall, Middlesex.
Gurdwaras cater for the religious, educational,
welfare and cultural needs of their community.
A granthi is usually employed to take care of the
building and to conduct prayers.
In April 2001 the Government announced a new
grant for repairs to listed buildings used as places
of worship. While not a tax rebate, it will have the
same effect as if the level of VAT (value added tax)
for repairs had been reduced from 17.5 per cent to
5 per cent.
Religion and society
The influence of Christianity and other religions in
the UK has always extended far beyond the
comparatively narrow spheres of organised and
private worship. Churches, cathedrals and other
places of worship make a significant contribution
to the architectural landscape of the nation.
Religious organisations are actively involved in
voluntary work and the provision of social
services - many schools and hospitals, for example,
were founded by men and women who were
strongly influenced by Christianity. Easter and
Christmas, the two most important events in the
Christian calendar, are the year’s major public
holidays. Festivals and other events observed by
other religions - such as Diwali and Holi (Hindu),
the High Holy Days and Passover (Jewish),
Ramadan and Eid (Muslim) and Vaisakhi (Sikh) -
are adding to the visible diversity of life in the UK
today.

Social and cultural affairs
15 Religion
In 2002, the Golden Jubilee celebrations marking
50 years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II included
a number of faith-linked events and visits. The
programme of royal engagements included visits to
a centre or place of worship of each of the main
faiths in the UK.
Ceremonies marking life events
Although there are secular alternatives, religious
traditions play a major role in commemorating
births, marriages, deaths and other important life
events.
In 2000 just under 40 per cent of marriages in the
UK were solemnised with a religious ceremony,
compared with 60 per cent in 1971. Between 1971
and 2000 the number of marriages with civil
ceremonies has remained fairly steady while the
number of marriages with religious ceremonies
has declined (see Figure 15.2).
In England and Wales, 36 per cent of all marriages
in 2000 involved a religious ceremony, including
over 65,000 marriages solemnised in the Church
of England or Church in Wales, over 11,000
Catholic weddings, 13,000 nonconformist
weddings and around 2,500 non-Christian
religious marriage ceremonies. In Scotland 60 per
cent, and in Northern Ireland 75 per cent, of all
marriages included a religious ceremony in 2000.

Religious education
In England and Wales all state schools must provide
religious education, each local education authority
being responsible for producing a locally agreed
syllabus. Syllabuses must reflect Christianity, while
taking account of the teachings and practices of the
other principal religions represented in the UK.
State schools must provide a daily act of collective
worship. Parents may withdraw their children from
religious education and/or collective worship.
In 2000 England had 4,738 state-supported
Anglican Church schools and 2,079 Catholic. In
addition, there is a well-established tradition of
Methodist and Jewish schools, with 28 and 33
state schools provided by each respectively.
Recently the Government has helped set up, and
given support to, a number of schools reflecting
other religious traditions - for example, one Greek
Orthodox, one Seventh-day Adventist, four
Muslim and two Sikh schools. All the Churches
and faith groups involved with the provision of
these schools have organisations at national or
regional level to provide support and help when
opportunities arise to promote new schools.
In Scotland, education authorities must ensure
that schools provide religious education and
regular opportunities for religious observance.
The law does not specify the form of religious
education, but it is recommended that pupils
should be provided with a broad-based
curriculum, through which they can develop
a knowledge and understanding of Christianity
and other world religions, and develop their own
beliefs, attitudes and moral values and practices.
In Northern Ireland a core syllabus for religious
education has been approved by the main Churches
and this must be taught in all state schools.
Integrated education is encouraged and all schools
must be open to pupils of all religions, although in
practice most Catholic pupils attend Catholic
maintained or Catholic voluntary grammar
schools, and most Protestant children are enrolled
at controlled schools or non-denominational
voluntary grammar schools. However, the number
of inter-denominational schools is increasing and
in 2001/02, 14,980 primary and secondary pupils
received their education at ‘integrated’ schools not
attached to any particular religion.
Welfare
Charitable concern is a feature of many religions.
Around 3,000 charities have a Christian

connection, such as Christian Aid or CAFOD, but
there are also many charities involving other
religions. Muslim Aid, Islamic Relief, Khalsa Aid
(a Sikh charity) and UK Jewish Aid are among the
many British-based charities that organise appeals
and deliver relief aid globally.
Within the UK the Salvation Army is an
important provider of hostel accommodation,
and offers other services including work with
alcoholics, prison chaplaincy and a family-tracing
service. The Quakers have a long tradition of
social concern and peacemaking. Trusts with a
Quaker history, such as the Cadbury and
Rowntree Trusts, support many social initiatives.
The Church Urban Fund, established by the
Church of England, is an independent charity
which raises money to enable those living in the
most disadvantaged urban areas to set up local
projects to help alleviate the effects of poverty.
Although rooted in the Christian faith, the fund
does not restrict its grants on the basis of religious
belief.
The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
debates annual reports from its Committee on
Church and Nation, on social, economic and
political matters, and, through its Board of Social
Responsibility, it is the largest voluntary social
work agency in Scotland. The Board currently
runs projects offering care and support to 4,000
people every day. Churches in Wales and Northern
Ireland, and other faith communities, also have
a concern for social issues.
In England, the Inner Cities Religious Council,
based in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister,
provides a forum in which the Government and
faith communities work together on issues
relating to urban policy. Chaired by a
government minister, the Council includes
representatives of the Christian, Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh faiths. The Churches Regional
Network co-ordinates church involvement in
Regional Development Agencies and Regional
Assemblies.
Churches in Scotland have created a Scottish
Churches Parliamentary Office for formal
representation of their interests in the Scottish
Parliament. In Wales, the Churches have worked
together to appoint a Churches National Assembly
Liaison Officer to relate to the National Assembly
for Wales.
Legal rights and responsibilities
Everyone in the UK has the right to freedom of
thought, conscience and religion subject to the law,
under Article 9 of the European Convention on
Human Rights, which was incorporated into the
Human Rights Act 1998. In Great Britain religious
discrimination will be unlawful in the areas of
employment and training under an EC Directive,
set to come into effect by December 2003.
The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
has extended existing racially aggravated offences
in England and Wales to cover offences motivated
by religious hatred.
Discrimination on the grounds of religious belief
or political opinion is already unlawful in
Northern Ireland. The 1976 and 1989 Fair
Employment Acts have been updated by the Fair
Employment and Treatment (NI) Order 1998
which makes direct and indirect discrimination on
grounds of religious belief or political opinion
unlawful in employment and training and in the
provision of goods, facilities and services.
In addition, under the Northern Ireland Act 1998,
a public authority, in carrying out its functions
relating to Northern Ireland, is obliged to have
regard to the need to promote equality of
opportunity between persons of different
religious beliefs and to have due regard to the
desirability of promoting good relations between
such persons.
Co-operation between religions
The Inter Faith Network for the UK links a wide
range of organisations with an interest in inter¬
faith relations, including the representative bodies
of the Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain,
Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian
communities. The Network promotes good
relations between faiths in the UK, and runs a
public advice and information service on inter¬
faith issues. The Council of Christians and Jews
works for better understanding among members
of these two religions and deals with educational
and social issues. The Three Faiths Forum and the
Calamus Foundation have as their focus
relationships between the Christian, Jewish and
Muslim traditions. There are many other
organisations in the UK dealing wholly, or in part,
with inter-faith issues. These include a growing
number of local inter-faith groups and councils.
213
Social and cultural affairs
15 Religion
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland (see
page 208) has a Commission on Inter Faith
Relations. The Interfaith Unit of the Islamic
Foundation was set up with the specific aim of
developing better relations between the Muslim
and Christian traditions.
Since November 2000 members of the Buddhist,
Orthodox Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh
communities have joined other Christian
denominations and Jewish leaders at the Cenotaph
in London's Whitehall on Remembrance Sunday to
represent the many thousands of men and women
of different faiths who have lost their lives in
conflicts around the world.

The United Kingdom has a diverse cultural
heritage, with many artists and performers having
contributed to the development of rich traditions
in art, music, drama, literature and, more recently,
TV, film and radio. Many people come from
abroad to visit the UK for cultural reasons.
Collections in the UK’s museums and galleries are
considered among the best in the world. British
popular music has enjoyed success at home and
overseas.
Culture 50 years ago
Much of the cultural life of Britain was, 50 years
ago, still being rebuilt after the Second World War.
Years of planning began for a new national theatre,
which was eventually built alongside the Royal
Festival Hall on London's South Bank. Public funding
for the arts was being channelled through the newly
founded Arts Council. The image of Britain as
presented through films made at the time may have
been over reliant on stereotypical images such as
the friendly policeman and the London smog, but
these familiar and comforting images probably
reflected the needs of a nation still recovering after
the Second World War. Television was still very much
in its infancy, with mainstream broadcasts
transmitted for only one hour each afternoon and
then later from 8.30-10.00 pm in contrast with the
24-hour coverage of today's major networks.
Participation
Revenue and employment
Recent economic estimates made by the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) (see page 226) suggest that the creative
industries accounted for nearly 8 per cent of UK
gross domestic product in 2000, and were
providing nearly 2 million jobs in December 2001.
In 2001, cinemas took £550 million at the box
office in Great Britain, compared with £507
million in 2000. An estimated 45,000 people were
employed in the film and video industry in 2000
and exports in 1999 were worth around £653
million.
Turnover in the music industry as a whole was
estimated at over £4 billion in 2000 (with exports
worth £1.3 billion). It employed about 120,000
people. In 2001, nearly 226 million pop albums
and 60 million pop singles were sold in the UK
domestic market, generating a turnover of £1,231
million.
Audiences
With the exception of the cinema, the percentage
of the population who attend various types of
cultural event has remained fairly stable since the
late 1980s (see Table 16.1). Admissions to cinemas
rose from 137 million in 2000 to 141 million in
2001, reaching their highest level since 1972.
Attendance at many major museums and galleries
in England also rose between 2000/01 and 2001/02
(see Table 16.2). Attendance may have been
boosted by the re-introduction of free admissions.
Churches and cathedrals are also an important
part of the nation’s cultural heritage, attracting
many visitors. Over 1 million people were
estimated to have visited York Minster and
Canterbury Cathedral in 2000. Strathclyde
Country Park in Scotland, Kew Gardens in
Richmond, the Botanic Gardens in Belfast and the
National Botanic Gardens in Carmarthenshire are
also popular destinations for people with an

Expenditure
Figures from the ONS Family Expenditure Survey
show that the culture and leisure industries are
strong growth areas for the economy: in 2000/01
the average household spent more on leisure
goods and services (including holidays) than food
(see chapter 22).
Government expenditure on the arts is distributed
through a number of channels. DCMS has overall
responsibility for public expenditure in this area.
Table 16.3 shows how DCMS expenditure is
allocated. Local government, the arts councils (see
page 226), the Scottish Executive, the Welsh
Assembly Government and education and library
boards in Northern Ireland also fund arts projects.
More details on how finance is distributed are given
on pages 225-8.

Films
Two recent successful films have been The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Harry
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Both films were
adapted from children's books and released in
November 2001. They proved to be instant
successes with adults and children alike. Although
largely filmed in New Zealand, many of the people
involved in the production of The Lord of the Rings
were British. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
Stone ms produced in Hollywood, but again drew
on British filmmaking expertise for its success.
Musical soundtracks from both films have also
proved popular. By mid-2002 the films had become,
respectively, the third and second highest grossing
films of all time in the UK. Gosford Park, directed by
Robert Altman, was also produced during the year
to critical acclaim, picking up five Golden Globe
nominations. Star Wars: Attack of the Clones and
Spiderman were other major film releases in 2002.
admissions to museums was dropped as a
part of the Government’s commitment to
encourage greater participation in the arts.

schools, volunteering with local pupils on a
range of creative projects. It was launched
with the support of many artists including
the sculptor Anthony Gormley. The aim of
the initiative, which will be repeated in 2003,
is to inspire more schoolchildren to involve
themselves in the arts.

British actors and filmmakers have enjoyed
success at Hollywood’s Oscars in recent years. In
2002 Jim Broadbent was named best supporting
actor for his performance in Iris, Julian Fellowes
won best original screenplay for Gosford Park and
Peter Owen was awarded an Oscar for best make¬
up for The Lord of the Rings.
Cultural events
Arts centres
Over 200 arts centres in the UK give people the
chance of seeing a range of art forms and taking
part in activities, especially educational projects.
Nearly all the centres are professionally managed,
but use the services of volunteers. The Pier Arts
Centre at Stromness (Orkney) and Dundee
Contemporary Arts (which has two galleries, two
cinemas, a print studio and activity rooms) are
two of the centres supported by the Scottish Arts
Council. Centres funded by the Arts Council of
Wales include the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff
and the Aberystwyth Arts Centre, which helps to
promote international artists and collaborations.
Festivals
Some 500 professional arts festivals take place in
the UK each year. Their appeal has broadened -
for example, whereas classical music once
dominated music festivals, there are now those
that offer jazz, folk, pop, rock, world and early
music as well. Around 60 festivals concentrate on
poetry, and other festivals are devoted to the visual
arts, such as the Liverpool Biennial.
The 2002 Edinburgh International Festival
featured performances of music, theatre, opera
and dance, as well as lectures and discussions. The
Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with a wide variety of
programmes (including street events), takes place
alongside the main events. In recent years it has
proved a fertile training ground for comedians
and actors who have progressed to successful
careers elsewhere. Other annual Edinburgh events
include the International Film Festival, the
International Book Festival and the International
Jazz and Blues Festival.
The Aldeburgh Festival, founded by Benjamin
Britten, focuses on classical music. The Hay
Festival, held in Hay-on-Wye, originally focusing
on literature - the town is renowned for its
second-hand bookshops - has broadened its range
in recent years and its programme now includes
musical events and contributions from guest
speakers. Film festivals include the annual London
Film Festival, and newer festivals such as the Leeds
Children’s Film Festival and the Brief Encounters
short film festival in Bristol.

Live performance
Drama
Some of the UK’s 300 professional theatres are
privately owned, but most belong to local
authorities or to not-for-profit organisations.
In England, the Royal National Theatre on the
South Bank in London relies in part on public
subsidy for support, allowing it to take greater
artistic risks and offer cheaper tickets than
unsubsidised theatres in London’s West End.
Elsewhere in London, revivals of classic musicals
have proved a recent success. Other, more literary,
lower-budget plays have also proved popular with
audiences. The Almeida Theatre and the Donmar
Warehouse are two of London’s leading
independent theatres. The Globe Theatre - a
reconstruction of Shakespeare’s playhouse - is
another notable theatrical venue. The Royal
Shakespeare Company, based at Stratford-upon-
Avon, presents spring and autumn seasons of
Shakespeare’s plays in a repertory programme.
Regional theatre
A number of successful productions were staged in
regional theatres in England during 2002. After a
period of general decline, some significant increases
in audience numbers were recorded during the year.
Among the highlights of the 2002 season in English
regional theatre were productions of Edward II in
Sheffield, 1984 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Singing in
the Rain at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, and Rita,
Sue and Bob Too from the Out of Joint Touring
Theatre.
Northern Ireland has six major theatre spaces,
including the Opera House and Waterfront Hall in
Belfast and the new Millennium Forum in the city
of Londonderry/Derry. It also has several
independent theatre companies specialising in
productions of new work.
In Scotland, the Royal Lyceum Theatre and the
King’s and Festival Theatres in Edinburgh, and the
Citizen’s Theatre Glasgow, have full programmes
covering a wide range of productions. The
Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh is Scotland’s
leading centre for new writing.
Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold is the national
English-speaking theatre company for Wales. A
new Welsh language theatre company is currently
being planned and the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff
has a focus on theatre for young audiences.
Music
There are four symphony orchestras with a public
subsidy based in London: the largest of these, the
London Symphony Orchestra, performs at the
Barbican. Other symphony orchestras include two
at the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC),
one at English National Opera and one at Covent
Garden. Smaller chamber groups, such as the
London Mozart Players, the Academy of St
Martin-in-the-Fields and the English Chamber
Orchestra, also perform regularly.
Outside London, the Bournemouth Symphony,
Manchester’s Halle Orchestra and the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic are other well-known and
highly rated English orchestras. The Royal Scottish
National Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra each give many performances a year.
The Ulster Orchestra is Northern Ireland’s only
fully professional orchestra. In Wales the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales offers a year-round
programme of orchestral and choral music
featuring the BBC National Chorus of Wales.
English and Welsh choral societies have done
much to foster the oratorio tradition at the
leading music festivals. English ecclesiastical
choral singing is a speciality of the choirs of
cathedrals and Oxford and Cambridge colleges.
Three well-established events in the classical
musical calendar are the Leeds International Piano
Competition for young pianists, the biennial
Cardiff Singer of the World Competition and the
biennial BBC Young Musicians contest.
The series of Promenade Concerts (the ‘Proms’),
in the Royal Albert Hall in London, is the world’s
largest music festival. In September 2002 the last
night of the Proms was staged with a link to
Belfast with the Ulster Orchestra playing at the
City Hall.
British artists achieving commercial success in
2001 included the female pop star Dido, who had
the highest selling album in the UK. Robbie
Williams and David Gray also released hit albums
in 2001. Other popular British artists include the
south London garage band So Solid Crew, Travis,
and the ‘virtual’ band Gorillaz.

Social and cultural affairs
16 Culture
Foreign artists, including those from the United
States, have always flourished in the British pop
charts. In recent years, Madonna, Kylie Minogue
and U2 have maintained their long-term appeal.
In 2001 Shaggy had the biggest selling single ‘It
wasn’t me’, and Irish boy band Westlife
accumulated two UK number one singles. Other
international artists achieving commercial success
in the UK include the nu metal band Limp Bizkit,
Strokes and Destiny’s Child.
Folk music has always been strong in all parts of
the UK. In Northern Ireland, for example, bands
perform in pubs and clubs, playing fiddles and
other traditional Celtic instruments. Scottish and
Welsh festivals uphold Gaelic and Celtic traditions
in music and song.
London’s Royal Opera House (ROH) at Covent
Garden staged over 20 operas in 2001/02 and
attracts performers with international reputations.
Glyndebourne Opera (East Sussex), which relies
on private patrons for its summer season, is
another prestigious venue. Other country house
opera ventures include Garsington (Oxfordshire),
where the stage is a garden terrace, Longborough
(Gloucestershire) and Castleward Opera in
County Down (Northern Ireland).
Dance
In 2001 English National Ballet was based at the
Coliseum; in 2002 it is performing under the same
roof as the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden. Other
important ballet companies include Birmingham
Royal Ballet and Northern Ballet Theatre.
Scottish Ballet has embarked on a new era of
classical and contemporary dance, and Dance
Base, Scotland’s new national centre for dance,
opened in Edinburgh in 2001. Contemporary
dance companies with established reputations are
Diversions, Spring Loaded and the Richard Alston
Dance Company. Siobhan Davies and Wayne
McGregor are currently two of Britain’s leading
choreographers.
Broadcast performance
Television
Television is an enormously popular medium for
the communication of cultural experiences, now
that 99 per cent of households own a television
set, and the average person watches around
20 hours of programmes a week.
There is a wide variety in the kinds of television
programme broadcast on terrestrial television.
‘Soaps’, such as EastEnders and Coronation Street
(long-running serials screening several episodes a
week and often focusing on family relationships),
consistently attract the highest audiences. Quiz
shows {Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and The
Weakest Link, among the most notable examples)
have maintained their popularity, along with
police and detective series such as Midsomer
Murders and A Touch of Frost. Hospital dramas
such as Casualty and Holby City also achieve high
ratings. Football has a strong presence on
television. Films, documentaries and lifestyle
programmes, focusing on cookery and home
improvements, are among other types broadcast.
More details on the pattern of television watching,
and the range of stations available to audiences,
can be found in chapter 17.
Radio
Radio 50 years ago
Holders of the 12 million radio receiving licences in
the UK tuning in to 'home' radio stations at the
start of the 1950s were given three choices: they
could listen to the Home Services, the Light
Programme, or the Third Programme, all broadcast
by the BBC.
Characteristic items on the BBC Home Services radio
stations included 'news bulletins, broadcasts to
schools, religious services, plays, symphony concerts,
brains trusts, music-hall and variety talks'. The object
of the Light Programme was to 'entertain its
listeners and to interest them in the world at large
without failing to be entertaining'. The object of the
Third Programme was to 'broadcast without regard
to length or difficulty the masterpieces of music, of
art and of letters which lend themselves to
transmission in sound'.
The BBC broadcasts each week 156 hours of
classical and other music (both live and recorded)
on Radio 3. BBC Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop
music, and much of the output of BBC Radio 2 is
popular and light music. Among the independent
stations, Classic FM offers mainly classical and
Virgin Radio plays rock and pop. Much of the
output of the UK’s local radio stations is popular
and light music, news and information. More
details on the pattern of radio listening, and the
220
Social and cultural affairs
16 Culture
range of new digital stations available to listeners,
can be found in chapter 17.
BBC Radio 4’s output is mainly talk-based and
includes a wealth of drama, documentary
discussions and full-length plays. Latest estimates
indicate that radio programmes reach 91 per cent
of the adult population aged 15 and over, with
BBC local and national stations taking just over
half of the audience share.
Visual arts
A feature of cultural life in Britain recently has been
the building or refurbishment of arts centres, many
of them outside London. Prominent among these
have been:
■ the reopening of the Manchester Art Gallery;
■ the opening in Gateshead of BALTIC, The centre
for Contemporary Arts;
■ the reopening of the Walker Art Gallery in
Liverpool;
■ the opening of a new £5 million exhibition
centre at one of the UK's most important
archaeological burial sites in Sutton Hoo, near
Woodbridge in Suffolk;
■ the complete refurbishment of the British
Galleries at the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London;
■ the reopening of the Women's Library and
Heritage Centre in east London; and
■ major restoration work at the Coliseum, home of
the English National Opera, providing a 40 per
cent increase in public space, as well as extra
room for education activities.
Museums and galleries
Over 77 million visits a year are made to the UK’s
1,800 registered museums and galleries which
include the major national museums, about 600
independent museums, 500 receiving support
from local authorities, and others supported by
universities, the armed services, the National Trust
and English Heritage (see Table 16.2). In addition
to displaying their permanent collections,
museums and galleries also stage temporary
exhibitions, the largest attracting hundreds of
thousands of visitors. The number of museums
has expanded considerably since 1980, when there
were 800.
The English national museums and galleries are:
■ British Museum, housing one of the most
comprehensive collections of European and
world culture (www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk).
■ Natural History Museum (www.nhm.ac.uk).
■ Victoria and Albert Museum (concentrating
on fine and decorative arts - www.vam.ac.uk).
■ National Museum of Science & Industry
(www.nmsi.ac.uk) including the Science
Museums in London and Wroughton, the
National Railway Museum (York) and the
National Museum of Photography, Film and
Television (Bradford). Their exhibits
commemorate the role played by the UK in
the industrial and technological revolutions
of the 19th and 20th centuries.
■ National Gallery (www.nationalgallery.org.uk).
Western painting from about 1260 to 1900 -
a collection of worldwide importance,
including the Leonardo da Vinci cartoons and
The Haywain by Constable.
■ Tate Britain (www.tate.org.uk/britain) devoted
to British art since the 15th century, with
additional collections in Liverpool and St Ives,
Cornwall (St Ives School and modern art).
■ Tate Modern (www.tate.org.uk/modern).
■ National Portrait Gallery, containing pictures,
sculptures and photographs of people who
have shaped Britain’s past (www.npg.org.uk).
■ Imperial War Museum (www.iwm.org.uk)
which has three sites in London and one at
Duxford (which includes the American Air
Museum) in Cambridgeshire.
■ Royal Armouries (www.armouries.org.uk), the
UK’s oldest museum, which has exhibits in
the Tower of London (relating to the Tower’s
history), Leeds (arms and armour) and Fort
Nelson, near Portsmouth (artillery).

Particularly important collections outside the
national museums are recognised through
‘designation’. Designated collections outside
London range from the social history collections
at Beamish open air museum to the fine art
collections of the Barber Institute in Birmingham.
Within London, designated collections include the
Museum of London; the Courtauld Institute
Galleries (containing masterpieces of 14th to
20th-century European painting); and London’s
Transport Museum.
In Scotland the national collections are held by the
National Museums of Scotland (www.nms.ac.uk)
and the National Galleries of Scotland
(www.nationalgalleries.org). The former include
the Royal Museum, the Museum of Scotland, the
Scottish National War Museum and the Scottish
Agricultural Museum, in Edinburgh; the Museum
of Flight, near North Berwick; and the Museum of
Costume at Shambellie Fiouse near Dumfries.
The National Galleries of Scotland comprise the
National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery, the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art, and the Dean Gallery, housing the
Paolozzi gift of sculpture and graphic art, as well
as renowned Dada and Surrealist collections. The
National Galleries also have deposits at Paxton
Fiouse near Berwick upon Tweed and Duff House
in Banff.
The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff
(www.nmgw.ac.uk) has a number of branches,
including the Museum of Welsh Life at St Fagans,
the Slate Museum at Llanberis and the National
Waterfront Museum, Swansea, which is currently
under development and will be housed in
Swansea’s Maritime Quarter.
The Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland
(www.magni.org.uk) comprise the Ulster Museum
in Belfast, the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum
in County Down, and the Ulster-American Folk
Park in County Tyrone.
Architecture and design
The Royal Institute of British Architects, with
about 28,000 members, has been promoting and
advancing architecture since receiving its Royal
Charter in 1837. Among the many notable
examples of modern British architecture, the
Magna Science Adventure Centre outside
Rotherham was awarded the prestigious Stirling
Prize for architecture in 2001.
Better design in the fashion, film, computing and
manufacturing industries and in other areas, is
supported and encouraged in the UK by the
Design Council, an independent organisation
working with partners in business, education and
government to inspire and enable the effective use
of design.
Crafts
‘Crafts’ in the United Kingdom is an umbrella
term covering a huge range of activities, from the
making of pots and rugs to handmade toys and
other personal and household products.
The Crafts Council is the official organisation for
crafts in England. Its objectives include raising the
profile of crafts in England and abroad, and
strengthening and developing the craft economy
in support of craftspeople. The Crafts Council
also organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair and
other programmes from its London venue; and
co-ordinates British groups at international fairs.
Craft Forum Wales supports craft business groups
in Wales. Craftworks, an independent company, is
the craft development agency for Northern
Ireland. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland
funds crafts promotion. In Scotland, the Scottish
Arts Council has a Crafts Department, which
promotes crafts and helps craftworkers.
The written word
Despite the growth of television and the Internet,
demand for books remains strong. In 2001 British
publishers issued over 119,000 separate titles
(including new editions). The UK book industry
exported books worth £1,195 million in 2001.
222
Social and cultural affairs
16 Culture
Fictional works of literature are just part of the
range of books on offer. Non-fiction, in particular
gardening, lifestyle, and travel books, as well as
books tied to particular television series, are
consistently among the lists of best-selling titles.
The top ten best-selling titles of 2001 in Great
Britain were as follows:
1. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
J K Rowling
2. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire J K Rowling
3. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
J K Rowling
4. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

5. Bridget Jones’s Diary Helen Fielding
6. A Child Called ‘It’ Dave Pelzer
7. Chocolat Joanne Harris
8. Happy Days with the Naked Chef Jamie Oliver
9. White Teeth Zadie Smith
10. Man and Boy Tony Parsons
Among the leading trade organisations are the
Publishers Association (PA), which has 200
members; and the Booksellers Association, with
about 3,300 members. The PA, through its
international division, promotes the export of
British books. The Welsh Books Council promotes
the book trade in Wales in both Welsh and English
and the Gaelic Books Council supports the
publication of books in Gaelic. The Book Trust
encourages reading and the promotion of books
through an information service and a children’s
library.
Literary and philological societies
Societies to promote literature include the English
Association, the Royal Society of Literature and
the Welsh Academy (Yr Academi Gymreig). The
leading society for studies in the humanities is the
British Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the British
Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early English Text
Society, the Bibliographical Society and several
devoted to particular authors, such as Jane Austen
and Charles Dickens. The Poetry Society sponsors
poetry readings and recitals, as does the Scottish
Poetry Library. London’s South Bank Centre and
the British Library run programmes of literary
events.
Libraries and archives
Local authorities in Great Britain and education
and library boards in Northern Ireland have a
duty to provide a free lending and reference
library service. There are almost 5,000 public
libraries in the UK. In Great Britain more than 34
million people (58 per cent of the population) are
registered members of their local library, and of
these around 20 per cent borrow at least once a
week. Those who are not registered members can
also use their local library facilities. About 406
million books and 39 million audio-visual items
were borrowed from UK public libraries in
2000/01. The Government is advised on library
and archives policy by Resource (see page 227).
Many libraries have collections of CDs, records,
audio- and video-cassettes, DVDs and musical
scores for loan to the public, while a number also
lend from collections of works of art, which may
be originals or reproductions. Most libraries hold
documents on local history, and all provide
services for children, while reference and
information sections, and art, music, commercial
and technical departments are among the other
facilities available.
The information role is important for all libraries:
nearly all have personal computers for public use
and, in May 2002, 70 per cent had Internet
connections. A government initiative under the
New Opportunities Fund is providing £20 million
for information and communications technology
training of library staff and £50 million for
enabling library material to be stored and accessed
in digitised form. The Government intends to link
all public libraries and connect them to the
National Grid for Learning (see page 116) by the
end of 2002.
The British Film Institute (bft) maintains the
J Paul Getty Conservation Centre, which contains
over 275,000 films and 200,000 television
programmes, together with extensive collections
of stills, posters and designs. The bfi National
Library houses a large collection of film-related
223
Social and cultural affairs
16 Culture
books, periodicals, scripts and other written
materials.
The British Library and national libraries
The British Library (BL), the national library of
the UK, is custodian of one of the most important
research collections in the world (150 million
items spanning 3,000 years). It is housed in the
largest wholly publicly funded building
constructed in the UK in the 20th century. The
total floor space is approximately 100,000 square
metres. The basements, the deepest in London,
have 340 km of shelving for 15 million books.
There are 11 reading areas, three exhibition
galleries and a conference centre with a 250-seat
auditorium. British publishers are legally obliged
to deposit a copy of their publications at the BL.
The National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales,
the Bodleian at Oxford and the Cambridge
University Library (and the Library of Trinity
College, Dublin) can also claim copies of all new
British publications.
The reading rooms in the British Library are open
to those who need to see material (for example,
manuscripts, newspapers, journals, stamps, maps
and CD-ROMs as well as books) that is not
readily available elsewhere and to those whose
work or studies require the facilities of the
national library.
The British Library’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa is the national centre for inter-library
lending within the UK and between the UK and
other countries.
Manuscripts and other records
The Historical Manuscripts Commission (HMC)
gives information and advice about historical
papers outside the public records. It also advises
private owners, grant-awarding bodies, record
offices, local authorities and the Government on
the acquisition and maintenance of manuscripts.
The Commission maintains the National Register
of Archives (the central collecting point for
information about British historical manuscripts)
and the Manorial Documents Register, both of
which are available to researchers.
The Public Record Office (PRO) in Kew (Surrey)
houses the records of the superior courts of law of
England and Wales and of most government
departments, as well as manuscripts of historical
documents, such as the Domesday Book (1086)
and autograph letters and documents of the
sovereigns of England. Public records, with a few
exceptions, are available for inspection by
everyone 30 years after the end of the year in
which they were created.
From April 2003 the Historical Manuscripts
Commission and the Public Record Office will
combine to form a new organisation, the National
Archives. The National Archives of Scotland in
Edinburgh and the PRO of Northern Ireland in
Belfast serve the same purpose.
Education and training
The National Curriculum specifies that all
children at school should receive training in the
arts, music and literature (see page 107). For
many, involvement in art classes, the school play
or orchestra is the first time their interest in
culture is awakened. The Government is keen to
encourage artistic talent at school. In England,
Artsmark, an initiative from the Department for
Education and Skills (DfES) and the DCMS in
conjunction with the Arts Council of England (see
page 226), gives formal recognition to schools
which achieve a certain standard in the cultural
education they offer. Additional initiatives to
encourage cultural excellence in schools include:
■ the Music Standards Fund, receiving £270
million from the DfES between 1999 and
2004. Some £60 million a year from the DfES
Standards Fund has been used to protect and
expand a range of music services, such as
buying musical instruments for schools,
providing instrumental tuition and providing
extra training for teachers;
■ the National Foundation for Youth Music,
funded by Lottery grants and donations from
other sources including the British
Phonographic Industry; and
■ the Space for Sport and Arts programme,
allocating up to £130 million to enable pupils
and the wider community in deprived areas
to participate in art-based and sporting
activities by providing new (or modernising
existing) facilities in primary schools. The
programme will run until 2004.
In Scotland, education is the responsibility of the
Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED).

Expressive arts are a key component of the pre¬
school and 5-14 curricular guidelines, and are
available as examination subjects at Standard
Grade, Higher and Advanced Higher levels.
For those wishing to pursue a career in the arts,
training available at post-16 tends to concentrate
on particular specialisms. The DCMS and DfES
allocate £19 million a year in grants for drama and
dance students for tuition and maintenance. Over
800 students a year cover their tuition fees in this
way, on the same basis as other higher and further
education pupils. All training must be at
accredited institutions and towards recognised
qualifications, with annual evaluation by the
DCMS and DfES to ensure that standards are
maintained. Competition to enter all the Schools
of Performing Arts is keen.
The Royal National Theatre’s Education
Programme encourages access to drama on a
national level through youth theatre projects,
touring productions, workshops, rehearsed
readings, work in schools and a nation-wide
membership scheme.
Professional training in music is given at
universities and conservatories. Nearly a third of
the players in the European Community Youth
Orchestra come from the UK. There is also a
National Youth Jazz Orchestra, a Scottish Youth
Jazz Orchestra and a network of other youth jazz
orchestras and wind bands.
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by specialist
schools, while all government-funded dance
companies provide dance workshops and
education activities.
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and the film,
video and television industries. It offers
postgraduate and short course training for
directors, editors, camera operators, animators
and other specialists.
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and applied
art departments of universities and in further
education colleges and private art schools. Some
of these institutions award degrees at postgraduate
level. The Royal College of Art in London is the
only wholly postgraduate school of art and design
in the world. Art is also taught to degree level at
the four Scottish art schools.
University courses concentrate largely on
academic disciplines, such as the history of art.
The Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College London are leading institutions. The
Society for Education through Art, among other
activities, encourages schools to buy original
works by organising an annual ‘Pictures for
Schools’ exhibition.
Innovations
The Government’s 24-hour museum website
(www.24honrmuseum.org.uk) provides a gazetteer
of all UK museums and galleries, a magazine,
search facilities and educational resources. SCRAN
(www.scran.ac.uk), the Scottish Cultural Resources
Access Network, is a history and culture site
providing access to images, films, sounds and
virtual reality records from museums, galleries,
archives and media.
Culture online (www.cultureonline.gov.uk),
another government initiative, will increase digital
access to and participation in English arts and
cultural activities. DCMS will assume initial
responsibility for culture online.
A growing number of operas, concerts, ballets and
plays can now be viewed via the Online Classics
WebPages (www.onlineclassics.net). The British
Library has put on its Internet catalogue details of
more than 10 million documents from the past
500 years, including books, journals and reports.
The National Library of Wales has established a
substantial digitisation programme in order to
make available online copies of large numbers of
items from its collections. Art created and shown
solely online has also expanded in recent years -
encouraged, for example, by the Institute of
Contemporary Arts.
Administration
The expression of creativity is primarily a personal
or group activity, but there is also an official and
commercial side to culture. Many artists and
225
Social and cultural affairs
16 Culture
performers engaged in cultural activity rely on
subsidies and funding from government and other
patrons of the arts. The Government has a role in
protecting the rights of authors through copyright
legislation; providing a regulatory framework for
cultural activities in areas such as film
classification; and encouraging greater public
participation in the arts.
Public sector involvement in the arts is expressed
in a number of different ways: through the work
of the four Administrations directly responsible
for culture in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland; through local government
support for local initiatives; or through
intermediate groups such as the Arts Councils,
which act independently from the Government
but are nonetheless publicly funded and take on
the role of patrons of the arts.
DCMS has policy responsibilities within
government for the arts, broadcasting, the built
heritage, creative industries, film, museums,
galleries and libraries, the National Lottery (see
page 263), press freedom and regulation, sport
and tourism.
DCMS aims to improve the quality of life for all
through cultural activities and to strengthen the
creative industries. It works, in partnership with
others, towards:
■ creating an efficient and competitive market
by removing obstacles to growth and
unnecessary regulation so as to promote
Britain’s success in the fields of culture,
media, sport and tourism, both in the UK
and abroad;
■ broadening access to cultural events and to
the built environment;
■ raising the standards of cultural education
and training;
■ ensuring that everyone has the opportunity
to achieve excellence in areas of culture and
to develop talent, innovation and good
design; and
■ maintaining public support for the National
Lottery and ensuring that the objective of the
Lottery Lund supports DCMS and other
national priorities.
The Welsh Assembly Government has
responsibility for the arts in Wales and has
published a culture strategy, ‘Creative Luture’. The
Scottish Executive’s National Cultural Strategy
provides the basis for the administration of the
arts in Scotland. In Northern Ireland,
responsibility for the arts rests with the
Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
Local authorities
Although policy is formulated by the four UK
administrations, many new initiatives are carried
out at a local level. Local authorities maintain
about 500 museums and art galleries, and a
network of public libraries. They also provide
grant aid for professional and amateur orchestras,
theatres, and opera and dance companies.
Lourteen authorities are piloting Local Cultural
Strategies, a DCMS scheme to bring cultural
issues into the heart of local government
planning.
The Arts Councils
The independent Arts Councils of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the
main channels for the distribution of government
grants and Lottery funding to the visual,
performing and community arts and to literature.
They give financial assistance and advice not only
to the major performing arts organisations, but
also to small touring theatre companies,
experimental performance groups and literary
organisations. The Arts Councils also commission
research into the impact of the arts on society and
develop forward strategies.
The Arts Council of England funds the major
national arts-producing organisations in England,
including the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet, the
Birmingham Royal Ballet, English National Opera
(ENO), the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC),
the Royal National Theatre and the South Bank
Reform of the Arts Council of England
In April 2002, the Arts Council of England and the
ten Regional Arts Boards joined together to form a
single development organisation for the arts in
England. The objective is to build a national force for
the arts which will deliver more funding and a
higher profile for artists and arts organisations.
Boundaries for the Arts Council regional offices are
being adjusted to match those for government
regional offices.

Centre and the main touring companies, such as
Opera North and English National Ballet.
New funding announced in early 2001 by the Arts
Council of England made an extra £25 million
available for theatre companies, spread over two
financial years. Nearly 200 individual venues are
benefiting from substantial increases in their grants,
with 85 touring companies sharing over £4 million.
Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives
and Libraries
‘Resource’ is the strategic agency working with,
and on behalf of, museums, archives and libraries
across the UK, and advising the Government on
policy issues. It is currently in the process of
establishing regional agencies in each of the nine
English regions. Resource provides funding
through these agencies and their predecessors
(which include the Area Museum Councils). It has
responsibility for a number of other initiatives,
including:
■ the portable antiquities scheme, set up to
record archaeological objects;
■ schemes for museum registration and
designation of collections (see page 222);
■ an initiative to establish a new framework for
England’s regional museums; and
■ the Acceptance in Lieu scheme, whereby pre¬
eminent works of art may be accepted by the
Government in settlement of tax and
allocated to public galleries.
Film Council and bfi
The Film Council channels the majority of public
funding for film production in the UK. It has a
wide remit, with both cultural and industry
objectives: to develop film culture in the UK, and
to create a coherent structure for the UK film
industry. The Council also helps to fund the
British Film Office in Los Angeles, which acts as
an information service to promote both British
exports and the advantages of British studios to
US film-makers. Recently, the responsibilities of
the British Film Office were broadened to include
television programmes and commercials.
The moving image as an art form is promoted by
the British Film Institute (bfi), Scottish Screen, the
Northern Ireland Film Commission and Sgrin, the
Media Agency for Wales.
Government help for the film industry allows,
until 2005, a 100 per cent tax write-off on the
production and acquisition costs, in the year the
costs were incurred, for British movies with
budgets of up to £15 million. Films which cost
more than £15 million can be written off over
three years against tax liabilities once the film has
been completed.
The Film Council is responsible for distributing
£150 million of Lottery and government grant to
the UK film industry during 2000-03. Its New
Cinema Fund is making £1.5 million available to
radical and innovative filmmakers who wish to
use the latest digital technology. The £10 million
Premiere Production Fund is geared towards the
making of popular mainstream films and the £5
million Film Development Fund is targeted at the
development stage of film-making.
Cinema licensing and film classification
Public cinemas must be licensed by local
authorities, which have a legal duty to prohibit the
admission of children to unsuitable films, and
may prevent the showing of any picture. In
assessing films the authorities normally rely on the
judgement of an independent non-statutory body,
the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), to
which all items must be submitted. Films passed
by the BBFC are put into one of the following
categories:
■ U (universal), suitable for all;
■ PG (parental guidance), in which some scenes
may be unsuitable for young children;
■ 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
■ Restricted 18, for restricted showing only at
premises to which no one under 18 is
admitted - for example, licensed cinema clubs.
The BBFC is also legally responsible for classifying
videos under a system similar to that for films. It
is an offence to supply commercially a video
which has not been classified or to supply it in
contravention of its designation. Responsibility for
the work of the BBFC lies with the DCMS.
Authors' copyright and performers'
protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works (including computer programs and
227
Social and cultural affairs
16 Culture
databases), films, sound recordings, cable
programmes, broadcasts and the typographical
arrangement of published editions are
automatically protected by copyright in the UK if
they meet the legal requirements for protection.
The copyright owner has rights against
unauthorised reproduction, distribution, public
performance, rental, broadcasting and adaptation
of his or her work (including putting material on
the Internet without permission). In most cases
the author is the first owner of the copyright, and
the term of copyright in literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic works is for the life of the
author and for 70 years thereafter. There are
similar rules governing copyright on films. Sound
recordings and broadcasts are protected for a
period of 50 years.
National Lottery
The introduction of the National Lottery in 1994
significantly altered the funding of arts events in
the United Kingdom. During the early years of the
Lottery, the focus of arts funding was chiefly on
major capital projects. Some shift in emphasis
occurred from 1998 onwards, with the allocation
of funds to smaller, local projects. According to an
official report on the first seven years of the
Lottery’s operation, by September 2001:
■ the Arts Councils across the United Kingdom
had awarded over 21,000 grants worth a total
of nearly £1.8 billion;
■ the Arts Council of England had awarded
over £1.45 billion to over 15,000 projects,
including 80 new and almost 600 refurbished
arts venues, and over 600 projects worth
£300 million, which are intended to benefit
children and young people;
■ the Scottish Arts Council had made nearly
2,500 grants worth over £154 million;
■ the Arts Council of Wales had awarded over
£97 million to 2,700 projects; and
■ the Arts Council of Northern Ireland had
made nearly 700 awards worth over £40
million.
In addition, the DCMS has established the
National Endowment for Science, Technology and
the Arts (NESTA), which uses the income
generated by £200 million of Lottery funds to
support projects and inventions in the arts and
sciences. Since its inception, it has allocated more
than £20 million to over 200 people and projects.
Sponsorship
Total UK business investment in the arts in
2000/01 was £114 million. With many Lottery-
backed arts buildings now in operation, business
help for new developments fell from £45.7 million
in 1999/2000 to £9 million in 2000/01.
Sponsorship in kind rose from £11.3 million in
1999/2000 to £18.1 million in 2000/01.
Arts & Business promotes and encourages
partnerships between business and the arts. It has
over 350 business members and manages the Arts
& Business New Partners Programme on behalf of
the Arts Council of England and the DCMS.
Many arts organisations also benefit from the
fund-raising activities of friends and groups and
from private individuals’ financial support. For
example, theatre companies have traditionally
relied on the support of‘angels’, individual
sponsors investing often quite small amounts of
money to meet the costs of putting on a show, in
the prospect of subsequently recouping their
investment from box office proceeds.

Regulation of broadcast media 235
Commercial activities 237
The press 238
Long-established media for communication, such
as the press and postal services, have altered
relatively little over the last 50 years. Many others,
particularly those concerned with the broadcast
media and telecommunications industries, have
experienced widespread and fundamental change.
Much of this has occurred over the past decade.
With the advent of digital television and radio,
alongside continuing expansion of cable and
satellite television, there has been a proliferation of
new public service and independent channels. The
Internet, unimaginable 50 years ago, is another
medium still undergoing rapid expansion, with
more households gaining access and an increasing
range of services.
Television
Figure 17.1 gives a broad indication of the type of
programmes on the five main UK terrestrial
channels. Drama, factual and education,
entertainment, and news and weather
programmes dominate the coverage. Around a
third of primetime broadcasting output in 2001
was devoted to drama programmes; arts and
religion programmes in the same year accounted
together for less than 2 per cent of broadcasting
time. Between 1997 and 2001 the percentage of
primetime television given to drama and factual
programmes fell slightly, whereas time allocated to
entertainment programmes rose over the same
period, to account for over a fifth of broadcast
output in 2001.
There are five public service broadcasters in the
UK: the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation),
the ITV network, Channel 4, Channel 5, and S4C
(Sianel Pedwar Cymru), which broadcasts in Wales.
They each have a statutory public service remit,
which governs the minimum level of different
types of programming they should provide.

Local television services operate under licence
making use of spare frequencies as and when they
are available. There are ten local delivery operators
with 15-year licences and five local delivery
operators with five-year licences in the UK. These
services began in 1998.
BBC
The BBC broadcasts 17,000 hours of television
each year on its two analogue domestic channels
to national and regional audiences. BBC ONE is
the channel of broad appeal (documentaries and
current affairs, features, drama and light
entertainment, sport, religion and children’s
programmes), while BBC TWO aims for more
innovation and originality in its programming.
Network programmes are made at, or acquired
through, Television Centre in London and six
230
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
bases throughout the UK (Glasgow in Scotland,
Cardiff in Wales, Belfast in Northern Ireland, and
Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester in England).
Programmes are also commissioned from
independent producers - the BBC must ensure
that at least 25 per cent of its original
programming comes from the independent sector.
Education is a central component of the
Corporation’s public service commitment. A range
of programmes is broadcast for primary and
secondary schools, further education colleges and
the Open University (see page 112), while other
educational programmes cover numeracy, literacy,
language learning, health, work and vocational
training. Books, pamphlets, computer software,
and audio and video materials supplement the
programmes. Details of the digital television
channels available from the BBC can be found on
page 232.
ITV network
The ITV network’s analogue services are broadcast
on Channel 3 as ITV1. There are 15 regionally
based independent television companies, which
are licensed to supply programmes in the 14
independent television geographical regions.
There are two licences for London, one for
weekdays and the other for the weekend.
A separate company licensed by the Independent
Television Commission (ITC) (see page 235)
provides a national breakfast-time service,
transmitted on the ITV network. All Channel 3
licences have been renewed for a further ten-year
period from 1999, 2000 and 2001.
Programmes are broadcast 24 hours a day
throughout the country. A shared national and
international news service is provided by
Independent Television News (ITN).
ITV 1 companies are obliged to operate a national
programme network. The ITV network centre,
which is owned by the companies, independently
commissions and schedules programmes.
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees derive
most of their income from selling advertising
time. Their financial resources and programme
production vary considerably, depending largely
on the population of the areas in which they
operate. Newspaper groups can acquire a
controlling interest in ITV companies, although
measures are in force to deter any undue
Participative shows
Pop Idol, a musical talent competition staged over
a number of weeks with one contestant from a
shortlist of solo performers 'voted off' each week by
the television audience, proved to be one of the
biggest media events in the UK in 2001/02. The two
finalists, Will Young and Gareth Gates, attracted
record numbers of telephone votes for any televised
event (over 4 million each), and achieved immediate
success as solo performing artists. Big Brother,
Soapstars and Survivor are other examples of shows
with an 'interactive' element that achieved high
ratings during the course of the year.
concentrations of media ownership (see page
240).
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4 provides a national 24-hour television
service. It is a statutory corporation, licensed and
regulated by the ITC, and funded by selling its
own advertising time. Its remit is to provide
programmes with a distinctive character and to
appeal to tastes and interests not generally catered
for by ITV 1. It must present a proportion of
educational programmes, and encourage
innovation and experiment. Channel 4
commissions programmes from the ITV
companies and independent producers, and also
buys programmes from overseas. In February 2001
it announced a restructure and launched a new
incorporated company, 4Ventures, to manage all
its film and other new business activities.
In Wales the fourth analogue channel is allocated
to S4C, which is regulated by the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority. Members of the Welsh
Authority are appointed by the Government.
S4C must ensure that a significant proportion of
programming - the majority aired between
6.30 pm and 10 pm - is in the Welsh language. At
other times it transmits Channel 4 programmes.
In 1998 S4C launched a digital service
incorporating analogue Welsh programmes and
additional material.
Channel 5
The UK’s newest analogue terrestrial channel went
on air in 1997, its ten-year licence having been
awarded by competitive tender to Channel
5 Broadcasting Ltd. Channel 5 serves about
80 per cent of the population and is supported
by advertising revenue.

Text services
Teletext is a text-based data service, broadcast on
Channels 1 to 5 using the spare signal capacity in
analogue terrestrial television services. Most main
television sets in the home are capable of
decoding teletext signals, which are displayed as
text and simple graphics. Teletext services include
regularly updated information on a variety of
subjects, including news, sport, travel, weather and
entertainment.
The BBC broadcasts its ‘Ceefax’ teletext service
within the BBC ONE and TWO signals. For ITV1,
Channel 4, and Channel 5, the teletext service is
provided under ten-year broadcasting licences,
granted by the ITC. All terrestrial channels
provide subtitles for people with hearing
difficulties on most of their programmes.
Digital terrestrial television (DTT)
A single frequency carrying the signals of several
digital services is called a multiplex. The signal can
be received by a standard aerial, but has to be
converted into sound and vision by using a decoder,
either incorporated into the television set or in
a separate digital adaptor attached to a television.
There are six terrestrial multiplexes capable of
supporting services nationwide. One is operated by
the BBC and the other five are licensed by the ITC.
Since November 1998, the following services have
been available: one multiplex operated by the
BBC; one multiplex operated by Digital 3&4,
supporting services from ITV, Channel 4 and
Teletext; and one multiplex operated by S4C
Digital Network, supporting services from S4C,
Channel 5 and other broadcasters.
The remaining three multiplexes were operated
from November 1998 to April 2002 by ITV Digital
to support pay-TV services. ITV Digital ceased
broadcasting in 2002 and as a result the licences
for its multiplexes were handed back to the ITC.
In August 2002 the ITC granted the licence for
these three multiplexes to new operators. All DTT
services are now free-to-view.
Services from the public service broadcasters
which are available on analogue terrestrial are also
broadcast on DTT. Additional services available on
DTT include:
■ BBC News 24 (a 24-hour news channel);
■ BBC Choice, a supplementary service for
a younger audience to complement and
enhance the network schedules;
■ BBC Parliament (coverage of proceedings in
the House of Commons, House of Lords, the
Parliament in Scotland and the assemblies in
Wales and Northern Ireland);
■ BBC FOUR (in-depth coverage of culture, the
arts, science, history, business and current
affairs);
■ two daytime children’s channels, CBBC and,
for the under fives, CBeebies;
■ ITV2 (an additional service from the ITV
network); and
■ S4C2 (an additional service from S4C).
Future plans for DTT include an extended range
of digital services on the three multiplexes
previously held by ITV Digital.
Digital switchover
The Government intends eventually to cease
analogue terrestrial television transmission, and to
reallocate the broadcasting spectrum currently
used for analogue television. It believes that
switchover could start as early as 2006 and be
completed by 2010.
The UK leads the world in uptake of digital
television. Services are available to over 96 per
cent of households. By the end of June 2002, over
37 per cent of households (9.3 million) were
accessing digital television via either DTT, satellite
or cable.
Non-terrestrial television
There are two main non-terrestrial television
delivery systems (platforms) in the UK - digital
satellite and cable-access television (CATV). These
are funded mainly by subscription income. Both
platforms offer packages of subscription-only
television services, including some premium
services such as movie and sports channels and
pay-per-view events. Both cable and satellite are
required to carry the public service channels at no
additional cost to the viewer.
On both platforms, the selection of channels
available via subscription is broadly similar, but
232
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
there are some services which are unique to each
platform. Available services include Eurosport,
Cartoon Network, UK Gold (repeat programmes
from TV archives), E4 (additional services from
Channel 4) and the Discovery Channel (science
and nature documentaries).
Foreign language services are also provided, some
of them designed for ethnic minorities within the
UK, and others aimed primarily at audiences in
other countries. Viewers in the UK can similarly
receive a variety of television services from other
European countries.
Cable-access television
Cable-access television services are delivered to
consumers via underground networks of cables.
The signals are decoded using a converter box,
which is rented from the cable provider. Cable
customers can also access telephone services and,
in the case of digital cable, broadband Internet
services.
Around 13 million homes in the UK are passed by
cable, mostly in urban and suburban areas. The
two main cable providers are ntl and Telewest.
Both networks are in the process of converting
from analogue to digital - currently, there are
2 million homes subscribing to digital CATV, and
1.4 million homes subscribing to analogue CATV.
Analogue CATV systems can carry around
65 television services, as well as a range of
telecommunications services. Digital CATV
currently carries up to around 100 services (TV
and radio), and additionally offers the viewer
interactive services.
Digital satellite
Also referred to as ‘direct to home’, satellite
television signals are received via a specially
designed antenna (or ‘dish’) mounted on the
outside of a building, and are decoded using either
a set-top box or an integrated digital television.
Most satellite television in the UK is provided by
British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), which had
6.1 million subscribers by the end of June 2002.
Sky Television was launched in 1989 as an
analogue-only service, and began simultaneous
digital broadcasting in 1998. In October 2001 the
analogue signal was switched off, and the renamed
Sky Digital became the first digital-only TV
platform in the UK. The platform has been fully
interactive since 1999.
Around 200 services (TV and radio) are currently
available on the platform. Most of the more
popular channels are accessible only by
subscription to BSkyB, but there is also a wide
variety of free-to-view channels. Customers can
choose to buy a BSkyB installation without a
subscription to access free-to-view only. If viewers
wish to access the existing UK public service
television channels without paying a subscription,
they can request free of charge a smart card which
gives access to these services.
Interactive digital services
Satellite, digital cable and DTT all offer interactive
services. The level and complexity of these services
depend on the platform and the equipment that
the customer has installed.
Interactive services range from electronic
programme guides and digital text (an enhanced
version of teletext), to home shopping, video-on-
demand,1 home banking, e-mail and Internet
access. Interactive television can also involve
participating in TV quiz shows, voting in polls, or
viewing sports coverage from different camera
angles using the remote control.
Radio
Radio’s popularity has shown no signs of
diminishing, with 91 per cent of the adult
population listening regularly each week. News
and music form the bulk of the output of radio
stations.
The BBC has five national radio networks, which
together transmit all types of music, news, current
affairs, drama, education, sport and a range of
features programmes. There are also 39 BBC local
radio services covering England and the Channel
Islands, and national radio services in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, including Welsh and
Gaelic language stations. In spring 2002, BBC
radio took a 53 per cent share of the total UK
radio audience.
There are three national commercial radio stations
(see page 234). Around 260 independent local
radio (ILR) services also supply music, local news
1 Video-on-demand enables viewers to dial into a video library, via
a cable or telephone network, and call up a programme or film of
their choice, which is then transmitted to that household alone.

BBC network radio, broadcasting to the whole of
the UK, transmits nearly 44,000 hours of

BBC World Service
The BBC World Service broadcasts in 43
languages (including English) worldwide. It has an
estimated global weekly audience of 150 million
listeners. The core programming of news, current
affairs, business and sports reports is
complemented by cultural programmes, including
drama, literature and music.
While maintaining shortwave broadcasts for
mass audiences, BBC World Service is making
programmes more widely available on EM
frequencies and delivering services in major
languages through digital broadcasting and on
the Internet.
Programmes in English and many other languages
are made available by satellite for rebroadcasting
by agreement with local or national radio stations,
networks and cable operators.
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service, provides
transcripts of radio and television broadcasts from
150 countries. As well as providing a vital source
of information to the BBC, this service is used by
other media organisations, government
departments, the commercial sector and academic
institutions.
Independent national radio
There are currently three independent national
radio services, whose licences were awarded by the
Radio Authority (see page 235) through
competitive tender, and which broadcast 24 hours
a day:
■ Classic EM, which broadcasts mainly classical
music, together with news and information;
■ Virgin 1215, which plays rock and pop music
(and is supplemented by a separate Virgin
station which operates under a local London
licence); and
■ Talk Sport, a speech-based service.
Independent local radio
Independent local radio (ILR) stations broadcast a
wide range of programmes and news of local
interest, as well as music and entertainment, traffic
reports and advertising. There are also stations
serving minority ethnic communities. The Radio
Authority awards independent local radio licences
in an open competition. The success of local

Sutton Hoo in Suffolk was the burial site of Anglo-Saxon kings of East Anglia. In 1939 Basil
Brown, a local archaeologist, opened the largest burial mound on the site. He discovered a
ship burial containing, among many items, weapons and ornaments. Most of the objects date
from the 7th century AD.

17 The media and communications
licence applications is in part determined by the
extent to which applicants widen choice and
meet the needs and interests of the people living
in the area, and in part by whether they have
the necessary financial resources for the
eight-year licence period. Local radio stations
do not have guaranteed slots on digital local
radio multiplexes.
Digital radio
Commercial national digital radio services now
cover nearly 85 per cent of households in the UK.
The Radio Authority has awarded one national
multiplex licence in the UK carrying ten
programme services. It has also awarded licences
for 36 local digital multiplexes, which will carry
about 250 commercial radio stations between
them.
Regulation of broadcast media
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport
is responsible for government policy on
broadcasting. Two authorities, the BBC and
ITC (Independent Television Commission),
accountable to Parliament but otherwise
independent in their day-to-day operations,
oversee television services.
BBC
The BBC’s constitution, finances and obligations
are governed by Royal Charter and Agreement. Its
Board of Governors appoints the Director-
General, who heads the bodies in charge of the
daily running of the Corporation. The Board of
Governors is also responsible for regulating
programme content.
In 2000 the Government announced new funding
plans for the BBC over the period to 2006/07,
aimed at ensuring that the Corporation can
continue to meet its public service obligations and
operate effectively in a competitive market.
Independent Television Commission
The ITC is an independent statutory body
responsible for licensing and regulating all
commercial television services (including BBC
commercial services) operating in, or from, the
UK, including those delivered by non-terrestrial
platforms. It does not make, broadcast or transmit
programmes.
The ITC must ensure that a wide range of
commercial television services is available
throughout the UK and that they are of a high
quality and appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. It must also ensure fair competition in
the provision of these services, and compliance
with the rules on media ownership.
The ITC regulates the various television services
through licence conditions, codes and guidelines.
The codes cover programme content, advertising,
sponsorship and technical standards. If a licensee
does not comply with the conditions of its licence
or the codes, the ITC can impose penalties. These
range from a formal warning or a requirement to
broadcast an apology or correction, to a fine. In
extreme circumstances, a company’s licence may
be shortened or revoked.
Non-public service broadcasters must comply
with the ITC’s programmes, advertising and
sponsorship codes, but they are not subject to any
positive programming obligations.
The Gaelic Broadcasting Committee is an
independent statutory body committed to
ensuring that a good selection of quality television
and radio programmes is broadcast in Gaelic for
reception in Scotland. Its members are appointed
by the ITC, in consultation with the Radio
Authority. The Committee is responsible for the
distribution of government money to programme
makers through the Gaelic Broadcasting Fund.
Radio Authority
The Radio Authority’s licensing and regulatory
remit covers all independent radio services,
including national, local, cable, satellite and
restricted services. Its three main tasks are to plan
frequencies, appoint licensees with a view to
broadening listener choice, and regulate
programming and advertising. It has published
codes covering engineering, programmes, news
and current affairs, and advertising and
sponsorship, to which its licensees must adhere.
Satellite radio services must be licensed by the
Radio Authority if they are transmitted from the
UK for general reception within the country, or if
they are transmitted from outside, but are
managed editorially from within, the UK.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted service
licences (RSLs). Short-term RSLs, generally for
periods of up to 28 days, are for special events or
235

17 The media and communications
Draft Communications Bill
Following a review of the future regulation of
broadcasting and telecommunications, which took
account of the implications of the increasing
convergence of the two sectors, the Government
published in May 2002 a draft Communications Bill.
The main proposals are:
■ the establishment of a new unified, independent
regulator - the Office of Communications
(Ofcom) - combining the functions of the
Broadcasting Standards Commission,
Independent Television Commission, Office of
Telecommunications (Oftel, see page 242), Radio
Authority and the Radiocommunications Agency;
■ a requirement for Ofcom to establish and
maintain a 'content board' to ensure that the
public's interest in the nature and quality of TV
and radio programmes is properly represented
within OFCOM's structure;
■ making the BBC subject to Ofcom's regulation
with regard to standards, while retaining the
Board of Governors in the role of overseeing the
Corporation's public service remit and upholding
its political and editorial independence;
■ granting Ofcom powers concurrent with those of
the Office of Fair Trading to promote effective
competition in the communications services
sector for the benefit of consumers;
■ removing the requirement for licensing
telecommunications systems (see page 241);
■ allowing spectrum trading to secure more
efficient use of the available radio spectrum; and
■ overhauling rules governing media ownership
(see page 240).
Consultation on the draft Bill dosed in August 2002
and it is expected that full legislation will take place
in the next parliamentary session.
trial services, and long-term RSLs, primarily for
student and hospital stations, broadcast to specific
establishments.
Licences
The ITV licences for Channel 3 are awarded for
a ten-year period by competitive tender to the
highest bidder (who has to have passed a quality
threshold). Licensees must provide a diverse
programme service designed to appeal to a wide
range of tastes and interests. Each company plans
the content of the programmes to be broadcast in
its area. These are produced by the company itself,
by other programme companies, or are bought
from elsewhere. As with the BBC, at least 25 per
cent of original programming must come from
the independent sector.
Broadcasting standards
The independence of the broadcasting authorities
carries certain obligations concerning programme
content. Broadcasters must try to achieve a wide
and balanced range of subject matter, impartiality
in controversial issues and accuracy in news
coverage, and must not offend against good taste.
Broadcasters must also obey the law relating to
obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio Authority apply
rules on impartiality, the portrayal of violence,
and standards of taste and decency in
programmes, particularly during hours when
children are likely to be viewing or listening.
Television programmes broadcast before 9 pm (or
8 pm on certain cable and satellite services) must
be suitable for a general audience, including
children.
Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC)
The BSC, a statutory body, monitors standards
and fairness on television and radio (both
terrestrial - independent and BBC channels - and
satellite). It considers complaints received from
the public, and adjudicates on claims of unfair
treatment in broadcasts and of unwarranted
infringement of privacy in programmes or in their
preparation. In 2000/01 the Commission received
358 fairness complaints, of which 114 were within
its remit; 80 complaints were considered further,
of which 40 per cent were upheld in part or in
full. The BSC also received 7,183 complaints about
standards, of which 6,124 were within its remit;
5,119 complaints were pursued, of which 9 per
cent were upheld in part or in full.
European agreements
The UK has implemented two European
agreements on cross-border broadcasting - the
European Community Broadcasting Directive and
the Council of Europe Convention on
Transfrontier Television. These oversee the free
flow of television programmes and services
236
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
throughout participating countries, setting
minimum standards on advertising, sponsorship,
taste and decency, and the portrayal of sex and
violence. If a broadcast meets these standards, no
participating country may prevent reception in its
territory.
Commercial activities
The domestic services of the BBC are financed
almost wholly by a licence fee. All households or
premises with a television set must buy an annual
licence. This costs £112 for colour and £37.50 for
black and white in 2002/03, although households
with a member aged 75 and over have been
entitled to free licences since 1 November 2000.
Licence income is supplemented by profits from
the commercial activities of BBC Worldwide
(see below). BBC World Service’s radio
broadcasting operations (see page 234) are
financed by a grant from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office.
BBC Worldwide
BBC Worldwide Ltd. is the main commercial arm,
and a wholly owned subsidiary, of the BBC. It was
formed in 1994 to co-ordinate the Corporation’s
commercial activities (television, publishing,
product licensing, the Internet and interactive
services), which are not funded by the licence fee.
Its role is to generate money that can be reinvested
in public service programming for the benefit of
UK licence payers.
BBC Worldwide is Europe’s largest exporter of
television programmes, the world’s biggest
television channel operator based outside the
United States, and the UK’s third largest publisher
of consumer magazines. These activities
accounted for turnover of £660 million in
2001/02, which in turn delivered £106 million
back to the BBC for reinvestment in programming
and other services.
It operates 15 commercial channels in the UK
and overseas. These include the wholly owned
BBC World (news and information), BBC Prime
(entertainment) and BBC America channels, and
12 other channels in joint ventures with other
companies (Discovery Communications,
Flextech, FOXTEL and Pearson). Together, they
reach about 460 million households across the
world.
BBC Worldwide is the market leader in audio
publishing. It also operates online services
(beeb.net).
Advertising and sponsorship
The BBC may not raise revenue from broadcasting
advertisements or from commercial sponsorship
of programmes on its public service channels. It
must not give publicity to any firm or organised
interest except when this is necessary in providing
effective and informative programmes. It does,
however, cover sponsored sporting and artistic
events. Advertising and sponsorship are allowed
on all commercial television and radio services,
subject to controls. The ITC and the Radio
Authority operate codes governing advertising
standards and programme sponsorship, and can
impose penalties on broadcasters that do not
comply.
Advertisements on independent television and
radio are broadcast in breaks during programmes
as well as between programmes, and must be
distinct and separate from them. Advertisers are
not allowed to influence programme content.
Political advertising and advertisements for
betting (other than the National Lottery, the
football pools, bingo and amusement arcades) are
prohibited. All tobacco advertising is banned on
television and radio. Religious advertisements may
be broadcast on commercial radio and television,
provided they comply with the guidelines issued
by the ITC and the Radio Authority.
Television advertising
Television advertising in Britain began in 1955. The
first commercial was for Gibbs SR toothpaste. The
presenter commercial, with a celebrity endorsing the
virtues of a particular product, became a standard
format. In the 1970s there was a change of emphasis
in advertising techniques, with viewers being invited
to share in the lifestyles and values of the characters
using the product on screen. In the 1990s advertising
became increasingly sophisticated as budgets grew.
Companies spent £4.1 billion in 2001 on the
purchase of TV advertising. Making TV advertisements
has also become an established training ground for a
number of successful film producers.
Sponsorship in independent broadcasting
In return for their financial contribution, sponsors
receive a credit associating them with a particular
237
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
programme. The ITC’s Code of Programme
Sponsorship and the Radio Authority’s Advertising
and Sponsorship Code aim to ensure that sponsors
do not exert influence on the editorial content of
programmes and that sponsorships are made clear
to viewers and listeners. News and current affairs
programmes on television may not be sponsored.
References to sponsors or their products must be
confined to the beginning and end of a programme
and around commercial breaks; on television the
references must not appear in the programme itself.
All commercial radio programmes, other than news
bulletins and any news desk presentation, may be
sponsored.
The ITC permits masthead programming
(programmes with the same title as a magazine
and made or funded by its publishers) on all UK
commercial television services.
Audience research
The BBC and the commercial sector are required
to monitor the state of public opinion about the
programmes and advertising that they broadcast.
This is done through the continuous
measurement of the size and composition of
audiences and their opinions of programmes. For
television, this work is undertaken through BARB
(the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board). Joint
research is undertaken for BBC radio and for
commercial radio by RAJAR (Radio Joint
Audience Research).
The press
The UK has a long tradition of a free and often
outspoken press. Before the emergence of
broadcast media, newspapers were for many the
principal means of keeping up to date with the
news.
On an average weekday it is estimated that around
55 per cent of people aged 15 and over in the UK
read a national morning newspaper (59 per cent
of men and 50 per cent of women in 2001/02).
Over 80 per cent of adults read a regional or local
newspaper every week. National papers have an
average (but declining) total circulation of some
12 million on weekdays and about 13 million on
Sundays. There are more than 1,300 regional and
local newspaper titles.
While newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party, they can
express obvious political leanings in their editorial
coverage, which may derive from proprietorial and
other non-party political influences. There are
around 100 regional press publishers - ranging
from those owning just one title (about half of
them) to a few controlling more than 100 each.
In addition to sales revenue, newspapers and
periodicals earn considerable amounts from
advertising. Indeed, the press is the largest
advertising medium in the UK. The British press
receives no subsidies from the State.
The national press
The national press consists of ten morning daily
papers and ten Sunday papers. At one time
London’s Fleet Street area was the centre of the
industry, but now all the national papers have
moved their editorial and printing facilities to
other parts of London or away from the capital
altogether. Editions of many papers, such as the
Financial Times, Sun, Guardian and Daily Mirror,
are also printed in other countries.
National newspapers are often described as
broadsheet or tabloid papers on the basis of
differences in style and content. Many newspapers
have colour pages and most produce extensive
supplements as part of the Saturday or Sunday
edition, with articles on personal finance, travel,
gardening, home improvement, food and wine,
fashion and other leisure topics. Increasing
competition from other media in the delivery of
news, information and entertainment has had an
effect on the national press, with a gradual decline
in circulation discernible for many titles.
Most national newspaper groups have set up
Internet websites, building on editorial, directory
and advertising services, to develop networks of
additional special interest sites to cater for a
growing readership.
Regional newspapers
Most towns and cities throughout the UK have
their own regional or local newspaper. These
range from morning and evening dailies to
Sunday papers and others which are published
just once a week. They mainly include stories of
regional or local interest, but the dailies also cover
national and international news, often looked at
from a local viewpoint. In addition, they provide a
valuable medium for local advertising. Circulation
figures for the period July-December 2001
indicate that the regional press sells nearly
238
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
41 million paid-for newspapers and distributes
over 29 million issues of free titles each week.
Over 90 per cent of local and regional titles are
now available online.
London has one paid-for evening paper, the
Evening Standard. Its publisher (Associated
Newspapers) also produces a free daily newspaper,
London Metro, launched in 1999. There are also
local weekly papers for every district in Greater
London; these are often different local editions of
one centrally published paper.
Around 650 free distribution newspapers, mostly
weekly and financed by advertising, are published
in the UK. Top free weekly titles include the
Manchester Metro News, Nottingham & Long Eaton
Topper and Edinburgh Herald & Post.
There is a broadly based daily and weekly
newspaper industry in Scotland covering local,
Scottish and UK as well as international issues.
The Daily Record has the highest circulation and
there are also broadsheet newspapers including
the Scotsman (based in Edinburgh) and the Herald
(in Glasgow). The press in Wales includes Welsh-
language and bilingual papers; Welsh community
newspapers receive an annual grant as part of the
Government’s wider financial support for the
Welsh language. Newspapers from the Irish
Republic, as well as the British national press, are
widely read in Northern Ireland.
Many newspapers and magazines in the UK are
produced by minority ethnic communities. Most
are published weekly, fortnightly or monthly. A
Chinese newspaper, Sing Tao, the Urdu Daily Jang
and the Arabic Al-Arab, however, are dailies. Afro-
Caribbean newspapers include The Gleaner, The
Voice, New Nation and Caribbean Times, each
published weekly. The Asian Times is an English
language weekly for people of Asian descent.
Publications also appear in other languages,
particularly Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi.
The fortnightly Asian Trader is a successful
business publication, while Cineblitz International
targets those interested in the South Asian film
industry.
The periodical press
There are around 9,000 separate periodical
publications that carry advertising. They are
generally classified as either ‘consumer’ titles,
offering readers leisure-time information and
entertainment, or ‘business and professional titles,
which provide people with material of relevance
to their working lives. Within the former category,
there are general consumer titles, which have a
wide appeal, and specialist titles, aimed specifically
at groups of people with particular interests, such
as motoring, sport or music. A range of literary
and political journals, appearing monthly or
quarterly, caters for a more academic readership.
There are also many in-house and customer
magazines produced by businesses or public
services for their employees and/or clients.
Press institutions
Trade associations include:
■ the UK Publishing Media, representing those
involved in local, regional and national
newspapers and publishers of business,
professional and consumer magazines;
■ the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society;
■ the Scottish Newspaper Publishers
Association; and
■ the Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers.
Other organisations representing the views of
those working in the media include:
■ the Society of Editors;
■ British Society of Magazine Editors;
■ National Union of Journalists;
■ Graphical Paper and Media Union;
■ Foreign Press Association; and
■ the Press Association, the national news
agency of the UK and Irish Republic.
A number of other British and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and
there are smaller agencies based in other British
cities. Most regional agencies are members of the
National Association of Press Agencies.
Press Complaints Commission
A policy of press self-regulation, rather than
statutory control or a law of privacy, operates in
the UK. The Press Complaints Commission, a
non-statutory body whose 16 members are drawn
from both the public and the industry, deals with
complaints about the content and conduct of
239
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
newspapers and magazines, and operates a Code
of Practice agreed by editors covering inaccuracy,
invasion of privacy, harassment and
misrepresentation by the press. The Commission’s
jurisdiction also extends to online versions of
newspaper and magazine titles by publishers that
already subscribe to the Code.
In 2001 the Commission received 3,033
complaints, a 36 per cent increase on the previous
year. Over half (56 per cent) of the complaints
related to national newspapers, 26 per cent to
regional newspapers, 7 per cent to newspapers
specific to Scotland, 4 per cent to magazines and
the remaining 7 per cent to publications in
Northern Ireland and to agencies. Most
complaints breaching the Code are resolved by
editors following the intervention of the
Commission. It had to adjudicate on just 41
complaints - upholding 19 and rejecting 22.
The press and the law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and newspaper
proprietors, editors and journalists are subject to
the law in the same way as any other citizen.
However, certain statutes include sections which
apply to the press. There are laws governing the
extent of newspaper ownership in television and
radio companies (see below), the transfer of
newspaper assets, and the right of press
representatives to be supplied with agendas and
reports of meetings of local authorities.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce the
printer’s imprint (the printer’s name and address)
on all publications, including newspapers.
Publishers are legally obliged to deposit copies of
newspapers and other publications at the British
Library (see page 224).
Publication of advertisements is governed by
wide-ranging legislation, including public health,
copyright, financial services and fraud legislation.
Legal restrictions are imposed on certain types of
prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets and
defamation are also relevant to the press. A
newspaper may not publish anything which might
influence the result of judicial proceedings. The
unauthorised acquisition and publication of
official information in such areas as defence and
international relations, where such unauthorised
disclosure would be harmful, are offences under
the Official Secrets Acts. These are restrictions on
publication generally, not just through the printed
press. Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Advertising practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such as
newspapers, magazines, posters, sales promotions,
cinema, direct mail, and electronic media (such as
CD-ROM and the Internet) is regulated by the
Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA
is an independent body whose role is to ensure
that advertisers conform to the British Codes of
Advertising and Sales Promotion. These require
that advertisements and promotions are legal,
decent, honest and truthful; are prepared with a
sense of responsibility to the consumer and
society; and respect the principles of fair
competition generally accepted in business.
The ASA monitors compliance with the Codes
and investigates complaints received. Pre¬
publication advice is available to publishers,
agencies and advertisers from the Committee of
Advertising Practice. If an advertisement is found
to be misleading or offensive, the ASA can ask the
advertiser to change or remove it. Failure to do so
can result in damaging adverse publicity in the
ASA’s monthly report of its judgements, the
refusal of advertising space by publishers, and the
loss of trading privileges. Advertisers found guilty
of placing irresponsible or offensive posters can
face a two-year period of mandatory pre-vetting.
The ASA can also refer misleading advertisements
to the Director General of Fair Trading (see page
341), who has the power to seek an injunction to
prevent their publication.
Media ownership
Legislation in 1990 laid down rules enabling the
ITC and Radio Authority to keep ownership of the
broadcasting media widely spread and to prevent
undue concentrations of single and cross-media
ownership, in the broader public interest. The
Broadcasting Act 1996 relaxed those rules, both
within and across different media sectors, to
reflect the needs and aspirations of the industry
against the background of accelerating
technological change, by:
■ allowing for greater cross-ownership between
newspaper groups, television companies and
240
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
radio stations, at both national and regional
levels; and
■ establishing ‘public interest’ criteria by which
the regulatory authorities can assess and
approve (or disallow) mergers or acquisitions
between newspapers and television and radio
companies.
The 1996 Act overturned the rule that no one
company could own more than two of the ITV
(Channel 3) licences; instead, a new limit was set
whereby no company could control franchises
covering more than 15 per cent of the total
television audience. Local newspapers with more
than a 50 per cent share of their market may now
own a local radio station, providing at least one
other independent local radio station is operating
in that area. An additional regulation is the Office
of Fair Trading’s limit of 25 per cent on any
company’s share of television advertising revenue.
Newspaper transfers and mergers are subject to
the consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, usually after reference (where the total
paid-for daily circulation of newspapers owned by
the proprietors involved is 500,000 or more) to the
Competition Commission.
Relaxing the media ownership rules
Proposals for changes in media ownership rules
included in the draft Communications Bill are:
■ scrapping those rules preventing single
ownership of ITV and more than one national
commercial radio licence;
■ not allowing any newspaper group with over
20 per cent of the national market a significant
stake in ITV;
■ the introduction of a parallel regional rule
preventing anyone owning all the newspapers
and the regional ITV licence in any region or
major city; and
■ the introduction of a scheme to ensure that at
least three commercial local or regional media
voices exist in addition to the BBC in almost
every local community.
Telecommunications
Turnover of the UK telecommunications services
sector grew by 8 per cent in 2001 to £45.4 billion.
In 2002, 163 service providers held a public
telecommunications operator licence, and 62
providers held a cable licence.
Telephone services
Telephone calls from fixed links were 22 per cent
higher in 2001, at 300 billion call minutes, than in
2000 (see Table 17.2). This mainly reflects a big
increase in Internet call volumes during the year,
whereas voice call volumes were down. Oftel
(see page 242) estimates that Internet calls now
account for 44 per cent of fixed call volumes. A
telephone is one of the most popular consumer
durable goods in the home. According to Oftel,
around 95 per cent of households have a fixed
telephone, while a further 4 per cent of
households are thought to use a mobile phone
instead. However, more existing customers are
installing second lines in their home, often for
Internet use, and 5 per cent of households have
more than one fixed line. There are 35.3 million
fixed lines, but since October 2000 there have been
more mobile subscribers than fixed lines.
BT, which became a private sector company in
1984, remains the biggest fixed-line UK operator,
although competitors have increased their share
of the market, especially the business market.
BT runs one of the world’s largest public
telecommunications networks, including about 29
million exchange lines. Turnover from continuing
businesses in 2001/02 totalled £18.4 billion. In
2001 it demerged its BT Wireless operations,
including its mobile phone operations, to form a
separate company, MMO,.
The two main cable operators are ntl and
Telewest. By the end of April 2002 cable operators
had installed around 5.2 million telephone lines in
the UK.
A variety of new telecommunications services has
emerged. For example, many companies offer
their customers information services using 0845
and 0800 telephone numbers - over 100 operators
supply such services to companies. In September
2001 Oftel gave the go-ahead for the expansion of
directory enquiry (DQ) services, currently
provided mainly by BT through numbers such as
192. In May 2002 a lottery was held to assign new
six-digit DQ numbers among operators, and
around 300 numbers were allocated. Services
using the new numbers are due to be launched in
October 2002, with the existing numbers being
withdrawn by August 2003.

Mobile communications
At the end of 2001 there were some 44.9 million
mobile phone users in the UK, 12 per cent more
than a year earlier. Call volumes are continuing to
rise, but at a slower rate as the market reaches
maturity. Text messaging is growing in popularity,
and the volume of text messages handled by
cellular network operators grew by 56 per cent in
2001. About 69 per cent of subscribers at the end
of 2001 were using pre-paid packages.
The four network suppliers in the UK are Orange
(part of France Telecom), MM02, Vodafone and
T-Mobile (a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom and
formerly known as One 2 One), with 12.4 million,
11.1 million, 11.0 million and 10.4 million
subscribers respectively at the end of 2001. There
are also around 50 independent service providers.
Vodafone is one of the worlds largest mobile
phone operators. It had over 101 million
customers worldwide through its operations in
28 countries in March 2002.
The next development in mobile phone services
will be the ‘third generation’ services, which will
provide users with high-speed access to the
Internet, e-mail facilities, video conferencing and
access to a large number of information services.
Five operators have licences in the UK: the four
network operators, together with Hutchison 3G.
Services are expected to begin later in 2002 and to
become widely available in 2003.
Regulation
Oftel (the Office of Telecommunications), a non-
ministerial government department headed by the
Director General of Telecommunications, is the
independent regulatory body for the
telecommunications industry. It promotes
competition in telecommunications networks and
services, and carries out regular reviews of
markets. It is encouraging greater broadband and
narrowband Internet access. During 2002/03 Oftel
will be undertaking work in preparation for the
proposed new Office of Communications (see
page 236), which would take over its functions.
In April 2002 the European Commission set out a
new European regulatory framework for European
electronic communications. The framework is
contained in four EC directives, covering all
telecommunications and broadcasting networks in
the EU, and will take effect in each Member State
in July 2003. Before implementation, country
regulators will be reviewing the
telecommunications markets to assess the need for
regulation, and in the UK Oftel will be conducting
an intensive examination of market competition.
The Internet
The Internet plays an increasingly important role
in the provision and distribution of information
and entertainment. Broadly speaking, it is a loose
collection of computer networks around the world
and links thousands of academic, government and
public computer systems, giving access to a wealth
of stored information and other resources. No one
owns the Internet and there is no centralised
controlling or regulating body.
The use of the Internet in the UK is growing
rapidly (see Figure 17.3). According to the ONS
Expenditure and Food Survey, in the first quarter
of 2002 an estimated 10.7 million households
(42 per cent) in the UK could access the Internet
from home, over three times the number in the
first quarter of 1999. Nearly all access the Internet
through a home computer, although a small
proportion access the Internet in another way,
242
Social and cultural affairs
17 The media and communications
such as through digital television or a mobile
phone. Many people use the Internet at work, in
education establishments and in libraries; 99 per
cent of secondary schools and 96 per cent of
primary schools in England are connected to the
Internet.
A growing number of homes and businesses are
using high-speed broadband connections to the
Internet. According to Oftel, there were over
700,000 such connections in the UK by the
beginning of July 2002. Over 20,000 broadband
connections are being added a week.
According to the National Statistics Omnibus
Survey, 55 per cent of adults in Great Britain had
accessed the Internet at least once by April 2002,
equivalent to 25 million adults. Over

Index of Internet Connectivity
The ONS has developed a new Index of Internet
Connectivity. In the 12 months to June 2002 the
number of subscriptions to the Internet in the UK
rose by 17 per cent. Dial-up connections accounted
for 94 per cent in June 2002 and permanent
connections 6 per cent, although the latter are
growing very rapidly. The proportion of subscriptions
using free access has been falling and in June 2002
represented 30 per cent of subscriptions, while those
paying a fixed rate for unmetered access has been
growing and accounted for 34 per cent; a further 19
per cent used billed access for call minutes.

There are over 700 Internet Service Providers
(ISPs), of which BT has the biggest market share
(23 per cent in May 2002), followed by Freeserve
and AOL (20 per cent each).
The BBC's Internet, interactive and new media
offerings were renamed BBCi in November 2001 to
provide a single gateway to the BBC's web,
interactive TV and hand-held computer services. It is
estimated that over 6 million people are regular
users of the BBCi website {www.bbc.co.uk), which
was launched in 1997 and now offers more than
1 million pages of content, including news, sport,
weather and a wide range of other topics.

17 The media and communications
With the rapid growth in the Internet, many UK
public and private sector bodies have established
websites containing information about their
operations and services provided. Two of the main
government websites are the UK online Citizen
Portal providing a single point of entry to
government information and services,
www.ukonline.gov.uk, and the National Statistics
website (www.statistics.gov. uk).
Postal services
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue adhesive
postage stamps as proof of advance payment for
mail. Under the Postal Services Act 2000, the Post
Office ceased to be a statutory authority and its
business was transferred to a successor company,
Consignia pic, wholly owned by the Government.
Consignia (www.consignia.com) serves its UK
customers through three main operations - Royal
Mail, Parcelforce Worldwide and Post Office Ltd -
and employs some 220,000 people. The Act gave
Consignia greater commercial freedom, while
introducing through licensing the requirement to
provide a universal postal service throughout the
UK, involving the daily delivery and collection of
mail at a uniform, affordable price.
In June 2002 Consignia announced a pre-tax loss
of £1.1 billion, together with a three-year renewal
plan which involves a reduction of around 30,000
in its workforce. It also announced its intention to
change the corporate name to Royal Mail Group
pic by the end of 2002.
Competition and regulation
Under the 2000 Act, a new independent regulator,
the Postal Services Commission (known as
‘Postcomm’), was established. Following
consultation, Postcomm announced in May 2002
a timetable for introducing competition in respect
of items weighing less than 350 grams and costing
less than £1 to post. The Royal Mail used to have a
monopoly of such items, but is now licensed by
Postcomm to provide these services. Competition
will be introduced in three stages:
■ from 1 January 2003 bulk mail above 4,000
items per mailing (from a single user at a
single site in a similar format) will be opened
to competition - this market is estimated to
be worth around £1.4 billion a year and
represents about 30 per cent of the UK letter
market by value;
■ from 1 April 2005 the bulk mail threshold
will be adjusted to open up a total of 60 per
cent of the market by value; and
■ from 1 April 2007 all restrictions on market
entry will be abolished.
Postcomm is also seeking to adopt a ‘light touch’
regulatory regime for other licensed operators. By
July 2002 it had issued ten interim short-term
licences. Interim licences will be replaced by long¬
term standard licences from January 2003.
Consignia's operations
Royal Mail delivers to 27 million addresses in the
UK, handling around 82 million items each
working day. In 2001/02 it processed more than
20.6 billion inland letters and 628 million
outgoing international letters. The volume of mail
has continued to grow despite competition from
other forms of communication. Mail is collected
from over 110,000 posting boxes, and from Post
Office branches and large postal users. The UK
postcode system allows mechanised sorting down
to part of a street on a delivery round and, in
some cases, to an individual address.
Parcelforce Worldwide provides a door-to-door
overnight delivery service throughout the UK and
an international service to 239 countries and
territories. Express services are available to over
220 countries and territories. It handles 150
million packages a year and is modernising its
handling facilities.
The UK network of some 17,500 Post Office
branches (of which around 600 are directly run by
Post Office Ltd) handles a wide range of
transactions, with a total value of over £150
billion in 2001/02. It acts as an agent for Royal
Mail and Parcelforce Worldwide, government
departments and local authorities. Post Office
branches also provide banking services for six UK
banks as well as National Savings and Investments,
and Post Office Ltd is developing its provision of
personal banking services.
About 28 million customers visit a Post Office
branch each week, with 16 million using them to
collect benefit payments. However, this business is

Social and cultural affairs

expected to decline from April 2003 when new
arrangements start to take effect which will mean
that benefits will be paid directly into bank
accounts. Under new universal banking services
(see page 454), benefit recipients and pensioners
can continue to have their money paid in cash at
their local Post Office branch, and a number of
banks will be making their basic bank accounts
accessible through Post Office branches. A
restructuring programme is expected to reduce the
urban network of 9,000 offices by around 3,000.

Sport is a popular leisure activity. According to the
results from the ONS UK 2000 Time Use Survey,
about 80 per cent of the population reported
doing some type of physical activity in the four
weeks prior to the survey. The top three activities
reported were walking for at least 2 miles (3.2 km)
or 1 hour, by 12 per cent of respondents,
swimming (9 per cent) and keep fit (7 per cent).
The time use diaries of participants in the survey
showed that more time was spent in sports and
physical activities (an average of 16 minutes
a day) than in watching sport on television
(4 minutes a day).
Commonwealth Games
The Commonwealth Games were held in
Manchester in July and August 2002 and attracted
about 5,250 athletes from 72 Commonwealth
nations and dependencies who participated in 14
individual sports and three team sports. This was the
largest multi-sport event ever held in the UK. The
centrepiece of the new facilities for the Games was
the £110 million City of Manchester Stadium,
funded by Manchester City Council and Sport
England. Its seating capacity for the Games was
38,000. After the Games extra seating will be added
to raise capacity to 48,000 and from 2003 the
stadium will be the new home for Manchester City
Football Club. The Manchester Aquatic Centre,
costing £32 million, was also built for the Games
and hosted the swimming and diving events.

UK sportsmen and sportswomen hold over
50 world titles in a variety of sports, including
athletics, professional boxing, rallying, rowing,
sailing, snooker and squash. In 2001 able-bodied
UK athletes won 76 medals at world and European
championships, while athletes with disabilities
won 167 medals at this level.
Major events
Many important sporting events are held every
year in the UK, including the Wimbledon Lawn
Tennis Championships, the FA Cup Final, the
Open Golf Championship and the Grand National
steeplechase. Major events in the UK in 2002
included the Commonwealth Games in
Manchester and the European Champions League
Final at Hampden, Scotland’s national football
stadium. Among the international events to be
staged in the UK in 2003 are the World Indoor

fishing and sea fishing. Coarse fishing is the
biggest of the three governing bodies, with around
200,000 members. Each discipline organises
competitions. The rivers and lochs in Scotland,
and the lakes and clear rivers in Wales and
Northern Ireland are the main areas for salmon
and trout fishing.
Athletics
In the UK athletics incorporates many activities,
including track and field events, cross-country
and road running, race walking, and fell and hill
running. Mass participation events, notably
marathons and half marathons, are very popular.
Many runners are sponsored, raising considerable
amounts for charities and other good causes.
The largest UK marathon is the London Marathon
each April, with over 32,000 runners competing in
the 2002 event. The Great North Run, a half
marathon, takes place between Newcastle upon
Tyne and South Shields each autumn.
The governing body for the sport is UK Athletics
(www.nkathletics.net). It has made successful bids
to host major championships, including the World
Indoor Championships, which will be held at
Birmingham in 2003, and the European Cross
Country Championships, to be held in Edinburgh
in 2003.
The 2002 London Marathon featured record-
breaking performances in both the men's and the
women's events. In the men's event, Khalid
Khannouchi of the United States broke the world
marathon record, winning in 2 hours 5 minutes 38
seconds. Paula Radcliffe of the UK, in her first
marathon, recorded the second fastest time by a
woman. Her winning time (2-18-56) was the
fastest ever time set in a race without the
assistance of male pacemakers and the quickest
time for a first marathon.
In October 2001 Paula Radcliffe retained her
world half-marathon championship in Bristol,
and in March 2002 her 8 km world cross-country
title in Dublin. In August 2002 she won the 10,000
metres at the European Championships in
Munich, one of seven gold medals won by UK
athletes. British track and field athletes held world
records in two events in mid-2002: Jonathan
Edwards in the triple jump and Colin Jackson in
the 110 metre hurdles.
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the Badminton
Association of England and the Scottish, Welsh
and Irish (Ulster Branch) Badminton Unions. The
Badminton Association of England
(www.baofe.co.uk) has a coach education system
to develop coaches for players of all levels and a
development department with a network of part-
time county development officers.
The All England Badminton Championships,
staged at the National Indoor Arena in
Birmingham, is one of the world’s leading
tournaments. Birmingham is also staging the 2003
World Badminton Championships in May, with
around 700 competitors from 50 countries.
Basketball
Over 3 million people participate in basketball in
the UK. The English Basketball Association
(England Basketball) is the governing body in
England, with similar associations in Wales,
Scotland and Ireland (Ulster Branch). All the
associations are represented in the British and
Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as the
co-ordinating body for the UK and the Irish
Republic.
The leading clubs play in the British Basketball
League and the National Basketball League, which
cover four divisions for men and two for women,
while there are also leagues for younger players in
the RAF Junior/Cadet League and the Passerelle
competition. Mini-basketball has been developed
for players under the age of 12. Wheelchair
basketball for people with disabilities is played
under the same rules, with a few basic adaptations,
and on the same court as the running game.
England Basketball (www.englandbasketball.co.uk)
runs various development schemes for young
people which aim to increase participation and
improve the quality of basketball. With support
from National Lottery funds, some 10,000
outdoor basketball goals have been installed in
parks and play areas in England. An outdoor
basketball initiative has also been established in
Northern Ireland.
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn flat green
(outdoor and indoor) and crown green. About

Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
6,000 flat green outdoor lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish
Bowling Associations, which, together with the
Women’s Bowling Associations for the four
countries, play to the laws of World Bowls. Crown
green, indoor, English bowls federation and short
mat bowls have their own separate associations.
The World Bowls Tour now organises bowls at the
professional level. A new single world governing
body, World Bowls Ltd, has been set up, with
headquarters in Edinburgh. The 2004 World
Bowls Championship will be held at Northfield
in Ayr.
At the 2002 world indoor championships, held in
Hopton-on-Sea (Norfolk), Tony Allcock won the
singles title for the third time, while Hugh Duff
and Paul Foster won the pairs title.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the rules
established by the Marquess of Queensberry in
1865. In the UK boxing is both amateur and
professional, and strict medical regulations are
applied in both.
There are separate amateur boxing associations in
England, Scotland and Wales, and boxing in
Northern Ireland is controlled by the Irish
Amateur Boxing Association (Ulster Provincial
Council). The associations organise amateur
boxing championships as well as training courses
for referees and coaches.
Professional boxing in the United Kingdom is
controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control
(www.bbbofc.com). The Board appoints referees,
timekeepers, inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed, and that contests take place under
carefully regulated conditions.
In mid-2002 the UK had three world champions
(as recognised by organisations of which the
British Boxing Board of Control is a member).
Lennox Lewis retained his world heavyweight
titles in June 2002 when he knocked out Mike
Tyson of the United States in the eighth round of
their contest in Memphis, Tennessee. Joe Calzaghe
successfully defended his World Boxing
Organisation (WBO) super-middleweight title at
the Cardiff International Arena in April 2002.
Johnny Nelson is the WBO world cruiserweight
champion.
Chess
There are local chess clubs and leagues throughout
the UK, and chess is also played widely in schools
and other educational establishments. Domestic
competitions include the British Championships,
the National Club Championships and the County
Championships. The Hastings Chess Congress,
which started in 1895, is the world’s longest
running annual international chess tournament.
A number of UK chess players, including Michael
Adams and Nigel Short, feature among the world’s
grand masters.
The governing bodies are the British Chess
Federation (www.bcf.org.uk), which is responsible
for chess in England and for co-ordinating activity
among the home nations, the Scottish Chess
Association and the Welsh and Ulster Chess
Unions.
Cricket
The rules of cricket became the responsibility, in
the 18th century, of the Marylebone Cricket Club
(MCC), based at Lord’s cricket ground in north
London. The MCC still frames the laws today. The
England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)
(www.ecb.co.uk) administers men’s and women’s
cricket in England and Wales. The Scottish Cricket
Union (www.scu.org.uk) administers cricket in
Scotland. The Irish Cricket Union governs the
sport in Ireland, with both the Northern Cricket
Union and the North West Cricket Union as
constituent bodies.
There is a network of First Class cricket, minor
county cricket and club games with a variety of
leagues. Eighteen county teams play in the four-
day Frizzell County Championship and the one-
day Norwich Union League, both in two divisions.
Two other main one-day competitions are held:
the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy and the
Benson & Hedges Cup. The latter event will be
succeeded in 2003 by a new competition to be
In June 2002 the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy
fourth round match between Surrey and Glamorgan
became the highest scoring game in the history of
one-day cricket. Surrey's total of 438 for 5 in 50
overs was the biggest in one-day cricket, while the
Glamorgan response of 429 was the second highest
score. The Surrey batsman Alistair Brown hit 268
runs off 160 balls, the highest individual score in a
one-day match.

Each summer two visiting teams play Test cricket
against England in a number of five-day Test
Matches; a ten-match one-day triangular
competition, the NatWest Series, is also contested.
In 2002 the visiting teams were Sri Lanka and
India. The other Test-playing countries are
Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Pakistan,
South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe. A
team representing England usually tours one or
more of these countries outside the UK cricket
season. In mid-2002 England was ranked fifth in
the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings
of Test-playing nations.
Cycling
British Cycling (www.britishcycling.org.uk) has
17,000 members and 1,200 affiliated clubs, and is
the internationally recognised governing body for
British cycle sport. Wales and Northern Ireland
have separate federations affiliated to British
Cycling. Cycling Time Trials (www.rttc.org.uk) has
around 970 member clubs. In 2001 over 180,000
rides were completed in time trials in England and
Wales. CTC (www.ctc.org.uk), with 70,000
members, campaigns to improve cyclists’ rights
and representation, and offers advice on all aspects
of cycling except racing. Local CTC groups run
regional and national cycling events for riders of
all abilities. CTC Scotland, CTC Cymru and CTC
Northern Ireland region perform similar roles.
The British team finished second in the medals
table at the World Championships in Copenhagen
in September 2002. Individual gold medals were
won by Chris Hoy and Chris Newton, while Chris
Hoy, Craig McLean and Jamie Staff won the team
sprint event.
Equestrianism
Leading equestrian events are held at a number of
locations throughout the year. The Badminton
Horse Trials is one of the UK’s largest sporting
events, attracting around 250,000 spectators. The
major show jumping events include the Horse of
the Year Show, which in October 2002 will be held
for the first time at the National Exhibition Centre
in Birmingham, and the Hickstead Derby in West
Sussex.
The British Equestrian Federation (BEE)
(www.bef.co.uk) is the governing body of horse
sports in the UK. It co-ordinates the major policy
interests of common concern of its 12 member
organisations, which together represent a total of
over 165,000 competitive and recreational riders.
These associations act as the governing bodies of
the different sporting disciplines in the UK and
oversee the organisation of national events. The
British Horse Society, which includes Riding
Clubs, is responsible for promoting training, road
safety, rights of way and the welfare of horses,
while the Pony Club provides training for
children.
At the European three-day event championships
in Pau (France) in October 2001, the British team
of Jeanette Brakewell, William Fox-Pitt, Pippa
Funnell and Leslie Law retained the team title.
Pippa Funnell rode Supreme Rock to take the
individual title, repeating their 1999 victory. She
became the first rider to win the title twice on the
same horse. The same British team then won the
bronze medal in the three-day event at the World
Equestrian Games at Jerez in Spain in September
2002, and Jeanette Brakewell, riding Over to You,
won the silver medal in the individual event.
Exercise and fitness
Exercise and fitness covers a wide variety of
activities, including exercise to music, aqua
exercise, weight training and circuit training. The
Keep Fit Association (KFA) (www.keepfit.org.uk),
which has 900 teachers and a membership of
8,500, promotes fitness through movement,
exercise and dance for people of all ages and
abilities. Its certificated training scheme for
KFA teachers is recognised by local education
authorities. The KFA also offers professional
development in a number of specialist areas.
Autonomous associations serve Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Field sports
Field sports in the UK include hunting, shooting,
stalking, ferreting, falconry and hare coursing.
There are over 300 recognised packs of quarry
hounds in the UK, of which more than 180 are
foxhound packs recognised by the Masters of Fox
Hounds Association. Most hunts organise ‘point-
to-point’ race meetings (see page 253). The
Countryside Alliance promotes, among several
other issues, the interests of field sports.
Following the report in 2000 of the Committee of
Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and
250
Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
Wales, there have been a number of parliamentary
votes, most recently in March 2002 when the
House of Commons supported a ban on hunting
with dogs but the House of Lords rejected a ban.
The Government has initiated a six-month
consultation period, with hearings in public in
September 2002. Two key principles are being
addressed: the prevention of cruelty and the
concept of‘utility’, so that a specific form of
hunting would have to be useful for achieving a
specific purpose or purposes. The consultations
are to contribute to the preparation of a new Bill
that the Government proposes to bring forward
for Parliament to consider on further free votes.
In Scotland the Scottish Parliament has passed
legislation to ban hunting with dogs. This came
into force in August 2002.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. In England 314 clubs are
affiliated to the Football Association (FA)
(www.thefa.com) and about 42,000 clubs to
regional or district associations. The FA, founded
in 1863, and the Football League (www.football-
league.co.uk), founded in 1888, were both the first
of their kind in the world. In Scotland there are 79
full and associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered
clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish
Football Association (www.scottishfa.co.uk).
Founded in 1880, the Irish Football Association
(www.irishfa.com) is the fourth oldest in the world
and has 600 affiliated clubs.
In England the FA Premier League comprises 20
clubs. A further 72 professional clubs play in three
main divisions run by the Football League. Over
2,000 English League matches are played during
the season, from August to May. Three Welsh
clubs play in the Football League, while the
National League of Wales contains 18 mostly
semi-professional clubs. In Scotland 12 clubs play
in the Scottish Premier League, while a further 30
clubs play in the Scottish Football League, which
has three divisions. In Northern Ireland, 20 semi-
professional clubs play in the Irish Football
League. Attendance at English Feague matches in
2001/02 was about 27.7 million. The major
knock-out competitions are the FA Cup
(sponsored by AXA) and the Worthington Cup in
England, the Tennents Scottish Cup and the CIS
Insurance Cup in Scotland, the Irish Cup and the
Welsh FA Cup.
In England and Wales, licences issued by the
Football Licensing Authority (FLA) require all
clubs in the Premier League and those in the First
Division of the Football League to have all-seater
grounds. Clubs in the second and third divisions
of the Football League have to ensure that any
terracing for standing complies with the highest
safety standards, as outlined in guidance from
the FLA.
The FA will open a new National Football Centre
in Burton-on-Trent in 2003. The Football
Foundation, a partnership funding body including
the Government, the FA and the FA Premier
League, was established in 2001 and is seeking to
improve access to the sport for children and
amateurs. It has distributed over £11 million to
grass-roots football.
The Government works closely with the police,
football authorities and the governments of other
European countries to implement crowd control
measures. Under the Football (Disorder) Act 2000,
orders banning individuals from attending
football matches can be imposed for between two
and ten years. Anyone subject to a domestic or
international ban has to surrender his or her
passport when major international ‘away’ games
involving England are imminent. The 2002 FIFA
World Cup Finals were notable for the good
behaviour of fans, and there were no public order
problems involving England supporters.
Michael Owen, who plays for Liverpool, was voted
European Footballer of the Year in 2001. David
Beckham, who plays for Manchester United and is
the current England captain, was runner-up in the
FIFA World Player of the Year.
In the FIFA World Cup in 2002 England reached
the quarter-finals of the competition, with wins
over Argentina and Denmark before being beaten
by Brazil, the eventual winners, by 2 goals to 1.
Scotland and Ireland are jointly bidding to host
the 2008 European Football Championship.

Golf
Since 1897 the rules of golf have been
administered worldwide (excluding the United
States and Mexico) by The Royal and Ancient Golf
Club (R & A) (www.randa.org), which is situated
at St Andrews. Club professional golf is governed
by the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA)
(www.pga.org.uk) and tournament golf by the
European PGA Tour and the European Ladies
Professional Golfers’ Association. The home country
governing bodies for men’s amateur golf are
affiliated to the R & A and are represented on the
Council of National Golf Unions, which is the UK
co-ordinating body responsible for handicapping
and for organising home international matches.
Women’s amateur golf in Great Britain is governed
by the Ladies’ Golf Union.
The main tournament of the British golfing year is
the Open Championship, one of the world’s four
‘majors’. The Ryder Cup is played between male
professional golfers of Europe and the United States
every two years, although the 2001 event was
postponed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of
11 September in the United States. The Europe team
regained the Ryder Cup in September 2002 at The
Belfry, securing victory by IS'h-ll'h points.
Other important competitions include the World
Matchplay Championship at Wentworth; the
Walker Cup and Curtis Cup matches for men and
women amateurs respectively, played every two
years between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States; and the Solheim Cup for women
professionals, played between Europe and the
United States.
There are over 2,000 golf courses in the UK. The
most famous is the Old Course at St Andrews,
while others include Royal Lytham and St Anne’s,
Royal Birkdale and Muirfield (which staged the
2002 Open Championship).
Greyhound racing
Greyhound racing is one of the UK’s most
popular spectator sports, with about 4 million
spectators a year. The rules for the sport are drawn
up by the National Greyhound Racing Club
(NGRC), the sport’s judicial and administrative
body. The representative body is the British
Greyhound Racing Board.
Meetings are usually held three times a week at
each track, with at least ten races a meeting. The
main event of the year is the Greyhound Derby,
run in June at Wimbledon Stadium, London.
Tracks are issued with a betting licence by local
authorities. There are 31 major tracks that operate
under the rules of the NGRC and around 25
independent tracks.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into eight main disciplines:
men’s artistic and women’s artistic gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics, general
gymnastics, sports aerobics, trampolining, and
gymnastics and movement for people with
disabilities. The governing body for the sport is
British Gymnastics, to which 984 clubs are
affiliated. It is estimated that between 7 million
and 8 million schoolchildren take part in some
form of gymnastics every day as part of the
National Curriculum.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games, which take place
between May and September, cover a wide range
of athletic competitions, including running,
cycling and dancing. The heavyweight events are
the most popular and include throwing the
hammer, tossing the caber and putting the shot.
Over 70 events of various kinds take place
throughout Scotland, the most famous being the
annual Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the official
governing body responsible for athletic sports and
games at Highland and Border events in Scotland.
Hockey
Club hockey has been played in some form in
England since the 1830s. By the 1880s there were
several clubs playing regular matches in the
London area, and these came together to found
the Hockey Association in 1886. English Hockey
(www.hockeyonline.co.uk) governs men’s and
women’s hockey in England, and there are similar
single associations in Scotland (www.scottish-
hockey.org.uk), Wales and Northern Ireland.
However, English Hockey has experienced
financial problems, and in May 2002 its member
clubs voted to hand over the running of the sport
to a new limited company, Hockey England Ltd.
Cup competitions and leagues exist at national,
divisional or district, club and school levels, both
indoors (six-a-side) and outdoors, and there are
regular international matches and tournaments.

Horse racing
Horse racing takes two main forms - flat racing
and National Hunt (steeplechasing and hurdle)
racing - and there are meetings throughout the
year. There are 59 racecourses in Great Britain and
about 13,000 horses in training. Point-to-point
racing, restricted to amateur riders on horses
which are qualified by having gone hunting, takes
place between January and June.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the principal event in
the flat racing calendar. Other classic races are the
2,000 Guineas and the 1,000 Guineas, both held at
Newmarket; the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster). The meeting at Royal Ascot in June is
another significant flat racing event. The most
important National Hunt meeting is the National
Hunt Festival held at Cheltenham in March, which
features the Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle.
The Grand National, run at Aintree, near Liverpool,
since the 1830s, is the world’s most famous
steeplechase. The race is televised around the world,
with an estimated total audience of approximately
500 million in 150 countries in 2002.
The British Horseracing Board (BHB)
(www.bhb.co.uk) is the governing body for racing
and is responsible for strategic and financial
planning, the fixture list, race programmes,
relations with the Government and the betting
industry, and central marketing. The Jockey Club
is the regulatory authority and is responsible for
licensing, disciplinary matters and security.
In April 2002 Tony McCoy broke the record for the
number of winners in a season when he rode his
270th winner in a hurdle race at Warwick - his
eventual total for the 2001/02 National Hunt
season was 289. This broke the previous record,
achieved in 1947 by Sir Gordon Richards, still the
most successful UK jockey ever with 4,870 career
wins. In August 2002 Tony McCoy became the most
successful National Hunt jockey ever when he rode
his 1,700th winner, breaking the record previously
held by Richard Dunwoody.
Ice hockey
Ice hockey is a popular indoor sport, with over
2 million spectators each season. There are two
professional leagues, with seven teams in the Ice
Hockey Superleague and a further 12 teams in the

sport is particularly popular in Northern Ireland.
Ice-skating
Ice-skating has four main disciplines: ice figure
(single and pairs), ice dance, speed skating and
synchronised skating. Competitive participation in
ice-skating is concentrated among the under-25s,
and it is one of the few sports that attracts more
female than male participants. Recreational
skating is enjoyed by people in a wide range of
ages, and by a growing number of skaters with
various levels of disability. The governing body is
the National Ice Skating Association of UK Ltd.
The Association has 75 affiliated clubs and over
4,500 individual members. There are over 70 rinks
in the United Kingdom, including a new National
Ice Centre in Nottingham. The Centre has two
rinks and caters for many ice sports, including free
skating, ice dance, synchronised skating, ice
hockey and short track speed skating.
Martial arts
Various martial arts, mainly derived from the Far
East, are practised in the UK, such as judo, karate,
kendo, taekwondo and tang soo do. Judo is
popular not only as a competitive sport and self-
defence technique, but also as a means of general
fitness training. There is an internationally
recognised grading system, which is in operation
through the sport’s governing body, the British
Judo Association (www.britishjudo.org.uk).
Motor-car sports
Four-wheeled motor sport includes motor racing,
autocross, rallycross, rallying and karting. In
motor racing the Formula 1 Grand Prix World
Championship is the pinnacle of the sport. The
British Grand Prix takes place at Silverstone

UK race car constructors have enjoyed
outstanding success in Grand Prix, World Rally
and many other forms of racing. The UK
produces around 75 per cent of the world’s single¬
seat racing cars, including a large proportion of
the cars used in the US Indy and Champ Car
series. A survey, partly funded by the Department
of Trade and Industry and the Regional
Development Agencies and carried out in 2000 by
the Motorsport Industry Association, estimated
that the British motorsport engineering and
services industry generates an annual turnover of
£5 billion (of which exports account for over 50
per cent) and employs over 40,000 people in more
than 2,500 businesses.
Motorcycle sports
Motorcycle sports include road racing, moto-
cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag racing,
enduro (endurance off-road racing), hill climb

The representative body for climbers, hill walkers
and mountaineers in the United Kingdom is the
British Mountaineering Council (BMC)
{www.thebmc.co.uk), which works closely with the
Mountaineering Councils of Scotland and Ireland.
Their main areas of work include access and
conservation, training and the provision of advice
and information. The BMC estimates that the
number of active climbers is around 400,000.
There are over 300 mountaineering and climbing
clubs in the UK, and three National Centres for
mountaineering activities run by the Sports
Councils (see page 261).
Netball
Netball is the largest female team sport in
England, with 56,000 registered participants over
16 years old in over 3,500 clubs that are members
of the All England Netball Association (AENA).
Over 2,500 schools are members of AENA,
providing a playing base in schools of over
1 million. The sport is played almost exclusively
by women and girls, although male participation
has increased in recent years.
The AENA {www.england-netball.co.uk) is the

and Northern Ireland having their own
organisations. National competitions are staged
annually for all age groups, and England plays a
series of international matches against other
countries, both in England and overseas.
Rowing
Rowing is organised by many schools, universities
and rowing clubs throughout the UK and takes
place on inland waterways and on the coast. The
boats used range from singles and pairs to fours
and eights. The governing bodies are the Amateur
Rowing Association (ARA) {www.ara-rowing.org)
in England, with similar bodies in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The ARA is also the
governing body for representative international
teams for Great Britain, in World and Olympic
competition.
The Head of the River Race is the largest event of
its kind, with more than 420 eights racing in
procession on the Thames. Similar events are run
throughout the winter months for fours, pairs and
singles. The University Boat Race, between two
eights from Oxford and Cambridge, has been
rowed along the same course almost every year
since 1836. The National Championships are held

straight course of about 2.1 km.
At the World Championships in Seville in
September 2002 the British team won six medals,
including three gold medals. Matthew Pinsent and
James Cracknell successfully defended their men’s
coxless pairs title. The men’s coxed four - Tom
Stallard, Luka Grubor, Steve Trapmore and Kieran
West, coxed by Christian Cormack - and the
women’s lightweight coxless pair of Naomi
Ashcroft and Leonie Barron were the other gold
medallists.
Rugby league
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby union
(see below) of 22 clubs in the north of England,
where the sport is still concentrated. There are
30 professional clubs in the UK, with about 2,000
professional players, and some 400 amateur clubs
with a total of around 40,000 players.
The governing body of the professional game is
the Rugby Football League (www.rfl.uk.com),
while the amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association. The major
domestic club match of the season is the
Challenge Cup Final. Matches in the two main
leagues are played in the summer. The Tetley’s
Super League consists of 12 clubs - 11 from the
north of England and one from London - while
18 clubs play in the Northern Ford Premiership,
which is due to split into two divisions from 2003.
Rugby union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game)
originated at Rugby School in the first half of the
19th century. The sport is played under the
auspices of the Rugby Football Union (RFU)
(www.rfu.com) in England (the International
Rugby Board internationally) and parallel bodies
in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. In 2001 the RFU
and the Premiership Clubs in England formed a
joint venture, England Rugby Ltd, to manage their
international and professional game together. Each
of the four home unions has separate national
league and knock-out competitions for its
domestic clubs, while in 2001/02 the two
professional sides in Scotland played in a league
with Welsh clubs. From 2002/03 they have been
joined by a newly formed third Scottish
professional team and by teams from the four
Irish provinces to form the Celtic League. Leicester
were European club champions for a second
successive year when winning the Heineken Cup
in May 2002, defeating Munster in the final in the
Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.
The Six Nations Championship is contested by
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland (a team from
the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland), France
and Italy. Overseas tours are undertaken by the
national sides and by the British and Irish Lions,
a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.
Sailing
Sailing in the UK includes yacht and dinghy
racing and cruising, powerboat racing, motor
cruising, jet skiing and windsurfing on inland
and offshore waters. The RYA (Royal Yachting
Association) (www.rya.org.uk) is the national
governing body for boating in the UK and aims
to make boating in all its forms as accessible as
possible. The Association also includes RYA
Sailability, the charity for disabled sailors, and
administers the RYA Yachtmaster training scheme.
According to RYA, about 2.2 million people
participate in the sport. Among well-known
yachting events in the UK are Cowes Week and
the Fastnet Race.
Snooker
Snooker was invented by the British in India in
1875 and is played by approximately 7 million
people in the UK. British players have dominated
the major professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Championship, held at the Crucible Theatre in
Sheffield. In May 2002 Peter Ebdon won his first
world title, defeating the seven-times world
champion Stephen Hendry in the final by 18
frames to 17 in the closest finish for eight years.
The 2001 world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan also
won the UK Championship in York in December
2001 to become the fifth person to win the world
and UK titles in the same year.
World Snooker (www.worldsnooker.com) organises
professional events and holds the copyright for the
rules. The representative body for women is the
World Ladies’ Billiards and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets, which
was invented at Harrow School in the 1850s. The
governing body for squash in England is England
Squash (www.englandsquash.com), while there are
separate governing bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland (Ulster Branch). The British Open

Championships is one of the major world events
in the sport, and in April 2002 it was held in
Manchester.
The number of players in the UK is estimated at
over 1.5 million, of whom more than 500,000
compete regularly in inter-club league
competitions. There are nearly 9,000 squash
courts in England, provided mainly by squash
clubs, commercial organisations and local
authorities.
Peter Nicol is the current men’s world squash
champion. In January 2002 he regained the world
number one position when winning the Memorial
US Open in Boston, his third victory in this event.
Swimming
Swimming is a popular sport and form of exercise
for people from all age groups. Competitive
swimming is governed by the Amateur Swimming
Association (ASA) (www.britishswimming.org) in
England and by similar associations in Scotland
and Wales. Together these three associations form
the Amateur Swimming Federation of Great
Britain Ltd, which co-ordinates the selection of
Great Britain teams and organises international
competitions. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers and coaches who
hold certificates awarded mainly by the ASA.
Swimming in Northern Ireland falls under the
auspices of Swim Ireland.
Zoe Baker set a new world record for the 50 metre
breaststroke during the Commonwealth Games in
July 2002. She was one of 11 gold medallists from
the home countries in the swimming events at the
Commonwealth Games.
Table tennis
Table tennis originated in England in the 1880s.
Today it is played by all age groups, and in a variety
of venues, ranging from small halls to specialist,
multi-table centres. It is also a major recreational
and competitive activity for people with disabilities.
The governing body in England is the English Table
Tennis Association (www.etta.co.uk) and there is
also an English Schools Association. Separate
associations exist in Scotland, Wales and Ireland
(where the association covers both Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic).
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in England
in 1873 and the first championships were played
at Wimbledon in 1877. The governing body for
tennis in Great Britain is the Lawn Tennis
Association (LTA) (www.lta.org.uk), to which
Tennis Wales and Tennis Scotland are affiliated.
Tennis in Northern Ireland is governed by Tennis
Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held within the
grounds of the All England Club, are one of the
four tennis ‘Grand Slam’ tournaments. Prize
money totalled £8.8 million in 2002. Ihe club is in
the process of a major redevelopment programme.
The UK’s leading player is Tim Henman (a
Wimbledon semi-finalist in 1998, 1999, 2001 and
2002), who secured his ninth title on the main
tennis tour when winning in Adelaide (Australia)
in January 2002.
About 2.8 million people play tennis in the UK,
according to the latest LTA survey. There are
national and county championships, and national
competitions are also organised for schools. The
profits from the Wimbledon Championships -
£32 million in 2001 - are allocated to the LTA for
investing in British tennis. The LTA has a five-year
plan for developing the game and improving
tennis facilities in Great Britain, with the aim of
expanding participation and club membership,
improving coach education and producing more
world-class tennis players.
Winter sports
Skiing takes place in Scotland from December to
May and also at several English locations when
there is sufficient snow. The five established winter
sports areas in Scotland are Cairngorm, Glencoe,
Glenshee, the Lecht and Nevis Range. All have a
full range of ski-lifts, prepared ski-runs and
professional instructors. The governing body in
Scotland is Snowsport Scotland
(www.snsc.demon.co.uk).
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-slopes
throughout the UK. The British Ski and

Sports policy
A ‘Sports Cabinet’, headed by the Secretary of
State for Culture, Media and Sport and including
the ministers responsible for sport in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, is involved
in identifying strategic priorities for sport, which
is a devolved function.1
In February 2002 the Government announced that
the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation
Unit and the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS) would carry out a joint study
examining long-term sports policy. The project
team will develop an overall strategy for guiding
government decisions on sports policy, including
major events, and review the institutional
structure and financial arrangements in the
context of the Government’s wider objectives,
which include health, crime reduction and social
cohesion.
Features of the Government’s existing sports
policy are:
■ an increase in the budget for sport, with extra
funds to extend the network of School Sports
Co-ordinators (of whom there are over 700),
to help governing bodies with modernisation
and to support the UK Sports Institute (see
page 260);
■ the allocation of £750 million, through the
National Lottery’s New Opportunities Fund,
for improving sports facilities in schools in
the UK, with all these facilities being available
for use by the wider community;
■ investment of £130 million, under the Space
for Sport and Arts scheme, in building new
indoor sports and arts facilities in primary
schools in the most deprived areas of
England;
1 Most of the strategies and funding programmes in this section
relate to England, but there are usually similar programmes in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
■ the creation by 2005 of 250 Specialist Sports
Colleges, of which 101 are in operation and
a further 40 had been designated by June
2002; and
■ maintaining funding for elite sportsmen and
sportswomen.
Sporting excellence
As well as the Specialist Sports Colleges, two main
schemes are designed to promote sporting
excellence:
■ The World Class Performance Programme
provides support to the UK’s most talented
athletes to enable them to improve their
performance and win medals in major
international competitions.
■ The World Class Events Programme aims to
ensure that major international events can be
attracted to, and staged successfully in, the
UK. About £1.6 million a year is available to
help support the cost of bidding for, and
staging, events.
Sport on television and radio
Major sporting events (such as the Olympic
Games) receive extensive television and radio
coverage in the UK and are watched or listened to
by millions of people. Football matches attract
very high ratings, especially when the UK’s national
teams are involved in the final stages of
international tournaments. For example, around
15.8 million people (excluding those in pubs and
clubs) were estimated to have watched the quarter¬
final between England and Brazil in the 2002 FIFA
World Cup Finals. A number of other sports,
including rugby, horse racing, cricket and athletics,
also achieve high ratings figures. Several of the UK’s
leading sports events, such as the Grand National
and FA Premier League football matches (see pages
253 and 251 respectively), are watched on television
by viewers in many other countries.
Organisation and administration
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities and funding for sport
and recreation are largely channelled through five
sports councils:
■ the United Kingdom Sports Council,
operating as UK Sport;
257
Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
Protected coverage
In the Government's view, there are some leading
sporting occasions to which everyone should have
access. These are on a protected list (Group A) and
cannot be shown on subscription channels unless
they have first been offered to the UK's universally
available free-to-air broadcasters (the BBC, the ITV
network and Channel 4). Live coverage of events on
the Group B list may be shown by satellite and
cable channels on the condition that an acceptable
level of secondary coverage - a combination of
delayed coverage and edited highlights - is made
available to the universally available free-to-air
channels. The current list is:
Group A events (with full live coverage protected)
Olympic Games
FIFA World Cup football finals
European Football Championship finals
FA Cup Final
Scottish FA Cup Final
The Grand National
The Derby
Wimbledon Tennis Championships finals
Rugby League Challenge Cup Final
Rugby World Cup Final

Ryder Cup
Open Golf Championship
■ the English Sports Council, operating as
Sport England;
■ the Sports Council for Wales;
■ the Scottish Sports Council, operating as
sportscotland; and
■ the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
UK Sport takes the lead on those aspects of sport
and physical recreation that require strategic
planning, administration, co-ordination or
representation for the UK as a whole. Its main
functions include:
■ co-ordinating support to sports in which the
UK competes internationally (as opposed to
the four home countries separately);
■ tackling drug misuse in sport;
■ co-ordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to the UK; and
■ representing UK sporting interests overseas at
international level.
All the Sports Councils distribute Exchequer and
Lottery funds. UK Sport focuses on elite
sportsmen and sportswomen, while the home
country Sports Councils are more concerned with
the development of sport at the community level
by promoting participation, giving support and
guidance to providers of sports facilities, and
supporting the development of talented
sportsmen and women, including people with
disabilities. They also manage the National Sports
Centres (see page 261).
Sports governing bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400 independent
governing bodies. Some have a UK or Great
Britain structure, while others are constituted on
an individual home country basis. In Northern
Ireland almost half of the sports are part of an all-
Ireland structure, which covers both Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic. The functions of
governing bodies include drawing up rules,
holding events, regulating membership, selecting
and training national teams, and producing plans
for their sports. There are also organisations
representing people who take part in more
informal physical recreation, such as walking.
Most sports clubs in the UK belong to, or are
affiliated to, an appropriate governing body.
Governing bodies that receive funding from the
Sports Councils are required to produce
development plans, from the grass roots to the
highest competitive levels. In order to have access
to Lottery funds for their top athletes, they need
to prepare ‘world-class performance’ plans with
specific performance targets.

Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
A number of international federations have their
headquarters in the UK: the Commonwealth
Games Federation and federations for badminton,
billiards and snooker, bowls, cricket, curling, golf,
netball, sailing, squash, tennis and wheelchair
sports.
Other sports organisations
Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR)
The CCPR (www.ccpr.org.uk) is the largest sport
and recreation federation in the world, comprising
202 UK bodies and 64 English associations, most
of which are governing bodies of sport. The
British Sports Trust is the charity arm of the
CCPR that runs a volunteer sports leadership
programme, in which some 55,000 people
participated in 2001. The Scottish Sports
Association, the Welsh Sports Association and the
Northern Ireland Sports Forum are equivalent
associations to the CCPR. Their primary aim is to
represent the interests of their members to the
appropriate national and local authorities,
including the Sports Councils, from which they
may receive some funding.
British Olympic Association (BOA)
The BOA, comprising representatives of the
35 national governing bodies of Olympic sports,
organises the participation of British teams in the
Olympic Games, sets standards for selection and
raises funds. The BOA is supported by
sponsorship and by donations from the private
sector and the general public, and works closely
with UK Sport. It contributes to the preparation
of competitors in the period leading up to the
Games, such as arranging training camps, and
has programmes to support national governing
bodies and their athletes in areas such as
acclimatisation, psychology and physiology. Its
British Olympic Medical Centre at Northwick
Park Hospital in Harrow provides medical services
for competitors before and during the Olympics.
The BOA’s educational arm aims to educate
youngsters about the Olympic Games and the
Olympic movement.
Women in sport
UK Sport has set up the UK Co-ordinating Group
on Women in Sport, which held its first meeting
in November 2001. Its overall aim is to raise
participation by women in sport at all levels, from
grass-roots to high-performance, and increase the
number of women involved in coaching,
managing and administering sport.
The Women’s Sports Foundation (www.wsf.org.uk)
promotes opportunities for women and girls in
sport and active recreation. Its activities include
advising on key issues and campaigning for
changes in policy. Together with Sport England, it
has developed a national action plan on women’s
sport development.
Sport for people with disabilities
Sport for people with disabilities is organised by
a wide range of agencies in the UK. Some
organisations promote the needs of people with
a particular type of disability across a range of
sports. These include the British Amputee and Les
Autres Sports Association, British Blind Sport,
British Wheelchair Sports Foundation, Cerebral
Palsy Sport and the United Kingdom Sports
Association for People with Learning Disability.
The British Deaf Sports Council organises
sporting opportunities for people with hearing
impairment and co-ordinates British interests at
the World Deaf Games.
In addition, the English Federation of Disability
Sport, Disability Sport Cymru, Scottish Disability
Sport and Disability Sport Northern Ireland are
responsible for the general co-ordination and
development of sport for people with disabilities.
A number of sports already have a degree of
integration: archery, athletics, cricket, cycling,
equestrianism, football, judo, powerlifting/
weightlifting, rugby union, sailing, swimming and
wheelchair tennis/table tennis. The
Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002
(see page 246) was the first major sports event in
the world to include an integrated programme of
events for people with disabilities.
The British Paralympic Association (BPA) ratifies
selection, and funds and manages the Great Britain
Paralympic Team in the winter and summer
Paralympic Games. In May 2002 UK Sport
announced a £1.7 million investment programme
to support the British team for the 2004 Paralympic
Games in Athens, including multi-sport
preparation camps, to be held twice a year, to help
the athletes experience similar conditions and
climate to those expected in Athens.
Funding
National Lottery
Between 1994, when the National Lottery (see
page 263) started, and September 2001, 62 sports
259
Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
in the UK received funding and the Sports
Councils awarded nearly 17,000 grants worth
nearly £1.6 billion. Money has gone to improve
sporting opportunities, provide new sporting
facilities in schools (see page 257) and elsewhere,
support current and potentially future elite
performers, and to stage major events. For
example, in projects to improve sporting
opportunity, over £1 billion of Lottery funds have
been invested in over 3,300 community facilities
in England, while in Wales over 6,400 awards
totalling more than £89 million have been made
by the Sports Council for Wales.
Programmes to help sporting talent include:
■ sportscotland’s Talented Athlete Programme,
which provides financial support to top
performers and those with high potential -
by 31 March 2002 over 2,600 awards had
been made with a total value of about £10.2
million;
■ Sport England’s Active Sports Partnerships,
under which over £2 million has been
awarded for facilities and equipment,
targeting nine sports, including athletics,
basketball and rugby union, in a five-year
development programme aiming to help
young people to get more from their
involvement in sport; and
■ the Dragon Sport initiative, introduced by
the Sports Council for Wales to increase
after-school clubs and sporting
opportunities for primary schoolchildren
and to recruit parents to help organise after¬
school sport.
Sponsorship
Sport benefits from sponsorship, which may take
the form of financing specific events or
championships, such as horse races or cricket
leagues, or support for sports organisations or
individual performers. Motor sport and football
receive the largest amounts of private sponsorship.
Sponsorship is encouraged by a number of bodies,
including the Institute of Sports Sponsorship,
which comprises some 100 UK companies
involved in sponsoring sport.
SportsAid
SportsAid raises funds to help encourage and
support young people and disabled people with
sporting talent. Financial grants are provided on
an individual basis, with each application being
assessed on the criteria of talent and need. Those
receiving funds must usually be aged between
12 and 18, but there is no age limit for disabled
people. The Scottish Sports Aid Foundation,
SportsAid Cymru/Wales and the Ulster Sports and
Recreation Trust have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, set up by
the football pools promoters in 1991, funds
mainly small-scale projects in sport and the arts,
and has made awards to schemes benefiting over
100 sports. This initiative followed a reduction in
pools betting duty, made on the proviso that the
money forgone by the Government was paid into
the Foundation. In April 2002 the Government
abolished pools betting duty and replaced it with a
15 per cent tax on pools companies’ gross profits.
The Foundation will continue in its current form
at least until April 2004.
Sports facilities
The UK has a range of world-class sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports Centres,
operated by the home country Sports Councils. A
number of major facilities have been improved in
recent years, including the Millennium Stadium in
Cardiff, the Wimbledon tennis complex and
several football grounds. New facilities were built
in Manchester for the Commonwealth Games (see
page 246). In September 2002 the Football
Association announced the start of work on
a £757 million project to rebuild the football
stadium at Wembley (London), which will seat
90,000 and is due to open in 2006.
United Kingdom Sports Institute
The United Kingdom Sports Institute (UKSI) has
been set up under the strategic direction of UK
Sport and in partnership with the home country
Sports Councils, with funding mainly from the
National Lottery. It provides facilities and
integrated support services to elite athletes and
teams, and those with exceptional potential. Its
Athlete Career and Education (ACE UK)
programme is designed to enhance athletes
personal development and sporting performance.
All sports have access to the UKSI’s services,
although it concentrates on Olympic sports and
those minority sports that lack a commercial
element. The UKSI central services team is part
260
Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
of UK Sport and based in London. It co-ordinates
a network of regional centres in England and
national institutes in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
UKSI regional and national network
England
In England the UKSI network is managed by the
English Institute of Sport (EIS), part of Sport
England. The EIS, officially launched in May 2002,
consists of nine regional multi-sport sites,
together with 35 satellite centres. Four of the key
centres are based around National Sports Centres:
Crystal Palace (London), Bisham Abbey
(Berkshire), Lilleshall (Shropshire) and the
National Water Sports Centre at Holme
Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire. The other
network centres are based around the Don Valley
Stadium in Sheffield, Gateshead International
Stadium, Manchester Sports City, the University of
Bath, and Norwich Sports Park.
The EIS is investing £120 million in developing
sporting facilities. Its biggest single capital
investment is a £28 million project to improve
facilities at the Sheffield site, due for completion
in 2003. These facilities will include the National
Indoor Athletics Centre; the national netball
centre; special facilities for badminton, judo and
table tennis; and provision for sports science and
sports medicine.
Wales
The centre of the UKSI network in Wales is the
Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff, which is the
premier venue in Wales for top-level training and
for competition in many sports. The Institute,
which is run by the Sports Council for Wales,
has close links with other specialist facilities,
including the National Watersports Centre at Plas
Menai in north Wales, a centre of excellence for
sailing and canoeing; the national indoor athletics
centre at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff;
and the cricketing school of excellence at Sophia
Gardens, Cardiff. A National Swimming Centre
will open in Swansea in spring 2003 and shortly
afterwards a National Velodrome will open in
Newport.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre, in
Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, is run
by Sport England. It offers courses in canoeing,
rock climbing, mountaineering, orienteering,
skiing and most other mountain-based activities,
and is the UK’s leading training institution for
mountain instructors.
Scotland
The network supported by sportscotland
comprises the Scottish Institute of Sport, which
opened its new base at Stirling in May 2002, and
six area institutes. The institutes have provided
support for over 180 athletes in nine ‘core’ sports:
athletics, badminton, curling (including support
for the Winter Olympics gold medallists - see
page 256), football, golf, hockey, judo, rugby and
swimming.
The network also includes three National Sports
Centres, run by sportscotland, which provide
training and coaching facilities for a range of
sports: Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore, which
caters for outdoor sports, such as canoeing,
mountaineering, mountain biking, orienteering
and skiing; Inverclyde in Largs, which caters for
23 sports; and the Scottish National Water Sports
Centre on the island of Great Cumbrae in the
Firth of Clyde.
Northern Ireland
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has
announced a partnership with the University of
Ulster for the development of a Northern Ireland
network centre of the UKSI. This will involve
creating high-quality training facilities and
support services, primarily at the University’s
Jordanstown campus, with the establishment of
links with nearby facilities.
The Tollymore Mountain Centre in County
Down, run by the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland, offers courses in mountaineering, rock
climbing, canoeing and outdoor adventure.
Leadership and instructor courses leading to
nationally recognised qualifications are also
available.
Local facilities
Local authorities are the main providers of basic
sport and recreation facilities for the local
community, including indoor sports centres,
parks, lakes, playing fields, playgrounds, tennis
courts, natural and artificial pitches, golf courses
and swimming/leisure pools. Commercial facilities
include health and fitness centres, tenpin bowling
centres, ice-skating and roller-skating rinks,
squash courts, golf courses and driving ranges,
riding stables and marinas.

Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
There are an estimated 110,000 amateur sports
clubs in the UK. Some cater for indoor recreation,
but more common are those providing sports
facilities, particularly for bowls, cricket, football,
rugby, hockey, tennis and golf. The Government is
encouraging clubs to apply for charitable status
(see chapter 9), which offers tax reliefs and tax
exemption for fundraising income. For those clubs
that cannot, or do not wish to, become charities,
the 2002 Budget included a package of tax
measures giving clubs access to tax reliefs similar
to those available to charities.
The Government has also announced its intention
to allocate £20 million from the Capital
Modernisation Fund (see page 349) to provide
new or refurbished community sports facilities.
Support services
Coaching
The organisation sports coach UK works closely
with sports governing bodies, local authorities, and
higher and further education institutions.
Supported by the Sports Councils, it provides
a comprehensive range of services for coaches in all
sports. In 2001, some 30,000 coaches and
schoolteachers participated in its programmes.
A task force has reviewed coaching in England and
in July 2002 produced a report with proposals
designed to increase the pool of talented coaches
and to introduce a national coaching certificate. The
Government is to invest £25 million over the three
years from 2003/04 in the development of coaching.
Volunteering
Sport England has developed its Volunteer
Investment Plan, which aims to create a pool of
accredited volunteers working in sports clubs. In
April 2002 the DCMS Leadership and Volunteering
in School and Community Sport programme,
known as Step into Sport, began. The programme
will train up to 60,000 people aged 14 to 19 to act
as sports leaders in their schools and local sports
clubs. It is run by a consortium of the Youth Sport
Trust, the British Sports Trust (see page 259) and
Sport England. Up to 8,000 older volunteers will
train alongside the young volunteers. Some 10,000
volunteers assisted in the organisation of the
Commonwealth Games in July-August 2002.
Sports medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute of the
United Kingdom (NSMI) serves as the national
focus for all those concerned with sport and
exercise medicine. It aims to provide optimum
levels of safety and care in order to enhance the
ability of those engaged in exercise and sport from
grass-roots to international levels. The NSMI is
funded through contracts with the Sports
Councils and it also generates income from its
services, many of which are developed or delivered
through collaboration with other organisations.
Modern sports medicine facilities are being set
up as part of the UKSTs regional and national
network of world-class facilities and services to
elite athletes.
Sports science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of sport
is being promoted by the Sports Councils, in
collaboration with the BOA and sports coach UK,
in an effort to raise the standards of performance
of national squads. The type of support provided
may be biomechanical (human movement),
physiological or psychological.
Drug misuse
UK Sport aims to prevent doping and achieve
a commitment to drug-free sport and ethical
sporting practices. In January 2002 it launched
a national anti-doping strategy, in line with the
International Standard for Doping Control
endorsed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The
strategy calls on sports to publish a commitment
in their constitution to drug-free sport; inform
and, where relevant, test their athletes; publicise
targets and achievements; and establish an
independent disciplinary process. Many leading
sports in the UK, such as football, cricket and
rugby union, already comply with the strategy.
UK Sport’s Anti-Doping Directorate co-ordinates
an independent drugs-testing programme and is
responsible for reporting the results to the
appropriate governing body. In 2001/02 over
6,000 drug tests were conducted in over 40 sports,
of which 1.7 per cent of tests were reported to the
appropriate sports governing body for further
investigation. Nearly half of the 101 reports
concerned stimulants, of which a large proportion
were for prescribed substances for those suffering
from illnesses or allergies. In January 2002 UK
Sport launched a new online drug information
262
Social and cultural affairs
18 Sport and recreation
service to complement the existing information
provided for competitors and officials. The online
database draws on information from 102 sports
and lists some 2,100 substances and 4,300
products on the UK Sport website
(www.uksport.gov. uk/did).
Betting and gaming
A survey carried out by the National Centre for
Social Research for a consortium representing the
gambling industry, the Home Office and other
regulatory authorities, and GamCare (the national
centre addressing the social impact of gambling),
was published in 2000. It found that 72 per cent of
adults in Great Britain gamble at least once a year.
The National Lottery was by far the most popular
gambling activity in the UK and some 65 per cent
of the adult population had bought Lottery tickets
in the year leading up to the survey.
National Lottery
Of every pound spent on the National Lottery,
28 pence goes to good causes. Since its launch in
the UK in 1994, the Lottery has raised over £11.7
billion for good causes, and more than 115,000
awards have been made. Lottery money is divided
among the following areas - health, education,
environment, arts, sport and heritage.
The National Lottery is run by Camelot Group
pic, a private sector consortium, operating under a
seven-year licence from 27 January 2002. Online
tickets and scratchcards are available from around
25,000 retail outlets across the UK.
In May 2002 Camelot relaunched the Lottery, with
new game formats and the relaunch of existing
games. The Lottery now involves a series of games,
including the Saturday and Wednesday main Lotto
game and a variety of scratchcard games.
The National Lottery Commission regulates the
Lottery, selects the operator, sets the terms of its
licence and ensures that it complies with those
terms. It is headed by five commissioners and its
duties are to protect players’ interests, ensure the
Lottery is run properly, and maximise the amount
raised for good causes.
In June 2002 the DCMS issued a consultation
paper, which included a range of options for
Following an independent review of the controls on
gambling, published in 2001, the Government
issued its response, A Safe Bet for Success -
Modernising Britain's Gambling Laws, in March
2002. The main reforms proposed, which would
cover Great Britain,2 would involve:
■ the establishment of a single regulator, the
Gambling Commission, for all gambling
operators;
■ all gambling premises to be licensed by local
authorities;
■ licensing for the first time of online gambling,
such as on the Internet or through interactive TV;
■ relaxation of the controls on the operation of the
UK's casinos, bingo clubs and betting offices;
and
■ a new licensing framework for gaming machines
- amusement machines would be for use by
anybody, while gaming machines would be for
adults only and confined to places where access
could be controlled effectively.
Measures are also planned to keep crime out of
gambling, ensure a fair deal for the punter, tackle
problem gambling and ensure that children and the
vulnerable are protected. An industry-funded
gambling trust would support the prevention of
problem gambling and finance treatment
programmes.
Legislation is planned to implement the key
elements of the Government's proposals, but
meanwhile some changes will be introduced within
the existing gambling legislation (for example,
relaxing some of the controls on bingo).
changes to the current system of licensing and
regulation of the Lottery - for example,
consideration of whether there might be scope for
more competition in running the Lottery, and
examination of the scope for streamlining day-to-
day regulation.
In July 2002 the DCMS published a consultation
paper on Lottery funding, setting out a number of
issues for consideration on how the Lottery could

that funding is fairly distributed to all areas and

increasing public awareness on how Lottery
money is spent, making the Lottery more
responsive to the needs and priorities of
communities, and ensuring the long-term
sustainability of Lottery projects.

The environment can be defined as anything
outside an organism in which that organism lives.
Our environment includes not only our natural
and geological surroundings, but also buildings,
the atmosphere and even noise.
The UK environment
The UK has over 100,000 separate species of plants
and animals, out of a global total estimated at
between 5 million and 15 million. The natural
vegetation of much of the country is deciduous
forest dominated by oak. However, after many
thousands of years of human activity, only
scattered woodlands and areas of wild or semi¬
wild vegetation lie outside enclosed cultivated
fields (see Table 19.1). The moorlands and
heathlands which occupy around a quarter of the
land area of the UK, while appearing natural, are
as much the product of human activity as is
farmland.
The UK’s native fauna has also been dramatically
affected by human activity, and all native large
carnivores, such as wolves, are now extinct.

19 The environment
However, small carnivores, such as badgers, foxes
and stoats, are common in most rural areas, and
rodents and insectivores are also widespread.
Native herbivores include red and roe deer. There
are only eight species of amphibians and six
species of reptiles native to the UK. In contrast
some 200 species of bird are found, more than half
of which are migratory. Both fresh and salt waters
contain a wide variety of fish species.
Responsibility for environmental affairs
The government departments with overall
responsibility for countryside policy and
environmental protection are shown in the box
below. In England, Wales and Scotland (but not in
Northern Ireland) non-departmental environment
agencies are responsible for regulation and
enforcement matters.
Many local authorities, voluntary organisations
and charities are also involved in environmental
conservation and protection.
Pollution control
Executive responsibility for pollution control is
divided between local authorities, central
government and the devolved administrations.
Central government and devolved administrations
make policy, promote legislation and advise
pollution control authorities on policy
implementation. Local authorities are responsible
for:
■ collection and disposal of domestic waste;
■ keeping the streets clear of litter;
■ controlling air pollution from domestic
premises and, in England and Wales, from
many industrial premises;
■ reviewing, assessing and managing local air
quality; and
■ noise and general nuisance abatement.
Environmental legislation
Conservation and the countryside
(see pages 269-76)
The primary conservation legislation in Great
Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981,
which provides for a range of measures to protect
plants and animals from damage and destruction. It
was strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of
Way Act 2000, which gave ministers and
departments in England and Wales a statutory duty
to have regard to the conservation of biological
diversity in carrying out their functions, and
contained new measures for the conservation and
protection of habitats and wildlife. It also created a
new statutory right of access, giving people greater
freedom to explore the open countryside, while also
providing safeguards for landowners.

19 The environment
Industrial pollution control
There are two pollution control regimes for the UK:
Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC), which regulates
emissions to air; and Integrated Pollution Control
(IPC), which regulates emissions to land and water,
as well as air.
A new Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC)
regime, which implements an EC Directive on
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC),
has been introduced. It succeeds IPC and part of
LAPC and will be fully established by 2007.
Under both old and new regimes, regulators are
required to ensure that pollution from industry is
prevented or reduced through the use of best
available techniques, subject to assessment of costs
and benefits. The characteristics of each installation
and its local environment must be considered.
Under PPC, the issuing of integrated permits will
apply to more industrial activities than was
previously the case. These include animal rendering,
the food and drink industry, and intensive livestock
installations. Regulators are also required to take
into account a wider range of environmental
impacts (including noise, energy efficiency and site
restoration) when issuing integrated permits.
A Pollution Inventory for England and Wales,
administered by the Environment Agency, provides
details of emissions to air, water and land from
processes regulated under IPC, and their
contributions to national emission levels. The data
are updated annually and can be found on the
Agency's website {www.environment-
agency.gov.uk). The implementation of the IPPC
Directive will increase the number of sites reporting
from 2,000 to around 7,000 in 2003. A similar
inventory will be developed to include information
on emissions from PPC installations.
Waste management (see pages 277-9)
Waste management in Great Britain is governed
by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as
amended) and the Waste Management Licensing
Regulations 1994. A licence is required by anyone
wanting to deposit, recover, or dispose of waste.
Licences are issued b>y the Environment Agency
and SEPA. In Northern Ireland responsibility for
waste regulation lies with the DOE. A duty of care
requires waste producers, and anyone else with
responsibility for waste, to take all reasonable steps
to keep their waste safe. If they give their waste to
someone else they must be sure that those people
are authorised to take it and can transport, recycle
or dispose of it safely. Failure to comply with
either the licensing requirements or a duty of care
is an offence.
Local authorities are responsible for the collection
and disposal of all household waste and some
commercial waste. In ‘two-tier’ areas (see page 7),
district councils are responsible for collection, and
county councils for disposal, while in unitary
areas the council has both roles.
The disposal of radioactive waste in the UK is
regulated by the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.
This Act makes the Environment Agency in
England and Wales and SEPA in Scotland
responsible for regulating the safe use and storage
of radioactive materials and the management of
waste. The DOE is responsible for regulating
radioactive waste in Northern Ireland.
Noise (see pages 285-6)
In Great Britain, the primary legislation used to
take action against the producers of noise that
causes nuisance is the Environmental Protection
Act 1990. Under the Housing Act 1996, local
authorities in England and Wales have powers to
deal with anti-social behaviour by tenants,
including noise. In Scotland, action against noisy
neighbours is taken under earlier legislation. The
Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced Anti-
Social Behaviour Orders in England, Scotland and
Wales, which can be used against any person who
is causing harassment, alarm or distress to others,
including noise nuisance.
An EC directive specifies the maximum noise level
of certain new equipment for use outside.
Air pollution (see pages 281-5)
Ambient air pollution is controlled and regulated
by a number of different pieces of legislation,
depending on the source of emissions.
Sustainable development
The widely used definition of sustainable
development is ‘development which meets the
needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own
needs’. It springs from an awareness that economic
development in the past tended to mean more
pollution and the wasteful uses of resources.
267
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
The year 2002 marked the tenth anniversary of the
UN Conference on Environment and
Development, held in Rio de Janeiro. The ‘Earth
Summit’ focused global attention for the first time
on the links between environmental problems,
economic conditions and social justice, and from
it emerged a commitment to sustainable
development. It set in motion integrated
approaches to social, economic and environmental
management in many countries. In September
2002 most UN members, including the UK,
attended the World Summit on Sustainable
Development (Rio+10) in Johannesburg, South
Africa (www.johannesburgswnmit.org). The
summit sought to identify areas for further
action and examined the obstacles to the
implementation of Agenda 21 (the plan of
action adopted at Rio).
The Government’s sustainable development
strategy for the UK, A better quality of life, was
launched in 1999, with its own interpretation of
sustainable development: ‘ensuring a better quality
of life for everyone, now and for generations to
come’. It identified a core set of around 150
indicators of sustainable development and a subset
of 15 headline indicators to provide an overview
of progress. The headline indicators cover
economic and social, as well as environmental,
concerns (see box). The Government reports
annually on progress towards sustainable
development, and the 2001 report, Achieving a
Better Quality of Life, was published in March
2002. It showed how progress was being made
across the range of indicators. Since 1999, all or
part of six headline indicators had remained on
the right track, including economic output,
greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, river water
quality, and vehicle theft and domestic burglary.
The trend for another four - investment,
employment, poverty and social exclusion, and
woodland bird populations - had improved.
Violent crime, waste and road traffic, however,
remained high. Farmland bird populations were
still at an unacceptably low level.
The principal body responsible for encouraging
and promoting sustainable development within
the UK is the Government’s Sustainable
Development Unit within DEFRA
(www.sustainable-development.gov.uk). The
independent Sustainable Development
Commission acts as an advocate for action, and
reviews progress.
Headline indicators of sustainable
development
Economic: economic output (gross domestic product
at constant prices); investment (as a percentage of
gross domestic product); and employment.
Social: poverty and social exclusion; education
(qualifications at age 19); health (expected years of
healthy life); housing (the proportion of homes not
meeting standard decency criteria, which include
minimum levels of repair, facilities and thermal
comfort); and crime.
Environmental: climate change (greenhouse gases);
air quality (days of air pollution); road traffic; river
water quality; wildlife (farmland and woodland bird
populations); land use (percentage of new homes
on previously developed land); and waste (arisings
and management).
In its Programme for Government (see page 15),
the Northern Ireland Executive stated that
‘Sustainable Development will be a key theme
running throughout work and priorities’. Some
specific strategies include: the Regional
Development Strategy, which will influence the
future distribution of activities through the region;
the Growing for a Green Economy strategy, which
seeks to achieve sustainable economic
development through more efficient business
practices; and the Northern Ireland Biodiversity
Strategy.
In Wales, the Assembly has adopted a Sustainable
Development Scheme, Learning to Live Differently,
which provides a framework for all its work. This
is reflected in the Assembly Government’s
corporate strategy document Plan for Wales 2001
and other key strategies, including Farming for the
Future-A new direction for farming in Wales (see
page 397) and the Transport Framework for Wales
(see page 326). The Assembly has also introduced
its own list of sustainable development indicators.
The Scottish Executive Programme for
Government commits the executive to make
sustainable development the basis of all its activity.
The Executive has identified resource use, energy,
travel and social justice as priority areas for action.

sustainable development. It has produced 23
reports so far, on a variety of topics, such as
climate change and environmental standards.

Protecting countryside and wildlife
DEFRA is responsible for policy on wildlife and
countryside in England. It sponsors three non-
departmental public bodies: the Countryside
Agency, English Nature and the National Forest
Company. The devolved administrations sponsor
similar bodies in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. DEFRA also sponsors the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee (JNCC), a committee of
three statutory nature conservation agencies
(English Nature, Scottish Natural Heritage and the
Countryside Council for Wales).

The Countryside Agency is the statutory body in
England whose aims are to conserve and enhance
the countryside; promote social equality and
economic opportunity for the people who live
there; and help everyone, wherever they live, to
enjoy this natural asset. The Agency is currently in
the process of compiling the Countryside
Character database, which will develop a landscape
typography that provides a deeper insight into the
components of the English countryside. Once
finalised, it will be used to assess the impact on the
landscape of changes in agricultural practices, new
housing, industrial development, transport
infrastructure, and mineral extraction.
English Nature promotes the conservation of
England’s wildlife and natural features, and
provides advice to the Government on nature
conservation. The Scottish Executive sponsors
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), a body with both
the nature conservation duties and powers of
English Nature, and the countryside and landscape
powers of the Countryside Agency. The
Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) has
responsibilities in Wales for landscape and nature
conservation, and for countryside recreation. In
Northern Ireland, the Environment and Heritage
Service, an agency within the Department of the
Environment, protects and manages the natural
and built environment. It also has an
environmental protection role. English Nature,
CCW and SNH are also responsible for providing
advice and information to the Government and
the public on nature conservation, for notifying
land as being of special interest due to its wildlife
and geological features, and for establishing
National Nature Reserves (NNRs).
The JNCC is the statutory committee through
which English Nature, CCW and SNH exercise
their joint functions. These include providing
advice on amendments to the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 and on the development and
implementation of policies that affect nature
conservation in Great Britain and internationally;
establishing common standards for the
monitoring of, and research into, nature
conservation; and analysis of the information
produced. At the international level, the JNCC
provides technical advice to government and
others to aid implementation of global and
European conservation obligations, for example
the Convention on Biological Diversity (see page
275) and the EC Birds and Habitats Directives.

conservation work. Although they are funded
largely by subscription, private donations and
entrance fees, many receive government support
and grants, sometimes in recognition of statutory
responsibilities that they perform.
The National Trust (www.nationaltrust.org.uk), a
charity established in 1895 with nearly 2.9 million
members, owns and protects places of historic
interest and natural beauty for the benefit of the
nation. It cares for around 250,000 hectares of
land in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
including forests, fens, moorland, downs,
farmland, nature reserves and stretches of
coastline. It is responsible for 200 historic houses,
160 gardens, 40,000 ancient monuments and
archaeological remains, and 46 villages. Some
2.6 million people visit National Trust ‘pay for
entry’ properties each year and an estimated 50
million visits are made annually to its coasts and
countryside properties.
The separate National Trust for Scotland
(www.nts.org.uk) owns 127 properties and 74,000
hectares of countryside. Established in 1931, it is
supported by a membership of 250,000 and over
2 million people visit its properties each year.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
National Park status recognises the national
importance of the area concerned in terms of
landscape, biodiversity and as a recreational
resource. However, the name National Park
does not signify national ownership: most of
the land in National Parks is owned by farmers
and other private landowners. Each Park is
administered by an independent National Park
Authority.
The primary objective of Areas of Outstanding
Natural Beauty (AONBs) is the conservation and
enhancement of the natural beauty of the
landscape, although many of them also fulfil a
wider recreational purpose. Designation started in
1956 with the Gower peninsula in Wales, and the
most recent addition was the Tamar Valley in
Cornwall in 1995. The Countryside and Rights of
Way Act 2000 gave authorities and communities
greater powers to improve the conservation of
AONBs.
National Parks and AONBs are designated by the
Countryside Agency and the CCW, subject to
The history of Britain's National Parks
In the early 20th century a growing appreciation of
the outdoors, nature and the open air, and the
benefits of physical exercise, led to demands for
more access to the countryside. As towns and cities
expanded and more land was enclosed, conflict
between landowners and public interest groups
grew. A conference of recreation, conservation and
amenity groups was held in 1935 to discuss how to
deal with these issues, and from it emerged the
Standing Committees on National Parks (SCNP).
Pressure from this forum eventually led to the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act
1949, which allowed for the setting up of National
Parks to preserve and enhance natural beauty and
to provide recreational opportunities for the public.
The first two National Parks - the Lake District and
the Peak District - were designated in 1951, and
a further eight followed during the course of the
decade. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads were
designated in 1988, and two further parks are in
the process of designation in England: the New
Forest and the South Downs. The parks are now
nationally important recreational resources,
attracting approximately 100 million visitors a year.
The Scottish Parliament passed the National Parks
(Scotland) Act in July 2000, paving the way to
establish Scotland's first National Park - Loch
Lomond and the Trossachs - which was formally
inaugurated in July 2002.
confirmation by the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or National
Assembly for Wales.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Government on natural landscapes and the
designation of AONBs. In addition to the nine
already designated, two more areas - Erne Lakeland
and Fermanagh Caveland - have been proposed.
Scotland has four regional parks and 40 National
Scenic Areas (NSAs), which together cover around
11,000 square kilometres. The main purpose of
NSAs is to give special attention to the best
scenery in Scotland when new development is
being considered. Certain developments in the
areas are subject to consultation with SNH and, in
the event of a disagreement, with the Scottish
Executive.

Forest and country parks
There are 17 forest parks in Great Britain, covering
nearly 3,000 square kilometres, which are
administered by the Forestry Commission (see
page 406). The Countryside Agency recognises
over 200 country parks and more than 250 picnic
sites in England. A further 35 country parks in
Wales are recognised by the CCW, and there are 36
country parks in Scotland. Northern Ireland has
eight forest parks, three forest drives and over 40
minor forest recreation sites. All are administered
by the Forest Service, an agency of DARD.
Tree preservation and planting
Tree Preservation Orders enable local authorities
to protect trees and woodlands. Once a tree is
protected, it is, in general, an offence to cut down
or carry out most types of work to it without
permission. Courts can impose substantial fines
for breaches of such Orders. Replacement trees
must be planted where protected trees are felled in
contravention of an Order or are removed because
they are dying, dead or dangerous.
Tree planting is encouraged through various grant
schemes, including the Forestry Commission’s
Woodland Grant Scheme (see page 406), and the
planting of broadleaved trees has greatly increased
since the 1980s. Just under 14,000 hectares of new
woodland were planted in the UK in 2001/02.
Major afforestation projects involving the Forestry
Commission, the Countryside Agency and 58 local
authorities include the creation of 12 Community
Forests in and around major cities, with a total
designated area of 450,000 hectares. These forests
help to restore areas scarred by industrial
dereliction, create sites for recreation, sport and
environmental education, and provide new
habitats for wildlife. In 2000/01, about 640
hectares of new woodlands were created in
Community Forest areas, bringing the total since
1991 to over 8,000 hectares.
The Welsh Assembly Government has a woodland
strategy, which is managed by the Forestry
Commission. The strategy focuses on community
woodlands, the environmental management of
existing woodland, and the contribution that
woodlands make to rural, social and economic
development.
Other organisations involved in protecting existing
woods and planting new areas of woodland
include voluntary bodies such as the Woodland
Trust, which owns over 1,100 woods across the
UK covering 18,300 hectares and, since 1976, has
planted over 4 million trees.
Public rights of way and open country
England has about 188,700 km of rights of way,1
including 146,600 km of footpaths. There are
15 long-distance walking routes in England and
Wales, designated as National Trails. Twelve have
been fully developed and three are in the process
of being completed. There are three Long Distance
Routes in Scotland, which fulfil the same function
(see map).
About 17 per cent of the rights of way in England
may be lawfully used by horseriders and cyclists.
The Pennine Bridleway - the first section of which

Environmental affairs
19 The environment
opened in May 2002 - will be the first long¬
distance trail designed specifically for them.
County, metropolitan and unitary councils in
England and Wales (see page 7) are responsible for
keeping public rights of way signposted and free
from obstruction. Public paths are usually
maintained by these ‘highway authorities’, which
also supervise landowners’ duties to repair stiles
and gates on footpaths. In Scotland planning
authorities are responsible for asserting and
protecting rights of way. Subject to public
consultation (and, if necessary, a public inquiry)
local authorities in Great Britain can create paths,
close paths no longer needed for public use, and
divert paths to meet the needs of either the public
or landowners. Farmers in England and Wales are
required by law to restore any cross-field public
paths damaged or erased by agricultural
operations.
Common land in England and Wales totals more
than 550,000 hectares. The open character of
commons has made them popular for informal
recreation although significant areas are still
important for agriculture. Four-fifths of common
land is privately owned and although only 20 per
cent has a legal right of public access, there is also
de facto access. The CA and the CCW have
important roles to play in preparing for the new
access rights set out in the Countryside and Rights
of Way Act 2000 (see page 266). For example, the
CA is preparing maps of all open country and
registered common land in England, and hopes to
have conclusive maps completed by 2005.
Commons are largely unimproved and therefore
have high amenity and wildlife value; many are
protected by law and by nature conservation
designations. For example, around half of the
common land in England is found within National
Parks (see page 270) and a similar amount is
designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs) (see page 274). Ministerial consent is
usually required to undertake work on commons
or to enclose areas by fencing.
The coast
The UK has 12,429 km of coastline, representing
about 30 per cent of the North Sea and Atlantic
seaboard of Western Europe. The coastline is very
indented and includes 163 estuaries. No location is
more than 125 km from tidal waters. About 75 per
cent of the European chalk coast is located in
the UK.
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific interest.
The policy for the protection of the coastline
against erosion and flooding is administered by
DEFRA and the devolved administrations.
Operational responsibility lies with local
authorities and, in England and Wales, the
Environment Agency.
DEFRA and the Welsh Assembly Government
are jointly funding a project which aims to
predict how the coastline in England and Wales
will be changed by processes such as erosion and
landslip. This will help local operating authorities
update their shoreline management plans and
coastal defence systems and provide information
for longer-term decisions on coastal
management.
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast of
particular beauty in England and Wales are
defined as Heritage Coast. There are 45 Heritage
Coasts, protecting 1,553 kilometres, about 35 per
cent of the total length of coastline (see map).
The National Trust (see page 270), through its
Neptune Coastline Campaign, raises funds to
acquire and protect stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. Around
£36 million has been raised since 1965 and the
Regeneration of the Durham coast
After 100 years of waste tipping by the coal
industry, the coastline of County Durham was
heavily polluted. Mining started in the area in the
1840s, and continued until the last pit closure in
1993. In total, over 40 million tonnes of waste from
the mining was tipped on the coast. Of just over
17 kilometres of coast, more than 12 kilometres
were affected by spoil.
Through the Turning the Tide programme, the
derelict land has been transformed. With £10.5
million funding (including £4.5 million from the
Millennium Commission), 1.3 million tonnes of spoil
have been removed, and 80 hectares of land
regenerated. A footpath and cycle track have been
established along the coastline, and over 100
environmental and community programmes have
been completed. Thirteen kilometres of the coastline
were awarded Heritage Coast status in March 2001.
272
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
Trust now protects around 960 kilometres of
coastline in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The National Trust for Scotland cares for more
than 400 kilometres of the Scottish coastline and
protects other stretches through conservation
agreements.
In 1993 English Nature launched its‘Estuaries
Initiative’ with the objective of securing Estuary
Management Plans for 50 per cent by number, and
80 per cent by area, of England’s estuaries. That
objective has been reached and English Nature will
continue to support those partnerships which have
been successful.
There are also 29 informal marine consultation areas
in Scotland. In addition, SNH has established the
Focus on Firths initiative to co-ordinate
management of the main Scottish estuaries. In Wales
the CCW provides grants to the Arfordir (or Coastal)
Group, which is concerned with the sustainable
management of the whole coast of Wales.
Wildlife protection
The protection of wildlife is an essential element
of the UK Government’s sustainable development
agenda. DEFRA intends to bring 95 per cent of all
nationally important wildlife sites in England into
a favourable condition by 2010, compared with the
60 per cent of sites currently estimated to be in
that state.
All wild bird species in Great Britain, except for a
few pest and quarry species, are protected under
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Certain
birds may be killed or taken at specific times of
year, which are detailed in the Act, or under a
licence issued under the Act.
Other species are protected under the 1991 Act by
Order of the Secretary of State when in his or her
opinion the animal or plant is in danger of
extinction or likely to become so endangered
unless conservation measures are taken; or when
protection is needed to comply with international
legislation. Similar provisions apply under the
Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands Order in
Northern Ireland.
The JNCC is required to review Schedules 5 and
8 (protected animals and plants respectively) of
the Act every five years and consult on the level of
protection given to plant and animal species. From
the review stems advice on which the Secretary of
State bases his or her decisions. Following the
third review, carried out in 1997/98, 11 species of
animal were given full protection. These included
the basking shark - the largest fish in UK waters -
the water vole, the marsh fritillary butterfly and
the southern damselfly. A total of 17 plant species
were given protection, including the flamingo
moss, hedgehog fungus and wild bluebell. The
fourth review took place in 2001/02, and decisions
are expected in early 2003.
Bird populations are good indicators of the state
of wildlife in the countryside, since they are widely
distributed and are near the top of the food chain.
There are concerns about the decline in certain
bird species, as modern farming and forestry
methods have removed the food supply they need
for breeding and surviving the winter. A British
Trust for Ornithology (BTO) survey found that
populations of 20 of Britain’s most common birds
have dropped by more than 50 per cent in the last
25 years. However, the annual BTO/JNCC/RSPB
Breeding Bird Survey conducted in 2000 found
that more species (45) had increased since 1994
than had decreased (18).
DEFRA will provide funding up to 2007 for agri¬
environment schemes to restore farmland habitats
(see page 398). It is also funding a study led by the
BTO to investigate the long-term declines of the
house sparrow and starling, both of which have
declined by more than 50 per cent since the 1970s.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (see page 275)
includes targets to reverse bird population decline.

19 The environment
Twenty-five species have been identified for
targeting, including the skylark, grey partridge,
corn bunting, song thrush and bullfinch.
Wildlife crime
Wildlife crime takes many forms and has been
increasing in recent years. Examples include theft of
eggs from birds of prey, illegal shooting, trapping,
poisoning, digging up of wild plants, and the illicit
trade in endangered species. The most significant
organised criminal activities involve the trafficking
in endangered species and their by-products, and
the taking and keeping of species within the UK.
The extent of such criminality is unknown, but in
2000 HM Customs and Excise seized 1,783 live
animals and made 443 separate seizures of
endangered species or their by-products.
DEFRA and the Scottish Executive manage a team
of around 100 wildlife inspectors. Their main roles
are to verify information submitted in support of
applications to keep or trade in wildlife species;
and to check that people are complying with the
administrative controls contained in certain
wildlife legislation. There are also specialist wildlife
officers in almost every police force in the UK.
The Partnership for Action Against Wildlife
Crime, chaired by the police and DEFRA
(www.defra.gov.uk/paw), provides a forum for
communication and co-operation between the
statutory enforcement authorities and non¬
governmental organisations which have an active
interest in wildlife law enforcement.
The UK’s first National Wildlife Crime Intelligence
Unit was established in April 2002, within the
Specialist Intelligence Branch of the National
Criminal Intelligence Service. Jointly funded by
DEFRA, the Association of Chief Police Officers,
the Home Office and the Scottish Executive, it is
intended that the Unit will provide law
enforcement agencies with the information they
need to target and disrupt wildlife crimes and the
criminals involved. It will also act as a focal point
for the gathering and analysing of intelligence on
serious wildlife crime at regional, national and
international levels.
Much of UK law in relation to wildlife crime is
shaped by international regulations. The
Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES - see page 276) regulates trade in
endangered species. It prohibits trade of around
800 species and controls that of a further 23,000,
and is implemented in the EU by the European
Union Wildlife Trade Regulations. In England and
Wales, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000
introduced stronger measures to combat wildlife
crime, including greater powers for police officers
and DEFRA wildlife inspectors, and new penalties,
including jail sentences of up to six months and
fines of up to £5,000. In Scotland, the Protection of
Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act came into force on
1 August 2002. Among other things, the Act bans
hunting with dogs in Scotland (see page 251).
Habitat protection
Habitat protection is mainly achieved through the
networks of Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs) in Great Britain, and Areas of Special
Scientific Interest (ASSIs) in Northern Ireland.
Sites are protected for their plants, animals or

geological or physiographical features. Some SSSIs
and ASSIs are of international importance and
have been designated for protection under the EC
Wild Birds and Habitats Directives or the Ramsar
Convention (see page 276). In England, the
Government’s target is to bring 95 per cent of
SSSIs into favourable condition by 2010. Most
SSSIs and ASSIs are privately owned, but about
40 per cent are owned or managed by public
bodies such as the Forestry Commission, the
Ministry of Defence and the Crown Estate.
English Nature, the CCW and SNH have powers to
enter into land management agreements with
owners and occupiers of SSSI land, where this is
necessary to support the management of their
natural features. The CNCC advises on the
establishment and management of land and
marine nature reserves and the declaration of
ASSIs in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland
Programme for Government includes a
commitment to have a policy and legislation
framework in place for the protection of ASSIs by
July 2003.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000
improved the protection and management of
SSSIs in England and Wales, by giving enhanced
powers to the conservation agencies, including
powers to refuse consent for damaging activities.
The agencies in England and Wales also have
powers to develop management schemes, in
consultation with owners and occupiers of SSSIs,
and to serve a management notice to require
works to be done where necessary. The maximum
penalty for deliberate damage to an SSSI is
£20,000 in a magistrates’ court, with unlimited
fines in the Crown Court.
Wildlife Trusts {www.wildlifetrusts.org) and the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB -
www.rsph.org.uk) play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout the UK. The Wildlife
Trusts have 2,400 nature reserves covering 76,270
hectares. The 47 independent trusts have nearly
400,000 members, and are mainly based in counties
in England and Wales, with the whole of Scotland
covered by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. The RSPB
manages 176 reserves covering 121,082 hectares. It
is the largest voluntary wildlife conservation body
in Europe, with over 1 million members.
Biodiversity, species recovery and reintroduction
The UK is one of 183 Parties to the Convention on
Biological Diversity Treaty, agreed at the Rio Earth
Peat bog preservation
In February 2002 the Government announced an
agreement, reached between English Nature and
the private company involved, to stop peat
extraction at three sites: Wedholme Flow, Thorne
Moor and Hatfield Moor. These sites represent about
one-third of the total surviving area of lowland
peatland in England. Peatlands are unique
environments, acidic and low in nutrients, where
only specialised wildlife can survive and natural
decay can barely take place. Many provide homes to
important and unusual species, often in large
numbers - over 3,000 species of insect have been
found on Thorne Moor alone. All three sites are part
of the Natura 2000 network proposed to the
European Commission in recognition of their
ecological importance under the terms of the
Habitats Directive (see page 276).
Summit (see page 268). The Parties have agreed to
develop national strategies and programmes for
the conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity and to ensure the fair and equitable
sharing of benefits from the use of genetic
resources. While the prime focus for
implementation is at national level, much activity
is under way internationally to elaborate the
Convention’s obligations, share experience and
help identify good practice. The next meeting of
the Parties will be in 2004.
As part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan
{www.ukbap.org.uk), 391 species and 45 habitat
action plans have been established and are at
various stages of implementation. In addition,
over 160 local biodiversity action plans are in
preparation or being implemented.
The National Biodiversity Network Trust
{www.searchnbn.net) is a charity representing
11 voluntary and public organisations. The trust
aims to bring together biodiversity information to
meet a wide range of conservation, research,
educational and public participation needs.
English Nature held its Species Recovery
Programme (SRP) tenth anniversary conference in
December 2001. The SRP started with attempts to

reintroduction of species. Its Millennium Seed
Bank in the Wellcome Trust Millennium Building,
at Wakehurst Place, West Sussex, holds seeds of
1,312 native UK wild plants and trees - 90 per
cent of British plant species. It aims to hold 10 per
cent of the world’s flowering flora, principally
from dryland regions, by 2010 and 20 per cent by
2020. The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
(RBGE) (see page 384) promotes conservation
programmes for rare plants in Scotland and for
coniferous trees worldwide, maintaining
genetically diverse populations in cultivation at
many sites, as pools for eventual reintroduction to
the wild. RBGE’s Living Collections consists of
6 per cent of the world’s flowering plant species in
cultivation and also includes 1,400 threatened
plants.
International action
The EC Habitats Directive, adopted in 1992, aims
to promote biodiversity through the conservation
of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna. It
includes a range of measures relating to the
conservation and protection of species and
habitats; the most stringent obligations relate to
the selection, designation and protection of
a series of sites, Special Areas of Conservation
(SACs). It is envisaged that these sites will make a
significant contribution to conserving the 169
habitat types and 623 species identified by the
Directive as being most in need of conservation in
a European context. In the UK 76 such habitat
types have been identified, as have 51 species (four
of which are now extinct and a further six occur as
vagrants or introductions).
SACs, along with the similar Special Protection
Areas (SPAs), set up under the earlier Birds
Directive primarily to protect avian species, will
form the UK component of the Europe-wide
Natura 2000 network.
Advice to the Government on which sites should
be SACs or SPAs has been provided by the
statutory conservation agencies (see page 269) and
co-ordinated by the JNCC. By the end of March
2002, 567 candidate SACs (cSACs), covering
23,590 square kilometres, had been submitted, and
234 SPAs, at 13,116 square kilometres, had been
classified.
The UK funds the Darwin Initiative, a small grants
programme which uses UK biodiversity expertise
to help countries rich in biodiversity, but poor in
resources, with the conservation and sustainable
use of their biodiversity. This includes helping
them meet their obligations under the Biodiversity
Convention.
The UK is also a member of the World
Conservation Union and of several international
Conventions and Directives, some of which are
described below:
■ The IUCN - the World Conservation Union -
is the largest nature conservation body in the
world, having a membership of nearly 1,000
governmental and non-governmental
organisations. Its purpose is to influence,
encourage and help societies throughout the
world to conserve the integrity and diversity
of nature and to ensure that any use of
natural resources is equitable and ecologically
sustainable.
■ The Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance (the Ramsar Convention)
(www.ramsar.org) is an intergovernmental
treaty covering all aspects of wetland
conservation and use.
■ CITES (www.cites.org) regulates trade in
endangered species by means of a permit
system.
■ The Convention on the Conservation of
Migratory Species of Wild Animals (the Bonn
Convention). This convention co-ordinates
international action on a range of endangered
migratory species.
Land quality, waste, recycling and litter
Land quality
Land quality in the UK is relatively good, but faces
pressure from a range of factors, including
urbanisation, localised erosion, declining organic
content and contamination.
Contaminated land is the legacy of an industrial
age that generated wealth but also caused much
pollution. The Environment Agency estimates that
some 300,000 hectares of land in Great Britain are
contaminated to some degree. Government policy
emphasises the importance of voluntary action to
clean up contaminated land, and most attempts to
clean up sites occur when they are redeveloped.

and quality of soil for their survival, and a good
balance of soil types is required to support the
existing range of ecosystems, landscapes and
agriculture. In 2001 the former Department for
the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food jointly
published a draft soil strategy for England
promoting the sustainable use of soil and raising
public awareness of the importance of soil as part
of the environment. The strategy set out five
actions:
■ to ensure that all policies and programmes
which affect soil take into account the
strategy’s aims and objectives;
■ to develop a national set of key soil indicators
to help provide assessments of, for example,
the extent of soil lost to development;
■ to review current soil monitoring and develop
a national framework for this activity;
■ to examine existing soil research, and
recommend ways to improve its co¬
ordination; and
■ to set a five-year goal for evaluating the
success of the soil strategy.
Waste management and disposal
The UK produces over 400 million tonnes of waste
each year, the majority of which comes from
agricultural, industrial and construction sources.
However, a considerable amount of waste is
produced by households - 89 per cent of an
estimated 28.2 million tonnes of municipal waste
in England in 2000/01. Commercial activities
produce 25 million tonnes of waste a year. Nearly
two-thirds of waste from households, commerce
and industry is disposed of to landfill, a method
which makes little practical use of waste.2 In the
case of municipal waste, 12 per cent was recycled
or composted in 2000/01; but the majority, 78 per
cent, was disposed of in landfill (see Table 19.5).
The Government’s Waste Strategy 2000 for England
and Wales set out its views on waste and resource
management, and the changes needed to make
waste management more sustainable during the
next 20 years. It requires action by many different
organisations - including local authorities, the
waste industry and the business sector - and by
individuals.

The Recycling Fund is an important part of the
Strategy. Councils in England can bid for a share
of the £140 million available through the fund
from 2002/03 to 2003/04 to help them meet their
recycling and composting targets.
The Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation
Unit launched a review into waste strategy in
January 2002.
By 2005 the Government aims to reduce the
amount of UK industrial and commercial waste
disposed of in landfill sites to 85 per cent of 1998
levels and, in England, to recycle or compost at
least 25 per cent of household waste, increasing to
33 per cent by 2015. Between 1999/2000 and
2000/01 the amount of household waste recycled
increased from 10.3 per cent to 11.2 per cent.
Meeting these targets would go some way towards
meeting the Government’s obligation under the
EC Landfill Directive, which requires the UK to
reduce landfill of biodegradable municipal waste
to two-thirds of its 1995 level by 2020.
The landfill tax (see page 357) credit scheme
enables landfill site operators in the UK to channel
up to 20 per cent of their landfill tax liability into
environmental bodies, to be used for approved
projects. Examples include reclamation of polluted
land, research and education activities to promote
re-use and recycling, provision of public parks and
amenities, and restoration of historic buildings.
Scotland has its own waste strategy - the National
Waste Strategy: Scotland - the objectives of which
include: ensuring that waste is disposed of without
endangering human health and without harming
the environment; establishing an integrated and
adequate network of waste disposal installations;
277

19 The environment
encouraging the prevention or reduction of waste
production; and encouraging the recovery of
waste. Eleven local area plans are to be integrated
into a National Waste Plan by autumn 2002.
Northern Ireland has a similar waste management
strategy, designed to help achieve sustainable waste
management and to meet the targets for diversion
away from landfill. The main goal is a reduction of
25 per cent for biodegradable municipal waste going
to landfill by 2010, increasing to 50 per cent by 2013
and 75 per cent by 2020 (all set against 1995 levels).
A Planning Policy Statement on planning and waste
management will be published in 2002.
In June 2002 the Welsh Assembly Government
launched Wise about waste: the national waste
strategy for Wales, which establishes a programme
designed to change waste management practice in
Wales over the next ten years. It seeks to minimise
the production of waste and its impact on the
environment, and, where practicable, the use of
energy from waste and landfill, while maximising
the use of unavoidable waste as a resource. The
strategy includes specific targets for public bodies
to reduce their waste arisings by 10 per cent from
the 1998 level by 2010, and targets for local
authorities to have 40 per cent of waste
recycled/composted by the same date. Additional
funding will be provided by the Assembly
Government to local authorities to help meet the
recycling and composting targets - a total of £79
million from 2001 to 2004/05.
The EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging
Waste stipulates that at least 50 per cent of the UK’s
packaging waste must be recovered and at least 25
per cent recycled. All packaging must be recoverable
through recycling, incineration with energy
recovery, composting or biodegradation. By the end
of 2000, 42 per cent of packaging waste was
recovered and 36 per cent recycled. For 2002, the
Government has set a 59 per cent recovery target.
The Waste and Resources Action Programme
(WRAP) aims to overcome market barriers to the
recovery and recycling of waste - government
funding of around £40 million is available to the
programme between 2001 and 2004. In Scotland
a Strategic Waste Fund has been established to
assist local authorities in their implementation of
Area Waste Plans. The fund has been allocated
£50.4 million over three years (2001-04). Scotland
has also allocated £2.1 million to WRAP over this
period.

Across the UK, banks are available for the public
to deposit various waste material for recycling,
including bottles, cans, clothes, paper and plastics.
In addition, some local authorities provide
kerbside collection of recyclable material.
Fridges and freezers
Up to 3 million domestic refrigeration units -
fridges, fridge-freezers and freezers - are disposed
of in the UK every year. Almost all appliances
purchased before 1994 contain Ozone Depleting
Substances (ODS - see page 284), used as
refrigerants, and these substances are still widely
used in blowing agents for the insulation material.
A European Council Regulation came into force in
October 2001 which required the removal of ODS
from refrigeration equipment before such equipment
can be scrapped. At the time, there were no
specialised facilities in the UK to carry out this task,
leading to concerns about the stockpiling of old
fridges before suitable plant could be brought on
line. In March 2002 the Environment Agency
announced that it would license and regulate
suitable ODS processing plant in England and
Wales, and by July 2002 five fixed plants were in
operation.
Hazardous waste
There is an extensive framework of national and
EC legislation on the manufacture, distribution,
use and disposal of hazardous chemicals. New and
existing chemicals are subject to notification and
assessment procedures under EC legislation.
Pesticides, biocides and veterinary medicines are
subject to mandatory approval procedures.
278
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
International movements of hazardous waste are
controlled by the Basel Convention on the Control
of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and their Disposal. The UK is a signatory
of the Basel Convention Protocol on Liability and
Compensation. Once fully ratified the Protocol
requires exporters of hazardous waste to be
insured against any damage caused on the journey
to the recycler or disposer of that waste.
In Great Britain, the Special Waste Regulations
1996 are the centrepiece of hazardous waste
controls. However, since 1996, the Hazardous
Waste List that defines the scope of the EC
Hazardous Waste Directive has been refined and
increased in length. Furthermore, a number of
new Directives have been or will be made, which
will have an impact on the sector, notably the
Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive, the
Landfill Directive and the IPC Directive (see page
267).
The Special Waste Regulations were amended in
November 2001 to ensure that special wastes are
managed from the moment they are produced
until they reach their final destination for disposal
or recovery.
Litter and dog fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any public
place in the open air or to dump rubbish except in
designated places. The maximum fine upon
successful prosecution in a magistrates court is up
to £20,000 for fly-tipping (illegal dumping of
waste) offences. Local authorities can issue £50
Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs), for litter and dog
fouling offences; the maximum fine if FPNs are
not paid upon successful prosecution, is £2,500 for
littering and £1,000 for dog fouling.
Local authorities have a duty to keep their public
land free of litter and refuse, including dog faeces,
as far as is practicable. Members of the public have
powers to take action against authorities which fail
to comply with their responsibilities. In England
and Wales local authorities may also make it an
offence not to clear up after one’s dog in a public
place, and issue a fixed penalty fine of £25 under
the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996. In Scotland it
is an offence to allow a dog to foul in specified
places under the Civic Government (Scotland)
Act 1982.
ENCAMS (www.encams.org), formerly the Tidy
Britain Group, is the national agency for litter
abatement, working in collaboration with local
authorities and the private sector. In 2001 it
launched a continuous survey of local
environmental quality in England. Conditions
being monitored include cleanliness, graffiti, and
physical obstructions.
The environment agencies, local authorities, police
and ENCAMS have been monitoring the incidence
of fly-tipping since the introduction of the landfill
tax, and such activity has increased since 1994/95.
If indicted to the Crown Court, the maximum
penalty for fly-tipping (and other offences relating
to waste) is up to five years’ imprisonment and/or
an unlimited fine.
Buildings and monuments
In England, lists of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest are compiled by
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) with advice from English Heritage. In
Scotland and Wales, buildings are listed by
Historic Scotland and Cadw respectively. In
Northern Ireland, the EHS has responsibility for
listed buildings, following consultation with the
advisory Historic Buildings Council (HBC) and
the relevant local district council.
It is against the law to demolish, extend or alter
the character of any listed building without prior
consent from the local planning authority, or the
DOE in Northern Ireland, or - on appeal or
following call-in - the appropriate government
minister. A local planning authority can issue a
‘building preservation notice’ to protect for six
months an unlisted building which it considers to
be of special architectural or historic interest and
which is at risk, while a decision is taken on
whether it should be listed.
There are around 1 million archaeological sites or
‘find spots’ of all types currently recorded in
England. English Heritage assesses known
archaeological sites in England in order to identify
those that should be afforded statutory protection.
It makes its recommendations to the DCMS,
which maintains the schedule of ancient
monuments. The schedule now has about 19,300
entries (about 35,400 sites). Similar arrangements
exist to identify buildings and ancient and historic
monuments eligible for statutory protection in
Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland the EHS
assesses all known archaeological sites in order to
identify those sites which should be afforded
statutory protection. It then makes

English Heritage is directly responsible for the
maintenance, repair and presentation of 409
historic properties in public ownership or
guardianship, and gives grants for the repair of
other important ancient monuments and historic
buildings. In 2001/02 it gave out £27 million in
grant aid. Most of English Heritage’s properties are
open to the public, and there were nearly 5.5
million visits to staffed properties in 2001/02. Its
Images of England project will provide access via
the Internet to one of the largest digital libraries in
the world, containing pictures of England’s
370,000 listed historic buildings. Government
funding for English Heritage in 2002/03 is £115.4
million.
In Scotland and Wales, Historic Scotland, which
cares for over 330 monuments, and Cadw, with
127 monuments, perform similar functions. There
were nearly 3 million visitors to Historic
Scotland’s properties where admission is charged
in 2000/01 and 1.1 million to Cadw properties in
2000. The DOE in Northern Ireland has 189
historic monuments in its care, managed by the
EHS.
Local planning authorities have designated more
than 9,000 conservation areas of special
architectural or historic interest in England and
there are 504 in Wales, 602 in Scotland and 58 in
Northern Ireland. These areas receive additional
protection through the planning system,
particularly over the proposed demolition of
unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF)
helps towards the cost of acquiring, maintaining
or preserving land, buildings, objects and
collections that are of outstanding interest and of
importance to the national heritage. In addition,
its trustees are responsible for distributing the
heritage share of the proceeds from the National
Lottery (see page 263). The first requests for
lottery money were received in 1995 and, by July
2002, more than £2.0 billion had been awarded
from the Heritage Lottery Fund in more than
9,350 capital and revenue grants.
Many of the royal palaces and all the royal parks
are open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the DCMS and Historic Scotland.
Historic Royal Palaces, the Royal Household and
the Royal Parks Agency carry out this function on
behalf of the Secretary of State in England.
Industrial, transport and maritime heritage
As the first country in the world to industrialise
on a large scale, the UK has a rich industrial
heritage, including such sites as the Ironbridge
Gorge (now a World Heritage site - see below),
where Abraham Darby (1677-1717) first smelted
iron using coke instead of charcoal.
Several industrial monuments in Scotland are in
the care of the First Minister, including Bonawe
Iron Furnace, the most complete charcoal-fuelled
ironworks surviving in Britain; the working New
Abbey Corn Mill; and Dallas Dhu Malt Whisky
Distillery.
The UK pioneered railways, and has a fine heritage
of railway buildings and structures. A large
number of disused railway lines have been bought
by railway preservation societies, and there are
several railway museums.
A voluntary body, the Maritime Trust, preserves
vessels and other maritime items of historic or
technical interest. In all, about 400 historic ships
are preserved in the UK, mostly in private hands.
The National Heritage Act 2002 extended English
Heritage’s remit to include securing the
preservation and increasing the understanding of
archaeological sites of all types in the marine zone.
World Heritage sites
The World Heritage List was established under the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation’s 1972 World Heritage
Convention in order to identify and secure lasting
protection for sites of outstanding universal value
{www.unesco.org/whc). The UK currently has 24

19 The environment
World Heritage sites (see map), including three in
Overseas Territories - St George in Bermuda,
Henderson Island and Gough Island wildlife
reserve. Four sites were inscribed by the World
Heritage committee in 2001. The Dorset and East
Devon Coast is an area of both natural beauty and
scientific interest, while Derwent Valley Mills, New
Lanark and Saltaire date from the Industrial
Revolution, when they were developed as textile
communities.
Air and the atmosphere
Air quality
Air quality has improved considerably since the
smogs of the 1950s. The first step towards these
improvements was the introduction of the Clean
Air Act in 1956, which controlled smoke from
industrial and domestic coal burning, a major
source of pollution at the time. Since then, the
replacement of coal by natural gas and electricity
for domestic heating, tighter regulation and
structural changes in industry, and the
introduction of progressively more stringent
standards for vehicle exhaust emissions, have all
led to considerable improvements in air quality.
For example, in 1970, 8.9 million tonnes of carbon
monoxide (CO) and 6.5 million tonnes of sulphur
dioxide (S02) were emitted into the air in the UK.
By 2000 these emissions had fallen to 4.2 million
and 1.2 million tonnes respectively.
Industrial processes with the potential for
producing pollutants are subject to regulation
under IPG and IPPC (see page 267). Processes with
a significant but lesser potential for air pollution
require approval, in England and Wales from local
authorities, in Scotland from SEPA and in Northern
Ireland from the Chief Pollution Inspector or
relevant district council, depending on the process.
Local authorities also control emissions of dark
smoke from commercial and industrial premises,
and implement smoke control areas to deal with
emissions from domestic properties.
Under the provisions of the Environment Act 1995,
the Government is required to publish an Air
Quality Strategy setting out its policies for
managing ambient air quality in the UK,
particularly in relation to reducing air pollution
and any remaining risks to people’s health and the
natural and built environment. The current
strategy contains air quality standards and
objectives for eight pollutants of particular
concern to human health: nitrogen dioxide, PM]0
(particulate matter that is less than 10 microns in
diameter), S02, CO, ozone, lead, benzene and 1,3-
butadiene. Dates for achieving the various
objectives across the UK have been set between
2003 and 2008.
In September 2001 DEFRA and the devolved
administrations published a consultation paper
which included proposals for tighter objectives for
benzene, CO and PM10, and a new objective for
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These were the
same throughout the UK except for PM10, where a
tougher objective was proposed for Scotland than
elsewhere, because air quality there is generally
better. Conversely, a less stringent objective was
proposed for London. The new objectives came
into force in Scotland in June 2002 through the Air
Quality (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2002,
and separate arrangements for the rest of the UK
will come into effect in due course.
The UK has an automatic air quality monitoring
network with 122 sites covering much of the
country, in both urban and rural areas. A number
of new sites have been established in recent years,
mainly in urban areas to provide more
comprehensive coverage of air quality in UK
towns and cities.
In the UK in 2001 there was an average of 21 days
per site in urban areas when air pollution was
recorded as moderate or higher, compared with 16
days in 2000 and 28 days in 1999. The main causes
of moderate or higher air pollution at urban sites
are ground level ozone, PM10 and S02. Ground
level ozone is formed from chemical reactions of
other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx)
and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Pollution caused by PM10 and S02 has fallen
significantly since 1993, so that ozone is now the
principal cause of these criteria being exceeded in
urban areas. In rural areas, air pollution was
recorded as moderate or higher on 30 days on
average per site in 2001 compared with 25 days in
2000. This series can be volatile from year to year,
and there is no clear trend. This reflects variability
in levels of ozone, which is overwhelmingly the
main pollutant in rural areas.
Air Quality Bulletins provide the public with
hourly updates of air pollution data from the
national monitoring network. These give the
concentrations of the main pollutants, together
281

with an air pollution forecast. The information
features on television and radio weather reports,
and appears in many national and local
newspapers. Information can also be accessed
through the UK’s Air Quality Archive website
(www.airquality.co.uk).
Vehicle emissions
Measures to reduce pollution from road transport
are seen as vital to achieving the objectives set out
in the UK Air Quality Strategy. Progressively
tighter standards for fuels and vehicle emissions
mean that urban road transport emissions of CO,
NOx and particulates are projected to fall by
around 70 per cent between 1995 and 2015.
Vehicle emissions standards are governed by
a series of EC Directives enforced in the UK under
the Motor Vehicles Construction and Use and
Type Approval Regulations. All new petrol-
engined passenger cars in the UK are fitted with
catalytic converters, which typically reduce
emissions by over 75 per cent. These measures to
reduce vehicle emissions from new vehicles have
been accompanied by improvements in fuel
quality with, for instance, reductions in
components such as benzene and sulphur, which
have an environmental impact, and the phasing
out of leaded petrol. People in the UK who own
vehicles registered after February 2001 pay vehicle
excise duty according to the amount of carbon
dioxide (C02) their car produces and the type of
fuel it uses (see page 356).
Compulsory testing of emissions from vehicles is
a key element in the UK’s strategy for improving
air quality. Metered emission tests and smoke
checks feature in the annual ‘MoT’ roadworthiness
test. Enforcement checks carried out at the
roadside or at operators’ premises also include a
check for excessive smoke. The Vehicle
Inspectorate (see page 314) carried out 90,345
roadside emissions checks in 2001/02 (on cars,
coaches, goods vehicles, buses and taxis), and
4,063 vehicles failed. The equivalent figures for
2000/01 were 85,300 and 3,482 respectively. Local
councils in England and Wales which have
designated air quality management areas have the
power to enforce vehicle exhaust emissions
standards, by roadside testing, in those areas. The
Scottish Executive will introduce similar powers,
available to all Scottish local authorities, by the
end of 2002, and the Welsh Assembly Government
is consulting on extending them to local
authorities in Wales.
Climate change
Several gases naturally present in the atmosphere
keep the Earth at a temperature suitable for life by
trapping energy from the Sun - the greenhouse’
effect. However, emissions from human activities
are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of
several greenhouse gases, causing global warming
and climate change. Globally the temperature rose
by about 0.6°C during the 20th century. In
England, four of the five warmest years since
records began in 1659 occurred in the 1990s, with
1990 and 1999 being the joint warmest years ever.
Research at the Hadley Centre, part of the Met
Office, is focused on improving climate
predictions and investigating the causes of recent
climate change. Results from its latest climate
model suggest that, with the current levels of
increase in greenhouse gases, the global mean sea
level will rise by between 9 and 88 cm by 2100 and
there will be a rise in average global temperature
of up to 6°C over the next 100 years.
Possible impacts of climate change in the UK
could include a rise in average temperatures of
about 3°C by 2100 and an increase in rainfall of
up to 10 per cent over England and Wales and
20 per cent over Scotland by the 2080s. Models
suggest that autumns and winters will get wetter,
and spring and summer rainfall patterns will
change making the north-west of England wetter
and the south-east drier.
The most significant greenhouse gas emitted by
the UK is C02, followed by methane (CH4) and
nitrous oxide (N20). Although still comparatively
low, there has been an increase in emissions of
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which have a high
global warming potential, as consumption grew in
response to the phasing out of ozone-depleting
substances under the Montreal Protocol (see page
284). HFCs were virtually unused before 1990, but
their emissions accounted for nearly 3 per cent of
total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 1998 and
then fell to about 1.4 per cent in 2000 in response
to pollution control regulations.
Control of global and regional air pollution
requires international co-operation and action.
The first international action dealing with climate
change dates from the Rio Earth Summit
(see page 268), at which the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was
adopted, calling for the stabilisation of greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level
that would prevent dangerous man-made
282
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
interference with the climate system. At the third
Conference of the Parties to the Framework
Convention, held in Kyoto in 1997, richer
countries established a Protocol agreeing legally
binding targets to reduce emissions of the basket
of six main greenhouse gases: C02, methane, N20,
MFCs, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur
hexafluoride. The Protocol committed developed
nations to a 5.2 per cent reduction in greenhouse
gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2008-12. The
European Union agreed to a collective reduction
target of 8 per cent. At a subsequent meeting in
June 1998, the Member States agreed to share out
the EU’s target to reflect national circumstances.
Individual countries’ targets range from a
reduction of 28 per cent for Luxembourg to a
permitted increase of 27 per cent for Portugal. The
UK, along with its EU partners, ratified the Kyoto
Protocol on 31 May 2002.
Beddington Zero Energy Development, south

The BedZED housing development in Sutton, Surrey
{www.bedzed.org.uk), (see also page 303), is one
of the first developments in the UK to incorporate
thinking on sustainable development into every
aspect of construction. The development is designed
to use energy from renewable sources generated on
site, and aims to be the first large-scale 'carbon
neutral' community - in other words it will not add
additional carbon to the atmosphere.
Constructed on a former sewage works, features of
BedZED include:
■ selection of building materials from natural,
renewable or recycled sources wherever possible;
■ a combined heat and power unit to produce all
the development's heat and electricity from tree
waste (which would otherwise have gone to
landfill);
■ energy efficient designs for all buildings; and
■ a water strategy, making the most of rain and
recycled water, which enables mains consumption
to be cut by a third.

methane and 19 million tonnes of carbon
equivalent of N20) and 2000. However,
provisional figures suggest that emissions of
C02, the main greenhouse gas, increased by about
1.5 per cent between 2000 and 2001. This was
mainly due to increased use of coal in power
stations because of higher gas prices during late
2000 and 2001.
In July 2001 the UK attended the second part of
the sixth Conference of the Parties to the
UNFCCC in Bonn to discuss the details of the
Kyoto Protocol. Among the issues agreed were
extra funding for poorer countries for climate-
change-related activities, rules on how to make
the Protocol workable, and tighter targets for
countries that fail to meet their emission
reduction targets. Further talks in Marrakesh in
November 2001 produced agreement on a text
which, following the political agreement in
Bonn, provides a legal framework for the Protocol.
The Government and the devolved
administrations published Climate Change: The
UK Programme in 2000. It sets out how they
intend to meet the UK’s legally binding Kyoto

target and move towards a domestic goal of a
20 per cent cut in C02 emissions by 2010. The
programme also seeks to move the UK towards
a more sustainable, lower carbon economy,
ensuring that all sectors of the economy and all
parts of the UK play their part.
The integrated package of policies and measures
contained in the programme includes the climate
change levy, which applies to sales of electricity,
coal, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to
the non-domestic sector (see page 434). It aims
to encourage business energy efficiency and is
expected to prevent at least 5 million tonnes of
carbon emissions by 2010. The package includes:
■ extra money for improving business use of
energy;
■ emissions trading (see box);
■ reform of the building regulations;
■ EU-level voluntary agreements with
manufacturers to increase fuel efficiency in
vehicles;
■ a target to deliver 10 per cent of the UK’s
electricity from renewable sources of energy
by 2010; and
■ the promotion of energy efficiency in the
domestic sector.
The programme also looks at what the UK may
need to do to adapt to the effects of climate
change.
As part of its contribution to ocean climate
monitoring, the UK has commissioned research to
assess the rapid collapse of the western Antarctic
ice sheet. The Government has also funded an
instrument to provide highly accurate
temperature readings for the sea surface, one of
ten in the ENVISAT environmental monitoring
satellite, which was launched in March 2002.
The ozone layer
Stratospheric ozone is a layer of gas, about 10 to
50 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, that
protects it from the more harmful effects of solar
radiation. British scientists first discovered ozone
losses over much of the globe, including a hole in
the ozone layer over Antarctica, in 1985. This hole
has been growing steadily and its edges now reach
Emissions trading
Emissions trading schemes are designed to allow
businesses to reduce their emissions of greenhouse
gases in the most economically efficient way.
The UK scheme is the world's first economy-wide
greenhouse gas trading scheme. It works by giving
individual companies and installations a cap, which
when added together form an overall emissions cap
for the trading scheme. As long as the aggregate
target is achieved, the individual emission
contributions do not matter. Participating companies
can either meet their individual target by reducing
their own emissions; reduce their emissions below
their target and sell or bank the excess 'emissions
allowances'; or let their emissions remain above
target, and buy emissions allowances from other
participants. Across the whole scheme those with
low-cost emission reduction opportunities will tend
to sell allowances to those with higher cost options,
thereby minimising the overall cost of delivering a
set of environmental benefits.
Thirty-four organisations, including some of the
largest businesses, have joined the UK scheme,
which started in April 2002. Over the five years of
the scheme, the companies have agreed to cut their
greenhouse gas emissions by more than 12 million
tonnes of C02. This represents over 5 per cent of
the planned reduction in the UK's annual emissions
by 2010.
beyond the Antarctic continent to the tip of South
America. Similar, but less dramatic, thinning of
the ozone layer occurs over the North Pole each
year as well. Ozone depletion is caused by man¬
made chemicals containing chlorine or bromine,
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and halons.
These chemicals have been used in aerosol sprays,
refrigerators and fire extinguishers.
In an effort to repair this damage, over 170
countries have ratified the Montreal Protocol, an
international treaty for the protection of the
stratospheric ozone layer. This is enforced in the
UK by an EC Regulation.

stations) and ammonia (NH3 - mainly from

being deposited directly on to vegetation and soil
or being washed out as acid rain. Acidification
results when sensitive ecosystems are not capable
of neutralising the deposited acidity. In the UK,
the ecosystems that are most sensitive to
acidification are located in the northern and
western uplands. The damaging effects of high
levels of acid deposition on soils, freshwater, trees,
and buildings, have been demonstrated by
scientific research.
The National Expert Group on Transboundary Air
Pollution advises the Government and devolved
administrations on biological and chemical trends
in the UK environment and the prospects for
ecosystem recovery as a result of current and
projected transboundary air pollution. In 2001
it published its draft report for comment,
Transboundary Air Pollution: Acidification,
Eutrophication and Ground Level Ozone in the UK.
The UK is a party to the UNECE (United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe) Convention
on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution,
which was set up in 1979 in response to evidence
that acidification of lakes in Scandinavia was
linked to emissions of S02 from other countries in
Europe, including the UK. Under the Convention,
there have been a number of protocols to reduce
emissions of acidifying pollutants. The latest
Gothenburg Protocol, signed in December 1999,
tackles the three environmental problems of
acidification, eutrophication4 and ground-level
4 The process by which pollution from sewage or fertilisers
stimulates excessive growth of algae. Death and decomposition of
the algae depletes the oxygen content of the water, resulting in

ozone (summer smog). Under the Protocol, the
UK agreed annual emission ceilings of 625
kilotonnes for S02, 1,181 kilotonnes for NOx and
297 kilotonnes for NH3, to be achieved by 2010.
By comparison, UK emissions in 2000 were 1,165
kilotonnes for S02, 1,512 kilotonnes for NOx, and
2975 kilotonnes for NH3 (see Table 19.9). The
Protocol also sets a ceiling of 1,200 kilotonnes for
VOCs (for example, solvents used in industry,
domestic products, dry cleaning, paints and fumes
at petrol pumps). VOCs contribute to the
formation of ground-level ozone, and in 2000 the
UK emitted 1,498 kilotonnes of these compounds.
Running in parallel with the UNECE Gothenburg
Protocol is the EC National Emission Ceilings
Directive (NECD), provisionally agreed in June
2001, which is intended to tackle the harmful
effects to human health and the environment from
transboundary air pollution. The NECD sets
ceilings for 2010 for the same four pollutants. The
figures negotiated commit the UK to further cuts
in S02 and NOx emissions, reducing the ceilings to
585 kilotonnes and 1,167 kilotonnes respectively.
Noise
Noise, whether from the house next door or from
aircraft flying overhead, can seriously affect
people’s quality of life. DEFRA is responsible for
the co-ordination and development of policies and
the promotion of initiatives to address the
problem of noise in England. The Welsh Assembly
Government, Scottish Executive and the DOE in
Northern Ireland have equivalent responsibilities.
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their areas
for ‘statutory nuisances’, including noise nuisance
from premises and vehicles, machinery or
equipment in the street. They must take
reasonable steps to investigate complaints, and
serve a noise abatement notice where it is judged
to be a statutory nuisance. There are specific
provisions in law to control noise from
construction and demolition sites, to control the
use of loudspeakers in the streets and to enable
individuals to take independent action through the
courts against noise nuisance.
The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health
found that there were just over 118,000
neighbour noise incidents reported in 2000/01 in
England and Wales, by far the largest category of
5 Excluding emissions classified under 'Nature'.
285
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
noise complaints received by councils. Almost
half of the complaints substantiated were dealt
with informally. The Government completed
a consultation on a proposed national ambient
noise strategy in spring 2002. The strategy will
include mapping the main sources and areas of
noise to enable policy to take better account of
the implications of noise sources for rural areas.
The first stage is expected to be completed by
2004, and £13 million has been allocated for this.
The Noise Incidence Survey (NIS) and the Noise
Attitude Survey (NAS) are undertaken by DEFRA
to establish a baseline for, and monitor changes
in, the noise climate in Britain. They were
conducted nationally in 2000/01 and 1999/2000
respectively, following up similar surveys in 1990
and 1991.
The NIS generates objective assessments of the
pattern of the noise exposure of the population.
It found that over the last decade changes in
outdoor noise level and exposure to noise have
been small. Typical outdoor sound levels during
the day decreased between 1990 and 2000, while
there has been a slight worsening of levels during
the night.
The NAS found that 21 per cent of respondents
reported that noise spoilt their home life to some
extent. Road traffic noise could be heard by 84 per
cent, and 40 per cent were bothered, annoyed or
disturbed by it to some extent. The proportion
of respondents who reported being adversely
affected by noise from neighbours has increased
over the last ten years. The survey found that 81
per cent of respondents heard noise from
neighbours and/or other people nearby and 37
per cent were bothered, annoyed or disturbed to
some extent. However, 69 per cent reported
general satisfaction with their noise
environment.
Compensation may be payable for loss in property
values caused by physical factors, including noise
from new or improved public works such as roads,
railways and airports. Highway authorities (in
Scotland, local road authorities and the Scottish
Executive, in Wales the Assembly Government and
local authorities, and in Northern Ireland, DARD’s
road service) are required to make grants available
for the insulation of homes when they are subject
to specified levels of increased noise caused by new
or improved roads. Equivalent regulations exist for
railways.
The Department for Transport is to carry out a
major study to reassess attitudes to aircraft noise,
and will ensure that both environmental and
aviation interests can contribute to the oversight of
the project.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents about 15 per cent
of the total exposure to ionising radiation of the
UK population - most radiation occurs naturally
(for example from the radon gas given off by some
rock formations, particularly granite). A large
proportion of the exposure to man-made
radiation comes from medical sources, such as
X-rays. This and other man-made radiation is
subject to stringent control. Users of radioactive
materials must be registered by the Environment
Agency, SEPA or the Chief Radiochemical
Inspector in Northern Ireland as appropriate. The
Health and Safety Executive (HSE - see page 137)
is responsible for regulating safety at civil nuclear
installations. The National Radiological
Protection Board (NRPB) advises on health risks
posed by radiation and how to guard against
them.
Radioactive waste management
All solid radioactive waste in the UK is either
disposed of in suitable facilities on land or safely
stored pending the adoption of a final
management strategy. The Government and
devolved administrations started a major
programme of consultation and research,
Managing radioactive waste safely, in 2001, which
aims to arrive at such a strategy. Radioactive
wastes vary widely in nature and level of activity,
and the methods of management reflect this. Most
solid waste - of low radioactivity - is disposed of
at the shallow disposal facility at Drigg in
Cumbria. Some small quantities of very low-level
waste are disposed of at authorised landfill sites.
Some intermediate-level waste is stored at nuclear
licensed sites, usually those sites where it is
generated, but most of the UK’s inventory is at
Sellafield in Cumbria. High-level or heat¬
generating waste is stored in either raw (liquid) or
vitrified (glass-like) form. Once vitrified it will be
stored for at least 50 years to allow it to cool to
a safe temperature for final management.
International commitments
An EC Directive lays down basic standards for the
protection of the health of workers and the general
public against the dangers arising from ionising
radiation. The provisions of the Directive are
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
implemented in the UK through a number of Acts
including the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. The
UK is also a Contracting Party to the International
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive
Waste Management.
The contracting parties to the Oslo and Paris
Convention on the Protection of the Marine
Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR),
including the UK, have agreed to reduce
radioactive discharges to the North East Atlantic
so that by 2020 concentrations of radioactive
substances in the marine environment would be
almost reduced to historic levels.
In July 2002 the Government and the devolved
administrations published the UK Radioactive
Discharge Strategy 2001-2002, which set out how
the UK will implement OSPAR. The Government
is also consulting on new statutory guidance to the
Environment Agency on the regulation of
radioactive discharges from licensed nuclear sites
in England. Similar arrangements will apply in
other parts of the UK.
Water
Freshwater environment
Freshwater habitats in the UK include rivers, lakes
and ponds, and wetlands such as fens, bogs and
reedbeds. Many invertebrates and all amphibians
native to the UK are dependent on fresh waters,
and there are 38 native species of freshwater fish.
In addition, a large number of bird species, and
two ‘rare or threatened’ mammals, the otter and
water vole, depend on aquatic habitats.
Despite the high rainfall in the UK, there are
limited natural and man-made capacities for
storage, and the country’s high population density
means there is relatively little water per person.
Available resources of water include rivers,
reservoirs and underground aquifers, but these
must be carefully managed. The Environment
Agency’s strategy for water resource management
considers both environmental and socio-economic
factors (see chapter 28).
Marine environment
The seas around the UK support a wide variety of
plants and animals, and are a source of both food
and fuel. However, marine life and the food chain
can be put at risk by pollution and overfishing.
DEFRA and the devolved administrations have
responsibility for protecting the UK’s seas and
coastal waters. In May 2002 DEFRA published
Safeguarding Our Seas - the first marine
stewardship report, which set out the
Government’s strategy for the conservation and
sustainable development of the marine
environment.
Government policy is not to permit any deposit of
waste in the sea when there is a safe land-based
alternative, unless it can be demonstrated that
disposal at sea is the best practicable option.
Disposal of sewage sludge at sea ceased at the end
of 1998. The only types of waste that are now
routinely considered for deposit in the sea are
dredged material from ports and harbours, and
small quantities of fish waste.
Through the OSPAR Convention the UK and
other contracting parties have put in place
strategies which aim to promote diversity and
tackle the threats posed to the marine
environment by hazardous substances,
eutrophication and offshore industries.
Decisions about which areas of the UK
Continental Shelf should be made available for
petroleum licensing take account of advice from
the JNCC. Where areas are made available for
exploration and development, special conditions
may be imposed on the licence holders to
minimise or avoid any impact on the marine
environment. These conditions are agreed with
the JNCC.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency
(see page 324) is responsible for dealing with
spillages of oil or other hazardous substances from
ships at sea. The various counter-pollution
facilities for which it is responsible include
remote-sensing surveillance aircraft; aerial and
seaborne spraying equipment; stocks of oil
dispersants; mechanical recovery and cargo
transfer equipment; and specialised beach cleaning
equipment. The Agency has an Enforcement Unit
at its headquarters in Southampton for
apprehending ships making illegal discharges of oil
and other pollutants off the British coast. The
maximum fine for pollution from ships is
£250,000 in cases heard in magistrates’ courts.
Water quality
In the UK, about 96 per cent of the population live
in properties connected to a sewer, and the waste
287
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
water from the majority of these properties is
given secondary treatment6 or better. Continued
investment in the sewerage system and improving
sewage treatment standards will be made up to
2005, and is expected to deliver:
■ greater compliance with the EC Bathing
Waters Directive;
■ at least secondary treatment for all significant
discharges from sewage treatment works;
■ improved compliance with river quality
objectives; and
■ improvements to almost 4,700 Combined
Sewer Overflows (CSOs) that are currently
regarded as unsatisfactory due to their
environmental impact.
Water quality in England and Wales has continued
to show steady improvement in recent years.
Scottish ministers published a consultation paper
in June 2001, entitled Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: the
Future for Scotland’s Waters, which contains
proposals for a new approach to the sustainable
management of the natural water environment in
Scotland and for implementing the EC Water
Framework Directive. A second consultation
paper, The future for Scotland’s waters, proposals for
legislation, followed in February 2002. Primary
legislation to implement the Directive was
introduced in the Scottish Parliament in June
2002.
In November 2000 the Government published a
draff Water Bill which includes measures to
improve customer protection, by setting up an
independent consumer council; improvements to
water conservation and drought planning; and
improvements to the water abstraction licensing
system in England and Wales. For details on the
water supply industry and the Drinking Water
Inspectorate, see page 447.
6 The preliminary treatment of sewage involves screening to
remove rags, grit and other solids. Primary treatment involves a
physical and/or chemically enhanced settlement of suspended
solids not removed by preliminary treatment. Secondary treatment
involves 'biological' treatment - using bacteria to break down the
biodegradable matter in waste water.

Discharges to inland waters, coastal waters and
groundwaters
All discharges to water in the UK are regulated. In
England and Wales the Environment Agency
controls water pollution by issuing legally binding
documents, known as consents, for all effluent
discharges into controlled waters (groundwaters,
inland and coastal waters). The effluent quality is
monitored against the conditions set within the
consents. The Agency maintains public registers
containing information about water quality,
performance and compliance, consents,
authorisations and monitoring. Trade effluent
discharges to the public sewers are controlled by
the water companies.
In Scotland, controlling water pollution is the
responsibility of SEPA; appeals are dealt with by
the Scottish Executive and trade effluent
discharges to the public sewer are controlled by
Scottish Water.
In Northern Ireland, the EHS is responsible for
controlling water pollution. In 2001 a cost
recovery scheme of application fees in respect of
all discharges to waterways and underground
strata was introduced. In addition, from 2002/03,
annual charges are payable by those industries that
discharge effluent to waterways and underground
strata that are subject to compliance sampling by
the EHS.
In 2000, the Environment Agency responded to
47,840 reports of environmental pollution in
England and Wales; 36,406 were substantiated.
The number of category 1 (the most significant)
incidents fell to 77 in 2000, the lowest number
288
Environmental affairs
19 The environment
since records began in 1997. In 2000/01, SEPA
substantiated 2,345 routine water pollution
incidents in Scotland; the DOE responded to 2,582
reports in Northern Ireland, of which 1,701 were
substantiated.
Under the 1999 Groundwater Regulations, certain
listed dangerous substances may only be disposed
of to land following prior investigation and
authorisation. An authorisation will not be
granted if the investigation reveals that List I
substances could enter, or List II substances could
pollute, groundwater. The regulations also give the
Environment Agency (in England and Wales) and
SEPA (in Scotland) powers to stop activities which
might cause groundwater pollution.
One of the major causes of water pollution is oil
leaking from storage tanks. The Control of
Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations
2001 require commercial and industrial oil stores
to have secondary containment, such as a ‘bund’
(surrounding wall) or a drip tray.
Diffuse pollution from agriculture
Agricultural nutrients, pesticides, microbes from
livestock manure, and soil erosion from
agricultural land all cause water pollution. In
England, the Government is conducting a review
to identify cost effective measures to tackle such
problems.
One aspect of this wider problem is nitrate
pollution arising from the application of inorganic
fertiliser and manure on farmland. The
designation of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs),
under the EC Nitrates Directive, is intended to
reduce or prevent this pollution. An area is
designated as an NVZ when the nitrate
concentrations in its ground or surface water
exceed or are likely to exceed 50 mg/litre. Sixty-
eight NVZs were designated in England and
Wales in 1996, and a further two in Scotland and
three in Northern Ireland. The Government and
the devolved administrations are now in the
process of designating additional NVZs. In
England, together with existing zones, these will
cover 55 per cent of the country, while in Scotland,
the Executive announced the designation of some
14 per cent of the total area of Scotland as NVZs
in June 2002.
Farmers in NVZs are required to follow rules
(known as Action Programme Measures’),
controlling the timing and rate of application of
fertilisers and organic manure. This will have the
effect primarily of safeguarding drinking water
supplies, and, secondarily, of curtailing wider
ecological damage in the form of eutrophication
of freshwater and saline waters.
Bathing waters and coastal sewage discharges
Bathing water quality is influenced by natural
factors (such as temperature, salinity and
sunlight), discharges from coastal sewerage
treatment works, storm water overflows and river
borne pathogens (that is, pollutants that could
affect human health), and run-off from urban and
agricultural land. Over the past 11 years the overall
quality of UK bathing waters has improved
considerably. In 2001, 95 per cent of UK waters
complied with the mandatory coliform (bacteria,
found in the intestine and faeces of most animals)
standards of the EC Bathing Waters Directive,
compared with 94 per cent in 2000 and 77 per
cent in 1990. The North East and Thames regions
in England achieved 100 per cent compliance.
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland achieved
93, 85 and 81 per cent respectively.
The Scottish Executive launched a bathing water
strategy in 2002, to help in its aim of meeting
European bathing water standards on all 60
Scottish bathing waters. The SE has identified nine
bathing waters as sensitive under the EC Urban
Waste Water Treatment Directive; the Welsh
Assembly has identified 24 Welsh bathing waters;
and DEFRA has declared 180 coastal areas in
England. The identification confirms that
advanced treatment has been or will be provided
to discharges into the bathing waters from local
waste water treatment works.
In 2002 ENCAMS (see page 279) gave Seaside
Awards {www.seasideawards.org.uk) to 317 beaches
in the UK for meeting appropriate standards of
water quality and beach management. The Awards
provide information about a wide range of
beaches in the UK and are given to beaches that
comply with the EC Bathing Waters Directive
mandatory standards, are clean, safe and well
managed; and provide appropriate information
about water quality.
The European Blue Flag Campaign
{www.blueflag.org) is an initiative of the
Foundation of Environmental Education in
Europe and is administered in the UK by
ENCAMS. To be considered, a beach must have

83 beaches in the UK were awarded a ‘Blue Flag’,
compared with 55 in 2001, and 27 marinas won
recognition in the ‘Blue Flag’ for marinas category.
Business and the consumer
Business has an important role to play in
environmental matters. A DEFRA survey found
that in 1999 UK industry spent an estimated £4.1
billion on environmental protection expenditure.
This is spending by companies where the primary
aim is to reduce environmental pollution, for
example reducing emissions to air or water, to
protect soil and groundwater or to prevent noise
and vibration.
The Envirowise {www.enviwwise.gov.uk)
programme promotes the use of better
environmental practices that reduce business costs
for industry and commerce. It provides information
and advice on environmental technologies and
techniques by means of publications, events and a
freephone UK helpline. In 2001 it helped businesses
generate savings of £178 million and reduce solid
waste by 1.6 million tonnes. It works in partnership
with the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme
(EEBPP) (see page 446), which supports energy
efficiency measures.
Other government initiatives to encourage
environmentally sound practices include:
■ the Climate Change Projects Office, launched
in May 2001, which exists to help UK firms
tackle climate change and take advantage of
new opportunities and markets in low carbon
technology;
■ the Sustainable Technologies Initiative (STI),
which provides financial support for
developing new technologies that will help
businesses to be more efficient in their use of
resources, and produce less waste and
pollution; and
■ the Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment (ACBE) {www.defra.gov.uk/
environment/acbe), which provides a forum
for government and business to discuss
environmental issues. The ACBE was
instrumental in the establishment of the
Carbon Trust in April 2001 (see page 446).
Environmental management systems
An environmental management system provides
organisations with a tool to help them control and
minimise the impact of their products, services
and activities on the environment. Two recognised
models exist. One is the international management
system, ISO 14001, the other the EU
Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS),
which is based on the international standard but
additionally requires the reporting of
environmental performance. Both require auditing
by an accredited independent third party. In the
UK accreditation is provided by the UK
Accreditation Service (UKAS).
Many leading companies now address
environmental issues in their annual reports and
over 90 such companies publish separate
environmental performance reports. To encourage
the top 350 UK businesses to report publicly on
their major environmental impacts, the
Government has produced guidance to help
companies measure and report on greenhouse gas
emissions, water consumption and waste.
Environmental labelling
Consumers often rely on the information given on
product labels when trying to choose
environment-friendly goods. To help them, the
Government encourages accurate and relevant
environmental labelling, as part of an integrated
approach to reduce the environmental impact of
consumer products. Through DEFRA, it also
administers the voluntary EU ecolabelling award
scheme in the UK. The voluntary Green Claims
Code sets out guidance for businesses that make
environmental claims about their products, and
provides an introduction to ISO 14021 - the
international standard on environmental
labelling.
The Government’s Market Transformation
Programme aims to encourage the take-up of
more energy-efficient domestic appliances. The
mandatory EU energy labelling scheme provides
graded information on product performance, and
EU measures have also resulted in the removal of
inefficient appliances from the market.

The United Kingdom is a relatively densely
populated country, with 242 people per square
kilometre in 2001. The number of households is
projected to increase (in England, for example,
from 20.2 million in 1996 to 24.0 million in 2021).
These changes, together with an increase in the
population and the demands of a growing
economy, mean there are pressures on land use. In
2001 a buoyant housing market led to average UK
house prices being almost twice that of 1993.
Various measures were introduced which
attempted to help certain groups, such as nurses,
to buy homes in areas where accommodation was
particularly expensive. Throughout the UK a
number of programmes continue to work to
regenerate areas which have been in decline and in
need of investment.
Housing
Following a government reorganisation in 2002,
the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)
has taken over responsibility for determining
housing policy in England and supervising the
housing programme. Responsibility for housing
policy in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
rests with the devolved administrations. They all
work with local authorities (which are responsible
for preparing local housing strategies) and with
the private and voluntary sectors. Social housing
(housing at below market rent) is provided by
local authorities, registered social landlords (RSLs)
— most of which are housing associations — and
the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE).
RSLs are registered by the Housing Corporation
(in England), the National Assembly for Wales
(NAW) and Communities Scotland, through
Development plans 304
Development control 305
Regeneration 306
England 306
Wales 308
Scotland 308
Northern Ireland 309
which bodies they also receive government
funding. In Northern Ireland, the Housing
Division of the Department for Social
Development funds the NIHE and the housing
association movement, and has regulatory powers
over both.
The Government issued a housing policy
statement in December 2000, The Way Forward for
Housing, which set out its strategy for ensuring
that everyone in England has the opportunity to
The decent home standard
In order to set and monitor progress against its
decent social housing target for England, the former
Department for Transport, Local Government and
the Regions (DTLR) established the decent home
standard. A decent home is one which:
■ meets the current statutory minimum for
housing, which at present is the 'fitness
standard';
■ is in a reasonable state of repair;
■ has reasonably modern facilities; and
■ provides a reasonable degree of thermal comfort
through effective insulation and efficient
heating.
It is estimated by ODPM that in England in April
2001, 1.7 million social rented homes (40 per cent
of the social housing stock) were below a decent
standard. Further information on the decent home
standard can be found on the ODPM website.

live in a ‘decent home’ (see box). The aim is to
deliver greater quality and choice across the
housing market, through improving the quality of
stock in all tenures; improving the quality of
housing services; delivering affordable housing
where it is needed; and giving people greater
choice over where they live. As part of its 2000
Spending Review, the Government set a target to
bring all housing provided by local authorities and
RSLs in England up to decent home standard by
2010, with a third of improvements taking place
by 2004. By 2003/04 annual capital investment in
housing will be more than £4 billion, compared
with just over £1.5 billion planned spending in
1997/98.
The Government’s 2002 Spending Review (see
page 350) announced an additional £1.4 billion
over three years to help provide well-designed,
affordable homes where they are needed, improve
stock conditions in both the social and the private
sectors, and tackle the problem of low demand
that is causing homes to be abandoned in certain
areas.
In addition, the Supporting People programme, a
policy and funding framework for the delivery of
housing support services in England, will begin in
2003. The programme aims to help vulnerable
people improve their quality of life by delivering
housing support services to complement existing
care services. It is hoped that a wider range of
people will be able to live independently in their
own homes than at present. Supporting People
will be delivered on a partnership basis involving
local government, other local statutory agencies,
users, providers and voluntary agencies.
Better Homes for People in Wales, which sets out
the National Assembly’s plans for a national
housing strategy for Wales, was published in
September 2001. The strategy placed emphasis on
improving the quality of rented housing, both
social and private, continuing support for
sustainable home ownership, tackling
homelessness, providing help and advice for
elderly and disabled people, meeting the needs of
disadvantaged households and eradicating fuel
poverty by 2010.
The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 contained a series
of reforms on tenancy rights in the social rented
sector, including a modernised right to buy (see
page 300) and improved arrangements for tenant
involvement. It established a single tenancy (the
Scottish secure tenancy) for tenants of both local
authorities and RSLs; provided an enhanced
strategic housing role for local authorities; and
established Communities Scotland, an executive
agency of the Scottish Executive, as a single
regulator of providers of social housing. It also
strengthened and extended the rights of homeless
people, and introduced changes to the system of
improvement and repairs grants.
In Northern Ireland a new housing Bill was sent
out for consultation in March 2002 and was
introduced into the Assembly in June 2002. Key
proposals include: a more flexible system of grants
to deal with unfit housing, particularly in rural
areas; measures to deal more effectively with anti¬
social behaviour; and stricter controls on houses
in multiple-occupancy.
Housing stock and housebuilding
In 1951 there were 14 million dwellings in the
United Kingdom. By 2001 the number had
increased to 25 million. The peak for
housebuilding in the UK was in 1968 when total
Housing in 1952
The damage caused to the nation's housing stock
during the Second World War exacerbated existing
shortages:
'Out of about 13 million houses in the United
Kingdom at the outbreak of war in 1939, nearly
4.5 million were damaged or destroyed by
enemy action: 210,000 houses were totally
destroyed, 250,000 were so badly damaged as
to be rendered uninhabitable, and 4 million
received slight damage. The number of houses
completed between September 1939 and May
1945 (most of which were under construction on
the day war broke out) did not exceed 200,000'
{Britain Yearbook 1949-50).
By 1952 the Government was still dealing with the
consequences and the provision of new housing
became a major post-war priority:
'In January 1952 the Government decided that
there should be no fixed limit to the housing
programme. House production would be
expanded over the next three years as rapidly as
the resources of materials and labour that could
be made available would allow'{Britain
Yearbook 1954).

completions amounted to 426,000 dwellings:
226,000 completed by private enterprise and
200,000 by the public sector (primarily local
authorities). In 2000/01 there were 178,000
completions in the UK. While local authorities are
no longer major developers of new housing, they
still play an important role as landlords. RSLs
(predominantly housing associations) dominate
building in what is now called the social sector,
although in 2000/01 private sector enterprise was
responsible for 86 per cent of all dwellings
completed. Figure 20.1 shows the number of
homes built in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland
and the English regions in 2000/01. Scotland had
the most completions (when private and social
housing are added together). However, the
number of homes completed per 1,000 resident
households ranged from five in London to 18 in
Northern Ireland.
The type of dwellings built has changed over the
last century. Terraced housing was the norm
before the First World War and over a third of the
current stock of terraced housing dates from
before 1919. Between 1919 and 1944 there was an
expansion in the number of semi-detached
dwellings. After 1965 the private sector began to
build more detached houses, while a large number
of purpose-built flats were provided in the public
sector. Figure 20.2 illustrates the type of
accommodation households were living in, by
2000/01.
To minimise greenfield development (that is,
building on land that has not previously been
developed) and to encourage urban regeneration,
the Government wishes to see unoccupied homes
brought back into use. The number of empty
homes in England fell from 868,600 in 1993 to
755,100 in 2001. Four-fifths of vacant dwellings
are private housing, with about half of these
having been vacant for six months or more. Some
dwellings are vacant for short periods between
purchase and sale or re-let (known as

Home ownership
Between 1981 and 2001 the number of owner-
occupied dwellings in the United Kingdom
increased by more than 40 per cent, while the
number of rented dwellings fell by around 15 per
cent. By 2001 over 17 million dwellings were
owner-occupied, more than double the number of
rented dwellings, which numbered 8 million (see
also Table 20.3).
The increase in the proportion of dwellings that
are owner-occupied is in part due to a number of
schemes that aim to increase low-cost home
ownership. In England these include the Right to
Buy, Right to Acquire and Voluntary Purchase
Grants, which offer tenants in social housing a
discount against the market value of the homes
they rent if they are eligible and choose to buy
them. In addition, funding to support low-cost
ownership is provided through the Housing
Corporation and local authorities, including:
■ Conventional Shared Ownership, which allows
people to part buy and part rent homes
developed by RSLs. The scheme allows people
to increase their share of ownership in their
home over time;
■ Do-It-Yourself Shared Ownership, which is
funded by local authorities in partnership
with RSLs and enables people to select a
house in the private market and then part
own and part rent it, with the RSL taking on
ownership of the rented share of the
property;
■ Homebuy, which allows people to buy a home
in the private market with an equity loan
from an RSL for 25 per cent of the value of
the property. The loan is repayable, at 25 per
cent of the current market value, when the
home is sold; and
■ the Cash Incentive Scheme, in which local
authorities offer cash grants to its existing
tenants for the purchase of a home in the
private market.
Properties defined as being owner-occupied fall
into two legal categories, either freehold
(predominantly houses) or leasehold (mainly
flats). Under a freehold, the purchaser has legal
ownership of the dwelling and the land it is sited
on for an indefinite period. A leasehold provides
the purchaser with ownership of the dwelling for a
fixed period, during which time ownership of the
land remains with the freeholder. On expiry of the
lease, ownership of the dwelling reverts to the
freeholder. During the period of the lease,
leaseholders must pay the freeholder ground rent
and property maintenance costs. The freeholder is
legally responsible for maintaining the structural
condition of the building and ensuring that it is
adequately insured.
The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002
introduced ‘commonhold’, a new form of tenure
for multi-occupied properties where people own
295
Environmental affairs
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
their individual unit outright. The Act also
provides new rights for residential leaseholders in
England and Wales, including a right for
leaseholders to manage their properties and the
extension of the existing right to buy their
freehold. Leaseholders in blocks of flats are
entitled to buy the freehold of their property
jointly, with other leaseholders in their property.
In addition, the new Act provides a range of
safeguards to leaseholders including the right to
challenge unreasonable service at a Leasehold
Valuation Tribunal (LVT). The LVTs currently deal
with a wide range of disputes involving residential
leasehold property, such as disputes over valuation
for the purposes of buying the freehold or
renewing the lease, and the appointment of
managing agents.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home ownership
scheme allowing purchasers to buy a home for 70
per cent of its value, the balance being secured as a
charge on the property. The Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association administers a ‘buy
half, rent half ’ (shared ownership) scheme. By
September 2002 it had helped 17,000 people
become homeowners. Over 98,700 NIHE tenants
have bought their homes.
In Scotland, Communities Scotland administers a
Housing Association Grant for low-cost home
ownership. The grant is used to bridge the
shortfall between the cost of provision and locally
assessed market value.
Key workers
The Starter Home Initiative (SHI), set up in 2000,
aims to help key workers in England, particularly
teachers, police officers, nurses and other essential
health workers, to buy homes within a reasonable
distance of their workplace in areas where high
house prices are undermining recruitment and
retention. The Government is making £250
million available over the years 2001/02 to
2003/04 in support of the scheme, mainly through
RSLs. Types of assistance vary and include equity
loans, interest-free loans and shared ownership.
The first key workers assisted under the scheme
moved into their homes in 2001.
Mortgage loans
A feature of home-ownership in the United
Kingdom is the relatively high proportion of
homes purchased with a mortgage. Approximately
Figure 20.4 Average house prices,1 UK
£
1 Current prices, not adjusted for inflation.
Source: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister
three-quarters of house purchases are financed
with a mortgage loan facility. In 2001, 77 per cent
of loans for home purchase were obtained
through banks and 18 per cent through building
societies, with 5 per cent through other lenders.
Lenders differ in the amount that they are willing
to lend relative to annual income. In 2001 the ratio
of the average advance to income for all borrowers
was 2.25 - 2.35 for first-time buyers and 2.23 for
existing owner-occupiers moving to another home.
Those who are buying a house can choose from a
variety of different types of mortgage, the most
common being repayment and interest-only. With
repayment mortgages, the debt and the interest
are both repaid during the life of the mortgage
(usually 25 years). Around 72 per cent of all new
mortgages were standard repayment mortgages in
2001. Interest-only mortgages, which include
endowment policies, ISAs (individual savings
accounts) and personal pensions, account for the
bulk of other mortgages. Since the late 1980s there
has been a decrease in the popularity of
endowment mortgages because of the possibility
that investments may not grow fast enough to
repay the capital borrowed. In 1988, 83 per cent of
new mortgages for house purchase were of this
type but by 2001 this had fallen to 10 per cent.
In 2000/01 average weekly mortgage payments for
owner-occupiers ranged from £40 in Northern
Ireland to £95 in London. The number of
properties taken into possession by mortgage
lenders in the United Kingdom in 2001 was
18,280, 20 per cent fewer than in 2000. The

number of mortgage accounts in arrears also fell,
by 6.5 per cent for mortgages with long-term
arrears (over 12 months).
The average dwelling price of properties bought
and sold in the United Kingdom in 2001 was
£112,835 (see Figure 20.4), although there were
marked regional variations with buyers in London
and the South East paying the most for their
property (see Table 20.5). Dwelling prices also
vary according to type, with detached houses
being the most expensive.
In December 2001 the Treasury announced that it
intended to give the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) responsibility for regulating the selling of
residential mortgages, including the provision of
advice associated with the sales process. The FSA
will authorise mortgage lenders and
administrators, and intermediaries who advise on
and arrange mortgages, regulate mortgage
advertising and require firms to disclose the main
features of loans clearly and openly. Statutory
regulation of mortgages will begin in mid-2004.
In September 2001 the Scottish Executive
announced the introduction of a Mortgage to
Rent Scheme, designed to allow families in
mortgage difficulties to avoid repossession and to
become tenants in their own homes. Funding of
£8.4 million is available for the scheme in the
period to 2003/04. Another measure to help
people experiencing difficulties with mortgage
payments is contained in the Mortgage Rights
(Scotland) Act 2001. This provides for people in
mortgage debt to seek suspension of the creditor’s
right of enforcement if, in the view of the court, it
is reasonable to do so.
Rented housing
As owner-occupation has increased, the number
of dwellings that are rented has decreased. In
2001, 21 per cent of UK households were renting
from the social sector (local authorities and RSLs),
while 10 per cent were renting privately.
Private rented sector
In its policy statement The Way Forward for
Housing, the Government set out its strategy to
encourage good practice in England through
voluntary accreditation schemes for landlords, via
the development of the national Approved
Lettings Scheme. The Government has also
proposed the mandatory national licensing of
297
Environmental affairs
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
housing in multiple occupation in order to
improve the standard of this type of housing. The
Government also plans to allow local authorities
to license private landlords if they chose.
‘Assured’ and ‘shorthold’ (in Scotland, ‘short
assured’) tenancies are the commonest forms of
arrangement for the letting of houses and flats by
private landlords. If the tenancy is shorthold, the
landlord can regain possession of the property six
months after the beginning of the tenancy,
provided that he or she gives the tenant two
months’ notice requiring possession. If the
tenancy is assured, the tenant has the right to
remain in the property unless the landlord can
prove to the court that he or she has grounds for
possession. In an assured tenancy, the landlord
does not have an automatic right to repossess the
property when the tenancy comes to an end. In
both types of tenancy the landlord can charge a
full market rent.
2002 transfers
In 2002 two of the largest local authority landlords,
Glasgow City Council and Birmingham City Council,
carried out ballots of their tenants. The tenants
voted on whether they were in favour of their
homes continuing to be owned and managed by the
local authority or whether they preferred the option
of transferring them to a single local housing
association (in Glasgow) or a network of local
community landlords (in Birmingham). The elections
were conducted by postal vote and were decided by
a simple majority.
Glasgow voted 'Yes' to transfer
Number of tenants voting - 50,802 (64.4 per cent).
Proportion voting for transfer to a housing
association - 58.3 per cent.
Proportion voting against transfer - 41.7 per cent.
Birmingham voted 'No' to transfer
Number of tenants voting - 61,593 (65.5 per cent).
Proportion voting for transfer to community
landlords - 33.2 per cent.
Proportion voting against transfer - 66.8 per cent.
Social housing
Much of the Government’s expenditure on social
housing is provided as subsidies to local
authorities to help pay for the costs of nearly 3.7
million rented council homes in the UK. More
than 2,000 housing associations, most of them
RSLs, provide other social housing (see also
Table 20.3). RSLs manage and build new homes
with the aid of government grants administered
through the Housing Corporation, the Welsh
Assembly Government, Communities Scotland
and NIHE.
Government policy aims to promote a wider
range of social landlords through stock transfers.
In England and Wales a Large Scale Voluntary
Transfer (LSVT) Programme has been running
since 1988. By July 2002, almost 650,000 dwellings
had been transferred from local authorities to
RSLs with the support of tenants and the approval
of the appropriate Secretary of State. The transfers
generated £4.5 billion in capital receipts, and
raised over £10 billion in private finance. Plans for
2002/03 involve 26 local authorities and 182,831
dwellings. An Order allowing local authorities on
an LSVT programme up to two financial years in
which to transfer came into effect in February
2002. In Scotland, three local authorities are
expected to transfer their entire stock of around
101,000 dwellings to RSLs in 2002/03.
Local authorities in Wales own around 200,000, or
approximately 15 per cent, of all Welsh homes. By
law they have to manage their own stock
efficiently and, in consultation with their tenants,
address current housing needs and demands.
The Scottish Executive has provided local
authorities with £148.5 million in capital
allocations for 2002/03. Communities Scotland
plans to invest £215 million in Scotland s housing
to help build 4,700 new and improved homes. The
majority of the homes will be for rent from RSLs,
and the remainder will be offered to first-time
buyers. In Northern Ireland the Government’s
contribution to housing of £170 million in
2001/02, supplemented by rental income and
capital receipts, meant that gross resources
available were £620 million. Under the Housing
(Scotland) Act 2001, the Executive has powers to
place government investment in housing under
council control, thus enhancing the role of local
authorities. The first local authority to receive
funding will be Glasgow City Council in April
2003. This means that local authorities are able to

20 Housing, planning and regeneration
distribute funds currently allocated to housing
associations via Communities Scotland.
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the
regional strategic housing authority for Northern
Ireland, is the landlord of 116,000 properties,
nearly one-third of rented properties in Northern
Ireland. It is responsible for assessing the need for,
and arranging the supply of, social housing.
Registered social landlords
Registered social landlords (RSLs) are the major
providers of new subsidised homes for those in
housing need. They range from almshouses to
large housing associations, managing thousands of
homes. They also include large-scale voluntary
transfer and local housing companies, set up to
own and manage council houses transferred from
local authorities. The Housing Corporation, which
regulates RSLs in England, gives capital grants to
provide homes for rent and for sale under shared
ownership terms, primarily from the Approved
Development Programme (ADP). Local
authorities also provide some capital funding in
the form of Social Housing Grant. In March 2002
the Housing Corporation announced an expanded
ADP for 2002/03, which aims to provide around
22,000 homes at a cost of £1.2 billion. This
includes funding for around 800 homes for rent
and 740 for sale in London, plus 550 under the
Homebuy scheme (see page 295) in the south of
England and the Midlands. Planned ADP funding
for 2003/04 is £1.2 billion.
In 2002/03 Communities Scotland will invest
almost £344 million in the regeneration of
Scotland’s communities. Of that total, £215
million will be spent on housing projects, helping
to complete more than 5,200 new and improved
homes already under way and allowing work to
start on another 4,700, mainly for rent through
housing associations. In addition, Communities
Scotland will assist the Scottish Executive in
delivering a range of policy initiatives.
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has
continued to transfer its new build programme to
registered housing associations. The 2003/04
programme will involve 110 new schemes
producing some 1,400 homes.
Improving existing housing
Poor quality housing can have an adverse impact
on health and well being. Although primary
responsibility for maintaining a property rests
with the owner, the Government can provide help
to improve housing quality across all tenures and
accepts that some people, especially the elderly
and most vulnerable, do not have the resources to
keep their homes in good repair. The Regulatory
Reform (Housing Assistance) Order, which came
into force in July 2002, prescribes how local
authorities can offer assistance to homeowners,
and private landlords, for the renovation of their
properties.
The Government intends to reform the legislation
on housing fitness. The current statutory housing
fitness standard (set out in the Housing Act 1985)
is based in part on criteria first introduced
approximately 80 years ago. To reflect a more
modern approach to health and safety hazards in
the home, the Government has developed the
Housing Health and Safety Rating System
(HHSRS). The HHSRS was made available to local
authorities in July 2000 and consultation on
enforcement arrangements took place in 2001.
Primary legislation will be required to implement
these proposals.
In Scotland, the Housing Improvement Task Force
was established in March 2001 to undertake a
comprehensive examination of the issues
affecting the condition and quality of private
sector housing and the process of buying and
selling houses in Scotland. Its work includes an
examination of the statutory and strategic
framework for improving private sector housing.
It will report its recommendations in early 2003.
Social housing
Most capital expenditure on social housing goes
towards renovating and improving existing local
authority housing. By 2003/04 resources provided
to local authorities in England for housing capital
investment will have risen to £2.6 billion a year,
from £0.9 billion in 1997/98. This is excluding
local authorities’ own contributions and the
Private Finance Initiative (PEI) which aims to
help councils work with the private sector in
providing social housing. The Government hopes
this, together with the Major Repairs Allowance
(MRA), will reduce the amount of poor quality
social housing by a third by 2004 and ensure that
all council housing is of a decent standard by
2010. The MRA in England ensures authorities
have the resources necessary to maintain their
stock. Funding for MRA was £1.6 billion in
2001/02 and will be £1.5 billion in 2002/03 and
299
Environmental affairs
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
£1.4 billion in 2003/04 (reflecting an estimated
fall in the number of council homes from 2.86
million in 2001/02 to 2.52 million by 2003/04).
In November 2001 the Government published its
Neighbourhood Renewal Implementation
Strategy to outline how it intends to achieve these
targets. In Scotland gross resources available to
local authorities for investment in their own stock
in 2001/02 were an estimated £356 million.
Private housing
Local authorities in England have discretionary
grant-giving powers to help homeowners and
tenants to repair their properties and assist in the
regeneration of communities. Local authorities
use these powers to fund around £250 million of
repairs for some 70,000 homeowners and tenants
a year. The Regulatory Reform (Housing
Assistance) Order gives local authorities a general
power to deliver private sector housing renewal
through grants, loans, loan guarantees and equity
release schemes.
Local authorities have similar powers in Scotland.
In July 2001 the Scottish Executive announced
modifications to this legislation. New types of
work will be eligible for grant, and a national test
of resources will be introduced, enabling those on
the lowest incomes to receive full grant funding
for necessary repairs and improvements. In
Northern Ireland, funding is allocated through the
house renovation grants scheme, administered by
the NIHE, on a similar basis to that in England
and Wales. In rural areas of Northern Ireland,
financial assistance to replace isolated dwellings
that cannot be restored is also available.
Rural housing
The Housing Corporation finances a special rural
programme to build houses in villages with a
population of 3,000 or less. Following the
publication of the Rural White Paper A Fair Deal
for England in November 2000, the Government
announced targets for the Corporation to approve
1,600 new homes in small villages by 2003/04. The
Corporation will also contribute to the
Government’s target of approving 9,000 homes a
year across all rural districts by 2003/04.
The National Assembly for Wales supports the
development of housing in rural areas if it is
regarded as a strategic priority by the local
authority. The consultation paper - Better Homes
for People in Wales - commented on the effect of
second homes and the Right to Buy (which has
removed many homes from the social housing
stock). Concerns have been raised about the
ability of local people to access affordable housing.
The National Assembly is considering further
restrictions on the Right to Buy and Right to
Acquire in rural areas in order to safeguard the
accessibility of low cost housing for local people.
Communities Scotland’s Rural Development
Programme provided 1,178 new and improved
homes across Scotland in 2001/02 and aims to
improve a further 1,266 in 2002/03. To address a
shortage of affordable housing in rural areas, the
Scottish Executive established the Rural
Partnership for Change. Its report in May 2001
made recommendations on identifying the areas
affected and strategies to respond to such
pressures. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001
provides for the limiting of Right to Buy in certain
areas by giving Scottish ministers authority to
designate an area as being a pressured area when it
considers the demand for social housing exceeds
that which is available. The Act also contains
initiatives to encourage private landlords to bring
empty properties back into a suitable condition
for renting.
In Northern Ireland, a revised rural housing
policy was introduced in April 2000. It included a
programme of rural housing needs assessment,
the planned development of around 120 new rural
dwellings a year, and the improvement or
replacement of some 600 rural cottages over the
next three to five years.
Homelessness
Local housing authorities in England and Wales
have a statutory obligation to ensure that suitable
accommodation is available for applicants who are
eligible for assistance, have become homeless
through no fault of their own and who fall within
a priority need group (this is the ‘main homeless
duty’). Among the priority need groups are
families with children, and households that
include someone who is vulnerable, for example
because of pregnancy, old age, or physical or
mental disability.
Where applicants are homeless but not owed the
‘main duty’ (for example, because they do not fall
within a priority need group) the housing
authority must ensure that they are provided with
advice and assistance in their own attempts to find

accommodation. Authorities also have a general
duty to ensure that advice about homelessness and
the prevention of homelessness is available free of
charge to everyone in their district. In most areas,
advice about homelessness is available from
housing aid centres, Shelter (a charity that offers
housing aid to homeless and badly housed people),
citizens advice bureaux and other local agencies.
The Homelessness Act 2002 introduced measures
aimed at helping homeless people. Housing
authorities must secure accommodation for these
groups until a settled home becomes available for
them. Local authorities must also have a strategy
for preventing homelessness in their district and
ensure that accommodation and any necessary
support will be available for homeless people. In
March 2002, the former DTLR released More than
a roof, a report outlining the Government’s
approach to tackling homelessness in England.
Table 20.6, which shows the number of households
accepted as being owed the main homeless duty in
2000/01, does not take account of variations in the
size of populations or differences in legislation
across the UK. In England and Wales, acceptances
per 1,000 resident households ranged from 3.5 in
Wales to 9.9 in London.
The number of homeless people housed by local
authorities in Bed and Breakfast (B&B)
accommodation in England rose from 4,630 in
1997 to 12,290 in 2001. Other types of
accommodation used for households accepted
under the legislation include hostels, women’s
refuges, properties owned by private landlords,
and dwellings owned by the local authority and let
on a non-secure tenancy.
In October 2001 the Government set up a Bed and
Breakfast Unit (BBU) with the aim of reducing the
use of accommodation where households are
placed in one or more rooms on a daily/nightly
charged basis and where they have to share
bathing, washing, toilet or cooking facilities. In
spring 2002 approximately 6,500 families with
children were living in B&B hotel-type
accommodation. The BBU aims to ensure that no
families with children will live in B&B hotels by
March 2004, except in an emergency and then for
no more than six weeks.
In Wales the Homelessness Commission was set
up in November 2000 with representatives from
the National Assembly, voluntary organisations,
local government groups and other practitioners.
The Commission submitted its final report to the
Assembly in August 2001 with 91
recommendations. The Assembly published its
response to these recommendations in May 2002,
along with a draft national homelessness strategy
for consultation.
In Scotland there were around 45,000 applications
under the homeless persons legislation during
2000/01. At the end of December 2001, 3,931
households were in various forms of temporary
accommodation. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001
includes a duty on local authorities to assess
homelessness in their area and to produce
strategies, setting out how they aim to prevent and
alleviate homelessness. The Act provides that
unintentionally homeless people in priority need
are entitled to permanent accommodation and
that there is a minimum package of rights for
non-priority applicants, including enhanced
advice, assistance and access to temporary
accommodation. The Act also introduces a
statutory right for the applicant to request a
review of the local authority’s decision and
provides that accommodation offered must meet
any special needs that he or she may have.
In 2002 the Homelessness Task Force released its
final report - Homelessness: An Action Plan for
Prevention and Effective Response - which sets out
301
Environmental affairs
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
an action plan for preventing and tackling
homelessness in Scotland. A Homelessness Bill is
planned for introduction to the Scottish
Parliament in late 2002 which will amend existing
Scottish homelessness legislation in the light of
the Task Force’s recommendations. Funding
totalling £38 million has been allocated to fund
the homelessness provisions of the 2001 Act and
to support the implementation of the Task Force’s
recommendations.
In Northern Ireland there were 14,164 applications
under the homeless persons legislation during
2001/02. A review of homelessness in Northern
Ireland was carried out in 2001 and found that it
had a higher rate of homelessness than in the rest
of the UK. The review made recommendations to
prevent homelessness; to help those in temporary
accommodation and to assess the specific needs of
those who are long-term homeless with a view to
supporting them into resettlement.
The Rough Sleepers Unit (RSU), established in
April 1999, has responsibility for delivering the
target of reducing rough sleeping in England to as
near to zero as possible and by at least two-thirds
by 2002. In December 2001 it announced that the
latter target had been met and estimated that the
number of people sleeping rough in England on
any single night was around 530. This represents a
reduction of 71 per cent since 1998.
Over the three years to 2004, £3.5 million is being
made available to support projects whose aim is to
reduce the number of people sleeping rough in
Wales. In Scotland, the Executive has set a target
to remove the need for anyone to have to sleep
rough by 2003.
In December 2001 the Government published
Addressing the housing needs of Black and Minority
Ethnic People, an action plan bringing together
current and planned ODPM housing policies and
initiatives aimed at meeting the housing needs of
black and minority ethnic people in England. The
Welsh Assembly Government published its own
action plan - Black, Minority Ethnic Housing
Action Plan for Wales - in September 2002.
Land use planning
Planning systems regulate development and land
use, and contribute to the Government’s strategy
for promoting a sustainable pattern of physical
development in cities, towns and the countryside.
In Great Britain land use planning is the direct
responsibility of local authorities. They prepare
development plans and determine most planning
applications. The ODPM and the devolved
administrations have overall responsibility for the
operation of the system. They issue national
planning policy guidance, approve structure plans
(except in Wales where unitary authorities have
this role), decide planning appeals and determine
planning applications that raise issues of national
importance. In England the ODPM operates
through the Government Offices for the Regions
and the Planning Inspectorate.
In Northern Ireland, the Department of the
Environment (DOE) functions as the single
planning authority. The Planning Service, an
executive agency within the DOE, is responsible
for issuing operational planning, policy and
guidance, determining planning applications and
preparing development plans.
England
There are just over 400 planning authorities in
England - including county councils, district
councils, unitary authorities and National Park
authorities. The first planning laws were enacted
in 1909 and the modern system dates from the
Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and
subsequent legislation in 1990 and 1991. The
Government’s national policy is set out in 25
Planning Policy Guidance notes (PPGs) - covering
issues such as housing, transport, sport and
recreation — and in 15 Minerals Policy Guidance
notes (MPGs) as well as circulars and other
guidance.
There are several tiers to the planning system.
Central government issues national planning
guidance to local authorities and also Regional
Planning Guidance (RPG) (based on advice from
regional planning conferences). Upper-tier local
authorities (such as county councils) produce
‘structure plans’, which indicate where
development should be focused, while lower-tier
local authorities (such as district councils)
produce ‘local plans’ with more detailed and site-
specific information. Local authorities decide
individual planning applications with reference to
these plans. They also prepare ‘economic
development strategies’, which can influence the
ability of a local plan to achieve its objectives. In
302
Environmental affairs
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
In December 2001 the Government issued a Green
Paper - Planning: Delivering a Fundamental Change
- which proposed changes to the planning system
in England. The proposals include the introduction
of new local planning frameworks, including action
area plans, faster processing of planning
applications, and cutting the decision time on
appeals to the Secretary of State. The paper aims to
simplify the system by replacing the multi-layered
structure of planning which currently exists at a
national, regional, county and local level, with a
two-tier system of local plans and regional plans. It
also proposes the creation of Business Zones, where
developers would be allowed to build in designated
areas without requiring specific planning approval.
This would be for low impact developments, which
would not put any strain on existing local services
or create massive demand for new housing.
London the Mayor has responsibility for
production of a ‘spatial development strategy’
covering development, regeneration and transport
issues in the capital.
Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 on Housing
provides national planning guidance on the future
of housebuilding and development in England. It
sets out proposals for planning authorities to
recycle brownfield (previously developed) sites
and empty properties in preference to greenfield
sites. It also encourages planning authorities to
use land more efficiently; assist with the provision
of affordable housing in both rural and urban
areas; and promote mixed-use developments that
integrate housing with shops, local services and
transport.
The Government’s national target is that, by 2008,
60 per cent of additional housing in England
should be provided on brownfield land or by re¬
using existing buildings. In 2002 it released
provisional figures showing that in 2001, 61 per
cent of new housing had been built on brownfield
land. Proportions varied regionally with London
having the highest proportion of new houses built
on brownfield land, 90 per cent, while in the
North East, South West and East Midlands less
than 50 per cent were built on brownfield sites.
Wales
National planning policy for Wales has existed
since 1996, and in March 2002 the Assembly
published Planning Policy Wales (PPW), its first
planning policy document. This includes:
Beddington Zero
Developed by the Peabody Trust, the Beddington
Zero Energy Development (BedZED) in the London
Borough of Sutton is the first large-scale carbon
neutral housing development. See also page 283.
Built on brownfield land reclaimed from disused
industry, BedZED is providing 82 homes for outright
sale, shared ownership, affordable rent for key
workers and social housing. The first residents
moved into their accommodation in April 2002. Key
features of the housing include:
■ wind cowls with heat exchangers on roofs to
provide ventilation;
■ super insulation on all external walls, roofs and
ground floors, and triple glazed windows, to
reduce heat loss; and
■ energy-saving appliances in kitchens.
■ keeping development away from flood risk
areas;
■ the possible establishment of Wales’ first Green
Belt areas;
■ development of land and buildings in a way
that creates a more accessible environment,
including for people with limited mobility;
■ guidance on the sustainable use of previously
developed land beyond housing needs alone;
■ encouraging both rural and farm
diversification; and
■ proposals to relax the control of developments
in the open countryside so that development
on farm complexes can be permitted (subject
to controls to prevent adverse environmental
and transport effects).
Scotland
Legislation for planning policy in Scotland is
contained in the Town and Country Planning Act
(Scotland) 1997. Nineteen National Planning
Policy Guidelines (NPPGs) provide statements of
Scottish Executive policy on nationally important
land use and other planning matters. Circulars
provide guidance on policy implementation and
Planning Advice Notes provide advice on good
practice. In March 2002 the Executive published
303
Environmental affairs
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
revisions to NPPG3: Planning for Housing, for
consultation. The policy aims to provide good
quality, well-located new housing consistent with
national and local planning policies.
Northern Ireland
The first piece of town and country planning
legislation specifically relating to Northern Ireland
was the Planning and Housing Act (NI) 1931.
Policy is currently contained in 11 Planning Policy
Statements. In February 2002 a consultation paper
was released with proposals for changes to the
planning system in Northern Ireland. Its aims
include speeding up decision-making (particularly
major planning applications) and effective public
participation in the planning process. The new
legislation is due to be placed before the Assembly
later in 2002.
Green Belts
Green Belts are areas of land that are intended to
be left open and protected from development. The
aim is to control the unrestricted sprawl of large
built-up areas, prevent towns from merging with
one another, preserve the heritage of historic
towns and encourage the recycling of derelict and
other urban land, thereby encouraging urban
regeneration. Not all Green Belt land is
countryside. It can cover small villages comprising
a mixture of residential, retail, industrial and
recreational land as well as fields and forests.
Development on Green Belts is only permitted
under exceptional circumstances.
The first major Green Belt was established around
the fringes of Greater London following legislation
in 1938. Green Belts have also been established
around Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Greater
Manchester, Merseyside and the West Midlands, as
well as several smaller towns. In 1997, there were
14 separate designated Green Belt areas in
England, amounting to 1.65 million hectares
(about 13 per cent of the land area). Between 1997
and 2000 some 3 per cent of new dwellings were
built within Green Belts, but three-fifths of these
were on previously developed land.
In Scotland there are six Green Belt areas totalling
156,000 hectares. Two further Green Belts
included in the Fife Structure Plan are now
approved in principle around St Andrews and part
of Dunfermline. There are 245,000 hectares of
Green Belt in Northern Ireland; this represents
about 18 per cent of the total land area. There are
no Green Belts at present in Wales, but their
creation is under consideration.
Development plans
Development plans play an integral role in
shaping land use and provide a framework for
consistent decision-making. Planning applications
are determined in accordance with relevant
development plan policies unless ‘material
considerations’ indicate otherwise. In England,
local planning authorities are required to prepare
development plans in line with the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990. Regulations, which
took effect in 2000, provide a statutory framework
for new procedures designed to improve the
delivery of development plans. Unless justified by
specific local considerations, plans should not
conflict with either national or regional policies.
In England, outside metropolitan areas and
certain non-metropolitan unitary authority areas,
the development plan comprises:
■ structure plans, which are produced by county
councils, some unitary authorities and
National Park authorities (in many cases on a
joint basis). They set out the key strategic
policies and provide a framework for local
plans;
■ local plans, which are produced by district
councils, some unitary authorities and
National Park authorities, and contain more
detailed policies to guide development in a
particular local authority area. The plans may
include proposals for specific sites; and
■ minerals and waste local plans, which are
produced by county councils, some unitary
authorities and National Park authorities
(which are usually the development control
authorities for these issues).
Within metropolitan areas and in some non¬
metropolitan unitary authorities, the development
plan comprises a single unitary development plan
(UDP). There are two parts to the UDP. Part I
consists of the local authority’s strategic policies
for the development and use of land in its area,
and forms the framework for the detailed

All unitary authorities and National Park
authorities in Wales are required to prepare a

UDP for their area. The UDP is the development
plan for each county or borough council and each
National Park, replacing the structure plan, local
plan and any other existing plan. Three-quarters
of the land area and almost 80 per cent of the
population of Wales are currently covered by area¬
wide plans. The Assembly is currently considering
the replacement of the requirement to produce
UDPs with Local Development Plans.
In Scotland, development plans are prepared by
local authorities and consist of structure and local
plans. In November 2000 the Scottish Executive
announced that current arrangements for strategic
planning would be reviewed. A consultation paper
was issued in June 2001 inviting views on a range
of issues, and details of the confirmed proposal for
change were published in June 2002. An objective
of these changes would be to guide investment in
new development and infrastructure by
identifying priority areas for physical renewal and
regeneration.
The Scottish Executive’s Planning Audit Unit
works with planning authorities to establish the
underlying reasons for contrasting development
control performance and to identify best practice
in handling planning applications. The work
covers development planning as well as
development control.
In Northern Ireland, the Planning Service put in
place its Development Plan Programme in 1998.
This is reviewed annually, and is designed to meet
the development planning needs of all districts. In
December 2001 the Planning Service launched the
Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan 2015 and released
a consultation paper concerning land use
proposals in the period to 2015 for six council
areas: Belfast, Carrickfergus, Castlereagh, Lisburn,
Newtownabbey and North Down.
Development control
Development control is the process for regulating
the development of land. Most forms of
development, such as the construction of new
buildings, alterations of existing buildings or
changes of land use, require permission from the
relevant planning authority. Applications are dealt
with on the basis of the development plans and
other material considerations, including national
and regional guidance.
In 2001/02 district planning authorities in
England received 582,000 applications for
permission, and made 534,000 decisions, granting
permission to 87 per cent of applications.
Householder developments accounted for 49 per
cent of all decisions in 2001/02, compared with 11
per cent for new dwellings and 18 per cent for
commercial and industrial developments. Other
decisions involved listed buildings or conservation
areas, advertisements, or change of use.
In 2001/02, 65 per cent of all planning decisions in
England were made within the statutory eight-
week period. The Government’s target is for 80
per cent of applications to be dealt with within
this timeframe. Similar targets apply in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. New targets in
England, for major and minor applications, came
into effect in April 2002.
In England, Wales and Scotland, a small number
of planning applications are referred for decision
to the Secretary of State, the Assembly, or the
Scottish ministers, rather than being decided by
the local planning authority. In general, this only
occurs where the planning issue is of more than
local importance. A small number are referred for
consideration at a public inquiry, such as the
Terminal 5 inquiry at London Heathrow Airport.
The public inquiry to establish the need for a fifth
terminal at the airport concluded with
government approval for the project. Work is
expected to begin on the site in 2004.
If a local authority refuses to grant planning
permission, grants it with conditions attached or
fails to decide an application within eight weeks
(or two months in Scotland), the applicant has a
right of appeal to the Secretary of State, the
Assembly or the Scottish ministers. In August 2000
a package of revised rules and guidance was
introduced aimed at speeding up decisions on
planning appeals in England. New arrangements
came into effect in Wales in 2002.
The Planning Inspectorate serves both the Deputy
Prime Minister in England and the National
Assembly for Wales on appeals and other
casework on planning, housing, the environment,
highways and related legislation. It also provides
information and guidance to appellants and other
interested parties about the appeal process. In
2001/02, over 14,000 planning appeal cases were
determined in England and Wales.
In Scotland, the Scottish Executive Inquiry
Reporters Unit is responsible for the

Planning Portal Programme
In the Modernising Government White Paper, the
Government made a commitment to ensure local
authorities are able to provide electronic delivery of
all their services by 2005. ODPM, the Welsh
Assembly Government and a number of local
authorities are developing the Planning Portal
Programme, which will deliver many planning
services over the Internet

and organises public local inquiries into planning
proposals and related matters. In Northern
Ireland, the applicant has the right of appeal to
the Planning Appeals Commission. Major
planning applications can be referred to a public
inquiry in certain circumstances.
Regeneration
Regeneration policies aim to enhance both the
economic and social development of communities
through a partnership between the public and
private sectors, with a substantial contribution
from the latter. They support and complement
other programmes tackling social and economic
decline, and initiatives such as Sure Start (see page
103), Health Action Zones (see page 162), the
Crime Reduction Programme (see page 185) and
the work of the Social Exclusion Unit (see page
98). Rundown areas in the UK benefit from
European Union Structural Funds, which assist a
variety of projects in the least prosperous
industrial, urban and rural areas of the European
Union. Over £10 billion of Structural Funds,
including £3 billion covering Objective 1 areas
(see page 340), have been allocated to the UK for
the period 2000-06.
England
In England, the Government and the nine
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) set out
the priorities for regeneration and ensure that new
programmes aim to enhance and complement
those already in place. RDA strategies, alongside
Regional Planning Guidance overseen by
Government Offices, provide a regional
framework for economic development and
regeneration.
The Department of Trade and Industry is the lead
sponsor of the RDAs, with the Government
Offices (for the Regions) responsible for day-to-
day RDA sponsorship issues. The ODPM and a
number of other departments are responsible for
financing RDAs and for advising them on the
implementation of regional strategies.
RDAs are now supporting regeneration schemes
from a single budget worth £1.55 billion in
2002/03, £1.7 billion in 2003/04 and £2 billion in
2005/06, giving them greater budgetary flexibility
and freedom. Under this new framework, they will
be required to deliver targets set collectively by
government departments.
English Partnerships (EP) together with the RDAs
are the Government’s main regeneration agencies.
EP (sponsored by the ODPM) is a key contributor
to delivering the Government’s ‘Living
Communities’ strategy, which was set out in July
2002 and seeks to create new jobs and investment
through sustainable economic regeneration and
development in the English regions. EP had an
operating budget in 2001/02 of £295 million. As
well as delivering the ‘Living Communities’
strategy, EP has responsibility for: the Greenwich
Peninsula; the National Coalfields Programme;
Millennium Communities; support for urban
regeneration companies (URC); the English Cities
Fund, the National Land Use Database, and the
production and maintenance of a national
brownfield strategy.
Englishsites.com
English Partnerships manages Englishsites.com, an
Internet service which delivers information on
strategic development sites in England
{www.englishsites.com). It provides data on sites
currently available to companies that are
considering expanding, investing or relocating in the
English regions. The database enables landowners
to promote their sites worldwide and currently holds
data on approximately 200 sites. It also allows users
to search for a site using a number of criteria,
including its size, location, distance to motorways
and airports, and the level of grants available.

Urban living
Following recommendations from the Urban Task
Force for improving towns and cities, the
Government published a White Paper on urban
policy, Our Towns and Cities: The Future -
Delivering an Urban Renaissance, in November
2000. It set out the Government’s plans for towns,
cities and suburbs, with the aim of encouraging
people to return to live in town and city centres,
thereby easing the pressure on the countryside
and helping to protect it from development.
Action has been taken on a number of initiatives
set out in the White Paper including:
■ the abolition of stamp duty on properties
worth up to £150,000 in over 1,200 of the most
disadvantaged wards in England;
■ a reduction in VAT (value added tax) to 5 per
cent on the costs of converting property to
residential use and of renovating properties
empty for three years or more;
■ relief from VAT on the sale of renovated houses
that have been empty for ten years or more;
Urban regeneration companies
URCs are independent companies established by
local authorities, RDAs, EP and the private sector
working in partnership. By spring 2002 three pilot
companies - Liverpool Vision, New East Manchester
and Sheffield One - had embarked on a programme
of urban regeneration and further URCs have been
announced in Bradford, Corby, Hull, Leicester,
Newport (South Wales), Sunderland, Swindon and
the Tees Valley.
The New East Manchester scheme occupies a
location that is mainly residential, but includes
former industrial land. A draft regeneration
framework has been set up with the aims of:
■ doubling the existing population to a total of
60,000;
■ building 12,500 new homes;
■ improving 7,000 existing homes; and
■ encouraging investment and employment
prospects by establishing business parks.
■ the introduction of 100 per cent capital
allowances for the costs of creating flats above
shops;
■ the provision of tax relief for covering the costs
of cleaning up contaminated sites;
■ proposals to review the planning system, set
out in the Green Paper - Planning: Delivering a
Fundamental Change (see page 303);
■ the establishment of the Green Spaces Task
Force with the aim of improving the quality of
parks, play areas and open spaces; and
■ more urban regeneration companies and the
establishment of a Neighbourhood Renewal
Fund.
The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit (NRU),
established in April 2001, is a unit which spans all
the key spending government departments. It
aims to tackle the core problems of deprived areas
by harnessing the support of all sectors to work in
partnership; focusing existing services and
resources on deprived areas; and giving local
residents a central role in its strategy. Based in the
ODPM, it provides funding for a number of
renewal programmes including £900 million (over
three years from 2001) for the Neighbourhood
Renewal Fund. Neighbourhood renewal teams
based in each of the Government Offices for the
Regions support its work (see also page 98).
Rural regeneration
Although most problems arising from dereliction
and unemployment occur in urban areas, some
rural areas have also been affected by declining
employment in traditional sectors, such as
mining, agriculture and rurally based defence
establishments. Even in areas that appear relatively
prosperous, some individuals within these areas
may be disadvantaged by poor local services, poor
public transport and low wages or seasonal
unemployment.
The RDAs outside London are responsible for
rural regeneration. The Countryside Agency
promotes and advises on conserving and
enhancing the countryside, on access to the
countryside for recreation, and on the economic
and social development of England’s rural areas. It
also administers a number of grants designed to
help meet village needs for transport, shops or
other services.

Wales
Following the reduction in steel making capacity,
and consequent redundancies, announced in 2001,
the Welsh Assembly Government announced
funding of £76 million to help stimulate the
regeneration of the affected steel communities.
Projects include the reopening of the Ebbw Vale
rail line for passenger transport, a Community
Learning Network and an Urban Regeneration
Company for Newport.
Wales will also receive up to £1.2 billion from the
European Union to fund a variety of programmes
until 2006. These include Objective 1 Funds (see
page 340) for West Wales & the Valleys. By March
2002 over £300 million of Objective 1 Funds had
been allocated to 470 projects in Wales. The
programmes are aimed at developing a stronger,
more sustainable economy (especially with an
expanded small and medium-sized company
sector), better infrastructure, a more highly skilled
workforce, and the regeneration of urban and
rural communities.
The Assembly Government has allocated £36.7
million to the Local Regeneration Fund (FRF) in
2002/03. The purpose of the Fund is to support
sustainable regeneration or development within,
or benefiting, the most deprived areas, including
the Objective 1 area in West Wales & the Valleys.
Some of the money is used to match funding
provided by European structural funds.
Communities First is an area-based regeneration
programme that will benefit the 100 most
deprived electoral wards, and other communities
including 32 pockets of deprivation. The
programme emphasises the involvement of local
people in decision-making through a community-
based partnership.
The Welsh Development Agency contributes to
economic regeneration across Wales. Its
In December 2001 the Welsh Development Agency
embarked on a £2.5 million regeneration scheme of
the derelict Six Bells Colliery in Blaenau Gwent.
During the 1950s the colliery employed around
1,650 men and output peaked at 500,000 tonnes of
coal a year. It was closed in 1988. The 15 hectare
site will be used for the construction of housing and
a school, and the creation of a recreation area for
the village of Six Bells.
programmes include physical and environmental
regeneration activities, such as land reclamation
and environmental improvements; activities to
provide site development work to assist with
business infrastructure; and financial support for
community initiatives such as the Market Towns
Initiative and the Small Towns and Villages
programmes.
Scotland
In Scotland the Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP)
programme, established in 1999, involves 48 local
partnerships tackling the problems that
disadvantaged groups and communities face
across rural and urban Scotland. The SIPs are
multi-agency partnerships, consisting of all
relevant local public agencies, the voluntary and
private sectors, and representatives from the
community. The SIPs are supported over three
years from 2001/02 by £169 million from the
Social Inclusion Partnership Fund. In June 2002
the Scottish Executive launched its community
regeneration statement, ‘Better Communities in
Scotland: closing the gap’, which sets out how it
intends to help deprived communities.
The Better Neighbourhood Services Fund (BNSF)
is a programme designed to improve services in
Scotland’s most disadvantaged neighbourhoods
and among its most disadvantaged groups. By
2002 the Scottish Executive had approved funding
for all 12 BNSF authorities. A total of £90 million
has been allocated to the fund over three years:
£20 million in 2001/02, £30 million in 2002/03
and £40 million in 2003/04.
Scottish Enterprise is the main economic
development agency for Scotland, covering 93 per
cent of the population from Grampian to the
Borders. It contributes to economic regeneration
Crown Street Regeneration Project
The Crown Street Regeneration Project set out to
regenerate a major derelict site within a mile of
Glasgow city centre. It aims to achieve sustainable
improvements by working in partnership with the
public sector and actively involving the local
communities. Seventeen hectares of derelict land
have been reclaimed and 810 mixed-tenure houses
and 2,600 square metres of business space
provided. Crown Street is scheduled for completion
by autumn 2003.

Communities Scotland also has a responsibility
for regeneration. It works closely with a number
of partners, in particular local authorities. The
planned budget for Communities Scotland for
2002/03 is over £300 million, of which £80 million
is specifically for regeneration schemes.
Communities Scotland plans to invest £65 million in
housing regeneration projects in Glasgow in
2002/03. The funding will be targeted at Glasgow's
nine priority areas for regeneration - the SIP areas -
and will provide new terraced homes with gardens
for people living in poor quality tenement flats.
Funding of £5 million will also be targeted at
improving poor housing in areas where there are
large minority ethnic communities.
Northern Ireland
The Department for Social Development (DSD)
administers the Urban Development Grant
(UDG) scheme, which promotes job creation,
inward investment and environmental
improvement in priority areas of Belfast and
Londonderry/Derry by stimulating the
development of vacant, derelict or underused land
or buildings. In Belfast, priority is currently given
to schemes within those deprived areas covered by
the Belfast Regeneration Office, while UDG in
Londonderry/Derry is targeted at the City Centre
and Waterside Business District. Outside the two
major cities the Department runs the Urban
Development Programme on behalf of the
International Fund for Ireland. It has similar aims
to UDG and is available within existing
commercial areas of towns and villages.
£2.7 million and from its launch in 1988 to the
end of 2001/02 provided £36 million for a variety
of projects in the most deprived and
disadvantaged areas.
The Community Regeneration and Improvement
Special Programme (CRISP), which is jointly
funded by DSD and the International Fund for
Ireland, is aimed at assisting community-led
regeneration in the most disadvantaged smaller
towns and villages in Northern Ireland. CRISP
provides a financial package of measures to deliver
economic, physical and social benefits to these
deprived communities. Since 1990 over 72
projects have been approved with funding of over
£56 million.
The Community Property Development Scheme
and Second Community Projects form part of the
International Fund for Ireland’s Urban
Development Programme in Northern Ireland.
The primary objective of these schemes is to
stimulate economic activity by encouraging cross¬
community groups to regenerate key properties in
the most rundown areas outside Belfast and
Londonderry/Derry. Twenty projects have been
approved under this scheme with grants totalling
£5.5 million.
The Rural Development Programme in Northern
Ireland began in 1991. In 2001 the NIHE
announced the 2001-06 phase of the programme,
which seeks to develop social, economic and
cultural initiatives for people living in Northern
Ireland’s rural communities. The programme
targets all parts of Northern Ireland outside the
Metropolitan Area of Belfast, the city of
Londonderry/Derry and the 20 towns with
populations greater than 5,000.
Underused or derelict land and buildings in selected
areas of towns and cities are identified for planning
and regeneration by the DSD via Comprehensive
Development Schemes. It also has responsibility for
the Laganside Corporation, a non-departmental
public body managing the regeneration of Belfast’s
riverside and waterfront areas.

Introduction
The terrorist attacks in the United States on 11
September 2001 had an immediate impact on
international travel to the UK. For example, there
were nearly 1 million, or 16 per cent, fewer
overseas visitors to the UK in the fourth quarter of
2001 than in the corresponding quarter of 2000.
Although the first quarter of 2002 saw a recovery,
the number of overseas visitors was still 8 per cent
below the same period in 2001.
The end of 2001 and beginning of 2002 saw some
important events in the rail industry. Railtrack
(see page 317) was placed into administration in
October 2001. Since then the administrator has
been responsible for ensuring the normal
operation of the industry. In January 2002 the
Strategic Rail Authority (SRA - see page 318)
published its ten-year strategic plan for the
railways, which is expected to involve expenditure
of £67.5 billion.
The new Department for Transport (DfT) was
created in May 2002 to focus solely on transport
issues. It took on all the transport responsibilities
of the former Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions (DTLR).
Travel trends
British residents travelled on average around
11,000 kilometres a year within Great Britain in
1999-2001. They made an average of 1,019 trips
a year, spending 360 hours, the equivalent of
15 days travelling.
Travel by car accounted for 85 per cent of
passenger mileage in Great Britain in 2001. Since
the early 1970s, the proportion of households with
regular access to one car has remained relatively

stable, while the proportion with more than one
has grown, from 7 per cent in 1970 to 26 per cent
in 1999-2001.
Roads
The total road network in Great Britain in 2000
was 391,701 kilometres. Trunk motorways (those
motorways that are the direct responsibility of the
central administration rather than the local
authority) accounted for 3,465 kilometres of this,
less than 1 per cent, and other trunk roads for
11,742 kilometres, or 3 per cent. However,
motorways carry 20 per cent of all traffic, and
trunk roads another 16 per cent. Combined, they
carry over half of all goods vehicle traffic in Great
Britain. In Northern Ireland the road network is
over 24,788 kilometres, of which 114 kilometres
are motorways.
The number of licensed vehicles on Britain’s roads
has increased over sixfold since 1952 (see Table
21.3). By far the biggest factor in this growth has
been the increase in private cars.
Motor traffic in Great Britain increased
significantly in the mid-1990s, although growth
has slowed somewhat in recent years. However,
total traffic levels still grew by 1.3 per cent
between 2000 and 2001 (see Table 21.2).
Congestion
About 7 per cent of the network of the Highways
Agency (see page 313) in England experiences
regular heavy peak and occasional non-peak
congestion, and a further 13 per cent sees heavy
congestion on at least half the days in the year.
Traffic congestion also occurs in many towns and
cities throughout the UK in the main morning

and evening peak periods and for much of the day
in central London. Traffic management schemes
aim to reduce congestion through measures such
as traffic-free shopping precincts, bus lanes and
other bus priority measures, red routes with
special stopping controls, and parking controls.
The DfT has a target to reduce congestion on the
inter-urban road network and in large urban areas
in England to below 2000 levels by 2010, as part of
its commitment to the Government’s Sustainable
Development Programme (see page 267).
Local authorities in London and the rest of England
and Wales can introduce congestion charging
schemes for road users or a levy on workplace
parking. The net revenue generated from charges
can be retained for at least ten years, provided that it
is used to fund local transport improvements.
Provision for urban congestion charging schemes
also exists in Scotland. Authorities must consult
local people and businesses, make improvements to
public transport and obtain ministerial approval
before starting schemes. The first such scheme - in
the historic centre of Durham - began in 2002.
Revenue from this scheme is being used to fund
improvements to the city’s bus services. A similar

kilometre area will be charged £5, payable in
advance or on the day by telephone, Internet, post
or at retail outlets. Weekend and evening travel
will remain uncharged. The aim is to reduce
traffic in central London by 10 to 15 per cent, and
delays by 20 to 30 per cent. The scheme is
expected to raise £130 million a year.
Traffic information
Traffic information is provided throughout Great
Britain by a variety of means, such as the media,
roadside signs and in-vehicle systems. Information
sources include roadside sensors, the traffic police
and highway authorities, and data are collated by
organisations such as the Automobile Association
(AA) and the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), and
by information service providers like Integrated
Traffic Information Services (ITIS), Metro
Networks and Trafficmaster.
Local traffic control centres across Great Britain
help to manage traffic and provide information
about conditions. Centres covering wider areas
exist in Scotland and Wales.
The Highways Agency has entered into a public-
private partnership (PPP - see page 350) with
Traffic Information Services to set up and run the
Traffic Control Centre (TCC). The TCC is
intended to provide a co-ordinated national
information service to travellers in England by
early 2003. Up-to-the-minute details will be
available via variable message signs, the Highways
Agency information line, the Internet, the media
and commercial driver information services.
Road safety
There were 4 per cent fewer road deaths and
16 per cent fewer serious casualties in Great
Britain in 2001 compared with the average for the
years 1994-98. Road traffic increased by 7 per cent
over the same period. In 2001 there were 228,825
road accidents involving personal injury in Great
Britain, 2 per cent fewer than in 2000, of which
34,749 involved death or serious injury. There
were 3,443 deaths in road accidents, 37,094
serious injuries and 272,509 slight injuries.
Overall, Great Britain has one of the best road
safety records in the world. Even so, the
Average car speeds1 on Great Britain's roads

Motorways 70 mph
Dual carriageways 70 mph
Single carriageways 45 mph
Urban 30 mph limit zones 32 mph
Urban 40 mph limit zones 37 mph
Traffic speeds in central and inner London showed a
marked variation from the national picture. For
example, the average speed in central London
during the daytime off-peak period in 1997-2000
was 10 mph.
Government has set a target of reducing the
number of people killed or seriously injured on
the roads by 40 per cent by 2010, compared with
the average level for 1994-98. A higher target
reduction, of 50 per cent, has been set for deaths
and serious injuries to children. Measures that
have been, or are being, taken include:
■ creating more 20 mph (32 km/h) zones
around schools and in residential areas -
a further 28 such schemes, at a cost of
£3.5 million, were approved in December
2001;
■ enforcing road traffic law more effectively,
with greater use of speed cameras, which will
be made more visible to drivers;
■ the mandatory fitting of seat belts in new
coaches and minibuses from October 2001;
and
■ improving road safety education, for example
through a network of road safety schemes for
children, funded from some £10 million set
aside over three years for increases and
improvements in child pedestrian training.
Local authorities in England and Wales are now
required to include specific road safety measures
as part of their Local Transport Plans (see page
325), while local authorities in Scotland are
expected to set out in their Local Transport
Strategies plans for reducing road casualties.

A major study of the safety of Europe’s roads was
published in February 2002. EuroRAP (the
European Road Assessment Programme)
(www.eurorap.org), led by the AA, gave safety
‘star’ ratings to 833 major UK roads, and a further
2,000 in the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain.
EuroRAP shows the safety performance of these
routes in relation to the amount of traffic. The
system is intended to allow planners to make
changes to lessen the risk of the four major causes
of fatal accidents - head-on crashes, accidents at
junctions, collisions with vulnerable road users
and hitting objects at the side of the road. Of the
roads assessed in the UK, 23 received no stars; 90
received one; 213 two stars; 415 three stars; and
92 gained the top four-star rating. Roads with no
stars have accident rates ten times higher than the
best performing roads in the four-star category.
Standards
Minimum ages for driving in the UK are:
■ 16 for riders of mopeds, drivers of small
tractors, and disabled people receiving
a mobility allowance;
■ 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including
that of the driver), small motorcycles, and
goods vehicles not over 3.5 tonnes maximum
authorised mass (MAM);
■ 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5, but
not over 7.5, tonnes MAM; and
■ 21 for passenger-carrying vehicles with
more than nine seats, goods vehicles over
7.5 tonnes MAM and large motorcycles.
About 32 million people hold a full driving licence
for a car. New drivers of motor vehicles must pass
both a computer-based touch screen theory test
and a practical driving test in order to acquire a
full driving licence. In 2000/01, just over 1.3
million driving tests were conducted in Great
Britain by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA),
the national driver testing authority. The average
pass rate was nearly 53 per cent. The DSA also
supervises professional driving instructors, the
compulsory basic training scheme for learner
motorcyclists and a voluntary register for
instructors of drivers of large goods vehicles.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles are
allowed on the roads, they must meet safety and
environmental requirements, based primarily on
standards drawn up by the European Union (EU).
The Vehicle Certification Agency is responsible for
ensuring these requirements are met through a
process known as ‘type approval’.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles, through
their annual testing. It also uses roadside and
other enforcement checks to ensure that drivers
and vehicle operators comply with legislation. In
Northern Ireland the Driver and Vehicle Testing
Agency is responsible for testing drivers and
vehicles.
Road haulage
Most freight in Great Britain is carried by road,
which accounts for 81 per cent of goods by
tonnage and 64 per cent in terms of tonne-
kilometres.
An operator’s licence is required for operating
goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross weight in the
UK. About 88 per cent of the 106,700 licences in
issue are for fleets of five or fewer vehicles, and
there are around 440,000 heavy goods vehicles
(HGVs) in the UK. Road haulage traffic by EIGVs
amounted to 149 billion tonne-kilometres in
Great Britain in 2001, 20 per cent more than in
1991. Road hauliers are tending to use larger
vehicles carrying heavier loads - 87 per cent of the
traffic, in terms of tonne-kilometres, is now
carried by vehicles of over 25 tonnes gross weight.
International road haulage has grown rapidly. In
2001 about 2.4 million road goods vehicles
travelled by ferry or the Channel Tunnel to
mainland Europe, a 3 per cent increase over 2000.
Of these, over 510,000 were powered vehicles
registered in the UK. UK vehicles carried
13.8 million tonnes internationally and 97 per
cent of this traffic was with the EU.
The Government has a long-term strategy for
freight in the UK. This seeks to reduce the extent
to which economic growth generates additional
lorry movements, by improving efficiency, making
the most of rail, shipping and inland waterways,
and improving interchange links between the
different types of transport. Measures introduced
include an increase in the maximum weight of
lorries on domestic journeys to 44 tonnes. The
Freight Facilities Grant scheme, which provides
assistance towards capital costs associated with
moving freight by inland waterway rather than
314

road, has been extended to coastal and short sea
movements.
Bus services
In 2000/01 some 4,309 million passenger journeys
were made on local bus services in Great Britain,
nearly 11 per cent fewer than in 1990/91. However,
journey numbers have been increasing in recent
years, from a low of 4,248 million in 1998/99. In
contrast, passenger journeys in London (which
accounts for nearly a third of bus journeys in Great
Britain) in 2000/01 were some 15 per cent higher
than ten years earlier. There have also been
increases in bus use in Scotland in recent years.
The ten-year plan (see page 325) target for bus use
in England is growth of 10 per cent in passenger
numbers by 2010 from 2000 levels.
There are around 85,000 buses and coaches in
Great Britain, of which 25 per cent are minibuses,
while 20 per cent are double-deckers. Most local
bus services are provided commercially, with
84 per cent of bus mileage outside London
operating on this basis. Local authorities may
subsidise services which are not commercially
viable but which are considered socially necessary.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by private sector concerns, apart from
17 bus companies owned by local authorities.
Transport for London is responsible for providing
or procuring public transport in the capital. It
oversees more than 700 bus routes run by about
25 companies under contract.
Five main groups operate bus services: Arriva,
FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group, National Express
and Stagecoach. All also run rail services and some
have expanded into transport services in other
countries, notably the United States.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger
services are operated by subsidiaries of the
publicly owned Northern Ireland Transport
Holding Company (NITHC), collectively known
as ‘Translink’. Citybus Ltd operates services in
Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd runs most of the
services in the rest of Northern Ireland, carrying
20 million and 47 million passengers a year
respectively.
Services
Local authorities in England and Wales are
required to develop bus strategies as part of their
Local Transport Plans (LTPs - see page 325).
Although there is no statutory requirement in
Scotland, local authorities are expected to set out
their views on bus services in their Local
Transport Strategies. Outside London statutory
backing also exists for ‘bus quality partnerships’
and ‘quality contracts’ between local authorities
and bus operators. Similar partnerships have
already been developed voluntarily in around 130
towns and cities, and have led to better services
with higher-quality buses, and typically 10 to 20
per cent greater passenger use. Authorities have
powers to promote joint ticketing and to work with
Train Operating Companies on bus/rail ticketing.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes, are
becoming more extensive, while in some areas
innovative measures, such as guided busways
(with buses travelling on segregated track) are
being adopted. Around 70 park and ride
schemes - in which car users park on the outskirts
of towns and travel by public transport to the
centre - are in operation in England and Scotland,
and are being increasingly used to relieve traffic
congestion. Over 100 new schemes are envisaged
over the next ten years. Similar schemes operate in
Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) has funding
of £136 million between 2001/02 and 2003/04.
The grant is for the provision of new or enhanced
local bus services in England. In addition, a total
of £60 million over the same period has been
allocated for the Rural Bus Challenge, an annual
competition in which local authorities bid for
project funding. The Scottish Executive’s
£6 million Rural Transport Fund is funding over
350 new and improved rural bus services. The
Urban Bus Challenge plays a similar role in towns
and cities in England to the RBSG, and has been
allocated £46 million from 2001/02 to 2003/04.
The Welsh Assembly Government is allocating
more than £7.5 million to local authorities in
2002/03 under its Local Transport Services grant
to increase the number and range of subsidised
bus services and to support community transport
projects.
Ninety-four per cent of local authorities offered a
half-fare concessionary scheme for the elderly in
England in 2001, while 90 per cent offered a
similar concession to disabled people and 60 per
cent to blind people. The remainder either had flat-
fare schemes or schemes offering free travel, such
as in London. Since April 2002, travel on local bus
315
Environmental affairs

services in Wales has been free for pensioners and
disabled people, while in Scotland, free off-peak
local bus fares will be available for elderly and
disabled people from October 2002.
Coaches account for much of the non-local
mileage operated by public service vehicles, which
totalled 1,503 million vehicle-kilometres in
2000/01. Organised coach tours and holiday
journeys account for about 60 per cent of coach
travel in Great Britain. High-frequency scheduled
services, run by private sector operators, link
many towns and cities, and commuter services
run into London and some other major centres
each weekday. The biggest coach operator,
National Express, has a national network of
scheduled coach services and carries more than
15 million passengers each year.
Taxis
There are about 98,000 licensed taxis in England
and Wales (mainly in urban areas), around
20,000 in Scotland, and about 3,100 in Northern
Ireland. In London (which has over 24,000 taxis)
and several other major cities, taxis must be
purpose-built to conform to strict requirements.
In many districts, taxi drivers have to pass a test of
their knowledge of the area.
Private hire vehicles (PHVs or ‘minicabs’) may
only be booked through the operator and not
hired on the street. There are about 76,000 in
England and Wales, outside London, 8,000 in
Scotland and over 2,100 in Northern Ireland.
Licences have been required for PHV operators in
London since October 2001 (bringing the capital
in line with the rest of England and Wales). Over
1,800 operators have so far been licensed, and it
is estimated that there are around 40,000 drivers
and a similar number of vehicles. Transport for
London is working on the details for the second
and third phases of licensing - covering drivers
and vehicles respectively.
Cycling and motorcycling
The use of two-wheeled transport in Great Britain
is much less common than 50 years ago. In 1952,
11 per cent of distance travelled was on pedal
cycles, and a further 3 per cent on motorcycles. By
2001, these figures had both fallen to only 1 per
cent.
The National Cycling Strategy aims to increase the
number of pedal cycle journeys fourfold by 2012
(based on 1996 figures). The Cycling Forum for
England is co-ordinating the implementation of
the strategy, which has been endorsed by the
Government. The Scottish Cycle Forum co¬
ordinates implementation in Scotland, while
Wales and Northern Ireland have their own
strategies. The DfT announced its own target of
trebling the number of cycling journeys by 2010,
as part of the Government’s ten-year plan. Cycling
strategies form part of Local Transport Plans and
Strategies, and include measures to make cycling
safer and more convenient.
The National Cycle Network currently provides
9,600 kilometres of cycling and walking routes
throughout the UK. Developed by the transport
charity Sustrans (www.sustrans.org.uk), the
network will cover 16,000 kilometres when it is
completed in 2005. Over a third of the network
will be entirely free from motor traffic by utilising
old railway lines, canal towpaths, river paths and
derelict land. The remainder will follow existing
roads, with traffic calming and cycle lanes being
implemented where necessary. Fifty per cent of
users are cyclists and 48 per cent pedestrians.
Sustrans estimates that more than half of all
network users making functional journeys could
have chosen a car instead of cycling or walking.
After a long period of decline since the early
1960s, there has been a resurgence in motorcycling
in the UK over the last few years. The number of
licensed motorcycles has risen from a low of
594,000 in 1995 to around 882,000 in 2001, the
highest figure since 1988.
Walking
People in the UK are walking less than in the past,
with fewer journeys on foot and many more by
car. The Government wishes to reverse this trend,
and expects local authorities to give more priority
to walking. Almost all local authorities included
walking strategies in their LTPs and Strategies (see
page 325), many identifying targets to encourage
walking through a variety of initiatives. LTP
funding is likely to be used to make walking safer
and more accessible, for example by improving
pavement and footway maintenance, removing
obstructions and improving pedestrian crossings.
Home Zones are residential streets in which the
road space is shared between the drivers of motor
vehicles and other road users, with the wider
needs of residents (including people who walk or
cycle, and children) in mind. The aim is to change
the way that streets are used, for example by
316
Environmental affairs
21 Transport
encouraging people to walk rather than use their
cars, and improve the quality of life of local
residents. Thirteen pilot schemes are in operation
across Great Britain; one, in Northmoor,
Manchester, has already seen a significant drop in
car speeds, by up to 10 mph. The Government
announced the winners of its Home Zones
Challenge in January 2002, when it awarded
£30 million to 61 projects.
Safe routes to school projects
(www.saferoutestoschool.org) aim to encourage and
enable children to walk and cycle to school. They
combine practical measures, such as redesigns of
roadspace to provide for cyclists and pedestrians
and 20 mph speed limits near schools, with
educational measures, for example cycle training
for children and an emphasis on the health
benefits of walking and cycling.
The Scottish Executive has provided local
authorities with an additional £20 million for
cycling, walking and safer streets projects through
its Public Transport Fund.
Road programme
The maintenance, operation and improvement of
most of the national road network in England is
the responsibility of the Highways Agency
(www.highways.gov.uk), an executive agency of
DfT. In London, responsibility lies with the
Greater London Authority. In Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland responsibility for the motorway
and trunk road network rests with the devolved
administrations.
The Highways Agency is responsible for 9,404
kilometres of motorway and trunk roads in
England. However, some 500 kilometres of this
network are in the process of being transferred to
relevant local authorities. The Agency’s budget is
£1.77 billion in 2002/03. In addition, local
authorities had a budget of nearly £1.9 billion in
2000/01 for maintaining roads. In Scotland, the
motorway and trunk road programme for 2001-04
will cost £680 million.
The Highways Agency’s 2002/03 programme
includes plans to:
■ spend £740 million on maintenance. To ease
congestion, 90 per cent of routine
maintenance will be carried out at night;
■ spend £698 million on major road projects,
including eight schemes intended to ease
congestion and improve safety;
■ award a PPP (see page 350) contract to build
and run a 53-km section of the A1(M) in
Yorkshire; and
■ carry out a programme of small-scale
congestion and safety improvements across
the network, including junction
improvements, cycleways and noise
mitigation.
Fifty years of travel trends
Passenger travel was 734 billion passenger-
kilometres in Great Britain in 2001 (see Table 21.1),
compared with 218 billion passenger-kilometres in
1952.
The major trend of the last 50 years has been the
increase in journeys by cars, vans and taxis, which
accounted for 85 per cent of passenger mileage in
2001 compared with 27 per cent in 1952. Only
15 per cent of households had regular use of a car
in 1952; by 2001 this figure had risen to 73 per
cent. In contrast, people in Britain are cycling much
less than 50 years ago. In 1952, pedal cycles
accounted for 11 per cent of all passenger miles,
compared with under 1 per cent in 2001.
Another major trend over the last 50 years has
been the growth in air travel. In 1952 there were
2.8 million terminal passengers at UK airports. This
figure had grown to 181 million passengers by
2001.
Railways
Railtrack is responsible for operating all track and
infrastructure in Great Britain. Its assets include
32,000 kilometres of track; 40,000 bridges, tunnels
and viaducts; 2,500 stations; and connections to
over 1,000 freight terminals. Railtrack was placed
into administration in October 2001 when the
High Court found it was unable (or likely to be
unable) to pay debts of £3.3 billion which it had
accrued. Since then the administrator has been
responsible for ensuring normal operation of the
railway.
A successor company, Network Rail (a company
limited by guarantee), has made an offer to the
administrator to bring administration to an end.
Network Rail would have the interests of the
travelling public as its priority and would invest
any operating profit back into the railway network.
317
Environmental affairs
21 Transport
Most railway services in the UK are now operated
by the private sector. Apart from 15 major stations
operated directly by Railtrack, nearly all stations
and passenger depots are leased to the passenger
Train Operating Companies (TOCs) that run
passenger services under franchise. There are
currently 25 TOCs. Many franchises are for seven
years, but some are for 10, 12 or 15 years.
The TOCs, such as First Great Western, South
West Trains and GNER, lease their rolling stock
from the three main rolling stock companies:
Angel Trains, HSBC Rail and Porterbrook Leasing.
Freight services are run by four companies, and
there are a number of infrastructure maintenance
companies.
There are also over 100 other passenger-carrying
railways, often connected with the preservation of
steam locomotives. Services are operated mostly
on a voluntary basis and cater mainly for tourists
and railway enthusiasts.
Rail regulation and strategy
The regulation of Britain’s railways is the
responsibility of two organisations: the Strategic
Rail Authority (SRA) and the Office of the Rail
Regulator (ORR). The two organisations have
common statutory purposes but different powers
to achieve them. The SRA is subject to directions
and guidance from the Government, while the
ORR is independent.
The SRA is responsible for providing strategic
leadership to the rail industry; allocating
government funding to the railways; negotiating,
awarding and monitoring the franchises for
operating rail services; and a number of other
statutory functions, in particular relating to
customer protection. Government support to the
rail industry amounted to approximately
£1.2 billion in 2000/01.
The Rail Regulator provides independent
economic regulation of the monopoly and
dominant elements of the rail industry,
particularly Railtrack’s stewardship of the national
rail network. In addition, the Regulator licenses
the railway operators, approves or directs
agreements governing access to track, stations and
depots, and enforces competition law in
connection with the provision of rail services.
A new refranchising programme was published by
the SRA in December 2001. It is designed to help
The SRA strategic plan
The SRA's ten-year plan for the railways sets out the
changes required by 2010 to meet the
Government's targets for rail - a 50 per cent
increase in passenger-kilometres, reductions in
overcrowding, and an 80 per cent increase in freight
tonne-kilometres. Utilising government funding of
£33.5 billion, the plan mixes short, medium and
long-term goals in an attempt to bring major
improvements for passengers. Key points include
£400 million for a Rail Performance Fund to co¬
invest with rail companies in short-term schemes to
improve reliability, £430 million for local passenger
improvements, and a National Rail Academy to
develop staff training in core skills. Changes to be
delivered within four years include:
■ replacement of slam-door Mark 1 coaches with
new stock, providing extra capacity;
■ track and signalling improvements at 100
locations;
■ improved station facilities; and
■ revenue support schemes for rail freight to
encourage competition.
deliver the Government’s ten-year plan targets.
Wherever franchises are replaced or extended, new
contracts will target provision of better facilities,
higher performance incentives for operators and
better compensation arrangements for passengers
when things go wrong. The SRA is also examining
the longer term benefits of fewer franchises where
two or more existing franchisees share the use of
one London terminus. One such combined
franchise, ‘Greater Anglia’, will be awarded from
2004.
Rail safety
There have been a number of fatal rail accidents in
recent years, including incidents at Southall
(London) in 1997, Ladbroke Grove, near
Paddington (London), in 1999, Hatfield
(Hertfordshire) in 2000 and Potters Bar
(Hertfordshire) in 2002. Nevertheless, there is
evidence that some trends in railway safety are
improving. Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
figures show that in 2000/01 significant train
accidents (that is, most collisions and derailments
involving passenger trains) were the second lowest
318
Environmental affairs
21 Transport
on record - 0.27 per million train miles run. Five
people were killed in train accidents in 2001/02,
compared with 17 in 2000/01.
Measures being taken to improve the safety of the
railway network include:
■ the fitting of the train protection and
warning system (TPWS) to the national
network by the end of 2003;
■ the development of plans to fit the new
European automatic train protection (ATP)
system as lines that are included in the
European high-speed network are upgraded;
■ investment in new rolling stock; and
■ the development of a new national safety
plan to improve safety management and
ensure best practice.
Passenger services
The passenger network (see map) comprises a fast
inter-city network, linking the main centres of
Great Britain; local and regional services; and
commuter services in and around the large
conurbations, especially London and the South
East. Passenger traffic is growing (see Table 21.4)
and on the national railways rose by 2 per cent in
2001/02 to 39.1 billion passenger-kilometres,
representing some 956 million passenger journeys.
According to the SRA’s Public Performance
Measure, an average of 78 per cent of scheduled
services ran to timetable in 2001/02.

Freight
Rail freight traffic in Great Britain totalled an
estimated 19.7 billion tonne-kilometres,
representing the carriage of 94.4 million tonnes in
2001/02. Over 80 per cent of traffic by volume is
in bulk commodities, mainly coal, coke, iron and
steel, building materials and petroleum. The two
largest operators are English, Welsh 8c Scottish
Railway (EWS), which also runs trains through
the Channel Tunnel; and Freightliner, which
operates container services between major ports
and inland terminals.
The Government and the devolved
administrations are keen to encourage more
freight to be moved by rail, to relieve pressure on
the road network and to bring environmental
benefits. Grants are available to encourage
companies to move goods by rail or water rather
than by road.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland Railways, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the NITHC (see page 315), operates
the railway service on about 338 kilometres of
track and handled 6.2 million passenger journeys
in 2001/02. The NITHC is currently undertaking a
programme to improve the railway network, with
increased expenditure provided by the
Department for Regional Development. The
award of a £73 million contract to build new
rolling stock was announced in February 2002, the
largest single such investment in Northern
Ireland.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel was opened to traffic in
1994. It is operated by Eurotunnel, a UK-French
group, under a concession from the British and
French Governments. As well as managing the
infrastructure of the Channel Tunnel - tunnels,
terminals and track - Eurotunnel operates a drive-
on, drive-off shuttle train service, with separate
shuttles for passenger and freight vehicles,
between terminals near Folkestone and Calais. In
2001 the service carried just over 2.5 million cars
(down 11 per cent on 2000), nearly 1.2 million
goods vehicles (up by 9 per cent) and 75,400
coaches (down by 5 per cent).
Eurostar high-speed train services are operated
jointly by Eurostar (UK) Ltd, French Railways and
Belgian Railways under the commercial direction
of Eurostar Group Ltd. Frequent services connect
London (Waterloo) and Paris or Brussels, taking

approximately 3 hours and 2 hours 40 minutes
respectively. Trains also serve Ashford
International (Kent), Calais, Lille, Disneyland
Paris, Bourg St Maurice in the French Alps (in the
winter) and Avignon (in the summer). Eurostar
carried 7 million passengers in 2001.
Channel Tunnel Rail Link
The first section of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link
(CTRL) is under construction between the
Channel Tunnel terminal and Fawkham Junction
(Kent), and is planned to be completed in 2003.
Construction work on the second section to St
Pancras (London) is in progress, and is due to
open in 2006. The whole project is forecast to cost
an estimated £5.2 billion. Eurostar trains will be
able to travel in the UK at speeds of 300 km/h
(185 mph), reducing journey times by 35 minutes.
FFigh-speed domestic services will also operate
from Kent to London. New international stations
for the CTRL will be built at Stratford in east
London and Ebbsfleet in Kent.
Underground railways
London’s ‘tube’ network is run by London
Underground Ltd (LUL - www.thetube.com),
serving 275 stations on 408 kilometres of railway.
In 2001/02, 953 million passenger journeys were
made on the network. The Glasgow Underground,
a heavy rapid transit system, operates on an 11 km
circle in central Glasgow.
Under an expected public-private partnership
(PPP), responsibility for maintaining and
upgrading LUL’s infrastructure will transfer to the
private sector, while LUL will continue to have
responsibility for safety and for all aspects of
operating passenger services across the network.
Three private sector infrastructure companies
(Infracos) will work under contract to LUL for a
30-year period. Ownership of LUL’s assets - for
example, trains, stations, track and tunnels - will
remain with the public sector LUL; the Infracos
will lease the assets for the period of the contracts.
The PPP is expected to provide about £16 billion
of investment over 15 years. LUL will become part
of Transport for London once the PPP is in place.
Light railways and tramways
There has been a revival in interest in tram/light
rail services in recent years, and a number are now
in operation (see Table 21.5). Government plans
indicate a growing role for tramways, with the
provision of up to 25 new lines in major cities and
conurbations.
The £180 million Nottingham Express Transit
system, which will run for 13 kilometres, will open
in 2003. Construction will commence in 2003 on
a £190 million light rail system in South
Hampshire and the £500 million Leeds
Supertram, while work on the Bristol Light Rail
Transit will start in 2004. Approval has also been
given for three extensions, costing over £500
million, of the Manchester Metrolink.
Air travel
The number of passengers carried into and out of
UK airports has trebled in the last 20 years. Air
transport movements and freight have more than
doubled. According to the DfF, these trends look
set to continue, as the number of air passengers is
growing by between 4 and 5 per cent a year and
the freight market by 7 per cent.

low-cost or ‘no-frills’ airlines have become
increasingly popular. Day-to-day responsibility for
the regulation of civil aviation rests with the Civil
Aviation Authority (CAA - www.caa.co.uk).
The terrorist attacks in the United States on
11 September 2001 had an impact on air travel in
the UK. However, figures suggest that this was less
severe than was originally feared; for example,
passenger numbers in the fourth quarter of 2001
were down only 7 per cent on the same period in
2000. Long-haul, especially transatlantic, services
were worst hit, but short-haul European and
domestic services, especially among low-cost
carriers, have proved more resilient. The attacks
prompted a working group, comprising DfT, the
Home Office, Metropolitan Police, HM Customs
and HM Immigration, to examine security at
airports. The recommendations in the group’s
report were subsequently accepted by the
Government. Measures implemented by May 2002
included stiffer regulations concerning security
passes and the extension of counter-terrorism
checks on staff. In the longer term, enhanced CCTV
coverage will also be introduced at airports and the
co-operation and co-ordination of those involved in
airport security will be improved. The working
group will continue to meet to review progress.
operations was £8.3 billion, and the British
Airways group carried over 40 million passengers
on its fleet of 360 planes, achieving an occupancy
of 70 per cent on its main scheduled services. The
airline’s worldwide network covers 244
destinations in 97 countries, and its main
operating bases are London’s Heathrow and
Gatwick airports.
British Airways was one of the founders, together
with American Airlines, Canadian International
Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, of the
‘Oneworld’ alliance. The alliance now has eight
member airlines and serves 571 scheduled
destinations in 135 countries or territories.
Other UK Airlines
BMI, formerly British Midland, is the second
largest scheduled carrier and operates an extensive
network of scheduled services with 57 aircraft,
carrying 6.7 million passengers in 2001. Britannia
Airways is the world’s biggest charter airline and
carried 7.9 million passengers in 2001 on its
31 aircraft. Virgin Atlantic operates scheduled
services to 21 overseas destinations with 34
aircraft. Low-fare ‘no-frills’ airlines operating in
the UK include easyjet and Go; easyjet acquired
Go in August 2002.

Airports
Of the 150 or so licensed civil aerodromes in the
UK, nearly a quarter handle more than 100,000
passengers a year each. In 2001 the UK’s civil
airports handled a total of 182.3 million
passengers (181.2 million terminal passengers and
1.1 million in transit), and 2.1 million tonnes of
freight.
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international travellers and is the UK’s most
important for passengers and air freight, handling
60.4 million passengers (excluding those in
transit) and 1.2 million tonnes of freight in 2001.
Gatwick is the world’s sixth busiest international
airport and has the world’s busiest single runway.
Stansted is the fastest growing airport in Europe,
with terminal passengers increasing by 15 per cent
in 2001.
Ownership and control
BAA pic is the world’s largest commercial operator
of airports. It handles almost 200 million
passengers a year worldwide, 122 million in its
seven UK airports alone. Overseas, BAA manages
all or part of 11 airports, including six in
321
Environmental affairs
21 Transport
Australia. The UK’s second largest operator is TBI,
which has an interest in 37 airports worldwide.
Highland and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) owns
ten airports in Scotland. These airports receive
considerable investment from the Scottish
Executive to ensure the continued provision of
‘lifeline’ services to remote areas.
All UK airports used for public transport must be
licensed by the CAA for reasons of safety.
Stringent requirements, such as adequate
firefighting, medical and rescue services, have to
be satisfied before a licence is granted.
Airport development
Investment to expand passenger facilities is in
progress at many UK airports. Planning
permission for Heathrow Terminal 5 was given in
November 2001, where BAA plans to invest
£4.1 billion. Planning conditions include a limit
on flight numbers of 480,000 at Heathrow,
compared with 457,000 in 2001. Even with this
limit, a capacity of 90 to 100 million passengers a
year is envisaged. Also at Heathrow, a £100 million
redevelopment of departure facilities at Terminal 3
is scheduled for completion in 2002. Expansion at
Gatwick’s two terminals over the next ten years is
designed to raise annual capacity to around
40 million passengers.
Among other large-scale projects at UK airports
are a £360 million expansion plan at Birmingham
Airport, which will increase capacity to around
10 million passengers a year, and a £200 million
investment programme at Stansted to increase
capacity to around 15 million passengers a year.
In July 2002 the Government published a
consultation document on the future development
of air transport in the south-east and the east of
England. This examined a number of options for
dealing with forecast demand, ranging from no
development other than that already in the
planning system; extension of Heathrow with
another short runway for regional transport; one,
two or three new runways at Stansted; and the
development of a new airport at Cliffe in Kent.
Air traffic control
Civil and military air traffic control over the UK
and the surrounding seas, including much of the
North Atlantic, is undertaken by National Air
Traffic Services Ltd (NATS - www.nats.co.uk),
working in collaboration with military controllers.
NATS is a PPP, in which the Government’s partner
is the Airline Group, a consortium of seven UK
airlines. The Airline Group has a 46 per cent share
of the company (with rights giving it voting
control), the Government 49 per cent, and NATS
employees 5 per cent. The CAA retains
responsibility for air safety regulation, and also
regulates the PPP.
To cope with the rapid growth in air traffic, NATS
is in the process of replacing the three previous
UK centres for civil and military en route air
traffic control operations with two major new
centres. Swanwick (Hampshire) opened in January
2002, while a new Scottish centre at Prestwick will
replace the existing one in 2009. Controlling
around 322,000 square kilometres of airspace
above England and Wales, Swanwick will handle
up to 6,000 flights a day during busy periods.
NATS announced a £1 billion investment plan in
April 2002. Among other things, it is intended that
the plan will enable the company to handle a 50
per cent increase in flights, from 2 million to
3 million, by 2010/11, and reduce NATS’
attributable delays to less than one minute per
flight.
Air safety
The CAA is responsible for safety standards on
UK airlines. It certifies aircraft and crews, licenses
air operators and air travel organisers, and
approves certain air fares and airport charges. To
qualify for a first professional licence, a pilot must
pass a full-time course of instruction approved by
the CAA or have acceptable military or civilian
flying experience. Every company operating
aircraft used for commercial air transport
purposes must possess an Air Operator’s
Certificate, which the CAA grants when it is
satisfied that the company is competent to operate
its aircraft safely. All aircraft registered in the UK
must be granted a certificate of airworthiness by
the CAA before being flown. The CAA works
closely with the Joint Aviation Authorities, a
European grouping of aviation safety regulation
authorities.
The DfT’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch
(AAIB) investigates accidents and serious
incidents in UK airspace and those that occur
overseas to aircraft registered or manufactured in
the UK. In 2001 the AAIB was involved in the
investigation of 322 civil aviation accidents/
incidents worldwide and provided technical
322
Environmental affairs
21 Transport
assistance to military aircraft accident
investigations on five occasions.
Inland waterways
Inland waterways are now used mainly for leisure
and general recreation, but they have a number of
other important roles: as a heritage and
environmental resource, as a catalyst for
regeneration, and in land drainage and water supply.
Some inland waterways still carry freight: in 2000,
49.0 million tonnes of goods were lifted and 1.7
billion tonne-kilometres of goods were moved.
The Thames was the busiest inland waterway
route.
The UK’s waterways are managed by about 30
different navigation authorities. British Waterways
(www.britishwaterways.co.uk), a public
corporation sponsored by the Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and the
Scottish Executive, is the largest, responsible for
some 2,600 kilometres of fully navigable
waterways, about half the UK total.
British Waterways has embarked on the biggest
ever programme of waterway restorations - over
480 kilometres of canals and waterway structures
will be restored or built in two phases. The first, to
open over 350 kilometres of canals and structures
in eight projects, will be fully completed in 2002.
Projects included the restoration of the Anderton
Boat Lift, built in 1875, which opened to the
public in March 2002, and the Millennium Link
project to connect Glasgow and Edinburgh, which
opened in May 2002. The second phase, covering
ten further projects, includes the first new canal to
be designed in a century - the Bedford and Milton
Keynes Waterway. Funding for the programme
comes from a wide range of partnerships and
public support.
The cross-border body Waterways Ireland is
responsible for the management, maintenance,
development and restoration of the inland
navigable waterways system throughout Ireland,
principally for recreational purposes.
Shipping and ports
It is estimated that about 95 per cent by weight
(75 per cent by value) of the UK’s foreign trade is
carried by sea. The UK fleet has declined
considerably in tonnage terms in the last 25 years,
reflecting changing trade patterns, removal of
grants, and greater competition. International
revenue (including freight revenue) earned by the
UK shipping industry in 2000 was £3.8 billion and
represented over 5 per cent of the total export of
services from the UK.
At the end of 2001 there were 594 UK-owned
merchant trading ships of 100 gross tonnes or
more, with a total tonnage of 12.0 million
deadweight tonnes. There were 140 vessels
totalling 4.7 million deadweight tonnes used as
oil, chemical or gas carriers, and 454 vessels
totalling 7.4 million deadweight tonnes employed
as dry-bulk carriers, container ships or other types
of cargo ship, together with 37 passenger ships. In
all, 75 per cent of UK-owned vessels are registered
in the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or
British Overseas Territories such as Bermuda.
The Government is implementing a series of
measures aimed at reviving the shipping industry
and reversing the downward trend in the UK fleet.
For example, shipping can now be taxed on the
basis of tonnage, as occurs in a number of other
countries. Other measures include more training
and career opportunities for seafarers.
Cargo services
International revenue earned by the UK shipping
industry in 2001 was £3.7 billion: £2.8 billion from
freight (£2.1 billion on dry cargo and passenger
vessels and £0.7 billion on tankers and liquefied gas
carriers); £0.3 billion from charter receipts; and
£0.6 billion from passenger revenue. Nearly all
scheduled cargo-liner services from the UK are
containerised. British tonnage serving these trades
is dominated by a relatively small number of
companies. Besides the carriage of freight by liner
and bulk services between the UK and the rest of
Europe, many roll-on, roll-off services carry cars,
passengers and commercial vehicles.
Passenger services
Over 30 million passenger journeys a year take
place on international and domestic ferry services
linking Great Britain with Ireland and mainland
Europe. A further 18 million passengers are
carried on ferry services to many of Britain’s
offshore islands, such as the Isle of Wight, Isle of
Man, Orkney and Shetland, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland.
323
Environmental affairs
21 Transport
P&O Ferries is the UK’s largest ferry operator, with
a fleet of about 50 ships operating on 18 routes
around the UK coast. Cross-Channel services are
operated by roll-on, roll-off ferries, high-speed
catamarans and high-speed monohulls.
Maritime safety
The DfT’s policies for improving marine safety
and pollution control are implemented by the
Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which
inspects UK ships and foreign ships using UK
ports to ensure that they comply with
international safety, pollution prevention and
operational standards. In 2001, 117 foreign-
flagged ships were detained in UK ports.
In 2001 the MCA was alerted to 12,514 incidents
and 16,487 people were assisted, including 4,852
who required rescuing. In an emergency, HM
Coastguard co-ordinates facilities, such as its own
helicopters; cliff rescue teams; lifeboats of the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI, a
voluntary body); aircraft, helicopters and ships
from the armed forces; and merchant shipping
and commercial aircraft.
The MCA has set up a Search and Rescue service
for the River Thames at Tower Pier in London and
there are now four lifeboat stations operated by
the RNLI along the river. Three - at Tower Pier,
Chiswick Pier and Gravesend - are manned
continuously, while the fourth at Teddington is
operated using volunteers.
Some locations around the UK are potentially
hazardous for shipping. There are over 1,000
marine aids to navigation around the UK coast
and responsibility for these rests with three
regional lighthouse authorities. Measures to
reduce the risk of collision include the separation
of ships into internationally agreed shipping lanes.
This applies, for example, in the Dover Strait, one
of the world’s busiest seaways, which is monitored
by radar from the Channel Navigation
Information Service near Dover.
By the end of 2001 the majority of ports had
complied with the Government’s Port Marine
Safety Code, which is designed to ensure the
highest standards of marine safety in UK ports.
The DfT has also issued a Guide to Good Practice
on port marine operations. It gives guidance on
a national standard by which harbour authorities
can measure how they discharge their legal duties
for the safety of navigation.
Ports
There are about 70 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, while several
hundred small harbours cater for local cargo,
fishing vessels, island ferries or recreation. There
are three broad types of port: those owned and
run by boards constituted as trusts; those owned
by local authorities; and company-owned
facilities.
Associated British Ports (ABP) is the UK’s largest
port owner and operates 21 ports, including
Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham, LIull, Ipswich,
Newport, Port Talbot, Southampton and Swansea.
Other major facilities owned by private sector
companies include Felixstowe, Harwich and
Thamesport (all owned by the Hong Kong group
Hutchison Whampoa).
The Government intends to assist ports in
maintaining competitiveness, and to develop
nationally agreed safety standards; to promote
environmental best practice; and to build on the
approach detailed in its ten-year plan for
transport, which recognised the importance of
port hubs within integrated transport systems.
Port traffic
A total of 566 million tonnes (Mt) of freight
traffic was handled in UK ports in 2001, a 1 per
cent reduction on 2000. Traffic through the 52
major UK ports (generally those handling over
1 million tonnes a year) accounted for 97 per cent
(548 Mt) of the total. Inwards traffic rose by
13 Mt to 329 Mt while outward traffic fell by
20 Mt to 236 Mt.
The main ports, in terms of total tonnage
handled, are shown in Table 21.7. Forth, Milford
Haven and Sullom Voe mostly handle oil, while
the principal destinations for non-fuel traffic are
London, Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham,
Tees and Hartlepool, and Liverpool. Crude oil
now accounts for one-third of all port traffic.
By far the most important port for container
traffic is Felixstowe (which handles about two-
fifths of this type of traffic), while Dover is the
leading port for roll-on, roll-off traffic. Dover is
also the major arrival and departure point for sea
passengers, handling well over half of all
international movements to and from the UK. The
top four UK ports are among the ten largest ports
in northern Europe.

Transport policy
Underpinning the Government’s transport policy
is its ten-year transport spending plan, launched
in 2000, which currently envisages public
spending and private investment in transport of
some £181.9 billion, including: £64.8 billion for
railways in Great Britain, £58.7 billion for local
transport in England, £25.6 billion for transport
in London, £21.2 billion for strategic roads in
England and £11.6 billion on future projects and
other transport areas. The Government intends to
issue a first-year report of the plan in autumn
2002. The devolved administrations are
developing their own transport strategies.
Under the Transport Act 2000 (see box), Local
Transport Plans (LTPs) have been drawn up by
local transport authorities in England (outside
London), and by Welsh authorities. In Scotland all
local authorities have produced Local Transport
Strategies and Strathclyde Passenger Transport a
public transport strategy.
Transport Act 2000
Closely linked to the targets of the ten-year plan,
this Act provided for the establishment of the
Strategic Rail Authority (see page 318) and the
NATS RPR (see page 322). It requires local
authorities to prepare five-year plans to improve
their local transport facilities; enables local
authorities outside London to introduce road
charges and workplace parking levies to help tackle
congestion; gives local authorities new powers to
improve local bus services; and requires them to
offer concessionary fares for all pensioners and
certain groups of disabled people.
The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides local
authorities with additional powers to enable them
to develop an integrated transport system at the
local level. The Act contains many provisions similar
to those in the Transport Act for England and Wales.
Underground and rail systems by up to 50 per
cent over 15 years, two-thirds of which is to come
from major new projects such as extensions and
improvements to the East London Line and
Thameslink. The Strategy also aims to increase the
capacity of the bus system by 40 per cent over ten
years, and supports the principle of congestion
charging in central London, due to be introduced
in February 2003 (see page 313).
Authorities in London produce Local
Implementation/Borough Spending Plans in line
with the Strategy, for which funding of at least
£130 million a year from 2003/04 is envisaged.
Transport for London will be responsible for
delivering the Strategy.
Each year, capital allocations to English authorities
are made in the LTP capital settlement. Funding of
£8.4 billion is envisaged from 2001/02 to 2005/06.
The 2002/03 settlement distributed £1.5 billion to
local authorities, including:
■ £1.2 billion for new small-scale transport
schemes, covering road safety, bus priority
measures, park and ride, encouraging cycling
and walking, as well as road maintenance and
bridge strengthening schemes; and
The London Mayor is responsible for delivering
integrated transport in the capital. The Mayor’s
Transport Strategy was published in July 2001, and
recognises that an increase in the capacity of
London’s transport system cannot be based on the
private car. It aims to increase the capacity of the
funding for 23 major new projects, such as
improved public transport interchanges, six
new bypasses, and four relief roads.
The Government has announced its intention to
introduce a Safety Bill covering travel by rail, air,
sea and on the roads.

21 Transport
Wales
The Welsh Assembly Government’s Transport
Framework for Wales, published in November
2001, sets the context within which the Assembly
Government’s decisions relating to transport will
be taken. It aims to provide a better co-ordinated
and sustainable transport system, including
improved public transport.
Programmes have been set out under the
Framework for rail, roads and local transport:
■ The SRA’s ten-year Strategic Plan for railways
in Wales identifies the important role to be
played by the Assembly Government in the
planning of railways. Some £60 million is
being invested in the rail infrastructure over
the next five years.
■ The Trunk Road Forward Programme aims,
among other things, to support economic
growth, secure environmental protection and
reinforce links between North and South
Wales. It includes a number of major
schemes, the start dates of which will be
phased in over the next six years.
■ Building on a £300 million investment
announced in January 2001, a further
£130 million has been provided for major
new local transport projects in 2002/03.
These include distributor roads, bus services
to rural areas and the ULTRA driverless taxi
scheme in the Cardiff Bay area.
Scotland
Expenditure on transport of £1,029 million is
planned in 2002/03, up from £986 million in
2001/02. Priorities include: creating an integrated
transport system; encouraging the use of public
transport; tackling congestion; moving freight off
the roads on to both the railways and waterways;
and maintaining affordable lifeline services to
islands and other remote areas.
The Executive’s Transport Delivery Report was
issued in March 2002. It recognises the major
challenges facing transport in Scotland for the
future - congestion, greater integration and
completing missing transport links. Ten priority
projects are identified, including:
■ a new 15-year Scottish passenger rail
franchise, from April 2004;
■ developing rail links for Glasgow and
Edinburgh airports;
■ addressing congestion problems in Aberdeen;
and
■ completing motorway links on the A8 and
A80.
Northern Ireland
An important element of the Regional
Development Strategy is the development of five
key transport corridors: strategic long-distance
routes connecting a number of towns to the major
regional ‘gateways’, including links to transport
corridors within the Belfast metropolitan area.
Within this context, the Minister for Regional
Development has published the Regional
Transportation Strategy for Northern Ireland
2002-2012, which takes into account the ten-year
plan and the wider priorities of the Northern
Ireland Programme for Government. Aiming to
contribute to a long-term goal of a modern,
sustainable, safe transport system, the £3.5 billion
Strategy seeks to balance investment across the
region. Among the areas to be targeted are:
■ the regional strategic transport network,
where, for example, Northern Ireland has a
low proportion of motorway compared with
the rest of the UK;
■ the Belfast metropolitan area; and
■ rural areas, for example modernising the
rural bus fleet.

Structure and performance
The value of all goods and services produced in
the UK economy for final consumption is
measured by gross domestic product (GDP). In
2001 GDP at current market prices - ‘money
GDP’ - totalled £988 billion. Average annual
growth in GDP at 1995 market prices over the past
five years has been 2.8 per cent (see also Table
22.1).

Output
In 2001 growth in the UK economy continued for
the tenth consecutive year. GDP at constant
market prices rose by 1.9 per cent, slightly below
its post-war average of around 2'h per cent a year.
Quarterly growth weakened during the year and
there was only slight growth in the fourth quarter.
Strong growth in domestic demand more than
accounted for the overall expansion, driven by a
4.1 per cent rise in household consumption. Gross
fixed capital formation fell marginally in 2001,
although general government investment
increased by 10.9 per cent; business investment
declined marginally following rapid expansion
over previous years. In the 2002 Budget, HM
Treasury expected trend GDP growth of
23A per cent a year in the period 2002 to 2004.
Recent decades have generally seen growth
dominated by the service sector (see chapter 29).
In 2001, at constant basic prices - that is, adjusted
for inflation, and excluding taxes and subsidies on
products - output of the service industries
increased by 3.4 per cent, with particularly strong
growth in post and telecommunications
(9.6 per cent) and in business services (7.0 per
cent). There was also a strong performance by the
construction industry, with growth of 3.6 per cent.
However, production industries’ output fell by
2.1 per cent, with manufacturing declining by
2.3 per cent, the first such decline since 1991.
Manufacturing (see chapter 27) contributed
17.5 per cent of GDP in 2001, compared with over
a third in 1950.
The UK experienced lower economic growth than
all its major competitors in the 1970s and, apart
from Germany and France, in the 1980s, according
to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). By the 1990s, although
the UK’s growth slowed, this gap had narrowed
significantly.

deductions, including taxes and social
contributions - totalled £686 billion. In 1995
prices, real household disposable income - the
amount of money the household sector has
available for spending after taxes and other
deductions - rose by 6.6 per cent over the year, the
strongest increase since 1988. Wages and salaries
increased by 5.9 per cent during 2001 to £478
billion, and accounted for over 59 per cent of
household primary income. Over the year, rises in
compensation of employees, social benefits and
property income outstripped interest payments,
social contributions and final consumption
expenditure. Household net financial wealth fell
by 16 per cent in 2001 to £2,011 billion. The
household saving ratio - saving as a percentage of
total available households’ resources - rose
substantially between 2000 and 2001, from 4.2 per
cent to 6.2 per cent, although it remains low
relative to the rates seen during most of the 1990s.
In 2001 household final expenditure - spending
by the household sector on products or services to
satisfy immediate needs or wants - rose by
4.1 per cent at constant prices to £568 billion,
representing 76.3 per cent of the total £744 billion
final consumption expenditure. This was the sixth
consecutive year of strong growth. Expenditure on
durable and semi-durable goods rose particularly
strongly, by 12.5 per cent and 8.9 per cent

respectively, although growth in services was only
1.1 per cent.
13.4 per cent of GDP, was slightly down on its
share in 2000.
Table 22.4 shows the pattern of household final
consumption expenditure. Since 1995, in real
terms, growth has been strongest in the durable
and semi-durable goods categories, much less so
in non-durable goods and services. By purpose,
communication, recreation and culture, clothing
and footwear, and household goods and services
have shown the most significant growth. On the
other hand, spending on health has shown the
smallest increase.
Investment
Gross fixed capital formation represents
investment in assets, primarily by businesses,
which are used repeatedly or continuously over
a number of years to produce goods, such as
machinery used to create a product. Total
investment at constant 1995 prices fell marginally
by 0.4 per cent in 2001 (see Table 22.5), compared
with the 1.9 per cent increase in 2000. Business
investment fell by 0.7 per cent in 2001 and, at
General government investment rose by
10.9 per cent in 2001 following a smaller 3.9 per
cent increase in 2000, and is forecast by HM
Treasury to accelerate further in 2002, with growth
remaining in double digits in both 2003 and 2004.
UK whole economy investment has accounted for
a smaller share of GDP than for other
industrialised countries - 16.4 per cent of GDP
(at current prices) in 2001, compared with a
G7 average of 19.0 per cent - but strong growth
of business investment until recently has helped
to reduce this gap.
International trade
International trade plays a key role in the UK
economy. The UK is the world’s fourth largest
trading nation, with exports accounting for
27 per cent of GDP in 2001. EU countries took
58.1 per cent of UK exports of goods in 2001 and
supplied 51.7 per cent of imported goods. See

Mergers and acquisitions
In 2001 expenditure on acquisitions abroad by UK
companies fell sharply by 77 per cent from the
record level seen in 2000 (see Table 22.6). Two
significant reported transactions were in the
telecommunications sector - the acquisition of Viag
Interkom GmbH by British Telecommunications
for a reported £4.4 billion and of Eircell 2000 by
Vodafone Group for £2.6 billion. Expenditure on
acquisitions in the UK by foreign companies also
fell sharply - by 62 per cent - from the record level
in 2000. Significant reported acquisitions in 2001
included that of the software group Serna by
Schlumberger Investments for £3.6 billion and of
the oil company Lasmo by Eni SpA for £2.7 billion.
Inflation
Three main measures of retail price inflation are
used in the UK:
■ the all items Retail Prices Index (RPI), the
main domestic measure of prices in the UK.
RPI inflation measures the average change
from month to month in the prices of goods
and services purchased by most households
in the UK and is commonly called ‘headline’
inflation;
■ the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments (RPIX), which is used to calculate
‘underlying’ inflation, the target measure set
by the Government (see page 334); and
■ the harmonised index of consumer prices
(HICP), calculated for each Member State of
the European Union for the purposes of
European comparisons; it is also used to
derive inflation rates for the eurozone and the
EU as a whole.
Retail Prices Index
The RPI is compiled using a large and
representative 'basket' of more than 650 goods and
services sampled each month to see how prices are
changing. Each year a review of the composition of
this 'basket' is undertaken. New items are added to
represent new or increasing areas of spending,
while other items are deleted as spending on them
falls. For the 2002 review some of the changes
included:
In Out
Frozen prawns Loose tea
Aluminium stepladders Pipe tobacco
Pet flea drops Shower curtains
Sunglasses Blank audio cassettes
Dumb-bells Darts
Annual underlying inflation (RPIX) has fluctuated
considerably in the last 25 years or so, peaking at
20.8 per cent in the year to May 1980. However, it
was much lower in the 1990s, and since 1993 has
been in a relatively narrow range, from around
2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. In 2001 it averaged
2.1 per cent, and has been below the
Government’s current target of 2'h per cent - set
in May 1997 - since April 1999, in all but two
months.
In 2001 the all items RPI averaged 1.8 per cent:
goods inflation averaged 0.3 per cent and services
inflation 3.8 per cent. UK inflation on the HICP

measure was 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the EU.
This was significantly below the EU average of
2.3 per cent and it has remained below the average
during the first half of 2002.
Having risen by 11.5 per cent in 2000, producer
input prices for materials and fuels purchased by
manufacturing industry declined by 0.3 per cent
in 2001 as a whole, as prices fell in the second half
of the year and into early 2002. Producer output
price inflation was 2.6 per cent in 2000 as a whole,
reducing to just 0.2 per cent in 2001, as output
prices fell towards the end of the year, driven by a
decline in the price of oil. They continued at this
lower level into the early part of 2002.
Labour market
Figures released in July 2002 show that
employment reached a record level of 28.51
million in the three months to May 2002, 179,000
higher than in the same period a year earlier, and
representing an employment rate of 74.7 per cent.
According to the International Labour
Organisation measure, unemployment, at
1,572,000 in the three months to May 2002, was
100,000 higher than a year earlier. This
represented 5.2 per cent of the workforce, well
below the figure (7.6 per cent) for all EU
countries. For full details see chapter 11.
Economic strategy
The main elements of the Government’s economic
strategy, designed to deliver high and stable levels
of economic growth and employment, are as set
out in the 2002 Budget:
■ delivering macroeconomic stability;

Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
■ increasing employment opportunity for all
(see chapter 11);
■ building a fairer society;
■ delivering high quality public services; and
■ protecting the environment.
HM Treasury is the department with prime
responsibility for the Government’s monetary and
fiscal frameworks. It is also responsible for wider
economic policy, which it carries out in
conjunction with other government departments,
such as Trade and Industry, Education and Skills,
Work and Pensions, and Transport.
The Government’s policy on UK membership of
the European single currency (see page 60)
remains as set out by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in his statement to Parliament in
October 1997. The determining factor
underpinning any decision is the national
economic interest and whether the economic case
for joining is clear and unambiguous. The
Government has set out five economic tests which
must be met before any decision to join can be
made. The five tests are:
■ sustainable convergence between Britain and
the economies of the single currency;
■ whether there is sufficient flexibility to cope
with economic change;
■ the effect on investment;
■ the impact on the UK financial services
industry; and
■ whether it is good for employment.
A comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the
five tests will be made within two years of the start
of this Parliament (June 2001). On the basis of the
assessment, the Government will decide whether
the five tests have been met. If a decision to
recommend joining is taken by the Government,
it will be put to a vote in Parliament and then to
a referendum of the British people.
Economic stability
The Government’s central economic objective is to
raise the economy’s sustainable rate of growth,
and achieve rising prosperity, through creating
economic and employment opportunities for all.
It has established frameworks for the operation of
both monetary and fiscal policy in order to
achieve low and stable inflation and sound public
finances, and seeks to ensure the co-ordination of
monetary and fiscal policy by setting mutually
consistent objectives for both.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (see page 452) is responsible for
setting interest rates to meet the Government’s
inflation target of I'h per cent, as defined by the
12-month change in RPIX. Official interest rates
peaked at 7'h per cent in 1998, compared with a
peak of 15 per cent in 1989 in the previous
economic cycle. More recently, they have been
held at 4 per cent since November 2001, as weak
external demand and investment have been
balanced by buoyant household consumption.
Fiscal policy
The Code for Fiscal Stability sets out the five key
principles of fiscal management at the heart of the
Government’s fiscal policy framework:
■ transparency in setting fiscal policy objectives,
the implementation of fiscal policy and the
publication of the public accounts;
■ stability in the fiscal policy-making process
and in the way that fiscal policy impacts on
the economy;
■ responsibility in the management of the
public finances;
■ fairness, including between present and future
generations; and
■ efficiency in the design and implementation
of fiscal policy, and in managing both sides of
the public sector balance sheet.
The Code also requires the Government to state
its objectives and fiscal rules through which it
operates fiscal policy based on these principles.
The objectives are:
■ over the medium term, to ensure sound
public finances and that spending and
taxation impact fairly both within and
between generations; and
334
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
■ over the short term, to support monetary
policy and, in particular, to allow the
‘automatic stabilisers’ to play their role in
smoothing the path of the economy.
These objectives are implemented through the
Government’s two fiscal rules, against which the
performance of fiscal policy can be judged, and
which are set out in its Economic and Fiscal
Strategy Report (see below):
■ the golden rule - over the economic cycle, the
Government will borrow only to invest and
not to fund current spending; and
■ the sustainable investment rule - public sector
net debt as a proportion of GDP will be held
over the economic cycle at a stable and
prudent level. Other things being equal, net
debt will be maintained below 40 per cent of
GDP over the economic cycle.
These fiscal rules promote economic stability by
ensuring sound public sector finances, while
allowing flexibility in two key respects:
■ the rules are set over the cycle, allowing fiscal
balances to vary between years in line with
the cyclical position of the economy; and
■ the interaction of the two rules promotes
capital investment while ensuring sustainable
public finances in the longer term.
The fiscal framework also recognises that
projections of the current budget and net debt
involve a considerable element of uncertainty.
Projections of the public finances are therefore
deliberately based on prudent assumptions for
key economic variables. These assumptions,
which include the trend rate of growth, the level
of unemployment, and oil and equity prices,
are audited by the National Audit Office (NAO -
see page 350) under a three-year rolling review
to ensure they remain both reasonable and
cautious. This minimises the need for
unexpected changes in direction in taxation
or spending.
Sound public finances are a prerequisite for
sustainable investment in public services. The
fiscal rules are the foundation of the public
spending framework (see chapter 23) and have
important consequences for the structure of the
budgeting regime.
The Budget
The role of the Budget is to:
■ provide an update on the state of the
economy and the public finances and to
present new forecasts for each;
■ set out the Government’s economic and fiscal
objectives; and
■ report on the progress the Government has
made towards achieving its objectives, and set
out the further steps it is taking to meet
them.
It is usually published in March, although in 2002
it was published in April. In a major speech to
Parliament, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
reviews the nation’s economic performance and
describes the Government’s economic objectives
and the economic policies it intends to follow in
order to achieve them. In accordance with the
Code for Fiscal Stability, the 2002 Budget report
comprised two documents:
■ the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report
(EFSR), setting out the Government’s long¬
term goals and the comprehensive strategy it
is pursuing to achieve them, the progress that
has been made so far, and the further steps
the Government is taking in the 2002 Budget
to advance its long-term goals; and
■ the Financial Statement and Budget Report
(FSBR), providing a summary of each of the
main Budget measures and how they affect
the Budget arithmetic, and updated forecasts
of the economy and the public finances.
Under the Code for Fiscal Stability, the
Government is committed to publishing a
Pre-Budget Report (PBR) at least three months
prior to the Budget (usually in the previous
November). The PBR provides an opportunity
for the Government to consult the public on
specific policy initiatives under consideration
for the forthcoming Budget, as well as
presenting an interim update on the outlook
for the economy and the public finances,
taking account of economic and other
developments since the previous Budget.

22 Economic and business framework
Industrial and commercial policy
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
aims to increase UK competitiveness and scientific
excellence in order to generate higher levels of
sustainable growth and productivity. It has four
specific objectives:
■ to promote enterprise, innovation and higher
productivity;
■ to make the most of the UK’s scientific,
engineering and technological capabilities;
■ to create strong and competitive markets
within a fair and effective regulatory
framework; and
■ to assist the competitiveness of UK
companies through export promotion and
inward investment.
Competitiveness
In February 2001 the DTI published the second in
its series of UK competitiveness indicators,
including international comparisons with other
members of the G7 and the OECD. In March 2002
a web-based version was launched
(www.dtistats.net/competitiveness), and this is
updated on a regular basis. According to the
indicators, the UK is a relatively open economy,
with a high level of both inward and outward
investment. Among other UK strengths noted at
the time the web-based version was launched:
■ the growth in GDP per head was the second
highest of the G7 countries over the most
recent economic cycle;
■ knowledge-based industries, such as
aerospace, pharmaceuticals and
telecommunications, were responsible for
54 per cent of output in 2000, with the UK
having a higher share of knowledge-based
exports than any other G7 country;
■ the science base was highly productive and of
high quality;
■ venture capital investment as a proportion
of GDP was higher than in any other EU
country;
■ the percentage of business connected to
digital networks was the highest in the G7;
and
Enterprise Bill
The Enterprise Bill was introduced into Parliament in
March 2002. It contains a number of provisions
designed to foster enterprise, promote competition
and increase productivity in the UK. These include:
■ the removal of ministerial involvement from most
decisions on mergers and market investigations,
with the intention of making the competition
regime more transparent and predictable for
business;
■ criminal penalties for those who operate cartels;
■ legislative weight to a new right for consumer
groups to make 'super-complaints' to the Office
of Fair Trading (OFT), to which the OFT would
have to respond within 90 days;
■ the power to enable the OFT to refer markets to
the Competition Commission where it appears
they may not be working well;
■ reforms to strengthen the legal rights of parties
harmed by anti-competitive behaviour;
■ a formal role for the competition authorities to
alert government to existing and proposed
regulations that may have anti-competitive
effects; and
■ modernisation of insolvency law, to provide those
bankrupts who have failed through no fault of
their own with a second chance while introducing
a tougher regime for those who have been
reckless or dishonest (see page 345).
■ progress had been made in improving skills.
The indicators also found that there were areas for
improvement. For example, the UK invested less
than other G7 countries and UK business was less
innovative, entrepreneurial and risk-taking, while
UK workers were relatively less skilled than in
other EU countries. Productivity continued at a
level below that of the UK’s main competitors. In
2001 the UK registered a weaker productivity
performance than in 2000, with the annual rise in
productivity falling from 1.9 to 1.0 per cent (see
Table 22.9), as firms tended to retain labour
despite weaker external demand. The DTI plans to
publish in October 2002 a document summarising
the UK’s performance against the main drivers of
productivity.

Enterprise, innovation and business
support
The DTI promotes enterprise and innovation by
encouraging successful business start-ups and
offering businesses a number of support services.
Most support is designed to assist business,
especially small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), to expand and invest, and to adopt best
practice.
The DTI has reviewed business support
arrangements and confirmed the role of the Small
Business Service (SBS), an agency of the DTI, in
organising the delivery of help for SMEs. In
addition, the Secretary of State is advised by the
Small Business Council, a non-departmental
public body with 20 members, most of whom are
entrepreneurs with experience of running an SME.
The Business Link network, which reports to the
SBS, covers 45 areas throughout England formed
by partnerships between local enterprise agencies,
local authorities, chambers of commerce and
some commercial organisations with wider
interests. In addition, the network can be
accessed nationally via a contact number and
associated website {www.businesslink.org).
Business Link, which offers information and
advice on a wide range of subjects, is the
‘gateway’ to a network of business support
organisations, as well as to information from the
public, private and voluntary sectors. The main
advice services are delivered by personal business
advisers, who either give advice or arrange
appointments with the relevant experts. The
SBS plans to spend some £140 million on the
network services in 2002/03.
Elsewhere in the UK similar business support
arrangements apply:
■ in Scotland, the Small Business Gateway
offers a package of measures designed to
improve the quality and consistency of public
sector support for new and small businesses
in the Scottish Enterprise area, which covers
the lowland areas of the country, while the
Business Information Source of Highlands
and Islands Enterprise operates equivalent
services;
■ in Wales, following a review of business
support services, the Welsh Development
Agency is working with its partners to
develop a new single gateway for business
support; and
■ in Northern Ireland, firms are helped by
Invest Northern Ireland (see page 340).
Business finance
Small businesses can face particular difficulties
accessing finance. The Government is working in
partnership with the private sector to help to
address weaknesses in the finance market for
SMEs. The Enterprise Fund is a partnership with
the private sector to deliver and develop risk
capital programmes to support SMEs. Funding for
SMEs includes:
■ the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme,
which offers guarantees on loans to small
firms with viable business proposals that are
unable to obtain conventional finance as they
lack security to offer against a loan. For
337
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
established businesses that have been trading
for two years or more, the SBS provides a
guarantee of 85 per cent on loans of up to
£250,000 and for other businesses, including
start-ups, the guarantee is 70 per cent on
loans of up to £100,000. Since the scheme
started in 1981 around 80,000 loans, valued
at £3 billion, have been guaranteed;
■ new Regional Venture Capital Funds, which
are being established in each region of
England to encourage small businesses with
high growth potential - the first five are
already in operation. They operate as public-
private partnerships (see page 350), with
investment from the Government of up to
£80 million and from the European
Investment Fund of £53 million. Private
sector funding of at least £187 million is
being sought;
■ the UK High Technology Fund, which is a
‘fund of funds’, managed by a private equity
firm. It has £20 million of government
investment and has secured £106 million of
private sector funding. The Fund has
committed over £114 million to eight
venture capital funds that specialise in
investing in early-growth, high-technology
companies, and investments have been made
in 69 firms;
■ the £75 million SBS Business Incubation
Fund, which opened for applications in
October 2001 and is available until 2004/05.
It is providing loans to those in the English
regions setting up or running business
incubation projects (helping SMEs to survive
and grow when they are at their most
vulnerable in their start-up and early-growth
stages) whose development plans are
hindered by a shortfall in funding from other
sources; and
■ a new programme of Early Growth Funding,
which is being developed by the SBS to
encourage the provision of relatively small
amounts of risk capital for start-up and
growth businesses. The SBS will invest up to
£50 million over three years to help up to
1,000 businesses.
In addition, the £100 million Phoenix Fund helps
to tackle social exclusion by encouraging
entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas and in
groups under-represented in business ownership.
The Queen's Awards for Enterprise
The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise scheme
(www.queensawards.org.uk) has three categories:
the Award for International Trade, which
recognises export achievement and outstanding
performance in other forms of international
trading; the Award for Innovation; and the Award
for Sustainable Development, which recognises
commercially successful products, services and
approaches to management that have major
benefits for the environment, society and the
wider economy. All UK organisations that operate
regularly as a ‘business unit’ and can meet the
criteria are eligible to apply. Awards are made
annually and are valid for five years. The Queen
makes the awards on the advice of the Prime
Minister, who is assisted by an advisory committee
that includes representatives of government,
industry and commerce, and trade unions.
Successful organisations may fly the Queen’s
Award flag at their principal premises and are
entitled to use the Queen’s Award Emblem on
their stationery, packaging, goods and advertising.
In 2002, 131 Awards were granted: 85 for
International Trade, 37 for Innovation and nine
for Sustainable Development.
Information and communications
technology
The Government is keen to ensure that the UK
benefits fully from the growth of the Internet (see
page 242) and of‘e-commerce’. Its e-commerce
strategy is being taken forward by the Office of the
‘e-Envoy’, within the Cabinet Office. This aims to
make the UK a leading e-commerce nation, and to
provide all government services electronically and
in a customer-focused way by the end of 2005. By
mid-2002 over 50 per cent of government services
were online. The Government’s website
(www.ukonline.gov.uk) is a portal for over 1,000
government department and agency websites and
17 per cent of Internet users in the UK have
accessed government websites or e-government
services online.
The ONS e-commerce survey of UK businesses
indicates that in 2001, excluding the financial
sector, there were £18.4 billion of sales made
online, that is, over the Internet. This represented
1.0 per cent of total sales by the non-financial
sectors of the UK economy. Sales by firms in the
non-financial sectors over electronic networks
other than the Internet were provisionally
estimated at £182 billion in 2001. The survey
338
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
found that 50 per cent of businesses reported use
of the Internet in 2001:
■ 12 per cent had permanent Internet connections;
■ 17 per cent of those not already online in
2001 planned to be during 2002;
■ 39 per cent of businesses had their own website;
■ 49 per cent used e-mail in 2001;
■ 64 per cent used personal computers, work
stations or terminals in 2001; and
■ of those online, 7 per cent were selling online
and 25 per cent were purchasing online, while
9 per cent and 10 per cent of businesses were
selling and purchasing via other electronic
networks respectively.
Regional development
The Government’s view is that all regions and
communities should have the opportunity to
share in the UK’s prosperity. Its regional policy
aims to facilitate economic growth in the regions,
and to create the conditions to enable regional
and local initiatives to work. Financial help is
focused on the Assisted Areas, covering some
16.5 million people in Great Britain and all
1.7 million people in Northern Ireland. Regional
Selective Assistance (RSA) is the main instrument
of government support to industry in the Assisted
Areas in Great Britain, and is now focusing more
on high-quality, knowledge-based projects that
provide skilled jobs. In 2001/02, 477 offers of RSA
grants totalling £246 million were accepted in
Great Britain in support of projects with total
investment of £1.46 billion, which is expected to
create or safeguard 38,000 jobs.
England
Nine Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in
England (see also chapter 2) aim to stimulate
economic development and regeneration; promote
business efficiency, investment, competitiveness and
employment; raise the level of skills; and contribute
to the achievement of sustainable development.
The RDAs have developed regional economic
strategies, which are designed to secure better and
more sustainable economic performance for their
regions. They work closely with the Government
Offices for the Regions on economic development
and regeneration programmes. The work of the
RDAs is currently scrutinised by voluntary regional
chambers.
Funding for the RDAs is £1.55 billion in 2002/03,
rising to £2.0 billion in 2005/06. From April 2002
RDA funding is being provided under a single
cross-departmental framework to give the
agencies greater flexibility to concentrate their
resources according to regional priorities. The DTI
is the lead sponsoring department, with a number
of other departments contributing to the RDAs’
single programme. RDAs have to meet a number
of targets set by these departments, including
targets on economic development, regeneration
and skills development.
The Government’s plans for decentralising power
and strengthening regional policy in England were
set out in a White Paper, Your Region, Your Choice:
Revitalising the English Regions (see page 10),
published in May 2002. The White Paper:
■ confirms greater freedom and flexibility for
the RDAs;
■ sets out an enhanced role for the regional
chambers;
■ gives extra responsibilities to the Government
Offices; and
■ in the longer term, offers regions the chance
to vote in a referendum to have an elected
assembly which would be responsible for
setting priorities, delivering regional
strategies and allocating funding.
Scotland
In Scotland the Scottish Executive Enterprise and
Lifelong Learning Department, which has overall
responsibility for development of the Scottish
economy, operates a range of schemes to support
business. Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise are the lead economic
development agencies in lowland and highland
Scotland respectively, operating mainly through
the network of Local Enterprise Companies
(LECs), which are wholly owned subsidiaries of
the national agencies. The enterprise networks are
focusing on three main aspects of raising
productivity: encouraging entrepreneurship,
raising skill levels and improving international
links. Joint working with other economic
development partners is developing through a
339
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
network of Local Economic Forums, which
consider local needs within the national
framework and aim to deliver a co-ordinated
approach to local economic development.
Wales
In December 2001 the National Assembly for
Wales issued its new national economic
development strategy, ‘A Winning Wales’,
including:
■ a greater focus in the Welsh economy on
innovation, enterprise, skills and ICT;
■ a commitment to an improved planning
system;
■ greater emphasis on sustainable development;
and
■ developing the theme of working in
partnership with others.
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) is the
lead body for economic development. Its business
plan is drawn up within the policy framework of
the national economic development strategy. The
WDA is focusing its activities on encouraging
businesses to increase the level of value added, on
supporting innovation and encouraging
entrepreneurship and e-commerce.
In 2001/02 over £109 million in RSA grants were
offered to 235 investment projects in Wales.
Business support schemes have been simplified,
and a new Assembly Investment Grant, providing
grants of between £5,001 and £50,000 to small
and medium-sized enterprises, was introduced in
April 2002.
Northern Ireland
A new agency, Invest Northern Ireland, was set up
in April 2002 to promote and support innovation
and entrepreneurship in the Northern Ireland
economy. The agency has become responsible for
the business support aspects of the Northern
Ireland Tourist Board, the company development
programme element of the Department of
Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and the
functions of three bodies: the Industrial
Development Board, the Local Enterprise
Development Unit and the Industrial Research
and Technology Unit.
European Union regional funding
The EU seeks to promote economic and social
cohesion, reducing disparities between the regions
and countries of the Union. The principal
responsibility for helping poorer areas remains
with national authorities, but the EU provides
additional funding and targets the worst affected
areas through its Structural Funds. The major
fund is the European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF), which supports regional competitiveness,
training, economic development and innovation.
The UK is due to receive about £10.7 billion from
the Funds in 2000-06. This is supporting a range
of projects, designed to encourage businesses to
grow, create suitable conditions for inward
investment and new jobs, assist the most
disadvantaged areas and the socially excluded, and
help people to learn new skills.
The highest level of assistance is available to areas
with ‘Objective 1’ status, where GDP is less than
75 per cent of the EU average. In the UK about
£3 billion is allocated to four Objective 1 areas:
Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly, Merseyside, South
Yorkshire, and West Wales & the Valleys. There is a
special programme in Northern Ireland and a
transitional funding programme in the Highlands
and Islands of Scotland; both areas used to have
Objective 1 status.
Aid is also available to areas qualifying for
‘Objective 2’ status, which covers industrial and
urban areas in need of regeneration, declining
rural areas, and depressed areas dependent on
fisheries. About 13.8 million people in the UK are
in Objective 2 areas and a further 6 million benefit
from transitional programmes.
Competitive markets
The Enterprise Bill (see page 336) includes
measures to implement the Government’s plans to
strengthen the UK’s overall competition regime, as
set out in the White Paper Productivity and
Enterprise - A World Class Competition Regime,
published in July 2001. These include:
■ new regimes for investigating mergers and
markets, with decisions taken in a large
majority of cases by independent competition
authorities (see page 341) against a new
competition-based test within a more
transparent and accountable framework, and
with the end of ministerial involvement in
these decisions;
340
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
■ new criminal penalties to deter those who
dishonestly engage in cartels covering the
most serious forms of anti-competitive
activity, such as agreements to fix prices,
share markets, limit production and rig bids;
and
■ enabling those harmed by anti-competitive
behaviour to bring claims for damages before
a specialist competition body, the
Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Office of Fair Trading
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) (www.oft.gov.uk)
is a non-ministerial government department
headed by the Director General of Fair Trading. It
administers a wide range of legislation on
competition and on consumer protection (see
chapter 29). The Competition Act 1998, whose
main provisions came into force in March 2000, is
enforced by the Director General of Fair Trading
and the utility regulators (see page 342) who have
concurrent powers in their sectors. The Act
introduced two prohibitions:
■ of agreements which prevent, restrict or
distort competition and which may affect
trade within the UK (the Chapter I
prohibition); and
■ of conduct by undertakings that amounts to
an abuse of a dominant position in a market
and may affect trade in the UK (the Chapter
II prohibition).
The Chapter I and II prohibitions are based on
articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of Rome. An
agreement will infringe the Chapter I prohibition
only if it has as its object or effect an appreciable
prevention, restriction or distortion of
competition in the UK. The Director General
takes the view that an agreement will generally
have no appreciable effect on competition if the
parties’ combined share of the market does not
exceed 25 per cent, although there will be
circumstances when this is not the case. Under the
Act, the Director General has the power to impose
financial penalties of up to 10 per cent of turnover
in the UK for up to three years on an undertaking
that has infringed either prohibition.
The OFT has already imposed the first penalties
under the Act on a pharmaceuticals firm found to
have abused its dominant position in the supply of
drugs for cancer patients. At the end of 2001 over
40 cases under the Act were under consideration.
The OFT has also begun to take action to promote
competition in specific markets. It has launched
studies into competition in the markets for
consumer IT goods and services, pharmacies,
extended warranties for electrical goods, and the
estate agency market in England and Wales. The
market for extended warranties for electrical
goods has now been referred to the Competition
Commission for further investigation, as has the
market for private dentistry, following the first
‘super-complaint’ (see page 336) by the
Consumers’ Association.
Competition Commission
The Competition Commission (www.competition-
org.uk) has two main arms:
■ a reporting arm, which investigates various
aspects of monopolies and mergers referred
by the Director General of Fair Trading or a
utility regulator; and
■ an Appeal Tribunals arm, which hears appeals
against decisions of the Director General of
Fair Trading and the regulators made
under the prohibition provisions of the
Competition Act 1998.
Its report on small business banking (see page
454) found that a complex monopoly existed and
proposed a series of remedies.
Mergers and monopolies
A merger qualifies for investigation if it involves
the acquisition of assets of more than £70 million
or the creation or enhancement of a 25 per cent
share of the supply of a particular good or service
in the UK or a substantial part of it. There is a
voluntary procedure for pre-notification of
proposed mergers. Qualifying mergers are
considered by the Director General of Fair
Trading, who currently advises the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry on whether the
merger should be referred to the Competition
Commission. The Secretary of State’s policy is
to follow the advice of the Director General on
reference, unless there are exceptional
circumstances. In general, a reference to the
Competition Commission will be made where the
merger raises competition concerns. However,
most mergers are cleared without being referred
to the Competition Commission. Under the
Enterprise Bill, the final decision in merger cases
341
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
(apart from those raising exceptional public
interest issues) would be made by the
Competition Commission.
If the Competition Commission finds that a
merger could be expected to operate against the
public interest, the Secretary of State can prohibit
it, allow it, or allow it subject to certain conditions
being met. Where the merger has already taken
place, action can be taken to reverse it. There are
special provisions for newspaper and water
company mergers.
The European Commission has exclusive
jurisdiction in mergers which meet certain
domestic, EC and global turnover thresholds.
The Commission can ban mergers if it concludes
that they would create or strengthen a dominant
market position which would significantly impede
effective competition within the EU or a
substantial part of it; alternatively, it may
negotiate undertakings to correct the adverse
effect.
The Director General of Fair Trading and those
utility regulators with parallel powers may
examine scale and complex monopolies,1 and
make a reference to the Competition Commission
to establish whether a monopoly operates, or may
be expected to operate, against the public interest.
Sectoral regulators
There are a number of bodies which regulate
particular industries or sectors formerly in public
ownership, including the Office of Gas and
Electricity Markets (see page 443), the Office of
Water Services (see page 447), the Office of
Telecommunications (Oftel - see page 242) and
two regulatory bodies for the railways: the
Strategic Rail Authority and the Office of the Rail
Regulator (see page 318). Each regulator operates
within a framework of statutory objectives, an
important feature of which is to protect and
promote the interests of consumers, for example
through ensuring effective competition.
1 A scale monopoly exists where a single company (or a group of
interconnected companies) supplies or acquires at least
25 per cent of the goods or services of a particular type in all or
part of the UK. A complex monopoly exists where a group of
companies which are not connected and together account for at
least 25 per cent of the supply of, or acquisition of, any particular
description of goods or services in all or part of the UK engage in
conduct which has, or is likely to have, the effect of restricting,
distorting or preventing competition.
EU Single Market
The Government is working with the European
Commission and other Member States to ensure
effective competition within the Single Market (see
page 366). It is looking to improve the way the
market operates through wide-ranging economic
reforms which target ‘weak areas’ (those areas
where the Single Market does not work as well as it
could) identified by the Commission. By the end
of May 2002, 98.5 per cent of Single Market
measures had been incorporated into UK law.
Corporate affairs
The UK has around 3.7 million businesses
including many large companies. In 2001 there
were 3,540 UK businesses employing 500 or
more people (see Table 22.10), representing
39.6 per cent of total employment by UK
businesses and 41.2 per cent of turnover. A small
number of large companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for a substantial proportion of
total production in some sectors. This is
particularly true for chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
motor vehicle assembly and aerospace.

According to a Financial Times survey of the
world’s 500 largest companies in March 2002, 41
were UK-based, with a market capitalisation of
US$1,498 billion (£1,052 billion). Of the top 20
UK companies by market capitalisation, six were
banks and there were two each in oil and gas,
telecommunication services, pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology, and mining (see Table 22.11). BP,
the biggest UK company, was the eighth largest in
the world and the second largest oil and gas
company. In the other most valuable sectors, by
market capitalisation:
■ the UK had four representatives in the
world’s top ten banks - HSBC Holdings,
Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and
Barclays;
■ GlaxoSmithKline was the world’s third largest
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company,
and AstraZeneca ranked sixth; and
Vodafone was the world’s second biggest
telecommunication services company.
Value added scoreboard
To complement 'scoreboards' on research and
development and on capital expenditure, the DTI
published in May 2002 the UK's first company
wealth creation league table, which includes the
500 largest UK firms and the 300 largest European
companies by added value. Five UK companies
featured in the top 15 wealth creators in Europe:
Shell, BP, HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and BT. The total
annual value added for the UK 500 was
£427 billion.
Small firms play an important part in the UK
economy: around 43 per cent of the private sector
workforce work for companies employing fewer
than 50 people. About 2.6 million businesses are
sole traders or partners without employees, while
a further 747,655 businesses employ one to four
people (see Table 22.10). Together these
3.3 million enterprises account for 89.3 per cent
of the number of businesses, 22.7 per cent of
business employment and 15.4 per cent of
turnover. In 2001 there were 345,000 business
start-ups in the UK.
Private sector firms predominate in the economy.
The public sector has become much less
significant following the privatisation since 1979
of many public sector businesses, including gas,
electricity supply, coal and telecommunications.
The remaining major nationalised industries are
Consignia (see page 244), BNFL (British Nuclear
Fuels) and the Civil Aviation Authority.
Company profitability
Company profitability, in terms of the net rate of
return on capital employed, was 11.6 per cent in
2001, compared with 12.5 per cent in 2000 (see
Figure 22.12). Among the individual sectors:
■ the net rate of return for UK Continental
Shelf companies fell slightly, from
35.7 per cent in 2000 to 34.2 per cent in 2001,
although it remained at a historically high
level, reflecting a combination of high oil and
gas prices and high levels of output;
■ service companies’ net rate of return, at
12.9 per cent, was the lowest since 1993

and compared with the recent peak of
16.2 per cent in 1998; and
■ the net rate of return for manufacturing
firms fell from 8.6 per cent in 2000 to
3.6 per cent in 2001, representing the lowest
annual rate of return since 1984.
Corporate structure
At the end of March 2002 there were about
1,491,500 ‘live’ companies registered in Great
Britain with the Registrar of Companies.
Companies incorporated overseas with a place of
business or branch in Great Britain must also
register. Most corporate businesses are ‘limited
liability’ companies, in which the liability of
members is restricted to contributing an amount
related to their shareholding (or to their
guarantee where companies are limited by
guarantee). Since April 2001 a firm has been able
to be incorporated as a limited liability
partnership, with the organisational flexibility and
tax status of a partnership but with limited
liability for its members.
Companies may be either public or private; about
12,400 are public limited companies (pics). A
company must satisfy certain conditions before it
can become a pic. It must be limited by shares and
meet specified minimum capital requirements.
Private companies are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Company law and corporate governance
Company law is designed to meet the need for
proper regulation of business, to maintain open
markets and to create safeguards for those wishing
to invest in companies or do business with them.
It takes account of EC Directives on company law,
and on company and group accounts and their
auditing.
A three-year fundamental review of company law
led by an independent steering group of experts
was completed in July 2001. The review
recommended the development of a modern
framework of company law that would encourage
both competitiveness and accountability. In July
2002 the Government published in a White Paper
Modernising Company Law its response to the
review’s major recommendations and its core
proposals to reform company law. It will consult
on further proposals for the reform of company
law as soon as practicable.
In August 2002 new regulations came into force
which give shareholders a right to an annual vote
on company directors’ pay, with the intention of
strengthening accountability, transparency and the
links between pay and company performance. A
quoted company is required, as part of the annual
reporting cycle, to publish a report on directors’
remuneration. This must include full details of
directors’ remuneration, including details of the
performance criteria for share options and long¬
term incentive schemes, a justification of any
compensation payments when a contract is
terminated, and a graph showing company
performance. A company must put a resolution to
shareholders on this remuneration report at each
annual general meeting. In April 2002 the
Government commissioned an independent
review of the role and effectiveness of company
non-executive directors, which is expected to
report around the end of 2002.
Insolvency
The Government wants a modern insolvency
regime that supports enterprise and encourages
responsible risk-taking. The Insolvency Act 2000
provided small firms in financial difficulty with
the option of a moratorium to agree a rescue plan
with their creditors, and introduced
disqualification undertakings whereby unfit
company directors may agree a period of
344
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
disqualification without the need to go to court,
so speeding up the process. Major changes to
insolvency law are contained in the Enterprise Bill,
now before Parliament. The Bill would:
■ reduce the duration of bankruptcy from three
years to a maximum of 12 months for those
who do not represent a risk to the public or
commercial interests, while at the same time
providing more effective protection against
those who do - it would also remove many
restrictions currently applying to bankrupts
that the Government considers are irrelevant
and outdated;
■ reform corporate insolvency law by
restricting the use of administrative
receivership and streamlining administration;
■ abolish the Crown’s preferential rights to
recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors;
and
■ modernise the financial regime of the
Insolvency Service.
Regulation of business
The Government is working towards ensuring
high standards of regulation across the UK by
changing the culture of regulation through
institutional and procedural reforms, lifting
barriers to enterprise by removing or relaxing
specific regulations, and improving
communications with business. In February 2002
it announced a Regulatory Reform Action Plan
(www.cabinet-ojfice.gov.uk/regulation/actionplan/
index.htm), with over 250 measures. Among these
are changes to simplify and consolidate fire safety
legislation; a Green Paper to reform the planning
system, including speeding up the planning
process for business (see page 303); and reforms
to reduce restrictions on the operation of credit
unions and to develop their role as financial
institutions (see page 457).
The Cabinet Office’s Regulatory Impact Unit
(www.cabinet-ojfice.gov.uk/regulation) works to
ensure that new and existing regulation is
necessary, meets the principles of better
regulation, and imposes the minimum burden.
The Regulatory Impact Unit helps to ensure that
regulatory impact assessments are prepared for
proposals that have an effect on business, charities
and the voluntary sector. These assess the cost,
benefit and risk, as well as considering all the
available options to achieve the policy goals,
including non-regulatory alternatives. Each
government department has a minister
responsible for its regulatory reform programme.
The Ministerial Panel for Regulatory
Accountability takes a strategic overview of the
regulatory system to tackle instances where
progress on regulatory reform is blocked.
The Better Regulation Task Force advises the
Government to ensure that regulation and its
enforcement conform to the principles of good
regulation. In 2001/02 the Task Force conducted
reviews of employment regulations, local delivery
of central government policy, higher education,
and scientific research and regulation. In its
2002/03 work programme the Task Force will
study the problems small firms face when doing
business with the public sector, independent
regulators, alternatives to state regulation, and
producer responsibility and waste.
Industrial associations
The CBI (Confederation of British Industry)
(www.cbi.org.uk) is the largest business
organisation in the UK. With a membership
comprising companies and trade associations, it
represents some 200,000 firms which employ
about 7.5 million people. The CBI’s objective is to
help create and sustain the conditions in which
British business can compete and prosper, both in
the UK and overseas. Examples of its work include
lobbying to minimise the burden of regulation,
and campaigning to spread best practice. The CBI
also offers a wide range of advisory services,
including a series of regular economic surveys. It
is the British member of the Union of Industrial
and Employers’ Confederations (UNICE). The
CBI has 13 regional offices in the UK and offices
in Brussels and Washington.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)
(www.chamberonline.co.uk) is a national network
of chambers of commerce, which are local,
independent, non-profit-making organisations
funded by membership subscriptions. With over
2,500 staff covering more than 100 locations, the
network provides a wide range of services for its
membership of over 135,000 businesses. Services
provided include business training, commercial
services, export-related services, financial services
and access to information resources. The BCC
represents business views to the Government at
345
Economic affairs
22 Economic and business framework
national and local levels and is also part of the
global network of chambers of commerce.
The Institute of Directors (loD) {www.iod.com)
has around 55,000 members in the UK. It provides
business advisory services on matters affecting
company directors, such as corporate
management, insolvency and career counselling,
and represents the interests of members to
authorities in the UK and EU.
Enterprise Insight {www.enterpriseinsight.co.uk), a
government-supported initiative launched in 2000
and led by a company owned jointly by the BCC,
CBI and loD, is aiming to encourage more
positive attitudes to enterprise among young
people aged 5 to 30 and to develop their
entrepreneurial skills. Up to 1,000 ‘ambassadors’
from business are helping to develop closer links
between schools and the business community.
The Federation of Small Businesses is the largest
pressure group promoting the interests of the self-
employed and small firms. The Federation has
over 168,000 members, and provides them with
expert information and guidance on subjects such
as taxation, employment, health and safety, and
insurance.
Trade associations represent companies that
produce or sell a particular product or group of
products. They exist to supply common services,
regulate trading practices and represent their
members in dealings with government
departments. For information on trade
associations and trade unions see chapter 11.

Fiscal policy framework 347 Debt management 351
Public spending framework 347 Main sources of revenue 352
The UK Government’s spending and revenue are
now over £400 billion a year. The main categories
of expenditure and of receipts are shown in Table
23.5 and Figure 23.6 respectively on pages 351
and 352.
Since 1998/99 there has been a surplus on the
public sector current budget, which reached £21.3
billion in 2000/01 (see Table 23.1). However, it fell
back to £7.7 billion in 2001/02, primarily reflecting
a fall in receipts from financial corporations and
lower growth in other receipts, especially of
corporation tax. Receipts from the latter were little
changed, reflecting weaker global economic
growth in 2001 and the resulting weak profitability
of non-fmancial corporations.
Fiscal policy framework
■ the sustainable investment rule - public sector
net debt as a proportion of gross domestic
product (GDP) will be held over the
economic cycle at a stable and prudent level -
generally below 40 per cent of GDP.
The fiscal framework also recognises that
projections of the current budget and net debt
involve a considerable element of uncertainty.
Projections of the public finances are therefore
deliberately based on prudent assumptions for key
economic variables. These assumptions, which
include the trend rate of growth, the level of
unemployment, and oil and equity prices, are
audited by the National Audit Office (NAO - see
page 350) under a three-year rolling review to
ensure they remain both reasonable and cautious.
This minimises the need for unexpected changes
in direction in taxation or spending.
The fiscal policy framework is designed to
ensure sound public finances, which are a
prerequisite for sustainable investment in public
services. The Code for Fiscal Stability sets out the
five key principles of fiscal management -
transparency, stability, responsibility, fairness and
efficiency - and government objectives are
implemented through two fiscal rules which are
the foundation of the spending framework and
are designed to promote economic stability:
■ the golden rule - over the economic cycle, the
Government will borrow only to invest and
not to fund current spending; and
Table 23.1 Key fiscal indicators, UK
Public spending framework
The key elements of the public spending
framework are:
■ three-year Departmental Expenditure Limits
(DHLs), designed to ensure that government
departments plan and manage resources more
effectively over the medium term;
■ Annually Managed Expenditure (AME),
which covers those elements of spending that
cannot reasonably be subject to firm

Other features of the framework include:

■ a National Asset Register to improve the
utilisation of the public sector asset base;
■ flexibility to allow departments to retain
resources not fully spent by the end of the
financial year, so assisting departments in
managing their budgets and avoiding wasteful
end-of-year spending surges;
■ Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB)
procedures, which became fully operational in
April 2001 and apply the financial reporting
practices of the private sector and much of
the rest of the public sector to government
departments’ accounts, estimates and budgets.

focus more on departmental objectives and
outputs in terms of resources used rather than
the money available for spending; and

Public expenditure
In terms of 2002/03 prices, Total Managed
Expenditure rose from £220.5 billion in 1971/72
to £399.5 billion in 2001/02 (see Table 23.2).
During this period it peaked as a proportion of
GDP at 49.9 per cent in 1975/76, but by
1999/2000 had fallen to 37.4 per cent, before
rising to 39.0 per cent in 2001/02. Total Managed
Expenditure is projected to rise to £418.4 billion
in 2002/03 and to reach £474.6 billion by 2005/06
when in nominal terms it would be £511.4 billion
(see Table 23.3).
Spending priorities
Social security is the biggest single element of
public spending, involving expenditure of
£105 billion (nearly 25 per cent of spending) in
2002/03, followed by spending on the National
Health Service (NHS) of £68 billion and on
education of £54 billion (see Table 23.5).
In the April 2002 Budget the Government set
overall spending limits for the three years to
2005/06 (see box on page 350). In addition, it
announced a substantial increase in investment to
place the NHS on a sustainable long-term
financial footing and ensure that resources are
available for reform (see chapter 13). The Budget
provided for spending on the NHS in the UK to
grow by 7.4 per cent a year on average in real
terms over the five years to 2007/08.
Local authorities in the UK are estimated to have
spent nearly £99 billion in 2001/02, around
a quarter of public expenditure. The main
categories of expenditure are education, law and
order, personal social services, housing and other
environmental services, and transport.

are two central funds supporting innovative public
investment projects:
■ the Capital Modernisation Fund, which is
aimed at improving delivery of public
services, with funds allocated to departments
on a competitive basis. Some £3.9 billion has
been allocated to 116 projects, such as the
new NHS walk-in centres and IT Learning
Centres in major city areas; and
the Invest to Save Budget, which provides
venture capital for the public sector - over
£300 million has been allocated to 335
partnership projects across central
government and the wider public and
voluntary sectors.
Public expenditure is planned and controlled
on a departmental basis, except where devolved
responsibility lies with the Scottish Parliament, the
National Assembly for Wales and the Northern
Ireland Assembly. The Scottish Parliament has
limited financial authority to vary tax revenue in
Scotland (see chapter 4). In 2000/01 the estimated
outturn for the current and capital budgets of the
devolved administrations totalled £14.7 billion in
Scotland, £7.6 billion in Wales and £5.4 billion in
Northern Ireland. See Table 23.4 for expenditure
by country when other expenditure has been
allocated.
Net public investment in the UK rose substantially
in 2001/02 to £8.8 billion (see Table 23.1). There
The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) was
set up as an independent office of HM Treasury in
April 2000 to modernise procurement in central
civil government and to deliver substantial
improvements in value for money. Its primary
target is to work with central civil government to
deliver £1 billion of value-for-money gains from
commercial activities by the end of 2002/03. More
than a third of this target was achieved in 2001/02
(the first year of operation), with £433 million of
gains reported. OGC is engaged in a number of
activities to modernise and promote best
procurement practice, based on a collaborative
approach with departments. These include

Spending Review 2002
In July 2002 the Government published its 2002
Spending Review, setting spending plans and targets
for the period 2003/04 to 2005/06. Total DEL
spending is set to rise by an average of 574 per cent a
year in real terms in this period, so that by 2005/06
DELs will be £61 billion higher than in 2002/03 (see
Tables 23.3 and 23.5). Public sector net investment is
planned to rise to £24 billion by 2005/06,
representing 2 per cent of GDP.
The 2002 Spending Review focused on the priority
areas of raising productivity, extending opportunity,
establishing stronger and more secure communities,
and Britain's position in the world. Three-quarters of
the additional spending in 2005/06 will go to the
Government's key priorities of education, health,
transport, housing and tackling crime. Additional
resources allocated include:
■ in education an increase in spending in the UK of
£14.7 billion a year by 2005/06 compared with
2002/03, raising education's share of GDP to
5.6 per cent by 2002/03, compared with 5.1 per
cent in 2002/03;
■ a substantial increase in spending on health, to
£109 billion by 2007/08, or 9.4 per cent of GDP
(compared with 7.7 per cent in 2002/03);
■ expected growth in UK transport spending of
8.4 per cent a year in real terms over the period
departments’ own good practice; ensuring the
success of large, novel and/or complex projects;
and working with suppliers to achieve value for
money.
Examination of public expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried out
by select committees of the House of Commons.
The committees study in detail the activities of
particular government departments and question
ministers and officials. The Public Accounts
Committee considers the accounts of government
departments, executive agencies and other public
sector bodies, and examines reports by the
Comptroller and Auditor General on departments
and their use of resources.
Audit of the Government’s spending is exercised
through the functions of the Comptroller and
Auditor General, the head of the National Audit
Office. The NAO’s responsibilities include
to 2005/06, in line with the ten-year plan for
transport (see chapter 21), to improve rail travel
and tackle road congestion;
■ an extra £1.3 billion a year for housing investment
by 2005/06 compared with 2002/03;
■ crime, where, for example, spending on police in
England will be around £1.5 billion a year higher
by 2005/06 than in 2002/03;
■ defence, which will grow by 1.2 per cent a year in
real terms over the three years to 2005/06; and
■ international aid, which will account for 0.40 per
cent of gross national income by 2005/06,
compared with the level of 0.32 per cent in
2002/03.
New Public Service Agreements, for 2003 to 2006,
were published as part of the Government's spending
plans. They contain about 130 'headline' performance
targets. Targets have been set for each department,
with independent audit and inspection arrangements
to monitor progress. Public service providers will have
flexibility and discretion to innovate, respond to local
conditions and meet differing consumer demands
within this framework of targets and accountability
arrangements. The Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and
HM Treasury are working with departments to support
them in producing delivery plans for all their targets
by October 2002.
certifying the accounts of all government
departments and executive agencies, and those of
many other bodies receiving public funds. It
reports to Parliament on the results of its
investigations of the financial operations of these
organisations and of the economy, efficiency and
effectiveness with which public resources have
been used.
Public-private partnerships
The Government sees public-private partnerships
(PPPs) as a key factor in the delivery of high-
quality public services, by bringing in private
sector management, finance and ownership with
the intention of improving the value for money,
efficiency and quality of these services. The PPPs
cover a variety of arrangements, including joint
ventures; outsourcing; the sale of equity stakes in
government-owned businesses; and the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI), in which the public sector
specifies the service needed, in terms of the

outputs required, and private sector companies
compete to meet the requirements. Over 500 PFI
projects, with a combined capital value of over
£22 billion, were signed between mid-1997 and
mid-2002 in a variety of areas, including schools,
colleges, hospitals, local authorities, defence IT
and property management. Major PPP projects
include the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (see page
320) and a scheme for investment in the London
Underground (see page 320). Partnerships UK,
owned jointly by the public and private sectors,
supports public authorities in the development
and implementation of PPP and PFI projects.
Debt management
The Government meets its borrowing needs by
selling debt to the private sector. In 2001/02 UK
public sector net debt was £310.9 billion, 12 per
cent below the peak of £352.9 billion in 1997/98.
As a proportion of GDP, it declined from 41.6
per cent in 1997/98 to 30.4 per cent in 2001/02,
and is the lowest level of any G7 country. ‘Core
debt’, a new measure of net debt excluding
fluctuations in the economic cycle, is now being
published and in 2000/01 was estimated at 31 per
cent of GDP.
The objective of the Government’s debt
management policy is to minimise, over the long
term, the cost of meeting the Government’s
financing needs, taking into account risk while
ensuring that debt management policy is
consistent with the aims of monetary policy.
Operational responsibility for managing
government debt rests with a Treasury agency,
the United Kingdom Debt Management Office
(DMO).
351
Economic affairs
23 Public finance
Gilt-edged stock
The major debt instrument, government bonds, is
known as gilt-edged stock (gilts’), as government
securities are judged by the market as having the
lowest risk of default. Gilts include ‘conventionals’,
which generally pay fixed rates of interest and
redemption sums; and index-linked stocks, on
which both principal and interest payments are
linked to movements in the Retail Prices Index.
Gilt issues are primarily by auction. The annual
Debt and Reserves Management Report sets out
the framework for issuing gilts for the
forthcoming fiscal year. The DMO, on behalf of
the Government, is aiming for gilts sales of
£22.4 billion in 2002/03, compared with gilts sales
of £13.7 billion in 2001/02.
At the end of December 2001 holdings of central
government marketable securities were estimated
at £286.1 billion. This comprised £204.4 billion of
conventional gilts, £70.5 billion of index-linked
gilts and £11.2 billion of Treasury Bills (short¬
term securities issued as part of the DMO’s cash
management operations). Insurance companies
and pension funds hold 61 per cent of gilts, other
UK financial institutions 12 per cent, UK
households 7 per cent and holders in the rest of
the world 18 per cent.
Main sources of revenue
Government revenue is forecast to be £407 billion
in 2002/03. The main sources (see Figure 23.6) are:
■ taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax
(see page 435);
■ taxes on expenditure, which include VAT
(value added tax) and customs and excise
duties;
■ National Insurance contributions (see chapter
12); and
■ taxes on capital, which include inheritance
tax, capital gains tax, council tax and non¬
domestic rates (also known as business rates).
Taxation policy
The primary aim of tax policy is to raise sufficient
revenue for the Government to pay for the
services that its policies require and to service its

companies' rate, and a new 25 per cent tax credit
to boost research and development by large
companies (see page 355);
■ changes to the North Sea oil and gas tax regime
(see page 435), so that companies will pay
a 10 per cent supplementary charge on North
Sea profits and will receive a 100 per cent first-
year allowance for capital expenditure. The

low as possible. The Government has based its tax
policy on the principles of encouraging work,
raising investment, and promoting fairness and
opportunity. It has taken measures designed to
improve productivity, increase employment
opportunities, tackle child and pensioner poverty,
and protect the environment.

Collection of taxes and duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects taxes on
income, profits and capital, and stamp duty (see
Table 23.7). Its National Insurance Contributions
Office is responsible for collecting National
Insurance contributions. HM Customs and Excise
collects around £100 billion a year in taxes and
duties (see Table 23.8), including VAT,
environmental taxes and alcohol, oils, tobacco and
gambling duties. Local authorities collect the main
local taxes, such as council tax.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax
under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system whereby
tax is deducted and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue by the employer, in a way which enables
most employees to pay the correct amount of tax
during the year.
Under the self-assessment system for collecting
personal taxation, around 8.5 million people -
primarily higher-rate taxpayers, the self-employed
and those receiving investment income - are

required to complete an annual tax return for the

their own tax liability, although they can choose to
have the calculations done by the Inland Revenue
if they return the form by the end of September.
The UK has agreements governing double
taxation with over 100 countries. They are
intended to avoid double taxation arising, to deal
with cross-border economic activity, and to
prevent fiscal discrimination against UK business
interests overseas. They also include provisions to
counter tax avoidance and evasion.
Tax Law Rewrite Project
The Tax Law Rewrite Project, established in 1996,
involves rewriting the UK's primary direct tax
legislation so that it is clearer and easier to use, but
without changing its general effect. It also involves
a revision of the PAYE regulations. The first rewritten
item was the Capital Allowances Act 2001, and the
second will be the Income Tax (Earnings and
Pensions) Bill, due to be introduced into Parliament
later in 2002, governing taxation of employment
and of charging provisions for pension and social
security income.
Taxes on income
Income tax
Income tax is the biggest single contributor to
government receipts, bringing in net receipts of
£103 billion in 2001/02. In general, it is charged
on all income originating in the UK - although
some forms of income, such as child benefit, are
exempt - and on all income arising abroad of
people resident in the UK. Income tax is imposed
for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April.
The tax rates and bands for 2001/02 and 2002/03
are shown in Table 23.9. Of around 28.3 million
income taxpayers, 3.0 million are expected to pay
tax only at the starting rate of 10 per cent in
2002/03, 21.7 million at 22 per cent and
2.8 million at 40 per cent, while 0.8 million
taxpayers will pay a marginal rate of 20 per cent
on their savings.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an individual’s
income tax liability. All taxpayers are entitled to
a personal allowance against income from all
sources, with a higher allowance for the elderly
(see Table 23.9). One of the most significant
reliefs, which is designed to encourage people to
save towards their retirement, covers contributions
Tax credits
Currently there are a number of tax credits,
including the Children's Tax Credit (CTC), introduced
in April 2001, which is currently worth up to £529
a year for families with one or more children under
16 living with them; the credit is reduced where the
main earner in the family is a higher rate taxpayer.
In April 2002 a higher rate of CTC, worth up to
£1,049 a year, was introduced for families in the
year of a child's birth, to recognise the extra costs
associated with having a baby. The Working
Families' Tax Credit (WFTC - see chapter 12) is
designed to provide a guaranteed minimum income
for working families.
From April 2003 the Government plans to introduce
a new system with the aim of supporting families,
tackling child poverty and making work pay. Two
new tax credits are planned:
■ the Child Tax Credit, which will integrate all the
existing income-related elements of support for
children currently included in the WFTC, the
Disabled Person's Tax Credit (DPTC) and Income
Support or Jobseeker's Allowance, as well as the
existing CTC; and
■ the Working Tax Credit, which will include the
adult elements of WFTC and DPTC, and extend
in-work support to workers without children or
disabilities.
to pension schemes. Personal tax-free saving is
also encouraged through the Individual Savings
Account (ISA) (see page 460).
Corporation tax
Corporation tax is payable by companies on their
income and capital gains. The UK’s main rate of
corporation tax, 30 per cent, is lower than any
other major industrialised country. Two changes
to the lower rates took effect in April 2002,
reducing the starting rate of 10 per cent to zero
for the smallest companies (so that companies
with annual profits of up to £10,000 will no
longer pay corporation tax) and cutting from
20 per cent to 19 per cent the small companies’
rate levied on firms with annual profits between
£50,000 and £300,000. A sliding scale of relief is
allowed for companies with annual profits
between £10,000 and £50,000 and between
£300,000 and £1.5 million, so that the overall
average rate paid by these firms is up to

expenditure on machinery or plant by small or
medium-sized businesses. Small businesses can
also claim 100 per cent first-year allowances on
investments in information and communications
technology (ICT) between 1 April 2000 and
31 March 2003, so enabling them to write off
immediately the entire cost against their taxable
income. In April 2002 a new research and
development (R&D) tax credit was introduced for
large companies, complementing a similar credit
for small and medium-sized firms. The credit,
payable at a rate of 25 per cent, will provide an
additional £400 million a year support for
investment in new technology by UK industry.
There are also 100 per cent allowances for
investments in qualifying environmental
technologies (including allowances that are part of
the climate change levy package - see page 434)
and a 150 per cent tax credit for expenditure on
restoring contaminated land.
Taxes on capital
Capital gains tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by individuals
and trusts on gains realised from the disposal of
assets. It is payable on the amount by which total
chargeable gains for a year exceed the exempt
amount (£7,700 for individuals and £3,850 for
most trusts in 2002/03). Gains on some types of
asset are exempt from CGT, including the
principal private residence, government securities,
certain corporate bonds, and gains on holdings of
Personal Equity Plans and Individual Savings
Accounts (see page 460). For individuals, CGT in
2002/03 will be payable at 10 per cent, 20 per cent
or 40 per cent, depending on a person’s marginal
income tax rate.
A consultation document containing further
government proposals to reform and modernise
the corporation tax regime was published in
August 2002. The views of business and other
interested parties are being sought on three areas:
the tax treatment of capital assets not covered by
earlier changes; rationalisation of the way in
which various types of income are taxed; and
differences in the tax treatment of trading and
investment companies.
Some capital expenditure - on machinery and
plant, industrial buildings, agricultural buildings
and scientific research, for example - may qualify
for relief in the form of capital allowances. There
is a 40 per cent first-year allowance for
CGT taper relief, introduced in 1998, reduces the
amount of the chargeable gain depending on how
long an asset has been held, with a higher rate of
relief for business assets than for non-business
assets. Subsequent changes to taper relief,
particularly on business assets, have been
introduced with the intention of encouraging
investment and promoting enterprise. The current
CGT taper reliefs reduce the percentage of the
gain that is chargeable for a business asset from
100 per cent for assets held for less than one year
to 25 per cent for assets held for two years or
more. For non-business assets the chargeable gain
falls from 100 per cent for assets held for less than
three years to 60 per cent for assets held for ten
years or longer.

Inheritance tax
Inheritance tax is charged on estates at the time of
death and on gifts made within seven years of
death; most other lifetime transfers are not taxed.
There are several important exemptions, including
transfers between spouses, and gifts and bequests
to UK charities, major political parties and
heritage bodies. In general, business assets and
farmland are exempt from inheritance tax, so that
most family businesses can be passed on without
a tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40 per cent above
a threshold (£250,000 in 2002/03). Only about
4 per cent of estates each year become liable for
an inheritance tax bill.
Taxes on expenditure
Value added tax (VAT)
VAT, which contributes about 58 per cent of
Customs and Excise receipts, is a tax on consumer
expenditure, which is collected at each stage in the
production and distribution of goods and
services. The final tax is payable by the consumer.
The standard rate is 17.5 per cent, with a reduced
rate of 5 per cent on a number of goods and
services, including domestic fuel and power,
children’s car seats, women’s sanitary products and
the installation of energy-saving materials in homes.
Certain goods and services are relieved from VAT,
either by being charged at a zero rate or by being
exempt:
■ Under zero rating, a taxable person does not
charge tax to a customer but reclaims any
VAT paid to suppliers. Among the main
categories where zero rating applies are goods
exported to other EU countries; some foods;
water and sewerage for non-business use;
domestic and international passenger
transport; books, newspapers and periodicals;
construction of new residential buildings;
young children’s clothing and footwear; drugs
and medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people; and
certain supplies by or to charities.
■ For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any VAT but is not
entitled to reclaim the VAT on goods and
services bought for his or her business. The
main categories where exemption applies are
many supplies of land and buildings;
financial services; postal services; betting and
gaming (where there are some exemptions);
lotteries; much education and training; and
health and welfare.
Recent Budgets have contained measures designed
to help new and small businesses, allowing them
to manage their entry into the VAT system, reduce
their VAT administrative burden and improve
their cash flow. The annual level of turnover above
which traders must register for VAT was raised to
£55,000 in the April 2002 Budget. Under a new
optional scheme, small businesses with an annual
turnover of up to £100,000 do not now have to
account for VAT on each purchase and sale, but
instead are able to calculate their net VAT liability
by applying a flat rate percentage to their total
annual turnover. This will be extended in April
2003 to businesses with an annual turnover of up
to £150,000.
Excise duties
Vehicle excise duty: since March 2001 VED for new
cars has been determined according to the carbon
dioxide emissions of the vehicle and the type of
fuel used. Initially there were four VED bands, but
in the 2002 Budget a fifth band was introduced,
with a further discount for the most efficient
vehicles. The annual VED rate for cars registered
after March 2001 now ranges from £70 to £155 for
cars using petrol, and £80 to £160 for those using
diesel, and for cars using cleaner fuels the overall
duty varies from £60 to £150. For cars registered
before 1 March 2001 VED is determined
according to engine size. The standard rate is
£160, with a lower rate of £105 for cars up to
1,549 cc. Under the new system of VED for goods
vehicles, which came into operation in December
2001, seven broad rate bands replaced around 100
different rates. This is intended to better reflect the
environmental and road damage caused by goods
vehicles. The annual standard rate ranges from
£165 to £1,850 (£160 to £1,350 for lorries with
reduced pollution certificates). Duty on buses
varies according to seating capacity.
Insurance premium tax: this is levied at 5 per cent
on most general insurance, with a higher rate of
17.5 per cent on travel insurance and on insurance
sold by suppliers of cars and domestic appliances.
Air passenger duty: for flights to UK and to
European Economic Area (EEA) destinations, the
duty is £5 for the lowest class and £10 for any
other class; the equivalent rates to non-EEA
356
Economic affairs
23 Public finance
The main announcements in the April 2002 Budget
on excise duties included:
■ an increase on tobacco duty, in line with inflation;
■ no change in the duty on the main road fuels
and on road fuel gases, although a new lower
rate for biodiesel was introduced;
■ no change in the main vehicle excise duty (VED)
rates (see page 356), but with some changes,
including a new low-carbon VED rate for cars
with the lowest emissions and reforms to VED
for motorcycles and vans to reflect
environmental benefits;
■ no change on the duty on spirits, for the fifth
Budget in succession;
■ a cut in beer duty for small brewers from June
2002, with a 50 per cent cut for those producing
up to 500,000 litres a year and lower rates of
duty worth more than £120,000 for breweries
producing up to 3 million litres a year; and
■ confirmation of the abolition of the pool betting
duty (on football pools) and its replacement by a
15 per cent tax on pools promoters' gross profits
(stakes less winnings). The Government
announced its intention to consider abolition of
the tax on bingo stakes and its replacement by a
gross profits tax on bingo companies; a
consultation document on bingo duty was
published in August 2002.
destinations are £20 and £40 respectively. All
flights from airports in the Scottish Highlands and
Islands are exempt from duty in recognition of
their remoteness and dependence on air travel.
From 1 November 2002 the lower rates of duty
applying to EEA destinations will be extended to
all countries applying to join the EU (see page 61)
and to Switzerland.
Betting, gaming and lottery duties: these are
charged on off-course betting, pool betting,
gaming in casinos, bingo and amusement
machines. Rates vary with the particular form of
gambling. In October 2001 a 15 per cent tax on
bookmakers’ gross profits replaced general betting
duty of 6.75 per cent on total stakes. On the
National Lottery (see page 263) there is a 12 per
cent duty on gross stakes, but no tax on winnings.
Landfill tax: this is levied at £13 a tonne, with a
lower rate of £2 a tonne for inert waste.
Aggregates levy: introduced in April 2002, this is
applied at £1.60 a tonne on the extraction of sand,
gravel and rock for use as aggregate.
Climate change levy: since April 2001 this has been
levied on the non-domestic use of energy at the
rate of 0.43p per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for
electricity, 0.15p per kWh for gas, 0.96p per
kilogramme (kg) for liquefied petroleum gas and
1.17p per kg for solid fuels. All revenues are
recycled back to business through a reduction in
employers’ National Insurance contributions and
additional support for energy efficiency measures
(see page 445). An 80 per cent discount is available
to energy-intensive business sectors that have
agreed targets with the Government for increasing
energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
Stamp duty
Some transfers are subject to stamp duty.
Transfers of shares generally attract duty at 0.5 per
cent of the cost, while certain types of document,
such as declarations of trust, generally attract a
small fixed duty of £5. Transfers by gift and
transfers to charities are exempt. Duty on land
and property is payable at 1 per cent of the total
price when above £60,000, 3 per cent above
£250,000 and 4 per cent over £500,000. Property
transfers of up to £150,000 in the UK’s most
disadvantaged areas are exempt from stamp duty,
and stamp duty is to be abolished for all non-
residential transfers in these areas, subject to EU
state aid approval. The system of stamp duty on
land and buildings is to be reformed, and the
Government issued a consultative document in
April 2002.
Local authority taxation
Domestic property in Great Britain is generally
subject to the council tax, one of the main sources
of income for local authorities (see page 53). Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value (the amount it
might have sold for on the open market) in April
1991. Discounts are available for dwellings with
fewer than two resident adults, and those on low
incomes may receive council tax benefit of up to
100 per cent of the tax bill (see page 154). In
2002/03, in England the average council tax for a
Band D dwelling (occupied by two adults) is £976
(compared with £901 in 2001/02): £895 in

Non-domestic rates (also known as business rates)
are a tax on the occupiers of non-domestic
property. The rateable value is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every five
years. Separate non-domestic rates are set for
England, Wales and Scotland, and collected by
local authorities. They are paid into separate
national pools and redistributed to local
authorities in proportion to their population.
In Northern Ireland, rates - local taxes on
domestic and non-domestic properties - are based
on the value of the property. For 2002/03 the
average domestic rates bill in Northern Ireland
will be £499.

Trade has been of vital importance to the British
economy for hundreds of years. Although it has
under 1 per cent of the world’s population, the UK
was the fourth largest trading nation in 2001,
accounting for 5.1 per cent of world trade in
goods and services. In 2001, 53 per cent of the
UK’s export trade in goods and services and 52 per
cent of its import trade was with fellow members
of the European Union, the world’s largest
established trading group. The UK exports more
per head than either the United States or Japan. Its
sales abroad of goods and services were 27 per
cent of gross domestic product at market prices in
2001. Investment income and receipts from trade
in services (such as financial services, business
services, travel, transport and communications)
accounted for 51 per cent of total UK current
account credits and for 44 per cent of equivalent
debits. The UK consistently runs large surpluses
on these accounts.

the world, and how that flow is funded. Economic
transactions include:
■ exports and imports of goods, such as oil,
agricultural products, machinery and
consumer goods;
■ exports and imports of services, such as
international transport, travel, financial and
business services;
■ income flows, such as dividends and interest
earned by non-residents on investments in
the UK and by UK residents investing abroad;
■ financial flows, such as investment in shares,
debt securities, loans and deposits; and
■ transfers, such as payments to, and receipts
from, EU institutions, foreign aid and funds
brought by migrants to the UK.
The balance of payments is made up of the
following accounts:
■ the current account, which comprises trade in
goods and services (Table 24.2), income
(investment income and compensation of
employees - for example, locally engaged staff
in UK embassies and military bases abroad)
and current transfers (such as food aid)
(Table 24.8);
■ the capital account, which comprises capital
transfers and the acquisition and disposal of
non-produced, non-financial assets (such as
copyrights);
Balance of payments
The balance of payments (see Table 24.1) is an
account of all the economic transactions between
the UK and the rest of the world. It records inward
and outward transactions, the overall net flow of
transactions between UK residents and the rest of
the financial account, which covers the flow of
direct, portfolio and other investment and
reserve assets (Table 24.9); and
the international investment position, which
measures the UK’s stock of external financial
assets and liabilities (Table 24.10).

Table 24.1 summarises the UK’s balance of
payments position over recent years. In 2001 the
current account was in deficit by £20.5 billion,
compared with a £19.2 billion deficit in 2000. A
sharp widening in the deficit on goods and
services was largely offset by a reduced deficit in
current transfers. The capital account surplus fell
from a record £1.8 billion in 2000 to £1.5 billion
in 2001.
Trade in goods and services
Table 24.2 summarises the UK’s trade in goods
and services over recent years. More detailed
analyses for 2001 can be found in subsequent
tables. In 2001, UK exports of goods amounted to
£191.6 billion and imports to £225.2 billion,
giving a deficit on trade in goods of £33.5 billion,
slightly higher than in 2000 and the largest deficit
on record. The surplus on trade in services in
2001 (£11.1 billion) compares with a £11.8 billion
surplus recorded in the previous year. Figure 24.3
shows the position over the past 30 years.
Commodity composition of goods
UK exports of goods are dominated by
manufactures - finished manufactures and semi¬
manufactured goods — which in 2001 accounted
for the same proportion (84 per cent) of exports
as they did in 1971. Oil exports, which had risen
as a proportion of total exports from 4 per cent in
1971 to 21 per cent in 1984, have subsequently
declined to 8 per cent (see Table 24.4).

Figure 24.3 UK balance of payments
in goods and services
£ billion
Historically the UK was predominantly an importer
of foods and basic materials. Over the last 30 years,
however, imports of manufactures have grown
rapidly. Between 1971 and 2001 the share of
finished manufactures in total imports rose from
27 per cent to 60 per cent. The UK has not had a
surplus on manufactured goods since 1982. Basic
materials fell from 12 per cent of total imports in
1971 to 3 per cent in 2001. Food, beverages and
tobacco accounted for 22 per cent of imports in
1971 compared with only 8 per cent in 2001.
Machinery and transport equipment accounted
for 46 per cent of exports and 44 per cent of
imports in 2001. Aerospace, chemicals and
electronics have become increasingly significant
export sectors, while textiles have declined in
relative importance. Sectors with a significant
positive balance of trade in 2001 included fuels,
chemicals and mechanical machinery, while those
with a relatively large negative balance included
food, crude materials, road vehicles and clothing.
Geographical breakdown of goods
Most of the UK’s trade in goods is with other
developed countries (see Table 24.5). In 2001, 85
per cent of UK exports were to other member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co¬
operation and Development (OECD), and 81 per
cent of imports came from the same countries. The
proportion of goods export trade with the
European Union was 58 per cent, while goods
imports from the EU accounted for 52 per cent of
the total.
EU countries accounted for eight of the UK’s top
ten export markets in 2001 and for seven of the
top ten leading suppliers of goods to the UK (see
Table 24.6). The United States remained the UK’s
largest single destination and was also its largest
single supplier. Two of the biggest percentage
increases in 2001 were in exports to the Irish
Republic (which rose by over 12 per cent) and
imports from China (over 20 per cent).
Trade in services
Trade in services covers the provision of services
between UK residents and non-residents, and
transactions in goods which are not freighted out
of the country in which they take place - for
example, purchases for local use by foreign forces
in the UK and by UK forces abroad and purchases
by tourists. There has been a surplus recorded for
trade in services every year since 1966, although in
2001 this was £0.8 billion lower than the record
level achieved in 2000. Exports fell slightly by 0.5
per cent to £76.8 billion in 2001, with imports
rising slightly by 0.6 per cent to £65.7 billion (see
Table 24.2). There were strong surpluses in
business and financial services, while travel and
transport contributed the largest deficits (see
Table 24.7).
Income and transfers
Earnings on UK investment abroad rose by 3.4 per
cent to £138.8 billion in 2001, while debits
(earnings of foreign-owned assets in the UK) also
increased, by 3.8 per cent, to £129.8 billion, giving
a surplus of £9.0 billion, a slight fall from 2000
(see Table 24.8). The surplus on direct investment
income of £15.8 billion, down a little from the
£17.5 billion surplus in 2000, was partly offset by a
£7.0 billion deficit on other investment income
(including earnings on reserve assets). The deficit
on current transfers fell from £10.0 billion in 2000
to £7.2 billion in 2001 (see Table 24.1).
Inward and outward investment
The UK has an open economy, with no
restrictions on the outward flow of capital.
Outward investment helps develop markets for
UK exports while providing earnings in the form
of investment income (see above). Inward
investment is promoted by Invest UK (see page
369). This inward investment is seen as a means of

improving UK productivity through the
introduction of new technology, knowledge,
products and management styles into the UK.
Table 24.9 shows that in 2001 there was a net
inflow of UK investment of £19.3 billion. Direct
investment abroad was £23.7 billion, compared
with a record £168.6 billion in 2000, a year of
exceptional merger and acquisition activity (see
also Table 22.6). Direct investment in the UK was
£43.8 billion in 2001, compared with £79.1 billion
in the previous year. This fall was primarily in
equity capital transactions, reflecting lower merger
and acquisition activity taking place in the year.
In 2001 direct investment in the UK exceeded UK
direct investment abroad for the first time since
1990.
The UK’s stock of external liabilities exceeded its
assets by £40 billion at the end of 2001 (see Table
24.10). Direct investment abroad stood at £645
billion, 5.8 per cent higher than a year earlier,
while direct investment in the UK was £347
billion, a 13.3 per cent increase - giving a net
balance of £298 billion.
International direct investment
According to the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) World
Investment Report 2001, the UK was the world’s
largest outward direct investor in 2000 and was
ranked third at attracting inward investment (see
Table 24.11). It accounted for 21 per cent of all
inward investment into the EU in 2000 and 32 per
cent of its outward investment (inclusive of intra-
EU flows). There are over 20,000 foreign investors
in the UK, including 5,500 from the United States.

Recent inward investment announcements have
included:
■ Guardian Industries, one of the world’s
largest glass makers from the US, which is to
build a new factory in Goole, Yorkshire,
creating more than 300 jobs;
■ Arius 3D Inc, the Canadian 3D scanning
specialist, which is to set up a 3D digital
imaging centre in Dundee, creating 250 jobs;
and
■ Ryobi Aluminium Costing (UK) of Japan,
which is expanding its plant in Carrickfergus,
Northern Ireland, creating 76 new jobs.
International trade policy
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
pursues the UK’s interest in international trade
policy, working closely with EU partners and
drawing on the UK’s bilateral relations and
membership of international organisations such as
the World Trade Organisation. The Common
Commercial Policy co-ordinates the external trade
of all EU Member States. In consultation with
other departments, together with a wide range of
business, consumer and other civil society
interests, the DTI seeks to:
■ create a framework for free and fair trade;
■ minimise barriers to the free movement of
goods, services and international investment
across the world;
365
Economic affairs
24 International trade and investment
■ promote open, dynamic and sustainable
markets; and
■ ensure coherence between commercial,
financial, environmental and social policies.
European Union
The free movement of goods, people, services and
capital is a fundamental principle of the EU, and
the basis of the Single European Market. In the
Government’s view, benefits of the Single Market
include;
■ a wider market for UK goods, comprising
nearly 380 million consumers, and making
up around 40 per cent of world trade;
■ lower prices, brought about by greater
competition and liberalisation;
■ better consumer protection;
■ the sale of goods throughout the EU without
expensh e re-testing in every country, as a
result of the harmonisation and mutual
recognition of standards;
■ a significant reduction in export bureaucracy
- in effect the Single Market is a domestic
market for European business; and
■ the right of ETC citizens to work, study or
retire in all other Member States - around
750,000 Britons live in other EU countries.
The European Commission set out its Internal
Market Strategy in 1999 and conducts an annual
review. The 2002 review, endorsed by the Internal
Market, Consumer and Tourism Council, focuses
on those target actions which have the most
significant contribution to make, and largely
reflects UK views on priorities for action to
improve the operation of the Single Market. These
include completion of work by the end of 2002 on
Community' Patents and on public procurement.
In the longer term, the UK is helping to take
forward work on other key elements in the
Strategy, such as on services and plans to simplify
the regulatory environment.
More than 92 per cent of Single Market Directives
have now been implemented in all Member States.
At the Stockholm European Council in March
2001, EU Heads of Government agreed that no
more than 1.5 per cent of directives should be
overdue in anv Member State by the time of the
Barcelona European Council in March 2002.
Heads of Government decided in Barcelona that
this 1.5 per cent target should be retained, and
agreed in addition that all directives whose
implementation was more than two years overdue
should be addressed by the Thessalonika
European Council in spring 2003.
The framework for ensuring the even and effective
enforcement of Single Market rules involves
encouraging co-operation between national
administrations, setting up contact points for
businesses and citizens, and improving the
efficiencv of the Commission's complaints
procedure. In the UK, the DTI s Action Single
Market f intw.dfi.gov. uk/europe/asm) is a contact
point for UK business and citizens and a first port
of call for similar units in other Member States
when Single Market problems arise. Initiatives for
simplifving national and Community rules
include SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal
Market) and the European Business Test Panel,
which allows for consultation of business during
the drafting stage of new legislation.
World Trade Organisation (WTO)
The WTO {www.wto.org) aims to promote an open
and liberal trading system, where barriers to free
trade - such as high import duties or subsidies -
are minimised. It was established in 1995 (when it
replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade) and currently has a membership of 144
countries, with 28 negotiating to join. At the fourth
Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, in
November 2001, members agreed to accept China
and Taiwan into the WTO. The Ministerial
Declaration, the Doha Development Agenda, adds
new negotiations on industrial goods, the
environment, subsidies and anti-dumping to
existing ones on agriculture and services. More
negotiations are envisaged after two years’ study on
imestment, competition, transparency in
government procurement and trade facilitation. A
fifth Ministerial Conference will be held in Cancun,
Mexico, in September 2003.
The DTI monitors actions by other countries
which represent obstacles to UK expxuts and
wherever possible seeks to resolve problems
bilaterallv in conjunction with EU p»artners.
Where efforts to resobe problems by negotiation
fail, the initiation of a WTO dispute settlement
action, again through the EU, may be necessary.

US restrictions on imported steel
The United States announced on 5 March 2002 that
it would impose a range of tariff measures severely
restriaing imports of steel products from the rest of
the world, to take effect on 20 March. EU trade
commissioners requested immediate WTO dispute
settlement action, the first step of which was a 60-
day consultation period with the US. That
consultation period did not produce a resolution of
the issues and a WTO disputes panel has now been
set up. Brazil, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand,
Norway and Switzerland have all joined the panel
hearing complaints against the US. The EU has also
taken safeguard action to protect the domestic steel
market from injury that would be caused by a surge
of imports into the EU, diverted from the US market.
Developing countries
The DTI works closely with the Department for
International Development (DFID) and other
government departments to ensure that developing
countries participate in, and benefit from, the
world trade system. An inter-departmental
Working Group on Trade and Development,
chaired by the DTI, meets regularly to ensure
consistency of approach.
The EU and the 76 African, Caribbean and Pacific
(AGP) countries are party to the Cotonou
Partnership Agreement, signed in June 2000 in
Cotonou, Benin. This sets out a framework for
economic and political co-operation, development
aid and trade, and gives the ACP countries tariff-
free access, subject to certain safeguards, to the EU
for almost all industrial and agricultural products.
After a transitional period of eight years, during
which the ACP countries will continue to enjoy
their current preferential access to the EU, new
WTO-compatible arrangements will be put in
place. Negotiations on these new trading
arrangements were due to start in September 2002.
The EU also operates a Generalised System of
Preferences (GSP), available to nearly all
developing countries and applying to industrial
products, including textiles and certain (mainly
processed) agricultural products. The EU Member
States negotiated a new, more generous, GSP
scheme which took effect on 1 January’ 2002.
Other recent developments have included:
■ a proposal by the European Commission,
agreed by the General Affairs Council in
February 2001, to open up immediately duty-
and quota-free access for all exports from
Least Developed Countries, except arms.
Only three products - sugar, rice and bananas
- are treated differently, with full duty-free
access being phased in gradually in the period
up to 2009; and
■ working within the Commonwealth to build
a stronger system of world trade which works
for the benefit of countries at all stages of
development.
Special trading arrangements
The multilateral trading system provides the
foundation for the EU’s common commercial
policy. However, the EU has preferential trading
arrangements with a number of groups of
countries, including:
■ those in Central and Eastern Europe
preparing for possible EU membership (see
page 61);
■ virtually all non-EU member countries with
Mediterranean coastlines (see page 65); and
■ former dependent territories (ACP countries
- see above).
New trade relationships with countries and
regions of Latin America and the Gulf
Cooperation Council are being pursued. A free
trade agreement with Mexico came into force in
July 2000, an Association Agreement
encompassing free trade with Chile was initialled
in June 2002 and negotiations for a new
agreement with Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay) are continuing.
Partnership and co-operation (non-preferential)
agreements have been concluded with ten states of
the former Soviet Union. Non-preferential co¬
operation agreements have also been made with
countries in South Asia, the Andean Community,
the Central American States, as well as the People’s
Republic of China and the .Association of South
East Asian Nations.
Controls on trade
Import controls
Following the completion of the Single European
Market, all national quantitative restrictions were
abolished. However, the EU does restrict imports
367
Economic affairs
24 International trade and investment
of textiles and clothing, steel, footwear and
ceramics from certain countries under EU import
regimes using licensing controls; these are also
used to monitor imports and deter quota fraud.
Imports into the UK may also be subject to
prohibition or restriction, either as a result of UN
resolutions (for example, imports of rough
diamonds from Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone)
or for reasons of national security. These include
firearms and ammunition, nuclear materials,
landmines and chemical weapons.
The DTTs Import Licensing Branch (ILB) has
responsibility for issuing import licences for goods
that DTI controls in accordance with UK and EC
law. Its principal customers are UK and other EC
importers dealing in goods that are controlled. In
2001/02 ILB issued over 343,000 licences.
Other products may be prohibited or restricted to
protect human, animal or plant life or health.
Examples include certain drugs, explosives,
endangered wildlife and derived products (under
the CITES Convention, see page 274),
pornographic material, counterfeit and pirated
goods and certain agricultural, horticultural and
food products. These are controlled and enforced
by other government departments such as the
Department for Environment, Food & Rural
Affairs, and HM Customs and Excise.
Export controls
Strategic export controls apply to a range of
goods, components, spare parts and technologies
and include the following:
■ military equipment, such as arms,
ammunition, bombs, tanks, imaging devices,
military aircraft and warships;
■ nuclear-related items, including nuclear
materials, reactors and processing plant;
■ dual-use goods - goods designed for civil use
but which can be used for military purposes -
such as certain materials, machine tools,
electronic equipment, computers,
telecommunications equipment, cryptographic
goods, sensors and radar, navigation and
avionics equipment, marine equipment and
space and propulsion equipment;
■ chemical weapons precursors, and related
equipment and technology;
■ certain micro-organisms, biological
equipment and technology; and
■ goods used in programmes involved in
weapons of mass destruction and missiles
used for their delivery.
Other export controls cover animals and plants
(under CITES); cultural goods such as works of
art or antiques; and drug precursors.
Licences to export goods subject to strategic
export control are issued by the DTI acting
through its Export Control Organisation (ECO).
The ECO also issues licences for the export or
supply of goods and certain services that are
controlled following the imposition of trade
sanctions by the United Nations or the EU.
The Export Control Act 2002 represents the
outcome of a wide-ranging review of the existing
framework governing export controls. The Act
provides:
■ new powers to introduce controls on
trafficking and brokering in arms and on the
transfer of sensitive technology by intangible
means - such as by e-mail or fax; and
■ increased transparency and accountability in
the arms export control regime, by setting
clear limits for the first time on the
Government’s power to impose export
controls, and by providing for parliamentary
scrutiny of new controls introduced under
the Act.

Latest figures on inward investment decisions
notified to Invest UK and new jobs expected to be
created are shown in Table 24.12. In 2001/02
around a third of these investment projects were
from companies with an existing presence in the
UK. The largest single investor country was the
United States, with 38 per cent of projects,
followed by Japan (8 per cent) and Canada (7 per
cent). The UK is particularly successful at
attracting investment in industries linked to the
knowledge-driven economy - computer software,
Internet, telecommunications, electronics and
e-business sectors. These form the largest category
of foreign direct investment, with some 239

Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD)
ECGD {www.ecgd.gov.uk), the UK’s official export
credit agency, provides facilities, which are broadly
complementary to those available from the private
sector. Its principal roles are threefold: to provide
support for capital goods and project exports sold
on medium and long-term credit; to provide
reinsurance for UK exports sold on short terms of
payment; and to provide insurance for UK
companies investing overseas. ECGD’s purpose is
to benefit the UK economy by helping exporters
of UK goods and services win business and UK
firms to invest overseas by providing guarantees,
insurance and reinsurance against loss, taking into
account the Government’s international policies.
ECGD is a government department and is
responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry.
Including overseas investment insurance and
reinsurance, the total amount of business
supported by ECGD in 2001/02 was £3,298
million. Table 24.13 shows the top ten markets,
representing 72 per cent of business in the year.

The UK has been at the forefront of many world-
class advances in science, engineering and
technology. Notable areas of UK achievement
include biotechnology, biomedicine, materials,
chemicals, electronics and aerospace.
Research and development
expenditure
Gross domestic expenditure in the UK on research
and development (R&D) in 2000 was £17.5
billion, 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Of this, £15 billion was on civil R&D, with
the rest going to defence projects. In real terms,
gross domestic expenditure on R&D increased by
2 per cent between 1999 and 2000.
Business enterprise is the largest source of
funding, providing 49 per cent of expenditure in
2000 (see Figure 25.1). Other contributions were
made by private endowments, trusts and charities.
As well as financing R&D carried out within
business enterprise itself, business enterprise
supports university research and finances contract
research at government establishments. Some
charities have their own laboratories and offer
grants for outside research. Contract research
organisations carry out R&D for companies and
are playing an increasingly important role in the
transfer of technology to British industry.
Total spending on R&D within business enterprise
amounted to £11.5 billion in 2000. Business
enterprise own funds accounted for 63 per cent,
with 9 per cent coming from government and
most of the remaining 28 per cent from overseas.
Expenditure on R&D within the pharmaceuticals
product group accounted for 25 per cent of all
spending. Aerospace and the radio, television and

Some notable British achievements during the
last 50 years
■ In 1953 Francis Crick, together with James Watson
of the United States, worked out the structure of
DNA using the experimental results of Maurice
Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.
■ In 1955 the first atomic clock was built at the
National Physical Laboratory in Teddington.
■ Sir Bernard Lovell pioneered the science of radio
astronomy in the 1950s, and in 1957 Jodrell Bank,
the world's first giant radio telescope, opened.
■ Interferons - proteins produced in the body to
fight infections - were first isolated and named by
Alick Isaacs and colleagues in 1957.
■ The work of Sir Peter Medawar in the 1950s on
acquired immunological tolerance made possible
the first successful kidney transplants.
■ Artificial hip joints were developed and first fitted
by Sir John Charnley at Wrightington Flospital,
Lancashire, in 1960.
■ In 1962 the first beta-blocker successful in
treating angina was introduced, having been
synthesised by Sir James Black at ICI.
■ Dorothy FJodgkin won the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry in 1964 for her work on the structure of
penicillin and vitamin B12.
■ A new form of telephone message transmission,
based on optical fibres, was invented in the UK in
1964.
■ In the late 1960s the science of radio-astrophysics
was pioneered by Sir Martin Ryle and Antony
Hewish. In 1967 their co-worker Jocelyn Bell
Burnell discovered pulsars.
■ The work of Brian Josephson in the early 1970s
was later used to develop high-speed computers.
■ The first commercial brain and body scanner
relying on computer-assisted tomography, based
on a technique developed by Sir Godfrey
Hounsfield, was produced in 1972.
■ Much of the work on black holes was carried out
by Stephen Flawking, who in 1974 showed that
they could emit radiation with a thermal spectrum.
■ In 1975 Cesar Milstein produced the first
monoclonal antibodies - proteins with enormous
potential in the diagnosis and treatment of
disease. This discovery transformed biological
research and created biotechnology.
■ The technique of in vitro fertilisation, pioneered by
Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, led to the
birth of the world's first 'test-tube baby' in 1978.
■ In the 1980s Professor Michael Green helped to
develop the 'superstring' theories, which see the
fundamental building blocks of matter and energy
as infinitesimal 'strings' rather than points.
■ Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, working at Leicester
University, developed the technique of DNA
fingerprinting in 1985.
■ In 1985 British Antarctic Survey scientists
discovered the hole in the ozone layer over the
Antarctic. The finding was linked to the growth of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere and
led directly to the Montreal Protocol controlling
the use of CFCs (see page 284).
■ Professor Sir Flarold Kroto of Sussex University
shared the 1996 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with
two US scientists for discovering in 1985 the
fullerene molecule - 60 carbon atoms arranged in
a symmetrical cage.
■ Timothy Berners-Lee did pioneering work in
connection with the Internet - he invented the
web's address system and layout while working at
CERN (see page 387) in 1990.
■ Pioneering work on nuclear transfer at the Roslin
Institute near Edinburgh resulted in the birth of
the world's first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep,
in 1996.
■ Scientists at the Sanger Centre in Cambridgeshire
played a major role in the international Fluman
Genome Project, being responsible for decoding
nearly one-third of the genome in the project's
initial stage, completed in 2000.
■ Sir Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt, together with
a US scientist Lee Hartwell, won the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine in October 2001 for their
work on key regulators of the cell cycle.

Government role
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,
assisted by the Minister for Science, has overall
responsibility for Science, Engineering and
Technology (SET). They are supported by the
Office of Science and Technology (OST), part of
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The
Ministerial Committee on Science Policy provides
the framework for the collective consideration of,
and decisions on, major science policy issues.
The OST, headed by the Government’s Chief
Scientific Adviser, is responsible for policy on SET,
both nationally and internationally, and co¬
ordinates science and technology policy across
government departments. The Chief Scientific
Adviser also reports directly to the Prime Minister.
An independent Council for Science and
Technology advises the Prime Minister on the
strategic policies and framework for science and
technology in the UK. Its members are drawn
from academia, business and charitable
foundations/institutions.
The policy and management of some aspects of
science and technology are reserved to the UK
Government, while in other instances this has
been devolved to the administrations in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ (SEE) is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in establishments
operated by the Research Councils (see pages
379-82). Also included are the national and
international central facilities (such as CERN - see
page 387) supported by the Research Councils and
available for use by British scientists and engineers.
There are also important contributions from private
institutions, chiefly those funded by charities. The
SEE is the main provider of basic research and
much of the strategic research (research likely to
have practical applications) carried out in the UK. It
also collaborates with the private sector in the
conduct of specific applied research.
The OST, through the Director General of
Research Councils, has responsibility for the
Science Budget, and for the government-financed
Research Councils. Through the Research
Councils, the Science Budget supports research by:
■ awarding research grants to universities, other
higher education establishments and some
other research units;
■ funding Research Council establishments to
carry out research or provide facilities;
■ paying subscriptions to international
scientific facilities and organisations; and
■ supporting postgraduate research students
and postdoctoral Fellows.
The Science Budget also funds programmes of
support to the science and engineering base
through the Royal Society (see page 388) and the
Royal Academy of Engineering (see page 388). The
other main sources of funds for universities are
the higher education funding councils (see page
386).
Strategy and finance
The Government’s policies for science,
engineering and technology were set out in the
July 2000 White Paper Excellence and Opportunity
- a science and innovation policy for the 21st
century. The White Paper set out the actions being
taken by the Government to ensure that UK
science remains world class, to open up
opportunities for innovation throughout the
economy and to increase public confidence in
science. High research priorities for 2001/02 to
2003/04 are genomics, e-science and basic
technology. Building on the commitments in the
White Paper, in July 2002 the Government
published Investing in innovation: A strategy for
science, engineering and technology. This sets out
how an additional £1.25 billion investment in
science and technology allocated from the 2002
Spending Review (see page 350) will be used.
The strategy ties together the increases in science,
engineering and technology spending across
schools, universities and the research base. It also
sets out how the Government plans to improve
the way it manages science within Government
itself, and contains its response to the Roberts
Review of the supply of skilled scientists and
engineers (see page 385).
The SEB is chiefly funded through two funding
streams, which together are known as the Dual
373
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
Support Scheme. One stream is provided by the
Education Departments through their higher
education funding councils. The other stream is
provided by the DTI/OST through the Research
Councils, which award programme and project
grants for specific research programmes, both to
universities and to their own institutions.

Planned total government expenditure on SET
(both civil and defence) in 2002/03 is £7.8 billion
(see Figure 25.2). In the 2002 Spending Review the
Government announced that the OST’s Science
Budget would increase by 10 per cent a year
between 2002/03 and 2005/06, from £2.0 billion in
2002/03 to £2.9 billion in 2005/06. This includes
an extra £436 million over the three years to fund
an expansion in science and engineering research
activities. Extra funding is intended to develop the
science research infrastructure, and to enable UK
scientists and engineers to take forward current
world-class research programmes and to move
into newly promising areas.
Additional resources would be available for
knowledge transfer from the SEB, with funding of
£90 million a year by 2005/06 for an enlarged
Higher Education Innovation Fund (see page
375).
programme is co-ordinated by a joint
industry/academic steering group headed by the
Chief Scientific Adviser. Foresight is guiding
government priorities in SET programmes, in
overall policy, regulation, and education and
training.
A review of the programme in 2001
recommended that resources should be
concentrated on fewer areas to allow for deeper
analysis and ensure greater impact. The revised
programme was launched in April 2002, and is
working on three or four projects at a time. The
first two pilot projects are:
■ the Flood and Coastal Defence Project, which
draws together experts to advise on factors
affecting future impacts and the required
response to flooding in the UK. Factors
considered will include land use,
demographic shifts, socio-economic changes
and climate change; and
■ the Cognitive Systems Project, which will
examine recent progress in artificial and
cognitive systems and their related
disciplines, including computer science,
neuroscience, cognitive science and artificial
intelligence. It will also look at likely
developments in these fields over the next
decade, and in particular the rate of progress
in the UK’s capability to build artificial
cognitive systems.
LINK
LINK is the Government’s main mechanism for
promoting partnership in commercial research
between industry and the research base. It focuses
on areas of strategic importance for the future of
the UK economy. Government departments and
Research Councils fund up to 50 per cent of the
cost of research projects, with industry providing
the balance. Since 1988, 74 LINK programmes
have supported 1,500 projects with a total value of
some £760 million and involving some 2,400
companies. Recent programmes include
manufacturing molecules, health technology
devices, and information storage and display.
Foresight programme
The Government’s Foresight programme
{www.foresight.gov.uk) encourages the public and
private sectors to work together to identify
opportunities in markets and technologies likely
to emerge over the next 10 to 20 years. The
Science Research Investment Fund
The Science Research Investment Fund, with
funding of £1 billion for 2002-04, finances new
infrastructure schemes across the spectrum of
science and engineering. Money from the
Government and the Wellcome Trust (see page
374
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
387), is allocated to universities for them to decide
priorities; the universities themselves contribute
25 per cent of investment. Projects include: a new
biomedical sciences research building at Leicester
University; a research institute for medical cell
biology at the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh;
an environmental engineering and bioremediation
centre at Queen’s University Belfast; and a research
institute for molecular medicine at Leeds
University.
University Challenge Fund
The fund is a competitive scheme that has offered
financing to 57 universities to help them in the
early stages of turning research into commercial
products. The first round of the competition in
1999 saw 15 seed funds being set up worth £45
million. The awards from the second round of the
competition in October 2001 allocated a further
£15 million.
Science Enterprise Challenge
Twelve Science Enterprise Centres have been
established with £29 million of government
funding. The centres support the teaching and
practice of entrepreneurship among science
faculties and students, and promote links between
universities and business. Awards worth £15
million were announced in October 2001. This
funding will help establish a new centre and
expand the 12 existing centres.
Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF)
The HEIF is run in partnership by DTI/OST, the
Higher Education Funding Council for England
(HEFCE) and the Department for Education and
Skills (DfES). The aim is to enable higher
education institutions to respond to the needs
of business, through developing capacity in
universities to liaise with business and the
community, and through large collaborative
projects to strengthen university-business
partnerships. In October 2001 awards totalling
£80 million were announced, with 89 bids being
funded. Additional resources are being allocated
to the HEIF under the Spending Review 2002, and
overall resources for knowledge transfer are
planned to rise from £64 million in 2002/03 to
£114 million in 2005/06.
Faraday Partnerships
The Faraday Partnerships scheme
(www.faradaypartnerships.org.uk) is intended to
improve the exploitation of SET in the UK. The
partnerships bring together universities,
independent research organisations, industry
associations and manufacturers, with support
from DTI, the Department for Environment, Food
& Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and some of the
Research Councils. There are 24 partnerships,
including six announced in September 2002.
Space activities
The UK’s civil space programme is brought
together through the British National Space Centre
(BNSC) (www.bnsc.gov.uk), a partnership of
government departments and the Research
Councils. BNSC’s key aims are to develop practical
and economic uses of space, to promote the
competitiveness of British space companies in
world markets, to maintain the UK’s position in
space science, to foster the development of
innovative technology and to improve
understanding of the Earth’s environment and
resources. These are realised primarily by
collaboration with other European nations through
the European Space Agency (ESA). BNSC’s policy
and aims are set out in detail in the publication
Space Strategy 1999-2002: New Frontiers.
Through BNSC, the Government spends around
£180 million a year on space activities. About
three-quarters of this is channelled through ESA
for collaborative programmes on Earth
observation, telecommunications and space
science, much of which returns to the UK through
contracts awarded to British industry. The
remaining quarter of the space budget is spent on
international meteorological programmes carried
out through the European Meteorological Satellite
Organisation (EUMETSAT); developing
experiments (such as the Beagle 2 Mars Lander)
for ESA satellites; and on the national programme,
which is aimed at complementing R&D supported
through ESA. Around half of the British space
programme is concerned with satellite-based
Earth observation (remote sensing) for
commercial and environmental applications.
The UK is also a major contributor to ESA’s latest
Earth observation satellite, ENVISAT, launched in
March 2002. This carries a new generation of radar
and radiometer systems as well as other scientific
environmental instruments, some of which have
been either designed or constructed in Britain. The
first pictures recorded by ENVISAT were beamed
down to scientists at the end of March 2002.
A quarter of the UK’s space budget is devoted to
space science led by the Particle Physics and
375
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
Astronomy Research Council, in support of
astronomy, planetary science and geophysics. The
UK is contributing substantially to the SOHO
mission to study the Sun; to the Cluster mission
launched in 2000 to study solar-terrestrial
relationships; to the Infrared Space Observatory,
which is investigating the birth and death of stars;
and to the Cassini Huygens mission, a seven-year
programme to send a probe to Saturn and its
moon Titan, launched in 1997. It is also
participating in XMM, ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy
mission to investigate X-ray emissions from black
holes.
The UK is also developing the Geostationary
Earth Radiation Budget instrument, which is
intended to provide accurate measurements of the
energy source for the Earth’s climate and, together
with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the High Resolution
Dynamics Limb Sounder, which will provide
measurements of upper atmosphere trace
chemicals and temperature.
Living planet programme
ESA's £400 million Living Planet environmental
research programme, to help scientists understand
and predict the Earth's environment and
humankind's effects upon it, was launched in 1999.
BNSC is contributing £67 million to this
programme. The first project to benefit will be the
British CRY0SAT mission, due to be launched in
2004, which will study the effects of global
warming on the polar ice caps and floating Arctic
sea ice. UK environmental scientists also have a
significant interest in a second mission, which will
measure soil moisture and ocean salinity.
Two new centres of excellence in Earth observation
will use satellites and models to help forecast
environmental change and play a role in exploiting
data from ENVISAT and the Living Planet
programme. The Data Assimilation Research Centre
will forecast changes in the Earth's systems, while
the Centre for Polar Observation Modelling will
measure changes in polar ice which could cause
rising sea levels and changes in ocean circulation.
Industrial and intellectual property
The Government supports innovation through the
promotion of a national and international system
for the establishment of intellectual property
rights. These matters are the responsibility of the
Patent Office, an executive agency of the DTI. The
Office is responsible for the granting of patents,
and registration of designs and trademarks. In
2001 it received over 30,500 applications for
patents and almost 61,000 applications for
trademarks.
The Patent Office encourages worldwide
harmonisation of rules and procedures, and the
modernisation and simplification of intellectual
property law. International patenting
arrangements include the European Patent
Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.
For trademarks the European Community
Trademark System and the Madrid Protocol
provide means of extending rights beyond the
UK’s borders. The Patent Office Central Enquiry
Unit and the website (www.patent.gov.uk) offer
detailed information about intellectual property
rights.
Departmental responsibilities
The DTI publication The Forward Look 2001
Government-funded science, engineering and
technology outlines the policy and expenditure
details for government departments and Research
Councils, learned societies and other bodies in
relation to their SET activities. The activities of
the main government departments involved in
SET are detailed below.
Department of Trade and Industry
In 2002/03 DTI’s planned expenditure on SET is
£429 million: £289 million on R&D and £140
million on technology transfer. Expenditure covers
innovation and technology for a number of
industrial sectors, including aeronautics,
biotechnology, chemicals, communications,
engineering, environmental technology, IT, space
(see page 375), and nuclear and non-nuclear
energy.
Funding for innovation embraces the development,
design and financing of new products, services and
processes, exploitation of new markets, creation of
new businesses and associated changes in
management of people and organisational
practices. Through its Innovation Unit, a mixed
team of business secondees and government
officials, DTI seeks to promote a culture of
innovation in all sectors of the economy.

Technology and knowledge transfer
DTI also aims to increase collaboration and the
flow of knowledge between the SEB and
businesses; improve access to sources of
technology and technological expertise; improve
the capacity of business to use technology
effectively; and increase the uptake of the latest
technology and best practice techniques.
One example of a technology and knowledge
transfer mechanism is TCS (previously known as
the Teaching Company Scheme), which is funded
by DTI, two other government departments, five
Research Councils and the devolved
administrations, and by the participating
companies. As well as facilitating technology and
knowledge transfer, TCS also provides business-
based training and experience for high-calibre
graduates. They work in companies on two-year
projects that are central to the needs of the
businesses and are jointly supervised by personnel
from the knowledge base and the companies.
There are around 900 individual TCS
Programmes, each involving one or more
graduates, with around 90 per cent of the
programmes involving small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs).
To help UK companies remain competitive in an
increasingly global market, DTEs International
Technology Service (ITS) (see
www.globalwatchonline.com) enables UK
companies to become aware of, and gain access
to, new technological developments and
management practices not present in the UK.
The ITS highlights developments and
opportunities overseas; and assists companies to
access technology, set up licensing agreements
and collaborative ventures, and gain experience
of new technology and leading management
practices.
Smart
The Smart scheme in England, operated by the
Small Business Service (an agency of the DTI),
provides grants to help individuals and small
businesses research and develop technologically
innovative new products or buy external
consultancy to improve their use and exploitation
of technology.
Over 800 offers of help under Smart were made in
England in 2001/02. Separate Smart schemes are
operated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Aeronautics
DTTs Civil Aircraft Research and Technology
Demonstration Programme (CARAD) supports
research and technology demonstration in
aeronautics as part of the industrial exploitation
of science programme. CARAD is part of the
national aeronautics research effort, with most of
the supported research work being conducted in
industry, and with significant involvement of
QinetiQ (see page 378). Universities and other
research organisations receive about 7 per cent of
funding. CARAD and earlier programmes have
supported a range of projects, including
aluminium and composite airframe materials,
more efficient and environmentally friendly
engines, and advanced aircraft systems.
National Measurement System
DTI is responsible for the National Measurement
System (NMS), which funds science and
technology programmes in measurement science,
including materials metrology. In 2002/03
DTI expects to invest £59 million on the NMS.
The NMS provides world-class measurement
standards and calibration facilities. These enable
businesses and public authorities to make accurate
measurements which are nationally and
internationally accepted. Although most of the
work is carried out at the National Physical
Laboratory, the Laboratory of the Government
Chemist, the National Engineering Laboratory and
the National Weights and Measures Laboratory,
DTI is taking steps to increase competition in these
programmes and to work more closely with
business in order to identify its future needs.
British Standards Institution
The DTI works closely with the British Standards
Institution (BSI), the national standards body
which is independent of the Government, to
promote UK trade and technology interests.
DTI support for BSI is directed particularly
towards European and international standards,
which account for over 90 per cent of the
Institution’s work. It also provides support for the
United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS),
the sole national body recognised by the
Government to accredit organisations that test,
calibrate, inspect and certify against standards.
DTTs contribution to BSI and UKAS was £7.2
million in 2001/02.
Ministry of Defence (MoD)
The Government invests about £450 million a year
in technological research to ensure that the UK’s
377
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
armed forces stay ahead of threats from potential
adversaries. The MoD has a research budget and
also a much larger equipment procurement
budget. Planned net expenditure on SET for
2002/03 is £2.4 billion.
All MoD research used to be carried out by its
Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA),
but in July 2001 DERA was disbanded and
replaced by two new organisations: Defence
Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and
QinetiQ pic. Dstl carries out research in key areas,
provides a high-level overview of defence science
and technology, acts as an in-house source of
impartial advice and manages international
research collaboration.
About 75 per cent of DERA’s staff were transferred
to QinetiQ pic, currently a wholly government-
owned company. The Government is selling
the company, while initially retaining a financial
stake.
Department for Transport (DfT)
The DfT funds research to inform the evidence
base for all its major policy and operational
responsibilities: transport integration, roads and
local transport; and railways, aviation and
shipping. Total planned expenditure for 2002/03 is
£52 million, including spending by its executive
agencies.
Department for Environment, Food
& Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
DEFRA co-ordinates its research programme with
the devolved administrations and the Research
Councils. The programme supports the
Department’s wide-ranging responsibilities for
protecting the public in relation to farm produce
and animal diseases transmissible to humans;
protecting and enhancing the rural and marine
environment; reducing risks from flooding and
coastal erosion; improving animal health and
welfare; and encouraging modern, efficient and
competitive agriculture, fishing and food
industries.
The budget for research expenditure in 2002/03 is
£147 million, including support for the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Kew (see page 384). Through the
Darwin Initiative, British expertise is being made
available to assist countries that are rich in
biodiversity but have insufficient financial or
technical resources to implement the Biodiversity
Convention.
Department of Health (DH)
The DH supports R&D to provide the evidence
needed to inform policy and practice in public
health, healthcare and social care. It delivers this
objective through:
■ National Health Service (NHS) R&D
funding, which supports projects funded by
other non-commercial R&D sources
(including charities) carried out in the NHS,
and also specific health and social care
projects meeting the identified research needs
of the DH and the NHS;
■ a Policy Research Programme (PRP), directly
commissioned by the DH; and
■ ad hoc project funding from other DH R&D
budgets and support for non-departmental
public bodies (NDPBs).
The DH expects to spend some £572 million on
research in 2002/03: £507 million on NHS R&D,
£35 million on the PRP and about £30 million
involving the NDPBs and ad hoc budgets.
Department for International
Development (DFID)
DFID commissions and sponsors knowledge
generation and sharing in natural resources,
health and population, engineering, education and
social sciences. Financial provision in 2002/03 is
around £105 million, covering research projects
and programmes that respond to identified
development needs and that help build research
capacity in developing countries.
DFID also contributes to international centres and
programmes generating knowledge on
development issues. These contributions include
support for the EU Framework Programmes (see
page 386), which sponsor research and
technological development in renewable natural
resources, agriculture, health and information
technologies; for the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR); and
for the World Health Organisation which
administers programmes that include
international research and the strengthening of
research capacity.
Scottish Executive
The majority of the Scottish Executive’s support
for the science base is disbursed by the Scottish
378
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
Higher Education Funding Council. In total this
amounts to some £180 million for 2002/03 -
£132 million for research and £48 million to
support the strategic development of the sector.
The Scottish Executive spends about £130 million
directly on agricultural and fisheries research,
health, biological, environmental, economic and
social science. A large proportion of this goes to
the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research
Institutes, the Fisheries Research Service and the
Scottish Agricultural College. In addition, the UK
Research Councils contribute around £150 million
to Scottish research institutions and around
£100 million is contributed by other UK
government sources.
In August 2001 the Executive launched A Science
Strategy for Scotland. In accordance with the
strategy, the Executive has established an
independent Scottish Science Advisory Committee,
to advise it on strategic science matters.
Northern Ireland Executive
In addition to participating in the Dual Support
Scheme and other UK-wide initiatives, the
Northern Ireland Executive is part funding the
Support Programme for University Research
(SPUR). This is a joint public/private programme,
under which some £44 million is being invested in
research over the period 2001/02 to 2004/05.
A substantial percentage of the programme
expenditure will be on science-related projects,
most notably the new £14.5 million Centre for
Molecular Biosciences at the University of Ulster.
In Northern Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland has a
similar role to that of DTEs Innovation Unit,
supporting industrial R&D, technology transfer and
innovation.
Research Councils
There are seven Research Councils. Each is an
autonomous body established under Royal
Charter, with members of its governing council
drawn from universities, professions, industry and
government. The Councils support research, study
and training in universities and other higher
education institutions. They also carry out or
support research, through their own institutes and
at international research centres, often jointly with
other public sector bodies and international
organisations. They provide awards to about
15,000 postgraduate students in science, social
sciences, engineering and technology. In addition

Following the Quinquennial Review of the
Research Councils in 2001, a new strategy group,
Research Councils UK (RCUK), was launched in
May 2002 to develop a stronger strategic
framework for science.
Research Councils UK
RCUK is a strategic partnership set up to champion
science, engineering and technology. It is supported
by the seven UK Research Councils and aims to:
■ create a common framework for research,
training and knowledge transfer;
■ provide a single focus for dialogue with
stakeholders;
■ provide the focus for independent scientific
advice from the Research Councils to the
Government;
■ promote collaboration to deliver scientific and
strategic goals; and
■ harmonise procedures to give stakeholders a
more efficient service.
The RCUK strategy group is chaired by the Director
General of Research Councils and includes the chief
executives of the seven Councils.

Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC)
The EPSRC (www.epsrc.ac.uk), the largest
Research Council in terms of remit, promotes and
supports high-quality basic, strategic and applied
research and related postgraduate training in
engineering and the physical sciences. It also
provides advice, disseminates knowledge and
promotes public understanding in these areas. Its
remit is delivered through ten programme areas:
engineering; infrastructure and the environment;
innovative manufacturing; chemistry; physics;
mathematics; information technology and
computer science; materials; the boundary
between the EPSRC and the life sciences; and
public awareness of SET. The EPSRC also manages
programmes in basic technology and e-science on
behalf of all the Research Councils.
Photonic crystal fibres
Photonic crystal fibres are being developed at Bath
and other universities. In these 'holey fibres' light is
guided by a regular array of micro or nanosized air
holes which run the length of the fibre; these
greatly enhance the capabilities of optical fibre. In
telecommunications, these fibres could transmit
many times more power than existing systems,
reducing costs for oceanic links by removing the
need for amplifiers or repeaters. Other applications
are expected to include high-power lasers,
amplifiers and medical imaging.
Medical Research Council (MRC)
The MRC (www.mrc.ac.uk) (see also chapter 13,
page 179) is the main source of public funds for
biomedical, health services and related research
and training aimed at maintaining and improving
public health. The Council has three major
institutes: the National Institute for Medical
Research, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology
and the Clinical Sciences Centre. It has 29 smaller
MRC Units, an MRC Health Services Research
Collaboration (a collaborative arrangement based
in the Department of Social Medicine in Bristol
University and involving groups in seven other
universities) and five grant-funded Centres. Most
of these are attached to higher education
institutions or hospitals throughout the UK. The
MRC also has laboratories overseas, in The
Gambia and Uganda.
About half the MRC’s research expenditure is
allocated to its own institutes and units, with the
rest going mainly on grant support and research
training awards to teams and individuals in higher
education institutions. The Council works closely
with the health departments, the major charities,
industry and international collaborators.
Genetics
The MRC Human Genetics Unit in Edinburgh has
developed a new imaging technique, Optical
Projection Tomography (OPT). It allows new insights
into the structure of tissues that will help the
understanding of what genes do and where and
when they function. It will be used initially to aid
research on the function of genes in mice. In the
past, genome sequencing projects have successfully
identified many thousands of genes. This new
technique is expected to find out what all these
genes do and their contribution to health and
disease.
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC)
The NERC (www.nerc.ac.uk) funds and carries out
scientific research in the sciences of the
environment. Science for a sustainable future
2002-2007 is the strategy document that identifies
priority areas for NERC, including:
■ Earth’s life-support systems - water,
biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity;
■ climate change - predicting and mitigating
the effects; and
■ sustainable economies - identifying and
providing sustainable solutions to the
challenges associated with energy, land use
and the effects of natural hazards.
Robot under ice
Autosub, a revolutionary £5 million submarine
robot, was designed and built at Southampton
Oceanography Centre (a NERC partnership with the
University of Southampton). Results of Autosub's
first mission under the Antarctic sea ice were
published in March 2002. Before its advent, it was
impossible to investigate under sea ice for more
than a few metres. The 7 m long, torpedo-shaped
Autosub travelled 27 km inside the edge of the ice
and made the first ever continuous measurement of
ice thickness.

Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
NERC trains the next generation of environmental
scientists. It also provides a range of facilities for
use by the wider environmental science
community, including a marine research fleet.
NERC’s wholly owned research centres are the
British Geological Survey, the British Antarctic
Survey, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
and the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory.
NERC also supports 13 collaborative centres in
UK universities.
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)
The BBSRC (www.bbsrc.ac.uk) supports basic and
strategic research and research training in the
non-medical life sciences. The scientific themes of
its research committees are biomolecular sciences;
genes and developmental biology; biochemistry
and cell biology; plant and microbial sciences;
animal sciences; agri-food; and engineering and
biological systems. As well as funding research in
universities and other research centres, the BBSRC
sponsors eight research institutes.
Centre for Novel Agricultural Products
The Centre for Novel Agricultural Products was
opened in summer 2002 at the University of York,
where it is an integral part of work on bioscience
development. The Centre seeks to identify valuable
genes, determine their function and define realistic
commercial opportunities for their use - taking
basic research through to application. Research
projects already in progress include:
■ new methods of oil production from plants;
■ molecular understanding of spider silk
production; and
■ biodegradation of explosives.
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council (PPARC)
The main task of the PPARC (www.pparc.ac.uk) is
to encourage and support a balanced and cost-
effective research programme into fundamental
physical processes. It funds UK research,
education and training in its four broad areas of
science: particle physics, astronomy, solar system
science and particle astrophysics.
The PPARC provides funds to universities to
undertake research and facilities to enable that
research to take place. Facilities are provided
on a national and international basis, the latter
including bodies such as the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and
the European Space Agency.
European Southern Observatory
In July 2002 the UK formally joined the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) project, which has nine
other member states. UK astronomers now have
access to some of the world's most advanced
telescopes and a major stake in future
developments, including the Atacama Large
Millimetre Array (ALMA) and the vast 100 m
Overwhelmingly Large Telescope project. UK
astronomers will be able to use the four 8.2 m and
several 1.8 m telescopes that comprise the Very
Large Telescope (VLT) facility, which is the world's
largest and most advanced optical telescope,
located at the Paranal Observatory in the Atacama
desert in Chile. The PPARC negotiated the terms of
the agreement under which the UK joined ESO and
is also making an additional contribution, including
support for a new 4 m Visible and Infrared Survey
Telescope (VISTA). VISTA, which will be installed at
the Paranal Observatory, is being financed using a
grant awarded to 18 UK universities and is
designed to be capable of rapidly mapping large
areas of the sky to a great depth.
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC)
The ESRC (www.esrc.ac.uk) supports research and
training in the social sciences. Research funded by
the ESRC is conducted in higher education
institutions or independent research
establishments. The Council has seven priority
themes: economic performance and development;
environment and human behaviour; governance
and citizenship; knowledge, communication and
learning; lifecourse, lifestyles and health; social
stability and exclusion; and work and
organisations.
Council for the Central Laboratory of
the Research Councils (CCLRC)

Following the terrorist attacks in the United States
on 11 September 2001 (see page 75), research
began in August 2002 on a new ESRC-funded
research initiative into the domestic management of
terrorist attacks in the UK. More than £600,000 has
been allocated to three individual projects:
■ the UK response - a comprehensive analysis of
the current state of the UK response to the
possible threat of a terrorist attack;
■ the public, risks and lessons from the United
States-an examination of the options for
responding to the threat of terrorist attacks on

In July 2002 an agreement to manage access to a
new supercomputer was agreed between the
EPSRC and a consortium led by the University of
Edinburgh, with the CCLRC and IBM. The contract
will cost £53 million and will be mostly funded by
the EPSRC, with additional funding from the NERC
and BBSRC. The service, due to start in December
2002, will be used by UK scientists to solve a wide
range of previously inaccessible problems, ranging
from the very small - such as the nature of matter
- to the global, with simulations of the Earth. In
addition, the service is expected to help engineers
design new and safer structures, and aircraft. New
advances are also envisaged in the human genome
project, and in new fields of research, such as
biomolecular electronics.

Public engagement in science
The Government seeks to raise the status of SET
among the general public, by increasing awareness
of the contribution of SET to the UK’s economic
wealth and quality of life. To this end, the
Government supports activities such as the annual
science festival of the British Association (BA) and
National Science Week, and offers grants to
science communicators through a scheme
administered by the Royal Society.
Science festivals are a growing feature of local co¬
operative efforts to further the understanding of
the contribution made by science to everyday life.
Cheltenham Festival of Science
The first Cheltenham Festival of Science, a five-day
event in May 2002, was attended by an estimated
24,000 people. The festival was promoted by
Cheltenham Arts Festivals and will continue as part
of their annual calendar. The pleasure of science, the
theme of the festival, aimed to engage the interest
of families and schoolchildren. The festival had 26
events and talks, including debates on genetic
modification, as well as a free hands-on interactive
exhibition aimed at younger visitors.

Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
The longest established annual science festival to
be held in a single location is the Edinburgh
International Science Festival. Activities such as
these help to ensure continued interest in SET
among young people making their educational
and career choices, and to enhance the public’s
ability to relate to scientific issues in general and
to make informed judgements about scientific
developments.
Science and the public
Science and the public, published in 2000 and
sponsored by the OST and the Wellcome Trust,
brought together research on the provision of
science communication with research exploring
public attitudes to SET.
The survey found that the British public generally
supported science. For example:
■ three-quarters of people said they were
amazed by the achievements of science;
■ only a fifth claimed that they were not
interested in science;
■ 72 per cent agreed that, even if it brought no
immediate benefits, scientific research that
advances knowledge was necessary and
should be supported by the Government; and
■ in general, scientists were well respected, with
84 per cent of respondents stating that
scientists and engineers made a valuable
contribution to society.

Aventis Prize for Science Books
The winner of the international science book prize in
2002 was Stephen Hawking with The Universe in a
Nutshell. It is the first time in five years that a British
writer has won it. Stephen Hawking is a physicist
who became famous in 1988 through his book
A Brief History of Time. He is currently Lucasian
Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University.
The prize for the best science book for children
under 14 was awarded to Richard Walker for the
Dorling Kindersley Guide to the Human Body.
and funded by the Department for Education and
Skills (DIES). It is focusing particularly on those
aged 10 to 19 and the adults around them
(especially their teachers), and aims to raise
awareness of the wide range of subjects and careers
that are underpinned by science and technology.
Science year was launched with The Giant Jump.
Over 1 million children jumped up and down at
the same time, in the largest simultaneous jump
ever, and measured the effects on home-made
seismometers.
Science and Engineering Ambassadors (SEAs)
The Science and Engineering Ambassadors project
was launched by the DfES and DTI in January 2002.
Individuals with backgrounds in science,
engineering, technology and mathematics go into
schools to help teachers develop the curricula and
to act as role models for the young. SEAs are
administered across the UK by SETNET, the Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network

DNA day
As part of National Science Week, the world's
largest model of DNA, standing at 10.78 m, was
built by teams from Daresbury Laboratory (see page
381) and Keele University at the Potteries Shopping
Centre in Stoke-on-Trent. Some 3,000
schoolchildren, and celebrities from science, politics
and the arts built base pairs for the model.
Zoological gardens

25 Science, engineering and technology
science and education charity founded in 1826,
runs London Zoo in Regent’s Park (London). It
also owns and runs Whipsnade Wild Animal Park
in Bedfordshire. ZSL is responsible for the
Institute of Zoology, which carries out research in
support of conservation. The Institute’s work
covers topics such as ecology, reproductive biology
and conservation genetics. ZSL also operates in
overseas conservation projects, and is concerned
with practical field conservation, primarily in East
and Southern Africa, the Middle East and parts of
Asia. Other well-known zoos in the UK include
those in Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley and
Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (www.kew.org.uk),
founded in 1759, are based at Kew in south-west
London and at Wakehurst Place (Ardingly, in West
Sussex). They contain one of the largest collections
of living and dried plants in the world. Research is
conducted into all aspects of plant life, including
physiology, biochemistry, genetics, economic botany
and the conservation of habitats and species.
Titanic flowering
One of the most spectacular plants to be found in
the wet tropics zone of the Princess of Wales
Conservatory, at Kew Gardens, is the titan arum
(Amorphophallus titanum). In May 2002 this giant
plant, over 2 m in height and a possible world
record of 75 kg in weight, burst into flower; two
more from the same batch of seeds have repeated
the majestic flowering. The Titan arum blooms very
rarely in cultivation and plants very often grow for
many years without producing a flower. The central
spike-like spadix gave off a pungent aroma
described as a mixture of rotting flesh and
excrement.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
(www.rbge.org.uk) was established in 1670 and is
the national botanic garden of Scotland. Together
with its three associated specialist gardens, it has
become an internationally recognised centre for
taxonomy (classification of species); for the
conservation and study of living and preserved
plants and fungi; and as a provider of
horticultural education.
A National Botanic Garden and research centre
for Wales (www.gardenofwales.org.uk) has been
developed on a site on the Middleton Hall estate
at Llanarthne, near Carmarthen, and was opened
in 2000 - the first botanic garden to be built in
Britain for two centuries.
Scientific museums
The Natural History Museum (www.nhm.ac.uk) is
one of the UK’s most popular visitor attractions
(with 2.1 million visitors in 2001/02), with
exhibitions devoted to the Earth and the life
sciences. It is also a world-leading centre in the
fields of taxonomy and biodiversity. It is founded
on collections of 70 million specimens from the
natural world, and has 500,000 historically
important original works of art. There are 350
scientists, and research projects are active in
60 countries. In September 2002 the opening of
phase one of the Darwin Centre made a further
12 million specimens accessible to the public for
the first time. The museum also offers an advisory
service to foreign institutions.
The Science Museum (www.nrnsi.ac.uk), which
had 3.1 million visitors in 2001/02, promotes the
public understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. The
collections contain many of the icons of the
scientific age with objects as diverse as Crick and
Watson’s DNA model and Stephenson’s Rocket.
These two museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections include
those at the Museum of Science & Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of Science
in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish Museum,
Edinburgh.
In Belfast, the W5 Interactive Discovery Centre
(www.w5online.co.uk) is located within Northern
Magna Science Adventure Centre
Magna (www.magnatrust.org.uk) is the UK's first
Science Adventure Centre. It is located in Rotherham
in South Yorkshire. Visitors can explore displays on
Earth, Air, Fire and Water, and have a chance to
create their own adventure through hands-on
interactive challenges. There are four Adventure
Pavilions, two shows and an outdoor adventure
park. Magna runs workshops and events aimed at
different age groups and tailored to different levels
of education. Since March 2002 a colony of 'Living
Robots' has been on show, featuring 'predator' and
'prey' robots, special effects and commentary. The
robots have the goal of obtaining enough energy to
survive and breed.

Workforce
The DTI report Maximising Returns - to science,
engineering and technology careers, published in
January 2002, estimated that the number of SET
graduates in the working age population increased
between 1992 and 2000 by 19 per cent, from
1.1 million to 1.3 million. However, owing to the
increase in the number of graduates overall, the
proportion holding an SET degree has declined
from 32 per cent to 25 per cent. Although the
number of women SET graduates is increasing, in
2000 men outnumbered women by more than
four to one.
The study found that less than half of male SET
graduates and approximately a quarter of female
SET graduates were employed in key SET
occupational groups (as defined by the study),
such as engineers, scientists and computer
programmers. They may, however, be engaged in
related occupations such as sales and marketing.
According to the 2000 ONS Business R&D Survey,
the number of staff employed on R&D in UK
businesses decreased by 5 per cent between 1999
and 2000, to 145,000 (see Table 25.4). Scientists
and engineers accounted for 59 per cent of the
staff.
In 1999/2000 there were nearly 82,000 full-time
staff employed in SET within higher education,
69 per cent of whom were male. Of those teaching
and carrying out research, 74 per cent were male.
Women were more likely to be involved in
research only (38 per cent), rather than teaching
and research (26 per cent).
The Promoting SET for Women Unit within OST
was established in 1994 in response to a report
which found that women were under-represented
in the SET sectors, especially at senior levels, a
finding confirmed in the 2002 Roberts Review
(see box). The Unit has highlighted the benefits to
business of providing a working environment
sensitive to the needs of women scientists and
engineers, many of whom have to combine a
career with family responsibilities. It seeks to

Roberts Review
The 'Roberts Review', published in SET for Success,
the supply of people with science, technology,
engineering and mathematic skills, in April 2002,
found that compared to other countries, the UK has
a relatively large, and growing, number of students
studying for scientific and technical qualification.
This growth primarily reflected increases in those
studying IT and the biological sciences, and there
were downward trends in the numbers studying
mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences.
The review made recommendations to deal with a
number of issues including:
■ a shortage of women choosing to study subjects
such as mathematics, engineering and the
physical sciences;
■ poor experiences of science and engineering
education, coupled with a negative image of
careers in the sector;
■ insufficiently attractive career opportunities in
research; and
■ science and engineering graduates and
postgraduates did not have the transferable
skills required by R&D employers.
The Spending Review 2002 (see page 350) provides
for additional investment of £100 million
a year by 2005/06 paid via the Science Budget.
This is to enable the OST to take forward the key
recommendations of the Roberts Review, with the
intention of ensuring a strong future supply of
skilled scientists and engineers. Measures include
attracting students in schools and universities to
science through improved pay and training for PhD
students and postdoctoral researchers, together
with better teaching and research facilities.

25 Science, engineering and technology
ensure that careers information for girls and
women is widely available and to promote good
employment practices, such as the provision of
childcare facilities and job sharing. The Unit’s
website (www.set4women.gov.uk) promotes SET
for girls and women, and gives details of the Unit’s
activities. In the Maximising Returns report, the
DTI estimated that around 24,000 women SET
graduates returned to employment in 2000, and
that about a third of them returned to SET
occupations.
Research in higher education
institutions
Universities carry out most of the UK’s long-term
strategic and basic research in science and
technology. The higher education funding
councils provide the main general funds to
support research in universities and other higher
education institutions in Great Britain. These
funds pay for the salaries of permanent academic
staff, who usually teach as well as undertake
research, and contribute to the infrastructure for
research. The quality of research performance is
a key element in the allocation of funding. In
Northern Ireland institutions are funded by the
Department for Employment and Learning.
The Research Councils also finance basic and
strategic research in higher education institutions.
The other main channels of support are industry,
charities, government departments and the EU.
Science Parks
Science Parks encourage and support the start-up,
incubation and growth of innovation-led, high-
growth, knowledge-based businesses. They have
formal or operational links to a higher education
institution or other major research centre. The UK
Science Park Association (www.ukspa.org.uk)
numbers 61 such initiatives, which together host
over 1,500 firms employing over 30,000 people.
International collaboration
European Union
The EU’s Sixth Framework Programme for Research
and Technical Development (FP6), published in
June 2002, has a budget of €17.5 billion for the four
years to 2006. Framework programmes are the EU’s
main instrument for funding research. There are
seven key areas within FP6, funding research in
genomics and biotechnology for health; information
society technologies; nanotechnologies and
nanosciences; aeronautics and space; food safety;
sustainable development; and economic and social
sciences. Framework programmes also provide
support for mobility, fellowships, infrastructures
and the continuation of nuclear research under
Euratom.
FP6 is a key mechanism in realising a European
Research Area, which aims to regroup all EC
support for better co-ordination of research and
innovation policies, at national and EU levels. The
UK is actively engaged in the development of
a common European Space Strategy involving
ESA, the EU and others.
The six grant-giving Research Councils, in
association with the UK universities, maintain the
UK Research Office in Brussels which aims to
promote UK participation in European research
programmes. The CCLRC receives funds from the
EU to make its facilities available to researchers
from other Member States.
Other international activities
Over 800 UK organisations have taken part in
EUREKA (www.eureka.be), an industry-led
scheme to encourage European co-operation in
developing advanced products and processes with
worldwide sales potential. There are 33 members
of EUREKA, including the 15 EU countries and
the European Commission. Some 650 projects are
in progress, involving firms, universities and
research organisations. Examples of projects in
2002 involving UK organisations include:
■ development of medicinal uses of cannabis
extracts;
■ generic e-trading software;
■ environmentally friendly plant growth
regulators and protection agents for use in
organic agriculture; and
■ automatic digitalisation and classification of
sound.
The COST programme (European co-operation in
the field of scientific and technical research) is
a multilateral agreement involving 33 countries
(including all the EU Member States, many
386
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
Mediterranean, Central European and Eastern
European countries and Israel). Its purpose is to
encourage co-operation in national research
activities across Europe, with participants from
industry, academia and research laboratories. The
UK participates in the majority of COST actions
and in the management of the programme.
Another example of international collaboration is
CERN, home to the European laboratory for
particle physics, based in Geneva, where the Large
Hadron Collider is due to be completed by 2006.
Scientific programmes at CERN aim to test, verify
and develop the ‘standard model’ of the origin and
structure of the Universe. There are 20 member
states. The PPARC leads UK participation in
CERN and the CCLRC co-ordinates several
aspects of UK research community involvement.
The EPSRC provides the UK contribution to the
costs of access by UK researchers to the high-flux
neutron source at the Institute Laue-Langevin and
to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility,
both in Grenoble. These responsibilities are to
transfer to the CCLRC from April 2003.
The PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the Arctic
Circle, which conducts research on the ionosphere.
NERC has a major involvement in international
programmes of research into global climate change
organised through the World Climate Research
Programme and the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme. It also supports the UK’s
subscription to the Ocean Drilling Program.
The Medical Research Council pays the UK
subscription to the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory (EMBL), which has its home research
base at Heidelberg. The European Bioinformatics
Institute, an outstation of the EMBL, at Hinxton,
near Cambridge, provides access to important
molecular biology, sequencing and structural
databases. The MRC is also responsible for the
UK’s subscriptions to the International Agency for
Cancer Research, Lyon.
BBSRC and MRC pay the UK subscription to the
Human Frontiers Science Program, which
promotes international collaboration in two areas:
brain functions and biological functions through
molecular level approaches.
The Research Councils have a number of bilateral
arrangements to promote international
collaboration. For example, the BBSRC has
agreements with its equivalent organisations in
France, the Netherlands, the United States,
Canada, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and
India, and supports travel, workshops and other
activities to encourage international links.
The UK is a member of the science and
technology committees of such international
organisations as the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), and
of various specialised agencies of the United
Nations, including the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
(UNESCO). The Research Councils and the
Royal Society are members of the European
Science Foundation - an association of 70 major
national funding agencies in 27 European
countries.
The UK Government also enters into bilateral
agreements with other governments to encourage
closer collaboration in SET. Staff in British
Embassies, High Commissions and British
Council offices conduct government business on,
and promote contacts in, SET between the UK
and overseas countries; and help to inform a large
number of organisations in the UK about
developments and initiatives overseas. The ECO
has a London-based Science and Technology unit,
whose tasks include the management of the
overseas network of science attaches, and the
recruitment and training of new attaches.
The British Council promotes ‘cutting edge’ UK
science through events, partnership programmes,
seminars, exhibitions and information provision.
Other organisations
Charitable organisations
Medical research charities are a major source of
funds for medical research in the UK. According
to the Association of Medical Research Charities,
their members spent more than £640 million in
support of medical research in the UK in 2000/01.
The two largest contributors are the Wellcome
Trust and Cancer Research UK.
The Wellcome Trust is an independent charity,
established under the will of Sir Henry Wellcome
in 1936. Its mission is ‘to foster and promote
research with the aim of improving human and
387
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
animal health’. To this end, it supports ‘blue sky’
research and applied clinical research, and
encourages the exploitation of research findings
for medical benefit. The Trust also seeks to raise
awareness of the medical, ethical and social
implications of research and to promote dialogue
between scientists, the public and policy makers.
To complement the programme of resources
announced in the 2002 Spending Review, the
Wellcome Trust is committing an additional
£280 million for complementary funding for new
programmes of science research and improved
training for science teachers.
New research facility
The Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility was
opened at Addenbrooke's Flospital, Cambridge, in
January 2002. It is the first of five new facilities
being established as part of a £20 million initiative
to use the results of research to improve patient
care. There are 31 studies in progress at the
Addenbrooke's facility, with more planned for the
future. Current studies include work on:
■ the role of genetic factors in the development of
severe childhood obesity; and
■ a study of bone protection for stroke victims,
who are at greater risk of hip fracture and death
from falls.
Professional and learned institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned societies in
the UK, many of which promote their own
disciplines or the education and professional well
being of their members. The Council of Science
and Technology Institutes has ten member
institutes representing biology, biochemistry,
chemistry, the environment, food science and
technology, geology, hospital physics and physics.
Engineering Council
The Engineering Council (UK) (ECUK) was
created in March 2002 as the successor of the
chartered institution first established in 1982 to
promote and regulate the engineering profession
in the UK. It is responsible for the Register of
Chartered Engineers, Incorporated Engineers and
Engineering Technicians, and the Engineers
Registration Board. ECUK is supported by
36 professional engineering institutions and
14 professional affiliates. In partnership with the
institutions, the Council accredits higher and
further education courses and advises the
Government on academic, industrial and
professional issues. Some 258,000 individuals have
satisfied the Council’s regulations for registration
through their institution as either Chartered
Engineers, Incorporated Engineers or as
Engineering Technicians.
Royal Society
The Royal Society (www.royalsoc.ac.uk), founded
in 1660, has 1,236 Fellows and 118 Foreign
Members. The Society has three roles: as the
national academy of science, as a learned society
and as a funding agency for the scientific
community. It offers independent advice to
government on science matters, acts as an
international forum for discussion of ground¬
breaking scientific research, supports many of the
best young scientists and engineers in the UK,
facilitates dialogue between scientists and the
public, and promotes science education. Its
government grant for 2002/03 is £28.7 million.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in Great
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering
(www.raeng.org.uk), which has 1,206 Fellows and
86 Foreign Members. It promotes excellence in
engineering for the benefit of society, and advises
government, Parliament and other official
organisations. The Academy’s programmes are
aimed at attracting students into engineering,
raising awareness of the importance of engineering
design among undergraduates, developing links
between industry and higher education, and
increasing industrial investment in engineering
research in higher education institutions. It has
a government grant of £4.8 million in 2002/03.
Other societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by offering
postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and publishing
journals. It also acts as a source of independent
scientific advice to the Government and others.
Three other major institutions publicise scientific
developments by means of lectures and publications
for specialists and schoolchildren. Of these, the
British Association for the Advancement of Science,
founded in 1831, is mainly concerned with science,
388
Economic affairs
25 Science, engineering and technology
while the Royal Society of Arts (www.rsa.org.uk),
dating from 1754, deals with the arts and commerce
as well as science. The Royal Institution
(www.ri.ac.uk), founded in 1799, arranges a large
and varied public programme of events to bring
science to a wider audience, including the Christmas
Lectures and the Friday Evening Discourses. In 2001
the Christmas Lectures celebrated their 175th
anniversary. As well as being broadcast in the UK,
the lectures are transmitted to other parts of
Europe, Japan and Korea.

Although agriculture, forestry and fishing together
accounted for only 0.7 per cent of the total
economy in terms of gross value added in 2001,
their impact across the United Kingdom was far
greater. Their share of the total economy has fallen
from 1.6 per cent in 1995 and 2.9 per cent in 1973
because of a long-term fall in agricultural prices.
The UK is about 63 per cent self-sufficient for all
food and about 75 per cent for indigenous food.
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (see page
401) in 2001 dealt the farming industry another
serious blow, after the severe flooding which
affected many parts of the UK during autumn
2000 (the wettest for at least 230 years) and the
BSE epidemic. However, 2001 was exceptionally
mild and drier than 2000 - this allowed farmers
to catch up on work which had fallen behind.
The Forestry Commission published its
Millennium Inventory of trees in November 2001.
The statistics for 2000 obtained by the inventory
have been compared with the figures indicated

almost 1,000 years ago by the Domesday Book (see
page 488). In 1086 forest cover was estimated to be
around 15 per cent. By 1870 it had fallen to below
5 per cent, but has since recovered (see page 405).
Similar research in Scotland has found that tree
cover has trebled in the last 100 years and is now
higher than it was 700 years ago.
Agriculture
In 2001 UK agriculture contributed £6.4 billion to
the total economy, employed some 568,000 people
and used over three-quarters of the country’s land
area. Income per full-time worker from agriculture
in the UK increased by 3.5 per cent in 2001,
slightly above the EU average increase of
3.3 per cent.
In 2000 there were some 286,000 farm holdings in
the UK (excluding minor holdings in Wales but
including all active farms in Northern Ireland,
Scotland and England). These holdings had an

average area of 60.5 hectares. Nearly half of them
are smaller than eight European size units (ESUs).1
About two-thirds of all agricultural land is owner-
occupied; the rest is tenanted or rented.
Agricultural land represents over 77 per cent of
total land area in the UK, compared with
42 per cent for the EU as a whole.
Following a 35 per cent fall in 2000, total income
from farming in the UK is estimated to have risen by
11 per cent in real terms in 2001, to £1,710 million.
The value of output (including subsidies directly
related to products) was 0.7 per cent (£104 million)
higher in current prices than in 2000. Volume was
6 per cent lower, with reduced production of cereals,
due to wet weather in the winter of 2000/01, and of
livestock, due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease. However, prices received by farmers were
7.1 per cent higher, mainly owing to price rises for
milk, potatoes, vegetables, sugar beet, oilseed rape
and wheat.
Productivity measures how efficiently inputs are
converted into outputs. Since 1973 the
productivity of the agriculture industry in the UK
has increased by 36 per cent. However, in 2001 the
volume of output was 6 per cent lower than in
2000 and inputs hardly changed. Labour
productivity decreased by 17 per cent and total
factor productivity decreased by 6.1 per cent. This
Farmers' markets
The first of around 455 farmers' markets now
operating in the UK - selling produce directly to
consumers - started in Bath in 1997. The National
Association of Farmers' Markets (NAFM -
www.farmersmarkets.net) was established in 1999.
NAFM has developed a set of criteria which markets
should meet to be recognised as farmers' markets.
These include provisions that:
■ food must be locally produced (each market will
have a definition of local);
■ all produce sold must be grown, reared or
otherwise produced by the stallholder; and
■ information should be available to customers at
each market about the rules of the market and
the production methods of the producers.

margins which might be expected from stock and crops: eight
ESUs is judged the minimum for full-time holdings.
was mainly due to the measures taken to combat
foot-and-mouth disease, poor yields and re¬
sowing in the arable sector.
Agricultural landlords and tenants
About 35 per cent of agricultural land in England
and 23 per cent in Wales is rented. Since 1995 a
simplified legal framework for new tenancies,
known as farm business tenancies, has allowed
landowners to benefit from full income tax relief.
There is a similar proportion of rented land in
Scotland, much of it in the Highlands and Islands
under crofting tenure (see box), including
common grazing. The Scottish Executive is
committed to changing the law relating to
agricultural tenure by introducing new tenancy
options. It is hoped that these will stimulate the
rental sector and offer tenants the opportunity to
manage their land more flexibly.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows owners
not wishing to farm all their land to let it annually
to others. Conacre land, about 30 per cent of
agricultural land, is used mainly for grazing.
Smallholdings and crofts
In England and Wales, county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want to
farm on their own account, and may also lend
working capital to them. In March 2000 there were
approximately 4,000 smallholdings in England and
720 in Wales. In Scotland, the Scottish Executive
manages a number of estates and holdings,
comprising some 103,000 hectares. Almost all this
is tenanted croft land.
Crofting is a system of land tenure regulated
through the Crofting Acts and found only in the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland. A croft is a unit
of land subject to these Acts. Crofting agriculture
rarely provides a full-time income and most crofters
have other employment. An estimated 30,000
family members live on the 17,721 crofts, and croft
land covers some 800,000 hectares, accounting for
more than 25 per cent of the agricultural land area
of the Highlands and Islands. The Crofters
Commission develops and regulates the crofting
system, and promotes the interests of crofters. The
Scottish Executive issued a White Paper in July 2002
containing proposals for legislation on crofting
reform.

1 Total new supply is home production plus imports less exports.
Source: DEFRA Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2001
Production
Home production of the principal foods is shown
in Table 26.2 as a percentage by weight of total
supplies.
Livestock
About 40 per cent of farms are devoted mainly to
dairy farming or to beef cattle and sheep. Most of
the beef animals and sheep are reared in the hill
and moorland areas of the UK. Among world-
famous British livestock are the Hereford, Welsh
Black and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey,
Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy breeds, the Large
White pig breed and a number of sheep breeds.
Livestock totals are given in Table 26.3.
Cattle and sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute nearly 35 per cent of the
value of the UK’s gross agricultural output. Dairy
production is the largest part of the sector, followed
by cattle and calves, and then sheep and lambs.
In 2001 the average size of dairy herds in England
was 82, and 90 in Scotland. The average yield of
milk for each dairy cow in the UK was 6,308 litres
per year. The total value of milk and milk
products for human consumption rose by
18 per cent to £2,818 million, the highest since
1997.
More than half of home-bred beef production
originates from the national dairy herd, in which
the Holstein Friesian breed predominates. The
remainder derives from suckler herds producing
high-quality beef calves.
Between June 2000 and June 2001 the total cattle
population declined by 4.8 per cent and the value
of cattle and calf production fell to its lowest
figure for 19 years. This was due primarily to
a 10 per cent fall in the value of home-fed
production of beef and veal, a decrease in
unfinished production work (work in progress on
animals to be slaughtered) and a 5.9 per cent fall
in subsidy and other payments to beef producers.
The UK has more than 60 native sheep breeds and
many cross-bred varieties. The size of the UK
breeding flock declined by 12 per cent in 2001 to
17.9 million, due primarily to the effects of foot-
and-mouth, but also continuing a decline from
1999. The value of sheepmeat production fell in
2001, again to its lowest for 19 years. This was
primarily due to a 32 per cent fall in the value of

home-fed production and a 43 per cent fall in
subsidy payments.
Pigs
The value of production of pigs fell by
5.4 per cent in 2001. A fall in the value of home-
fed production of pigmeat of 9.9 per cent was
partially offset by an increase in the value of
unfinished production. Marketing of clean pigs2
fell by 14 per cent, primarily due to the
contraction of the breeding herd in the previous
year as a result of poor market returns. The
outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 and
Classical Swine Fever in autumn 2000 also had an
effect.
Poultry
The total UK poultry population in 2001
comprised 112.5 million chickens and other table
fowls; 29.9 million birds in the laying flock;
2 Pigs which have not been used for breeding.

12.1 million fowls for breeding; and 12.3 million

Poultrymeat production in 2001 was 1.6 million
tonnes, a 3.4 per cent increase on 2000. The
increase in value (see Table 26.4) was less than the
rise in production because poultrymeat prices fell
during 2001.
Crops
Farms devoted primarily to arable crops are found
mainly in eastern and central southern England
393
Economic affairs
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
and eastern Scotland. The main crops are shown
in Table 26.5. In the UK in 2001, the area planted
to cereals - predominantly wheat, barley and oats
- totalled 3.0 million hectares, a decrease of
10 per cent on 2000. Wet weather in autumn 2000
hindered planting, and farmers elected to enter
extra land into ‘set-aside’ when alternatives
became unviable. The total volume of cereal
production fell by 21 per cent and the total value
by 14 per cent.
The output value of oilseed rape rose by
12 per cent in 2001, due to a slight overall increase
in production coupled with an increase in price
levels. The value of production of linseed fell by
53 per cent, due to lower plantings and a further
reduction in subsidy rates. The output value of
sugar beet rose by 1 per cent.
Large-scale potato and vegetable cultivation takes
place on the fertile soils throughout the UK, often
with irrigation. Principal areas include East Anglia
and the Midlands. Total area for all potatoes was
almost unchanged in 2001, while the overall
volume of production was down by 1.9 per cent.
However, the value of production increased by
32 per cent, recovering from a low in the previous
year, due to higher prices.
Arable Area Payments Scheme
Under this scheme within the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP - see page 399),
farmers may claim area payments on cereals,
oilseeds, proteins and linseed, and on fibre flax
and hemp for fibre. A condition for claiming area
payments is that large-scale farmers must ‘set
aside’ a certain percentage of their land, thereby
avoiding overproduction, and must comply with
the strict rules for managing set-aside. The
minimum rate for set-aside for 2001 was
10 per cent of the total area claimed.
In 2001 there were approximately 60,000 claims
for area payments in the UK in respect of over
4.3 million hectares of land. Payments of
approximately £1 billion were made.
Horticulture
Table 26.6 gives details of the main horticultural
products. As at June 2001 the total area devoted to
horticulture (excluding mushrooms, potatoes, and
peas for harvesting dry) amounted to 172,734
hectares, almost unchanged from the 2000 figure.
This area relates to field area and does not take
into account the number of crops in the year.
The output value of all horticultural commodities
(including seeds and peas harvested dry) in 2001
was £1.9 billion, an increase of 8.1 per cent from
2000, with price rises due to a shortage of supply.
The value of production of vegetables increased by
11 per cent, fruit by 7 per cent and ornamentals
by 5 per cent.
Genetically modified crops
Now that the location and function of individual
crop genes are being discovered, scientists have the
chance to alter the genetic make-up of plants by
adding or removing specific genes. Some
52.6 million hectares of genetically modified crops
were estimated to have been grown in 13 countries
across the world in 2001.
The year 2002 is the last in a three-year UK
programme of farm-scale evaluations (FSEs), set up
to allow independent researchers to study the effect,
if any, that the management practices associated
with genetically modified (GM) herbicide tolerant
crops might have on farmland wildlife, when
compared with those used with non-GM crops.
Three crops are involved: oilseed rape (both spring
and autumn sown); beet (fodder and sugar
varieties); and maize. The project has involved
between 60 and 75 fields of each crop in total. The
sites for the last spring sowing round were
announced in January and March 2002. At the end
of the programme in 2003/04, the results will be
reported, made publicly available and considered by
the Government. The FSE programme includes a
project to monitor gene-flow, including cross¬
pollination. There will be no commercial growing
of GM crops in the UK at least until the FSEs are
completed and the results fully assessed. The results
will be one factor which will be taken into account
when decisions are taken about the commercial
future of GM crop production in the UK.
Food safety
The Food Standards Agency (FSA - see chapter
13) (www.foodstandards.gov.uk), launched in 2000,
aims to ensure that the food consumers eat is safe,
and to offer independent, balanced advice to
government throughout the UK. The Meat
Hygiene Service, an executive agency of the FSA, is
responsible for enforcing legislation on meat
hygiene, inspection, animal welfare at slaughter
and specified risk materials controls in all licensed
abattoirs and cutting premises in Great Britain.

Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA),
administers the regulation of agricultural,
horticultural, forestry, food storage and home
garden pesticides. Its principal functions are to
evaluate and process applications for approval of
pesticide products for use in Great Britain and
provide advice to government on pesticides policy.
The PSD aims:
■ to protect the health of human beings,
creatures and plants;
■ to safeguard the environment; and
■ to ensure that methods of pest control are
safe, efficient and humane by providing
effective controls on the sale, supply and use
of pesticides.
Exports, marketing and promotion
Exports of food, feed and drink were around
£8.6 billion in 2001, compared with £18.4 billion
for imports. EU countries accounted for 60 per
cent of all UK food and drink exports. The main
markets were the Irish Republic (£1.3 billion) and
France (£1.0 billion).
Drinks and cereals are key contributors to exports.
Drinks were up overall by 2.4 per cent in 2001,
with whisky and other spirits being the main
components in the drink category. However,
exports of cereals fell by 20 per cent due to short
supply.
Food from Britain (FEB - www.foodfrombritain.com),
an organisation funded by DEFRA on behalf of
the four agricultural departments and by industry,
provides specialist marketing and international
business development services to the food and
drink industry. It has a network of 11
international offices, each with local food industry
expertise and trade contacts. It also fosters the
development of the speciality food and drink
industry in the UK through a range of tailored
business development and marketing services,
delivered nationally by FEB and locally by regional
and county food groups.
The British Farm Standard red tractor logo,
launched in June 2000, has been designed by the
National Farmers’ Union as an authoritative mark
to identify food that meets high - and
independently verified - production standards
covering food safety, animal welfare and
environmental issues.

Government role
The Department for Environment, Food & Rural
Affairs (DEFRA) has a crucial role in promoting
sustainable development, rural renewal, and
sustainable and competitive food chains, both in
England and internationally. It has responsibility
for agriculture, fisheries, food, animal welfare
issues, environmental protection, and wildlife and
the countryside in general. DEFRA administers
support policies agreed in Brussels which provide
around £3 billion a year to UK agriculture from
the European Union (EU) budget.
The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural
Affairs Department (SEERAD), the National
Assembly for Wales Agriculture Department
(NAWAD), and the Department of Agriculture
and Rural Development in Northern Ireland
(DARD) have varying degrees of responsibility for
agriculture and fisheries affairs. Matters not
devolved or transferred to the devolved
administrations, such as relations with the EU and
other international organisations, remain with the
Government in London. The work of DEFRA’s
nine Regional Service Centres in England and
SEERAD’s eight areas in Scotland relates to
payments under domestic and EU schemes,
licensing and other services for farmers and
growers.
UK agriculture strategy
The Government’s aim is to secure a more
competitive agriculture industry with a stronger
market orientation. In A New Direction for
Agriculture - published in 1999 - it set out its
long-term strategy for the future development of
the industry. The strategy is designed to help
farming become more competitive, diverse,
flexible, responsive to consumer wishes and
environmentally responsible. It aims to deliver
short-term support to those sectors hit hardest by
the continuing farming crisis and longer-term
action to encourage industry restructuring and
adaptation.
Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) (see page
398) are helping to implement the strategy,
investing nearly £3 billion in the UK rural
economy from 2001 to 2006.
The RDPs have been supplemented by other
measures, in particular the Action Plan for
Farming, launched in March 2000 in response to
the crisis in farm incomes in the UK. The plan
provides short-term financial relief and longer-
term support for business restructuring and
development, improved marketing and food chain
co-operation, training and innovation. Although a
number of measures in the Action Plan are UK¬
wide, others are focused on England. The
devolved administrations are developing strategies
to meet priorities in their own areas. The Scottish
Executive published a policy document, A forward
strategy for Scottish agriculture, in June 2001, and
the Welsh Assembly published its strategy for
farming in Wales, Farming for the future, in
November 2001. A Vision for the future of the
Northern Ireland agri-food industry, produced by
the ‘Vision’ group set up by the Minister of
Agriculture and Rural Development, was
published in October 2001.
The milk task force
Set up in 2000 by the then Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food to study and report on the
food chain in the milk and dairy sector, the task
force was asked to identify those areas where
greater efficiencies could be obtained from
production and marketing. It published its report
in January 2002. The report states the need for
greater co-operation and communication between
participants in the dairy supply chain, for example
in market and scientific research, the promotion
of milk and milk products, and the collection and
distribution of milk.

Economic affairs
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
The report also identified a number of areas
where government action could help the industry
become more efficient, for example by simplifying
the administration of milk quotas; CAP reform;
and accurate labelling of dairy products. The
Government published its response to the report
in April 2002, agreeing to almost all the
recommendations.
Agri-industrial materials (AIMS)
The AIMS section in DEFRA is responsible for the
co-ordination and development of plant-based
raw materials. Among other things, it aims to
encourage the use of crops for energy and
industry and stimulate opportunities for
renewable raw materials from environmentally
acceptable crops. It also provides the secretariat
for a new government-industry forum on non¬
food uses of crops.
Policy Commission report on farming and food
In January 2002 the Policy Commission on the
future of farming and food published Farming
and Food, its response to the Government’s
request to investigate how a sustainable,
competitive and diverse farming and food sector
could be created in England. The report makes
over 100 recommendations, including:
■ radical reform of the CAP (see page 399), for
example removing remaining price supports
and associated production controls;
■ targeting public funds towards environmental
and rural development instead of subsidising
production;
■ setting up a permanent Food Chain Centre to
bring together people from each part of the
food chain, in order, for example, to develop
supply chain analyses and identify how
efficiency savings could be made; and
■ the setting up of a new national ‘champion’
body for local food to help the sector expand.
Rural Development Programmes
Although each is different, these programmes have
the general aims of conserving and improving the
environment, and creating productive and
sustainable rural economies. Developing more
diverse and competitive rural industries are also
central themes. Agri-environment schemes (see
below) are key parts of the RDPs, and have seen
substantial expansions in funding. The RDPs will
run from 2001 to 2006.
The England Rural Development Programme
(ERDP) is investing £1.6 billion in rural
development and agri-environment measures. The
Environmentally Sensitive Areas and Countryside
Stewardship Schemes will continue, and four new
schemes opened to applications in October 2000:
the Rural Enterprise Scheme; Processing and
Marketing Grants; the Energy Crops Scheme; and
the Vocational Training Scheme.
The Scottish Rural Development Programme
concentrates on accompanying the CAP and
provides measures which support less favoured
areas (LFAs), through a new area-based scheme,
agri-environment measures, and afforestation.
Around £685 million will be spent over the
lifetime of the programme. In addition, SEERAD
has introduced the Agricultural Business
Development Scheme in the Highlands and
Islands. It will provide assistance to farmers and
crofters for investments in agricultural holdings
and diversification projects.
The Rural Development Plan for Wales involves
investment of around £450 million. The
programme will make funds available for schemes
such as the Tir Gofal (Land in Care) whole farm
agri-environment scheme and the Processing and
Marketing Grant Scheme. It includes support for
hill farming and a range of forestry and farm
woodland initiatives.
The Rural Development Regulation Plan for
Northern Ireland, which is running from 2000 to
2006, is worth £266 million. It includes the new
LEA support scheme and an enhanced agri¬
environment programme. DARD also manages a
Rural Development Programme targeted at the
broader rural community. It is expected to be
worth about £80 million between 2001 and 2007,
and combines several programmes, such as the
Northern Ireland Programme for Building
Sustainable Prosperity.
Agri-environment schemes
Agri-environment schemes form key parts of the
RDPs. They generally make payments for the
management of land to maintain, enhance and
extend wildlife habitats; conserve historic or
geological features; encourage public access; and
restore traditional aspects of the countryside.
Aiming to make conservation part of management
398
Economic affairs
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
practice, they are funded by the EU and the
Government.
The Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) scheme
offers incentives to farmers to adopt agricultural
practices which will safeguard and enhance parts
of the country of particularly high landscape,
wildlife or historic value. Farmers and land
managers enter ten-year agreements to manage
land in an environmentally beneficial way in
return for annual payments. Grants are also
available for capital works, such as hedge laying
and the restoration of traditional farm buildings.
There are now 22 ESAs in England, covering some
10 per cent of agricultural land; six in Wales
(operating under Tir Gofal), ten in Scotland and
five in Northern Ireland. In 2001 £71 million was
spent in the UK under ESAs.
The Hill Farm Allowance (HFA) scheme provides
assistance to hill farmers, who face particular
difficulties in their activities. Those farming in
LFAs are eligible for support under the HFA.
Different schemes operate in each of the
constituent countries of the UK, and provided a
total of £164 million in 2001.
The Countryside Stewardship scheme is the main
scheme for the wider countryside. Farmers and land
managers enter ten-year agreements to manage land
in an environmentally beneficial way in return for
annual payments. Grants are also available towards
capital works, such as hedge laying and planting, or
repairing dry stone walls. Around £49 million was
spent on the scheme in 2001. In Scotland, the Rural
Stewardship scheme has replaced both the ESA and
Countryside Premium schemes as the main scheme
for encouraging environmentally friendly farming
practice.
Organic farming schemes offer payments to
farmers - in the form of financial help during the
conversion process - to aid them in converting to
organic farming and to manage their land in some
additional environmentally beneficial ways. Total
expenditure on these schemes was £35 million in
the UK in 2001.
As at June 2002, there were 699,879 hectares of land
registered as being farmed organically in the UK. It
is estimated that the UK market for organic food is
currently worth around £500 million a year.
The Organic Conversion Information Service,
funded by DEFRA in England, provides free
advice to farmers considering conversion to
organic farming. In Scotland SEERAD funds the
Scottish Agricultural College to operate a
telephone helpline. Standards of organic food
production in the UK are set by the UK Register
of Organic Food Standards.
The Farm Woodland Premium Scheme (partly
funded by the EU) aims to encourage farmers to
convert productive agricultural land to woodlands
by providing payments to help offset agricultural
income foregone. The aim is to enhance the
environment through the planting of trees, improve
the landscape, provide new habitats and increase
biodiversity. Between April 1992 and December
2001 a total of 12,223 applications, covering 84,712
hectares, were approved for planting in the UK.
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
Total UK expenditure under the CAP and on
national grants and subsidies in 2001/02 is
forecast to increase by some £2.2 billion compared
with in 2000/01, to £5.3 billion. Spending in the
UK under the CAP itself is forecast to increase
from £2.7 billion in 2000/01 to £2.9 billion in
2001/02. The increase is mainly attributable to the
impact of foot-and-mouth disease, and in
particular the cost of creating the Livestock
Welfare Disposal Scheme (see page 401).
Expenditure in the cereals sector is expected to
drop significantly, mainly due to a sharp reduction
in intervention buying and reduced expenditure
on export refunds. Conversely, expenditure on the
milk sector is forecast to grow in 2001/02, mainly
due to new expenditure on dairy agrimonetary
compensation (see below).
Expenditure under the CAP arable and livestock
schemes is protected by the Integrated
Administration and Control System (IACS).
Controls to prevent and detect fraud and
irregularity are major features of the system.
These include verification checks of claimed land
and animals, including on-the-spot inspections
and remote sensing by observation satellites.
In 2000 the Government announced a series of
packages of agrimonetary compensation to offset
falls in CAP direct payments to the UK resulting
from changes in the euro/sterling exchange rate. In
2001 a total of £146 million was paid to farmers in
the livestock and dairy sectors, while arable
farmers received £29 million.

Member States not participating in the European
single currency have the opportunity to offer
producers, processors and traders the option of
CAP payments in euro. Following European
Commission approval of its scheme for euro
payments, the Government offered CAP market
support measures, such as export refunds, to
traders and processors from autumn 2001. Further
consideration is being given to extending this
option to direct aid recipients.
EU legislation permits Member States to recycle,
or modulate, a proportion of payments made
direct to farmers under CAP commodity regimes.
Modulation was introduced in 2001 at a flat rate
of 2.5 per cent, to help fund the RDP (see page
398). This means that 2.5 per cent of subsidy
payments will be reallocated to agri-environment
and forestry schemes such as Countryside
Stewardship, Tir Gofal, and ESAs (see page 398).
The Government is matching the sum reallocated
to provide further funding for the RDPs. On an
accruals basis, modulation is estimated to have
reduced arable and livestock subsidies by £44
million in 2001. In order to secure a significant
increase in funds for rural development measures,
all direct payments made under CAP commodity
regimes between 2001 and 2006 will be modulated.
In December 2000 a comprehensive EU proposal
for submission to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO) agriculture negotiations was agreed,
meeting a key UK objective in committing the EU
to constructive negotiations on continuing trade
liberalisation and reform of agricultural policy.
The WTO fourth ministerial conference held in
November 2001 in Doha (see page 366) contained
an important text on agriculture, which commited
WTO members to substantial cuts in market
protection and domestic subsidies, as well as
reductions of export subsidies. It also committed
members to take account of environmental, rural
development and animal welfare concerns, and
negotiate special treatment for developing
countries. The timetable for these measures
requires rules and commitments to be agreed by
March 2003 and for negotiations to be complete
by the beginning of 2005.
EU-wide rules on compulsory beef labelling have
been implemented. These require fresh, chilled
and frozen beef, offered for sale throughout the
supply chain, to be labelled with information on
place of slaughter and cutting/mincing, and, from
1 January 2002, with full country of origin
information (place of birth, raising and
slaughter).
Professional, scientific and technical services
A number of organisations are active in service
provision:
■ in England the Rural Development Service of
DEFRA provides scheme implementation
services for the ERDP, involving professional
and technical work in relation to the
enhancement and protection of the
environment, including biodiversity and rural
development;
■ in Scotland the Scottish Agricultural College
(SAC) provides professional, business,
scientific and technical services in the
agriculture, rural business, food and drink,
and environmental markets;
■ the Department of Agriculture and Rural
Development (DARD) has a similar remit in
Northern Ireland; and
■ Lantra, which is the UK Sector Skills
Development Agency (see page 115) for the
industry, receives government support under
contracts from DEFRA and the Scottish
Executive.

Animal health and welfare
Professional advice and action on the statutory
control of animal health and the welfare of farm
livestock are the responsibility of the State
Veterinary Service. It is supported in England and
Wales by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(VLA - www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla), which
also offers its services to the private sector on a
commercial basis. Similar support is provided in
Scotland by the SAC. In Northern Ireland, DARD’s
Veterinary Service carries out a similar role to the
State Veterinary Service in Great Britain,
supported by its Veterinary Sciences Division.
DEFRA works to ensure priority is given to
maintaining standards of welfare for animals during
Foot-and-mouth disease
A significant outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
occurred in the UK during 2001. By the time that the
disease was confirmed in pigs at an abattoir, and in
cattle on a neighbouring farm, in Brentwood (Essex)
on 20 February 2001, it had already been present in
the country, undetected, for two to three weeks - the
original outbreak was subsequently found to have
been on a farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall,
Northumberland. During this time it had already been
spread widely throughout the country by large-scale
commercial movements of sheep. As a result, cases
occurred in many areas, with particular clusters in
Cumbria, Dumfries and Galloway, Devon and North
Yorkshire, together accounting for over two-thirds of
all confirmed cases.
There were 2,030 confirmed cases in 2001, the last
being confirmed on 30 September. England had 1,730
cases, Scotland 183, Wales 113 and Northern Ireland
four. The disease peaked in March and April and then
trailed off from May onwards.
Over the year a total of 4,082,000 animals, on
10,075 premises, were slaughtered for disease control
purposes. A further 2,046,000 were slaughtered for
welfare reasons (for example because they could not
be moved from waterlogged fields), and another
526,000 under the Light Lambs Scheme.
Foot-and-mouth disease is highly virulent in pigs,
cattle, sheep and other ungulates, spreading rapidly
by contact between animals, transmission via people
or transport, or through the air. Strict controls on the
movement of animals in affected areas were
introduced as was an export ban. Direct
compensation payments for foot-and-mouth disease
totalled £991 million. In addition, a Livestock Welfare
Disposal Scheme was opened as an outlet of last
resort for livestock farmers whose animals faced
welfare difficulties as a result of the movement
restrictions. The scheme provided for the removal and
disposal of such animals, and the Government paid a
total of £224 million.
A report by the National Audit Office (see page 350),
published in June 2002, found that overall the foot-
and-mouth outbreak cost the public sector over
£3 billion and the private sector more than £5 billion.
However, the Treasury has estimated that the net
economic effect of the outbreak was less than
0.2 per cent of GDP (less than £2 billion) because
expenditure was diverted elsewhere in the economy.
Throughout the crisis the export of livestock and
livestock products was banned. Export of pigmeat
from provisionally free areas was resumed at the end
of October 2001. All remaining trade restrictions on
the export of meat, animal products and livestock as
a result of foot-and-mouth disease were lifted on
7 February 2002 by the Standing Veterinary
Committee of the European Commission (beef exports
remain subject to BSE controls).
The UK was declared free of the disease on 14
January 2002.
Three separate, independent, inquiries have reported
on the lessons learned from foot-and-mouth; the
science of disease control and prevention; and the
future of farming and the countryside:
■ Inquiry into the lessons to be learned from the
foot-and-mouth disease outbreak of 2001
(www.fmd-lessonslearned.org.uk), which reported
in July 2002;
■ The Royal Society Inquiry into Infectious Diseases
in Livestock, which also reported in July 2002; and
■ The Policy Commission report on the Future of
Farming and Food, which reported in January
2002 and covered only the situation in England
(see page 398).
In Northern Ireland, the Minister of Agriculture and
Rural Development commissioned The independent
review of foot-and-mouth in Northern Ireland, which
reported in June 2002.

Economic affairs
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
all stages of production. Work currently being
undertaken includes improved welfare conditions
for laying hens; broiler chicken welfare standards; a
new sheep code and negotiations on pig welfare.
Britain enforces controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including checks on
all individual consignments originating from
outside the EU and frequent checks on those from
other EU Member States at destination points.
Measures can be taken to prevent the import of
diseased animals and genetic material from
regions or countries affected by disease. Veterinary
checks also include unannounced periods of
surveillance at ports.
An EC Directive on welfare standards for laying
hens will forbid the installation of conventional
barren battery cages after 1 January 2003, and ban
them from January 2012. Farmers will still be able
to use ‘enriched’ cages which have more space for
each bird and include a nest, perch and litter.
Cattle tracing system (CIS)
The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) was
launched in 1998 in order to record all cattle in
the national herd on a CTS database. Cover has
been extended to over 98 per cent of the
10 million cattle in the Great Britain herd. Work
is in hand to collect the remaining data and apply
checks to help ensure that information held on the
database is accurate and complete. There is a legal
requirement to notify the BCMS of all
movements. In Northern Ireland, all cattle and
cattle movements are recorded on the Animal and
Public Health Information System (APHIS),
which has been approved by the EU since 1999 as
a fully operational database for cattle traceability.
Tuberculosis (TB) in cattle
The Government’s strategy is to find a science-
based policy to control TB in cattle. An annual £5
million research programme has been put in place
to find out how the disease is spread among cattle
and wildlife, including research into improved
diagnostic tests and the development of a TB
vaccine. An on-farm epidemiological survey,
known as TB99, is starting to provide data to help
understand the disease and focus future research.
DEFRA is also investigating the role that husbandry
might play in reducing TB risk. An important
element of the Government’s strategy is the badger
culling trial, designed to establish the contribution
that badgers, as opposed to other factors, make in
spreading TB to cattle. Field operations were
suspended during the foot-and-mouth outbreak,
but restarted in May 2002. It is hoped that the trial
will start yielding results by 2004.
BSE inquiry
In October 2000 the Government published the
report of the public inquiry into the history of
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and
variant CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and how
the diseases were handled by the Government and
others in the period up to 20 March 1996. The
report found that most of those responsible for
responding to the challenge posed by BSE
emerged with credit. However, it identified a
number of aspects of the response that were
inadequate, and set out some fundamental lessons
for public policy and administration in the future.
The Government published its response to the
inquiry report in September 2001. It set out the
progress made since March 1996, for example the
creation of the Food Standards Agency (see page
179) and the opening up of scientific advisory
committees to public scrutiny. The response
concluded that, in general, many of the inquiry’s
findings had already been, or were in the process
of being, addressed.
Fur farming
Under the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000, it
will be illegal to keep animals solely or primarily for
slaughter for their fur from January 2003. The Act
covers England and Wales - similar legislation will
be introduced in Scotland which will take effect at
the same time, and a Bill is being introduced in
Northern Ireland. Since January 2002 farmers who
incur losses as a result of the ban have been able to
submit claims for compensation.
Veterinary medicinal products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate
(www.vmd.gov.uk), an executive agency of DEFRA,
aims to protect public health, animal health and
the environment, and to promote animal welfare,
by ensuring the safety, quality and efficacy of all
aspects of veterinary medicines in the UK. The
Government is advised by the independent
scientific Veterinary Products Committee on
standards to be adopted in the authorisation
procedures for veterinary medicines.
The fishing industry
The UK has a major interest in sea fisheries,
reflecting its geographical position in the North
402
Economic affairs
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
East Atlantic, and is one of the EU’s largest fishing
countries, taking about a fifth of the total catch in
major species. It has an interest in more than
100 ‘total allowable catches’ set by the European
Commission (see page 404). In 2001 total UK fish
supplies amounted to some 718,000 tonnes, with
the UK fishing industry supplying around 67 per
cent by quantity. Household consumption of fish in
the UK in 2000 was estimated at 442,000 tonnes.
Fisheries Departments, in partnership with the
European Commission, are responsible for the
administration of legislation concerning the
fishing industry, including fish and shellfish
farming. The Sea Fish Industry Authority
(www.seafish.co.uk), a largely industry-financed
body, undertakes some R&D, provides training
and promotes the marketing and consumption of
sea fish. There are also two government
laboratories specialising in fisheries research - one
in Aberdeen and one in Lowestoft.
Fish caught and the fishing fleet
UK fishing industry statistics are shown in Table
26.8. Altogether, some 530,000 tonnes of sea fish,
with a total value of £488 million, were landed
into the UK by both the UK fleet and foreign
fishing vessels in 2001. Another major source of
supply is the import into the UK in bulk of fish
caught by other countries.
In 2001 demersal fish (living on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 43 per cent by
weight of total landings by British fishing vessels,
pelagic fish (living in mid water) for 28 per cent
and shellfish for 30 per cent. Landings of all types
of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels into the UK totalled 458,300
tonnes. Haddock and cod represented 14 and 15
per cent of the total value of demersal and pelagic
fish landed respectively. The quayside value of
landings of all sea fish, including shellfish, by
British vessels in 2001 was £424 million.
Catches of crabs, lobsters, scampi and other
shellfish have increased to supply a rising demand.
In 1985 British fishermen landed 75,000 tonnes of
shellfish worth about £65 million. By 2001
landings were 136,200 tonnes worth £167 million.
Some of the species caught by UK fishing vessels
find a more favourable market overseas and these
species are usually exported or landed directly
abroad. In 2001 UK vessels landed directly into
non-UK ports 279,500 tonnes of sea fish with
a value of £151 million.
Britain aims to achieve the EU target for reducing
its fishing fleet by both cutting numbers and
limiting the time some vessels spend at sea. At the
end of 2001 the UK fleet consisted of 7,721
vessels, including 416 greater than 24.39 m. There
are an estimated 14,600 professional fishermen
in Britain (see Table 26.8).
A national licensing scheme now limits the
shellfish fleet to 3,000, mainly small boats.
Minimum landing sizes for shellfish to be
introduced across the EU in 2002, and which
make it illegal to land a lobster smaller than
87 mm, already apply in the UK.
There is a substantial fish processing industry of
around 540 businesses which employ some 22,000
people. At the retail level, there are approximately
1,400 fishmongers. An increasing proportion of all
fish (69 per cent by volume and 67 per cent by
value, excluding canned produce) is sold through
supermarkets. A small proportion of the catch is
used to make fish oils and animal feeds.
Aquaculture
Fish farming is a significant industry in remote
rural areas on the west coast of Scotland, as well as
in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles,
producing primarily salmon. In addition, species
such as cod, halibut and turbot are entering
commercial production. Trout is also farmed as a
freshwater species, and various shellfish species are
produced all round the coast of the UK. In 2000,
total value at first sale was estimated at over £350
million, and the industry employed over 3,000
people. Production in 2000 was 130,000 tonnes of
salmon, 15,000 tonnes of rainbow trout, and some
14,000 tonnes of mussels, with some farming of
oysters, clams and cockles.
Aquaculture is subject to a comprehensive
regulatory regime covering such issues as fish and
shellfish health and disease control, control of
discharges into the marine and riverine
environment, site leasing and planning, and the
use of medicines and other chemicals.
Common Fisheries Policy
Management of the UK’s sea fisheries is subject to
the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CEP). Under
the CEP, UK vessels have exclusive rights to fish

within 6 miles of the UK coast. Certain other EU
Member States have historic rights in UK waters
between 6 and 12 miles. UK vessels have similar
rights in other Member States’ 6 to 12 mile belts.
Between 12 and 200 miles, EU vessels may fish
wherever they have access rights. Non-EU
countries’ vessels may fish in these waters if they
negotiate reciprocal fisheries agreements with the
EU. UK fishery limits extend to 200 miles or the
median line (broadly halfway between the UK
coast and the opposing coastline of another
coastal state), measured from baselines on or near
the coast of the UK.
The primary aim of the CEP is to ensure rational
and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks through
conservation and management policies designed to
protect resources and reflect the needs of the
fishing industry. The CEP aims to improve the
balance between catching capacity and available
resources by regulating the amount of fishing and
the quantities of fish caught, through a system of
Total Allowable Catches (TACs) based on scientific
advice. These TACs are then distributed to Member
States according to the system of relative stability.
This means that national quota allocations are
based each year on a fixed proportion reflecting,
among other things, historical fishing patterns.
Catch limits are complemented by a series of
technical conservation measures intended to
achieve more selective fishing, for example by
setting rules on minimum landing sizes, minimum
mesh sizes and gear design, as well as defining areas
of seasonal closures, methods of fishing and target
species. Opportunities to fish in third country
waters are also secured through the CEP.
Stock conservation plans are in place to help
conserve stocks of cod and hake which are
currently below safe biological limits. All EU
Member States with relevant fishing interests
share the burden of reduced fishing effort and
increased protection for the stocks.
A thorough review of the CEP is occurring during
2002. It is focusing on the decommissioning of
some fishing boats and other measures to help
conserve fish stocks.
Fish quotas
EU fisheries ministers set TACs for a wide range of
stocks in December each year. The TACs are then
divided into Member States’ quotas. The UK’s
separate quotas are then allocated between various
groups within the UK fishing fleet. The size and
structure of the fishing fleet is governed by a
licensing system (see below), and vessels work to
an agreed quota of allowable catches, based on
scientific assessment of fish stocks. Some allocations
are managed by fishermen’s organisations, known as
Producer Organisations. Elowever, overall
responsibility for managing the UK’s quotas rests
with DEFRA and the other Fisheries Departments
in the UK. Quotas, technical conservation and other
management measures aim to allow balanced fish
populations to renew themselves.
The 2002 quotas were decided at the EU Fisheries
Council in December 2001. After pressure from
the UK, an agreement was reached which
attempted to balance fish stock conservation with
fishing jobs, taking into account scientific advice.
Key elements of the revised deal included
404
Economic affairs
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
increases in the Irish Sea cod quota (of almost
50 per cent), in the proposed quota for prawn
catches in the North Sea, and in monkfish quotas.
Restrictive licensing system for fishing vessels
This system, also operated by the fisheries
departments, controls the activities of the UK
fishing fleet in accordance with the EU and UK
aims on fleet and catch management. All engine-
powered UK-registered or owned vessels which
fish for profit for sea fish (other than salmon,
migratory trout and eels) are required to hold
a licence issued by one of the UK fisheries
departments. In order to constrain the size of the
fleet, additional licences are not granted. Licences
must therefore be transferred or aggregated in
accordance with detailed rules.
Sea Fisheries Committees
There are 12 Sea Fisheries Committees (SFCs)
which regulate local sea fisheries around virtually
the entire coast of England and Wales out to
6 miles. SFCs were established in the 19th century
and are empowered to make bye-laws for the
management and conservation of their districts’
fisheries. In Scotland, inshore fisheries are
regulated by measures under Scottish legislation,
and local management bodies may also be
established in statute to regulate specific shellfish
fisheries.
Salmon and freshwater fisheries
The Environment Agency produces an annual
assessment of salmon stocks and fisheries in
England and Wales. The 2001 report found that the
declared catch of wild salmon was down slightly
from 2000 levels at 153 tonnes. The angling catch
was affected by foot-and-mouth disease, when
access to many rural areas was limited, and was 17
per cent below the 2000 figure.
Following the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Review Group report, the Government increased
fisheries grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency
by £3 million a year from April 2002. The Agency
will be able to increase its work on conserving and
restoring salmon stocks, and improving controls
over unauthorised transfers of coarse and non¬
native fish.

bark. Around 85 per cent of this has to be
imported at a cost of about £8 billion - the fourth
largest single import commodity. The British
timber industry, using wood from sustainable
forests, has seen considerable investment in recent
years. The volume of wood supplied from Britain’s
forests each year has more than doubled from
4 million cubic metres over bark standing in the
1970s to around 10 million in 2001. This is
forecast to increase to over 15 million cubic
metres by 2020, offering scope for further
substantial investment in the processing industry.
Very few woodlands in Britain are planted without
some form of grant. The Forestry Commission
offers grants through the Woodland Grant Scheme
(WGS), and operates the Farm Woodland Premium
Scheme (FWPS) on behalf of DEFRA and
SEERAD (see page 399). In Wales, there is a joint
application form for farmers who enter land into
the WGS and FWPS, which is administered by the
Welsh Assembly Government. Both schemes aim
to encourage the creation of new woodlands and
the management of existing woodlands by
providing money towards the cost of the work
involved, although the FWPS can only be given
where the WGS is also payable. Expenditure of
£139 million between 2001 and 2006 on the WGS
is provided for under the England Rural
Development Programme.
The Forestry Commission and forestry
policy
The Forestry Commission (www.forestry.gov.uk) is
the government department responsible for
forestry throughout Great Britain. It is the UK’s
largest land manager and biggest single provider
of countryside recreation. It has a Board of
Commissioners with duties and powers prescribed
by statute which, following devolution, they
exercise separately in England, Scotland and
Wales, under the directions of the relevant
commission. DEFRA ministers direct the
Commissioners’ activities in England and, after
consultation with Scottish ministers, the Welsh
Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland
Assembly, represent the UK’s forestry interests
within the EU and in the wider world. The
Commission is responsible for advising ministers
and for implementing each country’s separate and
distinct forestry policy.
The Commission’s objectives are to:
■ protect Britain’s forests and woodlands;
■ expand Britain’s forest area;
■ enhance the economic value of forest
resources;
■ conserve and improve the biodiversity,
landscape and cultural heritage of forests and
woodlands;
■ develop opportunities for woodland
recreation; and
■ increase public understanding and
community participation in forestry.

26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
The Forestry Commission has two executive
agencies. Forest Enterprise is responsible for
managing the forests and woodlands owned by
the nation. It has a total forest estate of 794,000
hectares of woodland with complementary land
for grazing, conservation and recreation, and
employs around 2,300 staff. A further 3,000
people work in the forests as contractors or are
employed by the timber purchasers.
In 2001/02, 1,503 hectares of land were acquired
by the Commission. It disposed of 3,090 hectares.
Forest Research aims to deliver high-quality
scientific research and surveys, to inform the
development of forestry policies and practices,
and to promote high standards of sustainable
forest management. It is the principal organisation
in the UK engaged in forestry and tree-related
research.
The Commission is undertaking a review of
forestry administration in England, Scotland and
Wales, examining options for further
decentralisation of forestry policy and
management.
Forestry initiatives
The new National Forest (www.nationalforest.org)
covers 520 sq km of the English Midlands,
spanning parts of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and
Staffordshire and incorporating the towns of
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Burton upon Trent, Coalville
and Swadlincote. The original 6 per cent wooded
cover in the area has been doubled, resulting in
some 470 new forest sites covering 3,100 hectares.
A total of 4 million trees have been planted so far,
and 30 million will eventually be planted (60 per
cent broadleaf and 40 per cent conifer). The aim is
to increase woodland cover to about one-third of
the area, with a third remaining in agriculture and
the remainder comprising the towns and villages.
For Community Forests, see page 271.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
The Forest Service (www.forestserviceni.gov.uk) is
an executive agency within DARD and promotes
the interests of forestry through sustainable
management and expansion of state-owned
forests. It encourages private forestry through
grant aid for planting.
The Service offered over 400,000 cubic metres of
timber for sale in 2001/02, with receipts of
£4.6 million. Forestry and timber processing
employ about 1,050 people. It is estimated that
some 2 million people visited Northern Irish
forests during the year.

27 Manufacturing and construction
Introduction 408 Construction 429
Manufacturing 408
Introduction
Manufacturing continues to play an important but
declining role in the UK economy, accounting for
17.5 per cent of gross value added (GVA)1 (at
current basic prices) in 2001 and for 14.5 per cent
of employment (over 3.7 million people) in
December 2001. Service industries now generate
over four times as much gross domestic product
(GDP) and almost five-and-a-half times as much
employment.
The regions with the highest proportion of
employees in manufacturing are the East Midlands
and West Midlands (both 21 per cent). London
has the lowest at just 7 per cent. Overseas
companies have a strong presence.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a decline in
manufacturing output, but it began to rise again in
1993. By 2000, the volume of output was over
13 per cent above the level in 1992, but then fell by
2.3 per cent in 2001. Some industries, notably
electrical and optical equipment - where output
was up by 68 per cent between 1992 and 2001 -
and chemicals and man-made fibres (up 31 per
cent), have achieved substantial growth following
the recession. However, output of some other
sectors was below the 1992 level - textiles and
1 Gross value added represents the difference between the value of
the output of goods and services produced by a company and the
value of the goods and services or raw materials used up in the
production of the output.

down.
Relative sizes of enterprises are shown in Tables
27.2 and 27.3, with output and investment,
industrial production and employment in Tables
27.4 to 27.6.
The construction industry contributed 5.4 per
cent of GVA in 2001. Following a period of
marked decline as recession affected the industry
in the early 1990s, output picked up and was
18 per cent higher in 2001 than in 1993, and above
pre-recession levels for the first time. Output grew
strongly, by 3.6 per cent, in 2001.

Paper, printing and publishing
In 2000 the UK pulp, paper and paper products
industry had turnover of £11.8 billion and
employed 98,000 people; the publishing and
printing industry had turnover of £33.3 billion
and employed 376,000 people. Total industry
output fell by 1.7 per cent in 2001 and was less
than 5 per cent higher than in 1992.
Paper
The paper and board sector is dominated by a
small number of medium and large firms - 87
pulp, paper and board mills, employing 17,400
people in 2001, concentrated in north Kent,
Lancashire, the West Country and central
Scotland. UK production in 2001 was 6.2 million
tonnes, 25 per cent higher than in 1991, with
1.2 million tonnes exported, 73 per cent to the EU.
Imports amounted to 7.6 million tonnes,
84 per cent of which came from the EU and
Norway. Hundreds of different grades of paper
and board are converted into a wide range of
products for use in industry, commerce,
education, communications and distribution, and
in the home. A host of speciality papers are
produced for industrial use, for example filters
and papers, which are subsequently coated,
sensitised or laminated. There has been a
significant trend towards waste-based packaging
grades. Recycled paper made up 63.5 per cent of

Printing and publishing
Unlike the paper and board sector, the printing
industry in particular has many small businesses -
only about 650 firms employ more than 50 people
and approximately 90 per cent of firms employ
fewer than 20 employees. Much publishing and
printing employment and output is carried out in
firms based in south-east England. Mergers have
led to the formation of large groups in newspaper,
magazine and book publishing. The British book¬
publishing industry is a major exporter, with
exports of £1.2 billion in 2001, 2.1 per cent higher
than in 2000 (see also Table 27.8). The United
States maintained its place as the largest export
market, followed by the Irish Republic. There were
119,000 new titles (including new editions) issued
in 2001, a 2.2 per cent increase on 2000.
The UK printing industry had an annual turnover
of £13 billion, employing 170,000 people in 2001.
It has undergone significant technological change
recently, with digital technology enabling much
greater automation and standardisation. With
exports of £2.0 billion and imports of £1.6 billion,
the printing industry had a £0.4 billion trade
surplus in 2001. Exports are dominated by books
and periodicals (see Table 27.9).
Food, drink and tobacco
In 2000 there were nearly 7,900 enterprises
employing 527,000 people in the UK food and
drink manufacturing and processing industry,
with a combined turnover of £65.7 billion. The
industry has accounted for a growing proportion
of total domestic food supply since the 1940s. The
largest concentration of enterprises is in the
production of bread, cakes and fresh pastry goods,
followed by those engaged in processing and
preserving meat and meat products. 1 he greatest
number of food and drink manufacturing jobs
and facilities are in the South East and London
(20.2 per cent of the total for Great Britain),
Scotland (13.6 per cent) and the North West
(11.1 per cent). Spirits production gives Scotland
the highest concentration of employment in the
alcoholic and soft drinks manufacturing industry,
with a significant proportion of jobs in its
economically deprived rural areas. The biggest
food and drinks export category in 2001 was
alcoholic drinks, with exports of £3.1 billion,
accounting for 36 per cent of the total value of
food and drink sales overseas. The largest food¬
exporting sector was biscuits and confectionery,
worth £681 million. As well as the leading
companies involved in food and drink
manufacturing and processing, there are many
specialist small and medium-sized firms,
supplying high-quality ‘niche’ products, often to
small retail outlets, such as delicatessens.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience foods, such
as frozen potato products and ready-prepared
meals, fish and shellfish dishes, salads and pasta,
together with yogurts, desserts and instant snacks,
have formed some of the fastest-growing sectors
of the food market in recent years. The trend
towards snacking — eating less, more often - and
higher consumption outside the home means that
snacks are filling the gap left by the decline of the
traditional family meal. Many new low-fat and fat-
free items have been introduced, ranging from
dairy products to complete prepared meals.
Organic foods have also become more widely
available. There has been a substantial rise in sales
of vegetarian foods (both natural vegetable dishes
and vegetable-based substitutes of meat products,
where soya plays a big role). For genetically
modified foods, see chapter 26.
Bread and morning goods
The UK market is worth over £3 billion each year
and is one of the largest sectors in the food
industry - total volume is about 2.9 million
tonnes, equivalent to over 9 million large loaves

British bakers have developed a bread containing a
range of nutrients more usually found in sprouts
and broccoli. This uses a form of vitamin C which
survives the cooking process in a form the body can
absorb - in traditional baking vitamin C is used as a
raising agent, but its benefits are lost. Each slice of
bread contains nearly one-fifth of the recommended
daily allowance of vitamin C for children. The
range of sliced white bread and white rolls also
contains vitamins D and B complex. The product
was launched in May 2002.
every day. The larger baking companies produce
81 per cent of bread sold in the UK by volume,
with in-store bakeries (ISBs) within supermarkets
accounting for about 15 per cent and high street
retail bakers the remaining 4 per cent. Some ISBs
use the bake-off method, where dough is part-
baked and frozen, to be baked off later at the retail
outlet - this is particularly popular at smaller
supermarkets. The two largest bread producers are
Allied Bakeries and British Bakeries, with 25
manufacturing sites in mainland Britain and three
in Northern Ireland between them. By volume,
76 per cent of bread sold in the UK is white,
16 per cent wholemeal and 8 per cent brown.
Morning goods, or bakery snacks (including rolls
and baps, scones, teacakes and croissants), account
for 25 per cent by volume of the bread market.
Sandwiches are the UK’s most frequently consumed
snack food and have a wider range of distribution
outlets than other bread sales. The sandwich
market was valued at £3.5 billion in 2001.
Dairy products
Around 24 per cent of household liquid milk
supplies in Great Britain are distributed through a
doorstep delivery system employing about 11,100
people, although the proportion is declining as
supermarkets take a greater share of milk sales.
Household consumption of liquid milk per head -
2.1 litres (3.8 pints) a week - is among the highest
in the world. Consumption of semi-skimmed
(containing between 1.5 and 1.8 per cent fat) and
skimmed milk (not more than 0.5 per cent fat)
continues to grow, accounting for 68 per cent of
total milk sales in 2001. The British dairy industry
accounted for 64 per cent of butter and 65 per
cent of cheese supplies to the domestic market in
2001, and achieves significant sales overseas. Over
400 different types of cheese are produced in the
UK. Cheddar accounts for over 55 per cent of all
household cheese purchases; other well-known
varieties include Caerphilly, Cheshire, Double
Gloucester, Red Leicester, Stilton and Wensleydale.
Beer
Beer (including lager) production in 2001, at
56.8 million hectolitres, was 2.8 per cent higher
than in 2000; beer released for home consumption
amounted to 58.2 million hectolitres. Exports
were valued at £225 million in 2001, amounting to
3.2 million hectolitres. The brewing industry
currently has six major national brewery groups,
44 regional/family brewers and about
400 micro-breweries. Throughout the world
brewers use British malt, made almost entirely
from home-grown barley. Beer consumption per
head in the UK in 2001 was 171 pints, equivalent
to 28 million pints sold every day or 10 billion
pints a year. Lager accounted for 66 per cent of all
sales, up from 64 per cent in 2000, but there is still
a strong demand for the vast range of traditional
cask-conditioned and brewery-conditioned ales
and stouts.
Spirits
Home-produced whisky production in 2001 was
3.69 million hectolitres, a 2 per cent increase on
2000. The Scotch whisky industry is one of the
UK’s top export earners, with overseas sales worth

£2.3 billion in 2001, 6.4 per cent higher than in
2000. By volume, about 90 per cent of sales was
exported to over 200 countries worldwide - the
top ten overseas markets are shown in Table 27.12.
Some 10,700 people work in the Scotch whisky
industry and a further 30,000 are employed in
associated sectors, for instance supplying
ingredients and materials. There are around 85
malt whisky distilleries in Scotland, the majority
in Speyside and in the Highlands, with a further
seven on Islay and three in the Lowlands. In
addition, seven distilleries produce grain whisky -
most Scotch consumed is a blend of malt and
grain. Some of the best-known single malt Scotch
whiskies include Glenfiddich, Glen Grant,
Glenmorangie and Macallan. Gin and vodka
production is another important part of the
spirits industry, with 64 per cent of UK-produced
gin and 28 per cent of vodka exported, worth
£204 million in 2001.
Wine, cider and perry
In a highly competitive market, English and Welsh
wines have a distinctive local identity. There are
nearly 400 commercial vineyards, covering
approximately 800 hectares of land, nearly all in
the southern half of the two countries. Most of
the production is white wine, mainly from
Germanic vines. Quality continues to improve
with a combination of more experienced
winemakers, modern technologies and better
winemaking equipment. Cider and perry are made
predominantly in the west and south-west of
England, notably in Herefordshire, Somerset and
Devon. Bulmers, one of the big two UK
producers, is the world’s largest cider maker.
Soft drinks
The soft drinks industry produces still and
carbonated drinks, dilutable drinks, fruit juices
and juice drinks, and bottled waters. The UK
market was worth £8.6 billion by retail value in
2001, with Coca-Cola Enterprises the largest
supplier. Soft drinks are one of the fastest-growing
sectors of the grocery trade, responsible for
introducing many innovative products each year.
In 2001 UK consumption of soft drinks was
12.4 billion litres, compared with 8.3 billion litres
in 1989, an increase of almost one-half. Sales of
energy and sports drinks reached £750 million in
2001, a fourfold increase since 1996. Bottled
waters - natural mineral waters, spring and table
waters - experienced the second fastest growth
within the sector between 1996 and 2001,
averaging increases in volume of 12 per cent a
year, and with sales of £900 million in the UK in
2001. Sales of carbonates registered the smallest
increase in sales in 2001, with 2 per cent growth.
Tobacco
In 2001 around 7,100 people in the UK were
directly employed in tobacco manufacturing, with
a further 125,000 jobs indirectly supported in
supplier industries and through forward linkages
into distribution and retailing. Three major
manufacturers supply the market, including
British American Tobacco, the second largest
tobacco company in the world. UK consumers

spent £14.7 billion on tobacco products in 2001,
of which £7.7 billion was accounted for by excise
duty. The figures in Table 27.13 show a substantial
decline in sales, although in recent years there has
been a rapid growth in smuggling and legitimate
cross-border shopping. Official estimates of
revenue lost through tobacco smuggling in
2000/01 were £3.5 billion, compared with
£2.9 billion in 1999/2000. The industry achieved
significant export sales - £931 million in 2001 -
with Europe, the Middle East and Africa
important overseas markets. The UK tobacco
industry remains one of the top ten balance-of-
payments earners in the UK economy.

and 17 per cent in medical, precision and optical
equipment and watches. Total output had been
rising sharply up to 2000, although it fell by over
8 per cent in 2001; nevertheless it was 68 per cent
higher than in 1992. Production of office
machinery and computers rose by 281 per cent
between 1992 and 2001, while radio, TV and
communications equipment output was up by
91 per cent. However, output of medical and
optical instruments was only 10 per cent higher,
while that of electrical machinery and apparatus
rose by just 2 per cent.
Southern England provides a substantial
proportion of employment (especially sales and
administrative jobs) in these sectors, with
Scotland and Wales having been important areas
for inward investors. Scotland’s electronics
industry (‘Silicon Glen’ - in effect all of central
Scotland) directly employed about 41,600 people
in 1999. In 2001 electrical and instrument
engineering accounted for exports worth
£10.8 billion, 58.4 per cent of Scotland’s
manufactured exports, up from 56.4 per cent
in 2000.
Many of the world’s leading overseas-based
multinational electronics firms have substantial
manufacturing investment in the UK. The main
electronic consumer goods produced are
television sets, with UK production concentrated
in the high-value market and with an increasing
proportion of widescreen and digital sets. High-
fidelity audio and video equipment is also
produced.
The computer industry in the UK produces an
extensive range of systems for all uses (for
information on software, see page 472). There are
several multinational computer manufacturers in
the UK; others have concentrated on developing
new lines for specialised markets.
415
Economic affairs
27 Manufacturing and construction
A broad range of other electrical machinery and
apparatus is produced in the UK by both British
and foreign companies, covering power plant,
electric motors, generators, transformers,
switchgear, insulated wire and cable (including
optical fibre cables for telecommunications), and
lighting equipment.
Recent years have seen the development of
electronic service providers - contract electronic
manufacturers - manufacturing and assembling
products to the specification of other companies.
This global trend has encouraged some
multinational producers to move away from
manufacture to become designers, developers,
marketers or sellers of their products; the UK is
one of the leading locations in Europe for this
type of business.
Communications equipment
Domestic telecommunications equipment
manufacturers have invested heavily in facilities to
meet rapidly increasing demand for
telecommunications services (see chapter 17). The
main products are switching and transmission
equipment, telephones and terminals.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification data-
carrying cables.
The UK is among Europe’s leading markets and
manufacturing bases for mobile communications
(see page 242) and many producers have UK
production or design centres. Fibre optics are a
UK invention. There has been a general downturn
in the telecommunications sector due mainly to
the downturn in the world economy. This has led
to rationalisation and job losses across the sector.
Another sector of the industry manufactures radio
communications equipment, radar, radio and
sonar navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and signalling
apparatus, public broadcasting equipment and
other capital goods. Radar was invented in the UK
and British firms are still in the forefront of
technological advances. Solid-state secondary
surveillance radar is being supplied to numerous
overseas civil aviation operators.
Medical electronics
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in the UK stems from its
comprehensive healthcare system and extensive
clinical research and testing facilities in the
chemical, biological, physical and molecular
sciences. British scientists and engineers have
made important contributions to basic R&D in
endoscopy, computerised tomography scanning,
magnetic resonance imaging (pioneered in the
UK), ultrasonic imaging, CADiagnosis and renal
analysis. Firms in the UK medical electronics
sector continue their tradition of developing and
manufacturing a range of medical equipment for
domestic and overseas health sectors.
Instrumentation and control
The instrumentation and control sector covers the
design, development and manufacture of scientific
and industrial equipment and systems for analysis,
measurement, testing and control. The
instrumentation sector is generally broken down
into six specific categories: navigation and
surveying; electronic and electrical testing;
laboratory/analytical; process monitoring and
control; automotive; and drafting and
dimensional measurement. The UK
instrumentation and control sector has an
estimated annual output of £5 billion, with a trade
surplus of £0.8 billion in 2001. The sector is
diverse, with over 3,300 enterprises, employing
91,000 people in 2000.
Chemicals and chemical products
The chemicals industry is one of the primary
manufacturing sectors in the UK. Over 37 per cent
of turnover in 2000 was in the manufacture of
basic chemicals, with a further 26 per cent in
pharmaceutical products. Sales for a range of
chemical products are shown in Table 27.17.
The sector underpins much of the rest of UK
manufacturing industry, with chemicals being
essential supplies for most other industrial
processes. Growth in output was strong in 2001 —
up 3.9 per cent - and was over 31 per cent higher
than in 1992.
It is a diverse industry, with important
representation in all principal chemical sectors -
ranging from bulk petrochemicals to low-volume,
high-value specialised organics. It includes key
industrial materials, such as plastics and synthetic
rubber, and other products such as man-made
fibres, soap and detergents, cosmetics, adhesives,
dyes and inks, and intermediate products for the
pharmaceutical and a range of other downstream
industries.

Bulk chemicals
The UK’s North Sea oil and gas provide accessible
feedstocks for its large organics sector, including
such products as ethylene, propylene, benzene and
paraxylene. These provide the basic building blocks
for the manufacture of many chemical products,
including plastics whose strength, durability and
light weight have led to their increasing use in
transport and packaging applications; and
synthetic fibres such as nylon and polyester
used in textiles, clothing and home
furnishings.

27 Manufacturing and construction
There is substantial inorganics production,
including sulphuric acid (947,000 tonnes in 2001),
chlorine and caustic soda, based on minerals such
as salt, sulphur, and phosphate ores, or reaction
between gases. These also serve many other
chemical processes.
Formulated products
The UK is strong in formulated consumer
products, such as decorative paint, home laundry
and cleaning products and personal care items like
toothpaste, shampoos and skincare products, as
well as a wide range of industrial speciality
products such as adhesives, inks and lubricants.
Fine chemicals
Fine chemicals meet specific needs through highly
sophisticated product and process development.
Active ingredients for the pharmaceutical and
agrochemical sectors are at the forefront of this
kind of innovation. In recent years, the application
of chirality2 in synthesis has allowed firms to make
drugs and agrochemicals more closely tailored to
specific targets. Leading-edge research by
international pharmaceutical and agrochemical
companies in the UK is supported both by a
strong academic research capability and a network
of specialist manufacturers of ‘fine' chemicals. The
latter specialise in the highly skilled processes
needed to produce commercial quantities of the
complex molecules identified by the
pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies
research.
Pharmaceuticals
The UK pharmaceuticals industry, largely based in
the South East, North West and North East of
England, is the world’s third largest exporter of
medicines, accounting for 12 per cent of the
developed world’s export market. Research-driven,
it is one of the UK’s most dynamic industries, of
key importance to the economy. Exports in 2001
were worth £10 billion, contributing to a trade
surplus of around £2.4 billion. The principal
overseas markets are Western Europe, North
America and Japan. Recently, the largest growth
has been in medicines that act on the
cardiovascular system, followed by central nervous
system and alimentary tract remedies. The total
UK market for pharmaceuticals was estimated to
be worth about £9.3 billion in 2001 (of which
2 Chiral compounds are mirror images of each other, analogous to
left- and right-handed forms. One form may be more effective, or
safer, than the other.
prescription medicines accounted for
approximately 80 per cent).
Around 355 pharmaceutical companies operate in
the UK, with indigenous and US-owned
multinationals dominating production.
GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca (UK-Swedish)
are the two largest UK-based companies (see
page 343).
Some 65,000 people are directly employed in the
UK pharmaceutical industry, with another
250,000 in related sectors. About a third are
engaged in R8cD, expenditure on which grew by
162 per cent between 1990 and 2000. The industry
invested £3.0 billion in UK-based R8cD in 2001,
around 25 per cent of all UK manufacturing
industry R8cD. AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline
are the UK’s top two companies in terms of R8cD
expenditure, with the US companies Pfizer, Merck
and Eli Lilly, and the Swiss company Novartis also
significant investors.
Major developments pioneered in the UK include
semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins,
both powerful antibiotics, and new treatments for
ulcers, asthma, arthritis, meningitis C, cancer,
migraine, HIV/AIDS, coronary heart disease,
hypertension, fungal infections, erectile
dysfunction and schizophrenia. The UK
pharmaceuticals industry is second only to the
US in the discovery and development of leading
medicines, including ten of the world s current
top 50 best-selling drugs. There are about 20 new
pharmaceutical products launched on the market
each year. Among the best-selling drugs produced
by the two largest UK-owned companies are:
■ GlaxoSmithKline - Seroxat/Paxil
(depression), Augmentin (bacterial), Avandia
(diabetes), Flixotide/Flovent and Seretide/
Advair (asthma); and
■ AstraZeneca - Losec/Prilosec (gastric/anti-
ulcer), Nexium (successor to Losec), Zestril
(hypertension), Seroquel (schizophrenia/
Parkinson’s disease/Alzheimer’s disease) and
Zoladex (cancer).
The most significant UK manufacturing
investment in 2001 was AstraZeneca s
announcement of a planned US$109 million
(over £70 million) expansion at Alderley Park/
Macclesfield (Cheshire).

27 Manufacturing and construction
Biotechnology
The UK has the leading biotechnology sector in
Europe, with over 550 companies (approximately
29 per cent of the number in Europe), employing
over 40,000 people. UK companies have a
particular strength in healthcare which includes
some of the largest biotechnology companies in
Europe, such as Celltech, Cambridge Antibody
Technology and Oxford GlycoSciences. Of the
potential new drugs under development in
Europe, around 50 per cent are from publicly
quoted UK companies. Companies are clustered
particularly around Cambridge, Oxford, London,
the South East and Scotland. The industry benefits
strongly from the UK’s science base. Bioscience
research in UK universities is of world renown,
and the major research laboratories of leading
pharmaceutical multinationals are based here. The
UK has a number of world-class research
institutes, such as the Sanger Centre in
Cambridge, which played an important part in the
Human Genome project (see page 372), the
Laboratory of Molecular Biology (also in
Cambridge) and the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh.
Metals and fabricated metal products
The Industrial Revolution in the UK was based to
a considerable extent on the manufacture of iron
and steel and heavy machinery - these sectors
remain important parts of the industrial economy.
However, output fell by 3.0 per cent in 2001 to its
lowest level since 1983.
The major areas of steel production are
concentrated in south Wales and northern
England, with substantial processing in the
Midlands and Yorkshire. Major restructuring in
the steel industry took place during the 1980s and
1990s. Steel is the most recycled material in the
world - more than 80 per cent of scrap steel
generated in the UK is recycled.
Total UK crude steel production was 13.5 million
tonnes in 2001, 11 per cent down on 2000 and the
fourth year of decline after five successive years of
growth. British producers delivered 13.0 million
tonnes of finished steel in 2001. The main UK
markets for steel are in the engineering
(24 per cent), construction (22 per cent),
automotive (17 per cent) and metal goods
industries (14 per cent). The UK steel industry
exported 48 per cent of its output in 2001, 71 per
cent of which went to other EU countries, with
Germany the biggest market. Annual steel
industry exports peaked in 1997 at 9.1 million
tonnes before falling in successive years to 6.5
million tonnes in 2001, valued at £2.4 billion.
Corus, Europe’s second largest steelmaker and the
sixth biggest in the world, employed 26,700 people
in the UK at the end of December 2001 and
produced 83 per cent of the UK’s total crude steel.
Its output is based on strip mill products, plate,
sections, specialist engineering steels, bars, wire
rods and tubes.
Products manufactured by other UK steel
companies include reinforcing bars for the
construction industry, wire rods, hot rolled bars,
bright bars, tubes, and wire and wire products.
Production of special steels is centred on the
Sheffield area and includes stainless and alloy
special steels for the aerospace and offshore oil
and gas industries.
Steel has had a notable success in the UK
construction industry, with its market share in
buildings of two or more storeys more than
doubling from 30 per cent in the early 1980s to
more than 70 per cent today. It has 90 per cent of
the single storey market. Total iron and steel sales
to the construction sector are £2.3 billion a year
and consumption of constructional steelwork
1.1 million tonnes.

27 Manufacturing and construction
Several multinational companies have plants in
Britain producing non-ferrous metals from both
primary and recycled raw materials. The
aluminium industry supplies customers in the
aerospace, transport, automotive and construction
industries. Other important non-ferrous metal
sectors are copper and copper alloys, used for
electrical wire and cables, power generation and
electrical and electronic connectors, automotive
components, plumbing and building products,
and components for industrial plant and
machinery; lead for lead acid batteries and
roofing; zinc for galvanising to protect steel;
nickel, used principally as an alloying element to
make stainless steel and high temperature turbine
alloys; and titanium for high-strength, low-weight
aerospace applications.
Fabricated metal products include those made by
forging, casting, pressing, stamping and roll
forming of a wide variety of metals. They are used
in many different applications from automotive,
aerospace and railway components to
construction, domestic appliances, packaging and
general hardware. Many of these products are
subjected to surface engineering processes, which
improve their working performance. These
include electroplating, galvanising, anodising and
heat treatment.
Transport equipment
Motor vehicles
New UK car registrations rose by 10.7 per cent in
2001 to 2.46 million, beating the previous record
set in 1989 by 6.9 per cent. The home-produced
share of the UK market in 2001 was 24.2 per cent,
compared with 28.3 per cent in 2000. By customer
type, the private sector took 49 per cent of the total,
the fleet car sector 42 per cent and the business
sector 9 per cent. Commercial vehicle registrations,
at 313,000, were 5.2 per cent higher than in 2000
and the third highest figure on record.
Two long-standing UK motor vehicle plants ceased
production during 2002. The last car manufactured
at Vauxhall's Luton plant rolled off the production
line in March, 95 years and 10 million cars after the
first vehicle built there. Production of cars and vans
ended at Ford's Dagenham plant in February after
more than 70 years. Almost 11 million cars, trucks
and tractors had been built there. However, Ford is
investing heavily in its diesel engine plant at
Dagenham to enhance its status as Europe's centre
for excellence.
Although car production, at 1.5 million, was
9.1 per cent lower than in 2000, it has risen by
almost 21 per cent since 1991. Traditional home
markets no longer dominate production by
vehicle manufacturers - exports accounted for 60
per cent of production in 2001 compared with
only 31 per cent in 1990. Despite being 15.9 per
cent lower than in 2000, 894,000 passenger cars
were produced for export in 2001, more than
twice as many as in 1990. Commercial vehicle
production in 2001 rose by 11.8 per cent to
193,000, reversing a downward trend since 1997;
almost 50 per cent, or 96,000 units, was for
export. The sector is dominated by light
commercial vehicles (van derivatives of passenger
cars).
In 2001 there were two particularly significant all-
new model launches, with the BMW Mini
produced at its Oxford plant, and the Jaguar ‘X’
type, produced at Ford’s Halewood plant. Both
models have made an immediate impact in the
UK and also in export markets around the world.
The UK is an increasing force in engine
production as a result of major recent
investments. BMW’s new Hams Hall (West
Midlands) plant produces 50 per cent of the
company’s engines, all for export, while Ford

produces 20 per cent of its global engines from
Bridgend and Dagenham. UK engine
manufacturing output is forecast to rise to over
4 million units by 2003, double the 1990 figure,
and representing substantial net exports.
Around 330,000 people are employed in vehicle
and component production and manufacturing
activities in the UK.
The UK has around 40 producers of motor
vehicles. This includes volume car producers
BMW, Ford (including Jaguar, Land Rover and
Aston Martin), Honda, MG Rover, Nissan,
Peugeot, Toyota and Vauxhall/IBC and a range of
smaller producers targeting specialist markets
such as sports and luxury cars. London Taxis
International, owned by Manganese Bronze
Holdings, the engineering and automotive
components group, produces some 2,500 taxis
a year at its Coventry factory.
The main truck manufacturer is Leyland Trucks,
owned by PACCAR. Medium-sized vans are
manufactured by LDV at Birmingham, Ford at
Southampton and by the GM/Renault joint
venture at the IBC plant in Luton. The main UK
bus manufacturer is TransBus, formed from a
merger of the bus manufacturing interests of
Mayflower and Henlys, and Optare.
The automotive components manufacturing sector
is a major contributor to the UK motor industry,
with an annual turnover of around £12 billion
and employing an estimated 150,000 people.
A large proportion of its enterprises are small-
and medium-sized, in terms of employment, and
many also supply other sectors.
Shipbuilding and marine engineering
The UK merchant shipbuilding industry, located
mainly in Scotland and northern England,
comprises some 17 yards employing around 4,000
people, producing ships ranging from tugs and
fishing vessels to fast ferries and large specialist
craft for offshore exploration and exploitation
work. The industry’s current order book is for ten
ships. The merchant ship repair and conversion
industry, which has a strong presence in the UK,
comprises over 60 companies employing 4,000 to
7,000 people depending on workload. Naval
construction accounts for a further 7,900 people.
Vosper Thornycroft and BAe Systems dominate
warship production, and in 2002 received an order
to build a further six Royal Navy warships at yards
in Glasgow, Barrow-in-Furness and Portsmouth.
Overall, shipyards employ about 27,000 people
and tend to concentrate around Southampton,
Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Glasgow and
Belfast. In addition, the UK has a range of world-
class companies in the boat-building sector. A few
internationally known builders dominate the
market for the supply of luxury motor yachts and
cruisers.
The UK marine equipment industry has an
annual turnover of £1.7 billion and employs an
estimated 16,600 people in about 690 companies.
About 62 per cent of its output is exported.
Production ranges from traditional marine
equipment to sophisticated navigational and
propulsion systems, as well as equipment and
supplies for the cruise industry.

Economic affairs
27 Manufacturing and construction
Oil and gas exploitation in the North Sea has
generated a major offshore industry (see page
438). Shipbuilders and fabricators design and
build semi-submersible units for drilling,
production and emergency/maintenance support;
drill ships; jack-up rigs; modules; and offshore
loading systems as well as undertaking ‘floating
production storage and offload’ vessel (FPSO)
conversions. Harland and Wolff of Belfast is a
principal leader in the offshore sector, specialising
in drill ships. Many other firms supply equipment
and services to the industry, notably diving
expertise, consultancy, design, project
management and R8cD. A number have used their
experience of North Sea projects to establish
themselves in oil and gas markets throughout the
world.
Railway equipment
Over 120 UK enterprises were engaged in
manufacturing railway equipment for both
domestic and overseas markets in 2000, mainly
producing specialist components and systems for
use in rolling stock, signalling, track and
infrastructure applications. About 5,000 firms are
involved in the supply chains, and UK expertise
extends to consultancy and project management.
Two large multinational train builders, the
UK/French-owned Alstom and the Canadian-
owned Bombardier, have UK factories and
assemble passenger rolling stock here. British-
owned companies are involved in producing and
exporting signalling and track accessories. Most
new trains now being introduced in Britain have a
number of foreign-made components, so UK
input varies from 5 to 75 per cent of total value.
Privatised train operating companies have placed
orders for around 4,000 passenger carriages since
1996. One notable order has been for 53 electric
tilting trains, due to begin operating on Virgin
West Coast routes from London Euston in 2003.
Aerospace and defence
The UK’s aerospace industry is one of the few in
the world with a complete capability across the
whole spectrum of aerospace products and
technology. Some 120,000 people were employed
in 2000 and turnover was £17.1 billion. The
industry contributed £2.1 billion to the UK s
balance of payments in 2001.
Farnborough International, held in July every
other year and organised by the Society ot British
Aerospace Companies, is one of the world’s
premier aerospace business events. At the 2002
show there were 1,260 exhibitors from 32
countries, with trade and public attendance of
290,000. Orders worth £9 billion were announced
during the event.
Industry activities cover designing and
constructing airframes, aero-engines, guided
weapons, simulators and space satellites, materials,
flight controls including ‘fly-by-wire’ and ‘fly-by¬
light’ equipment (see page 423), and avionics and
complex components, with their associated
services. The UK also has one of the largest
defence manufacturing industries in the Western
world.
Among the leading companies are BAe Systems
and Rolls-Royce. BAe Systems is a global systems,
defence and aerospace systems company. It
employs some 70,000 people (excluding joint
ventures) around the world and has annual sales
of some £13 billion; its order book in 2001 was
£43 billion. It designs and manufactures a range
of defence equipment, including military aircraft,
surface ships, submarines, communications and
electronic systems, and through joint ventures is
heavily involved in guided weapons and in civil
aerospace.
Engines
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three leading
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a turnover in
2001 of £6.3 billion, including £3.4 billion for its
aerospace business and £1.4 billion for defence.
More than 55,000 Rolls-Royce civil engines are in
service, in over 150 countries. Customers include
over 500 airlines, 2,400 corporate and utility
operators, and 100 armed forces. In civil
aerospace, the Trent family of engines has about
half of the available market in the new generation
of wide-bodied airliners from Airbus and Boeing.
Rolls-Royce is a partner in the low-emission
V2500 aero-engine, now in service on the Airbus
A320 family. In the defence sector, it produces
military engines for both fixed-wing aircraft and
helicopters, and is a partner in the EJ200 engine
project for the Eurofighter Typhoon; it is also
participating in the US/UK Joint Strike Fighter
(JSF) programme and in the team developing an
alternative main propulsion engine for JSF
designs.

the world’s largest manufacturer of head-up
displays (HUDs). British firms have made
important technological advances, for example, in
developing fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, in which control surfaces on the wings
and elsewhere are moved by means of automatic
electronic signalling and fibre optics respectively.
UK companies provide radar and air traffic
control equipment and ground power supplies to
airports and airlines worldwide.
Civil aircraft
BAe Systems has a 20 per cent share of Airbus,
with EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company) controlling the other 80 per cent.
Airbus UK is responsible for the design and
manufacture of the wings for the whole family of
Airbus airliners, from the short- to medium-haul
A320 series (the first civil airliner to use fly-by-
wire controls) to the large long-range four-
engined A340. The company will also design and
manufacture the wings for the new A380 ‘super
jumbo’ - a twin-deck, twin-aisle jetliner with 555
or more seats - expected to create up to 22,000
new jobs, 8,000 at Airbus UK and in UK suppliers
to the programme and a further 14,000 in
associated employment. In 2001 Airbus received
firm orders for 375 new aircraft worth US$44.7
billion from 32 customers around the world, and
in the first half of 2002 had 42 per cent of the
world market for large civil aircraft.
Bombardier Aerospace of Canada, the third largest
civil aircraft manufacturer in the world, produces
a wide range of turboprop and regional jet aircraft
and business jets. Bombardier Aerospace Northern
Ireland (formerly Short Brothers) employs around
7,000 people. Its Belfast site is engaged in the
design and manufacture of major civil aircraft
sub-assemblies, advanced engine nacelles, flight
controls, and for processes such as composites,
metal bonding and computer-aided design/
manufacture, as well as the provision of aviation
support services.
Military aircraft and missiles
BAe Systems, EADS and Alenia of Italy are
building the Eurofighter Typhoon. BAe Systems
also has the Harrier, a vertical/short take-off and
landing (V/STOL) military combat aircraft, the
Tornado combat aircraft manufactured by Panavia
GmbH, a joint venture with EADS and Alenia,
and the Hawk fast-jet trainer, all of which have
been sold overseas. The company is also part of
the Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter team
which is manufacturing three variants of the F-35.
BAe Systems co-owns (with EADS and Italy’s
Finmeccanica) Europe’s main guided weapons
business, MBDA, which is second only to
Raytheon of the US. Another major company
operating in the guided weapons sector is Thales,
including Thales Air Defence in Belfast.
Helicopters
Agusta Westland manufactures the multi-role
EH 101 medium-lift helicopter for civilian and
military markets - two British variants are the
Royal Navy’s Merlin HM.l advanced anti¬
submarine warfare helicopter and the RAF’s
Merlin HC.3 combat transport helicopter. It also
manufactures the Super Lynx light battlefield and
naval helicopter, and is building and supporting
the Apache attack helicopter for the UK Army,
under licence from Boeing. The company is
involved in the successful NH Industries NH-90
support helicopter and a range of civil helicopters
through its Italian facilities. It has a joint venture
with Bell in the US, which has recently developed
the Agusta-Bell AB139 helicopter, selected for the
US Coastguard.
Land systems
The UK’s main armoured fighting vehicle
capability is concentrated in three companies:
Vickers Defence Systems, RO Defence (part of BAe
Systems) and Alvis. RO Defence is also the UK’s
main artillery and ordnance company.
Space equipment and services
Around 400 organisations employing about 5,500

exploitation of space data imaging products.
The largest British space company is Astrium
Limited. Currently jointly owned by BAe Systems
and EADS, it is one of the world’s major space
companies. A leading provider of direct broadcast
television satellites, it is involved in all of Europe’s
space science and Earth observation projects and
Europe’s launcher and navigation programmes.
Machinery and equipment
Industry output rose by 1 per cent in 2001 but was
still almost 4 per cent lower than in 1992 and 1993.
Total turnover was £31.8 billion, of which exports
accounted for £10.8 billion, or 34 per cent (see
Table 27.22). Mechanical machine-building is an
area in which British firms excel, especially internal
combustion engines, power transmission
equipment, pumps and compressors, wheeled
tractors, lawnmowers, and construction and earth-
moving equipment. The UK is a major producer of
industrial engines, pumps, valves and compressors,
and of pneumatic and hydraulic equipment.
Companies manufacture steam generators and
other heavy equipment for power plants.
Alstom, a global specialist in transport and energy
infrastructure, is one of the world’s leading
suppliers of major components for complete
power station projects along with the transformers
and switchgear needed in transmission and
distribution of electricity. In the UK the
company’s strengths are steam turbine
manufacture, switchgear manufacture, industrial
gas turbines, and project design and management.
The mechanical lifting and handling equipment
industry makes cranes and transporters, lifting
devices, escalators, conveyors, powered industrial
trucks and air bridges, as well as electronically

Tractors and equipment used in agriculture,
horticulture, forestry, sports turf and gardens
achieved export sales of £1.0 billion in 2001. Most
tractor exports were supplied by three major
multinationals with plants in the UK; together

automotive industries. In 2001 total turnover of
companies classified to the metalworking machine
tools industry was £909 million, of which exports
accounted for £454 million, almost 50 per cent
(see Table 27.23).
The UK mining and tunnelling equipment
industry has a world reputation in the production
of coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports, conveying
equipment, flameproof transformers, switchgear,
and subsurface transport equipment and control
systems. In construction equipment, the UK has
the largest production volume in Europe, around
one-third of the total of the principal categories of
construction equipment. JCB and a number of
major multinational companies contribute to
construction equipment exports of over
£1.5 billion a year.
The UK has one of the largest engineering
construction sectors in the world, serving the
whole spectrum of process industries, with
particular strengths in oil, gas and related
industries. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms. British companies also make advanced
printing machinery and ceramic processing
equipment, and other types of production
machinery.
The domestic appliances sector includes the
manufacture of refrigerators and freezers,
dishwashers, washing machines, tumble dryers,
vacuum cleaners, floor polishers, microwave ovens
and cookers, as well as water heaters and showers,
ventilation products and small appliances for the
kitchen and bathroom. Energy efficiency and
water conservation have progressively improved in
home laundry products, and new technology has
been applied to many products. Visual design of
what were traditionally ‘white goods’ has changed,
giving a new look to kitchens, and modern design
has also been applied to vacuum cleaners and
small appliances such as kettles and toasters. The
UK is Europe’s largest manufacturer of tumble
dryers, with an annual trade surplus of £20
million in 2000.
Rubber and plastics products
In 2000 the rubber industry had turnover of
£3.4 billion and employed around 41,000 people;
the plastics industry had turnover of £16.4 billion
and employed 205,000 people. Output fell by
4.2 per cent in 2001, although it was over 12 per
cent higher than in 1992.
Rubber products include tyres and tubes, pipes,
hoses, belting and floor coverings, many of which

have applications in the automotive industry. The
largest firms in this sector are major tyre
manufacturers such as Goodyear, making tyres at
its Wolverhampton factory, and Michelin, with
factories in Stoke-on-Trent, Dundee and
Ballymena. Both companies have been making
tyres in the UK since 1927.
Plastics have a multitude of applications. The
packaging industry is the largest user, accounting
for 36 per cent of the market, followed by the
construction (22 per cent), electrical and
electronic goods (8 per cent) and transport
industries (7 per cent). The UK’s plastics industry
continues to be a world leader in material
specification and design, with new processes
allowing stronger plastics to replace traditional
materials and develop new applications. Among
the larger firms in a sector characterised by many
small and medium-sized businesses is British
Polythene Industries, Europe’s largest producer of
polyethylene films, sacks and bags. In the moulded
plastics sector, Linpac’s output includes trays, fast
food packaging, egg cartons and disposable
tableware.
Glass, ceramics and building materials
In 2001 industry output rose by 0.6 per cent in
2001 and was 2 per cent higher than in 1992.
Glass
In 2000 the glass and glass products industry
had turnover of £2.9 billion and employed
35,000 people. The UK is a world leader in the
manufacture of glass. Flat glass is made through
the float process, invented by Pilkington in 1952,
which manufactures clear, tinted and coated glass
for buildings, and clear and tinted glass for
vehicles. It is a process that continues to be
licensed throughout the world. Pilkington has its
own manufacturing operations in 25 countries on
five continents and sales to 130 countries. Today,
one in three of the world’s new light vehicles has
glazing from Pilkington and its associates. The
manufacture and supply of building components
containing glass, windows, doors, partitioning and
cladding is carried out by many other companies
operating from within the timber, metal
(aluminium and steel) and plastic (UPVC) sectors.
The UK also has several leading lead crystal
suppliers, such as Waterford-Wedgwood,
Darlington and Edinburgh Crystal.
Pilkington has developed a self-cleaning glass. It is
float glass with a special ultra-thin coating on the
outside that has a unique dual action. Once
exposed to daylight, the coating reacts chemically in
two ways: first, it breaks down any organic dirt
deposits and second, when rain or water hit the
glass, the loosened dirt is washed away without
leaving any marks.
Ceramics
‘Ceramics’ covers tableware, giftware, ornamental
ware and catering ware; floor and wall tiles and
sanitary ware; clay roofing tiles, clay pipes and
land drains; industrial ceramics and refractories;
and ceramic materials and machinery. In 2000 the
industry - heavily concentrated in the West
Midlands - had turnover of £1.9 billion and
employed 36,000 people. Domestic tableware
production includes fine china, bone china,
earthenware and stoneware, and is produced
predominantly in the Potteries (Stoke-on-Trent)
area of Staffordshire. Wedgwood, Spode and Royal
Doulton are among the most famous names in
fine bone china, and the UK is one of the world’s
leading manufacturers and exporters. Important
industrial ceramics invented in the UK include
some forms of silicon carbide and sialons, which
can withstand ultra-high temperatures.

Building materials
In 2000 the building materials industry had
turnover of £7.3 billion and employed 76,000
people. Most crushed rock, sand and gravel
quarried by the aggregates industry (some
220 million tonnes in Great Britain in 2000) is
used in construction. In 2001, 2.75 billion bricks
were produced by, and 2.83 billion bricks were
delivered from, sites in Great Britain. Portland
cement, a 19th-century British innovation, is a
widely used chemical compound throughout the
world.
Textiles and clothing
This sector has been adversely affected by imports
from low labour-cost suppliers and changing
sourcing patterns in the UK high street - in 2001
output of textiles and textile products was
33 per cent below the level in 1995. UK
manufacturers have modernised their domestic
operations to meet these challenges. In addition,
to compete in areas other than price, firms have
shifted into higher-value products to benefit from
the UK’s strengths in fashion, design, product and
process innovation, and information technology.
Technical textiles in particular are currently
growing at about 7 per cent a year and cover
sectors such as medical textiles, geo textiles and
electronic textiles. New technologies, largely
designed to improve response times and give
greater flexibility in production, are used
throughout the industry.
The textiles industry has a high degree of regional
concentration, reflecting the traditional centres for
this sector: cotton textiles in the North West, fine
knitwear in Scotland, linen in Northern Ireland,
woollens and worsteds in Yorkshire and Scotland,
and knitted fabrics in the East Midlands. The
clothing industry is more dispersed throughout
the UK, but also has significant concentrations in
the Midlands, north and east London and the
North East.
The UK textile and clothing industry comprises a
few multi-process companies, but in the main
companies operate vertically. However, small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dominate, some
of which subcontract work to other companies or
to homeworkers. Two long established companies

Courtaulds (created when the US Sara Lee
Corporation bought Courtaulds Textiles in 2000).
A number of clothing brands are managing a
resurgence, both in the UK and in the
international market, particularly micro and
SMEs, including those in the cut, make and trim
(CMT) sub-sector.
The principal textile and clothing products are
yarns, woven and knitted fabrics, interior
(including printed) textiles, technical textiles,
carpets and a full range of clothing (including
knitwear). Tables 27.28 and 27.29 show
manufacturers’ sales for a range of products.
Worsted yarns are finely spun for use mainly in
suit fabric and fine knitwear. As well as spinners,
weavers and knitters, the sector supports a
number of other processes, such as scouring of
raw wool and dyeing and finishing of wool, yarn
or fabric. British mills also process rare fibres such
as cashmere and angora. In addition, the UK
produces synthetic fibres, cotton/synthetic mixed
yarns and fabrics, and has a large dyeing and
finishing sector (which includes fabric printing).

Axminster and Wilton are the main types of
woven carpets in the UK, which is recognised for
its high-quality products, variety of design and
use of new technology. UK companies are also
continually improving their capability in the
manufacture of higher-volume, lower-value tufted
carpets.
Technical textiles are usually defined as such for
their performance characteristics. They include
non-wovens for filtration and absorbency, textiles
used in construction, automotive textiles, sewing
thread, rope and medical/healthcare textiles and a
very wide range of fabrics used in the automotive,
aviation, aerospace and defence sectors.
The clothing industry is more labour-intensive
than textiles. British firms have had some success
in the growing market for branded street and
club-wear. However, total exports fell by 23 per

Leather and leather products
Total sector output in 2001 was 21 per cent below
the level in 1995. Leather and leather products
accounted for just 0.4 per cent of total
manufacturing gross value added in 2000. Almost
60 per cent (£1.0 billion) of turnover was in the
footwear industry, with a further 23 per cent
(£0.4 billion) in the tanning and dressing of
leather. Also included under this sector are the
manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and
harness.
Britain is home to some of the world’s leading
footwear brands and most innovative designers -
75 per cent of its production is exported. UK
shoemakers are renowned for high-quality formal
footwear, directional fashion (such as trainers),
casual comfort brands and safety footwear.
Around 10,000 people are employed in footwear
manufacturing, with a further 5,000 in supply
trades. Manufacturers’ sales were 34 million pairs
in 2001, worth £584 million (see also Table 27.32).
The domestic market is, however, dominated by
imports, which amounted to 346 million pairs in
2001, or about £5.5 billion at retail prices.
Other manufacturing
In 2000, 58 per cent (£9.4 billion) of turnover in
this sector was in the manufacture of furniture,
with a further 10 per cent (£1.7 billion) in the
recycling of waste and scrap. Also included here
are the manufacture of jewellery and related
articles, musical instruments, sports goods and
games and toys.
Construction
The total value of work done in the construction
industry in Great Britain during 2001 was
£74.7 billion at current prices: £40.0 billion new
work and £34.7 billion repair and maintenance

constant 1995 prices grew by 3.5 per cent
compared with 2000; new work increased by 2.8
per cent and repair and maintenance by 4.5 per
cent. The main areas of construction work within
the GB industry covered by these statistics are:
■ building and civil engineering - ranging from
major private sector companies with diverse
international interests to one-person
enterprises carrying out domestic repairs; and
■ specialist work - companies or individuals
undertaking construction work ranging from
structural steelwork and precast concrete
structures to mechanical and electrical
services (including the design and installation
of environmentally friendly building control
systems).
Other areas of construction work not covered in
the above statistics include:
■ the supply of building materials (see page
427) and components - ranging from large
quarrying companies, and those engaged in
mass production of manufactured items, to
small, highly specialised manufacturers; and

Housing
The value of new housing orders in Great Britain
in 2001 was 8.8 per cent higher than in 2000 - the
private sector accounted for almost 86 per cent of
the total compared with 75 per cent in 1993. In
2001 construction of 178,900 dwellings was
started in Great Britain. Starts by private
enterprise concerns were 161,700, by registered
social landlords 16,900, and by local authorities
300. New dwellings completed by sector are shown
in Table 27.37.
Project procurement, management and
financing
Private and public sector projects are managed in
a variety of ways. Most clients invite construction
firms to bid for work by competitive tender,
having used the design services of a consultant.
The successful contractor will then undertake
on-site work with a number of specialist
subcontractors. Alternative methods of project
procurement have become more common in
recent years - for example, contracts might
include subsequent provision of building
maintenance, or a comprehensive ‘design-and-
build’ service where a single company oversees
every stage of a project from conception to
completion.
Financing of major projects has also been
changing. Traditionally, clients raised the finance
to pay for schemes themselves. Today, they often
demand a complete service package that includes
finance. As a result, larger construction companies
are developing closer links with banks and other
financial institutions. In public sector
construction the Government’s Private Finance
Initiative/public-private partnerships (see page
350) have also heralded a move away from
traditional financing.

country in the world.
UK contractors have pioneered management
contracting and design and build, and also the
financing mechanisms that have been developed
in the domestic market through innovations such
as the Private Finance Initiative. During 2001 they
won new international business valued at
£4.7 billion, 20 per cent more than in 2000 (see
Table 27.38). Contractors were particularly
successful in North America, their most valuable
market, accounting for 38 per cent of all new

Energy
UK energy production fell by 3.9 per cent in 2001,
although primary energy consumption for energy
uses increased by 1.8 per cent. Oil production fell
by 7.6 per cent, mainly due to the decline in
production from established fields. Production of
gas fell by 2.4 per cent. Emergency arrangements
for the energy sector are being updated in the light
of the events of 11 September 2001 (see page 76).
This is being done against the background of
testing of current procedures for dealing with the
risks to the supplies of the oil, gas, nuclear, coal
and electricity industries and the responsible
public bodies.
The Government has allocated £267 million over
the three years from 2001/02 to 2003/04 to
promote new and renewable energy technologies.
Resources
Production of primary fuels in 2001, at 277.6
million tonnes of oil equivalent, was 3.94 per cent
lower than in 2000. UK production of crude oil
and natural gas liquids (NGLs) decreased by
7.6 per cent to 116.7 million tonnes. Annual
production of gas (including gaseous renewables)
reached 106.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent,
2.4 per cent lower than in 2000, while petroleum
production was down by 7.6. per cent. In 2001 UK
refineries produced 0.5 million tonnes more petrol
than UK demand. UK coal production has
followed a downward trend since 1980. However,
production rose by 2.3 per cent in 2001 to 31.9
million tonnes. Coal still supplied a significant
proportion of the country’s primary energy needs:
33 per cent of the electricity supplied in 2001 was
from coal, while gas supplied 37 per cent and
nuclear 22 per cent. Nuclear electricity production
was 5.9 per cent higher than in 2000.
For 2001, in value terms, total imports of fuels
were 5.6 per cent higher than in 2000, largely
owing to a 72 per cent increase in the value of coal
and other solid fuel. Exports were 0.7 per cent
higher. The value of exports of natural gas
increased by 25 per cent, reflecting high world gas
prices during 2001 (see page 436).
Overall the UK remains a net exporter of all fuels,
with a surplus on a balance of payments basis of
£5.7 billion in 2001, £1.4 billion lower than in
2000. The trade surplus in crude oil and
petroleum products was £5.4 billion. In volume
terms, imports of fuel in 2001 were 16.2 per cent
higher than in 2000, while exports were
8.1 per cent higher. The UK had a trade surplus in
fuels of 40.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent.
Energy policy
The Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation
Unit (PIU) published its Energy Review in
February 2002, setting out the strategic issues for
Great Britain, within the context of tackling global
warming, and ensuring competitive energy
supplies. In response to the Review, the
Government initiated a national debate about
sustainable energy. The Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) and Department for Environment,
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) launched an
energy consultation paper in May 2002, targeted at
a wide range of energy stakeholders. In addition,
the Government undertook a programme of
events to involve members of the general public.
433
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
The following assumptions formed the
background to the consultation:
■ liberalised and competitive markets will
continue to be a cornerstone of future energy
policy;
■ it is vital to maintain security of supply;
■ greenhouse gas emissions will need to be
reduced significantly during the 21st century
- this will need technological innovation,
with the potential for the UK to benefit from
moving to clean and low-carbon technologies
and improving performance in energy
efficiency;
■ competitiveness and affordability are also key
objectives of energy policy; and
■ climate change issues and some aspects of
security of supply are international questions:
the UK cannot therefore only act through
domestic policies but must also address these
issues through international policies and
agreements, particularly through EU market
liberalisation and the Kyoto Protocol
(see page 283).
The Government proposes to publish a White
Paper early in 2003 setting out its approach to
future energy policy in the light of the PIU report
and the findings from the consultation.
Climate change levy
In April 2001 the Government introduced the
climate change levy, a tax on business use of
energy, designed to encourage energy efficiency
across business, and thus help to bring about
lower emissions of greenhouse gases. It is a key
component in the Government’s Climate Change
Programme, and is contributing towards climate
change commitments, including the UK’s target
under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 12.5 per cent below 1990 levels
by 2008-12 (see page 283).
The levy is designed to balance environmental
gains and the protection of business
competitiveness. It is expected to cut carbon
emissions by about 5 million tonnes a year by
2010. All revenues, however, are being recycled,
mainly through an offsetting cut in employer
National Insurance contributions, but also
through support for energy efficiency
programmes and renewables (see page 445).
To protect the international competitiveness of
energy-intensive industries, the Government
has provided an 80 per cent discount from the
levy for those sectors that agree targets for
improving their energy efficiency or reducing
carbon emissions.
International developments
Since 1999 the European Union’s (EU) Fifth
Framework Programme of Research and
Technological Development has been the focus of
research, development and demonstration of
energy technologies in the EU. The EU Energy
Framework Programme (EFP) 1998-2002 had six
separate components:
■ ETAP (shared studies and analyses);
■ SYNERGY (international co-operation on
security of supply and Kyoto targets);
■ ALTENER (renewable energy);
■ SAVE (strategic action for vigorous energy
efficiency);
■ SURE (safe transport of nuclear materials
and safeguards); and
■ CARNOT (clean and efficient use of solid
fuels).
The EFP is to be replaced by the Intelligent Energy
for Europe Programme (2003-06) comprising
SAVE, ALTENER, STEER (energy aspects of
transport) and COOPENER (international
co-operation in renewables and energy efficiency).
The European Commission collaborates with
specialist international organisations, notably the
International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris, which
monitors world energy markets on behalf of
industrialised countries and promotes reform of
energy markets, both among its members and
internationally. The lEA’s membership consists of
all members of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development except Iceland
and Mexico.
The degree to which electricity and gas markets
have been opened to competition varies
considerably across the EU, with only the UK and
a few others allowing all consumers to choose
their suppliers. However, agreement was reached
434
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
to complete the internal energy market at the 2000
Lisbon summit and the Commission subsequently
brought forward proposals to bring this about at
the start of 2001. Negotiations continue, although
it has now been agreed that the non-domestic
sector should be totally opened by 2004. The UK
Government supports the Commission’s proposals
and wishes to see their early adoption.
In November 2001 the European Commission
issued a Green Paper, Towards a European strategy
for the security of energy supply, aimed at
stimulating debate on the issue of security of
supply against the background of increasing EU
energy dependence. Among other things it
proposes stronger demand management (using
taxes and efficiency measures), promotion of
renewable energy sources as ways to address the
challenges of climate change and over-dependence
on fossil fuels, and dialogue with, and promotion
of, economic reform in supplier countries. It also
underlines the benefits of a liberalised EU energy
market and the importance for the single energy
market of adequate infrastructure.
Oil and gas exploration and production
In 2001, either through direct use or as a source of
energy for electricity generation, oil and gas
accounted for 72 per cent of total UK energy
consumption, with UK production supplying
97 per cent of gas consumed. About 11 per cent of
UK production was exported to Ireland or through
the UK-Belgium interconnector although on some
winter days imports were required to meet
demand. In 2001 output of crude oil and natural
gas liquids in the UK averaged 2.4 million barrels
(about 320,000 tonnes) a day, making it the world’s
tenth largest producer.
The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) comprises
those areas of the seabed and subsoil up to and
beyond the territorial sea over which the UK
exercises sovereign rights of exploration and
exploitation of natural resources. Exports from
the UKCS rose by 36 per cent in 2001 to
12.7 billion cubic metres, with gas going to the
Netherlands, from the British share of the
Markham transboundary field and the
neighbouring Windermere field, to the Irish
Republic and to Belgium through the
UK-Belgium interconnector. About 2.8 billion
cubic metres were imported from Norway and
from Belgium via the interconnector, representing
2.9 per cent of total supplies in 2001, compared
with 2.5 per cent in 2000.
Taxation
The North Sea fiscal regime is a major mechanism
for gaining economic benefit for the UK from its
oil and gas resources. The Government grants
licences to private sector companies to explore for,
and exploit, oil and gas resources (see page 436).
Its main sources of revenue from oil and gas
activities are petroleum revenue tax, levied on
profits from fields approved before 16 March
1993; and corporation tax, charged on the profits
of oil and gas companies. The 2002 Budget
introduced changes to the North Sea tax regime to
ensure that it raises a fair share of revenue while
promoting long-term investment. Companies will

now pay a 10 per cent supplementary charge on
North Sea profits and receive a 100 per cent first-
year allowance for capital expenditure in the
North Sea. As part of the modernisation of the
North Sea fiscal regime, the Government intends,
subject to consultation on timing, to abolish the
Royalty (Royalty is charged at 12.5 per cent of the
gross value of oil and gas won in a particular
licence area, less an allowance for the costs
associated with the conveying, treating and initial
storage of the oil and gas) that applies to fields
approved before April 1982. Royalty was abolished
in the 1980s for all fields given development
consent on or after April 1982.
Licensing
In January 2001 the 20th round of offshore
licensing was launched inviting applications for
blocks in the North Sea. The licence awards in the
tenth round of landward licensing will encourage
the exploitation of the potential of coal bed
methane, either through direct drilling or by
tapping into the gases released from abandoned
coal workings. By the end of 2001, over 8,000
wells had been, or were being, drilled in the
UKCS: 2,172 exploration wells, 1,396 appraisal
wells and 4,570 development wells. Some 24
exploration wells and 36 appraisal wells were
started in 2001. The Government must approve all
proposed wells and development plans.
Production and reserves
Some 233 offshore fields were in production at the
end of 2001: 117 oil, 96 gas and 20 condensate
(a lighter form of oil). During 2001, 22 new
developments were approved. Offshore, these
comprised eight oilfields, 12 gasfields and one
condensate field; onshore, one gasfield. In
addition, approval for 12 incremental offshore
developments (elaborations to existing fields) was
granted.
Cumulative production to end 2001 was 2.687
billion tonnes, with Forties (335 million tonnes)
and Brent (293 million tonnes) the largest-
producing fields. Britain’s largest onshore oilfield,
at Wytch Farm (Dorset), produces 90 per cent of
the total crude oils and NGLs originating onshore.
Possible maximum remaining UKCS reserves of
oil are estimated at 1.43 billion tonnes.
Offshore gas
Natural gas now accounts for over 40 per cent of
total inland primary fuel consumption in the UK.
In 2001 indigenous production amounted to a
record 111 billion cubic metres, 2.5 per cent up on
2000.
Cumulative gas production to the end of 2001 was
1,716 billion cubic metres. Maximum possible
remaining gas reserves in present discoveries now
stand at just under 1,710 billion cubic metres.
Pipelines
Some 10,928 km of major submarine pipelines
transport oil, gas and condensate from one field to
another and to shore. Nine landing places on the
North Sea coast bring gas ashore to supply a
national and regional high- and low-pressure
pipeline system some 273,000 km long, which
transports natural gas around Great Britain.
A 40 km pipeline takes natural gas from Scotland
to Northern Ireland; exports to the Irish Republic
are conveyed by the Britain-Ireland
interconnector. The pipeline from Bacton to
Zeebrugge in Belgium (232 km) has an export
capacity of 20 billion cubic metres a year and an
import capacity of 8.5 billion cubic metres a year.
Economic and industrial aspects
World oil prices declined somewhat in 2001; the
average price received by producers from sales of
UKCS oil was £126 a tonne, compared with £154 a
tonne in the last quarter of 2000. UKCS oil and
gas production fell from 2.6 per cent of the UK’s
gross value added in 2000 to an estimated
2.4 per cent in 2001. Total revenues from the sale
of oil (including NGLs) produced from the UKCS
in 2001 fell to £14.7 billion, while those from the
sale of gas rose to £8.3 billion. Taxes and royalty
receipts attributable to UKCS oil and gas rose to
some £5.1 billion in 2001/02.
PILOT, the successor to the Oil and Gas Industry
Task Force, is a joint initiative between oil and gas
companies, the industrial supply chain and the
Government. It is seeking to maintain exploration
and development momentum on the UKCS in the
face of increasing maturity of its oil reserves, and
to prolong UK self-sufficiency.
Since 1965 the oil and gas production industry has
generated operating surpluses of some £287 billion,
of which about £111 billion (including over
£24 billion of exploration and appraisal expenditure)
has been reinvested in the industry, £100.5 billion
paid in taxation, and about £75.5 billion retained by
the companies. Total annual income of the oil and
gas sector fell slightly to some £24.5 billion in 2001.
436
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
Among PILOT’S targets are:
■ a production level of 3 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2010;
■ a sustained investment level of £3 billion a
year;
■ a 50 per cent increase in the value of
industry-related exports by 2005;
■ additional revenue of £1 billion from new
businesses;
■ 100,000 more jobs than there would
otherwise have been in 2010; and
■ prolonged self-sufficiency in oil and gas for
the UK.
Production investment in the oil and gas
extraction industry rose to some £3.5 billion in
2001. Including exploration and appraisal
investment of a further £0.4 billion, it formed
about 15 per cent of total British industrial
investment and some 2.5 per cent of gross fixed
capital investment. In 2001 some 32,000 people
were engaged in extraction offshore and onshore
by the industry while some 265,000 jobs were
supported by the industry. Various initiatives, such
as LOGIC (Leading Oil and Gas Industry
Competitiveness), are aimed at making the UKCS
more attractive to investors and sustaining activity
through 2010 and beyond.
The offshore environment
All new developments are assessed under the
Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-lines
(Assessment of Environmental Effects)
Regulations, the ‘EIA’ (Environmental Impact
Assessment) Regulations and the Offshore
Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats)
Regulations 2001. The EIA Regulations apply to
the drilling of wells, the installation of pipelines,
extended well tests and the development of new
fields. Environmental Statements are required for
projects that could have a significant impact on
the marine environment. The Habitats
Regulations additionally apply to activities that are
not covered by the EIA Regulations, such as
offshore oil and gas surveys, well abandonment
and decommissioning operations.
In addition to these assessment procedures,
permits are required for a number of offshore
activities. The Offshore Combustion Installations
(Prevention of Control of Pollution) Regulations
2001 aim to reduce pollution from installations.
The regulations require permits for offshore
combustion installations, that is, gas turbines and
diesels burning natural gas or diesel fuel
predominantly used to generate electricity.
Permits are also required for the use and discharge
of chemicals during all offshore operations under
the Offshore Chemicals (Pollution Prevention and
Control) Regulations 2002. A comprehensive
review of the environmental regime will take place
in 2003 to examine ways of streamlining the
current regulations.
During 2001 a total of 93 tonnes of oil, from 435
incidents, was reported to the DTI as a result of
accidental spills. About 96 per cent of reports are
for a spill of less than 1 tonne. Since 1986 the UK
has carried out surveillance flights in accordance
with international obligations under the Bonn
Agreement. These flights are unannounced and
cover all offshore installations on the UKCS. The
DTI uses a computer link to the aircraft which
transmits photographic images of possible
pollution incidents and enables the Department to
investigate these as they happen. In addition, an
initial study by the Department into the potential
for satellite surveillance complemented by aerial
surveillance has given encouraging results. The
appointment of additional environmental
inspectors enabled the number of inspections of
offshore installations on the UKCS to be increased
significantly in 2001.
Decommissioning
The Petroleum Act 1998 places a decommissioning
obligation on the operators of every offshore
installation and the owners of every offshore
pipeline on the UKCS. Companies have to submit a
decommissioning programme for ministerial
approval and ensure that its provisions are carried
out. In 1998 the OSPAR Convention
(see page 287) agreed rules for the disposal of
defunct offshore installations at sea. Under the
terms of this decision, there is a prohibition on the
dumping and leaving wholly or partly in place of
offshore installations. Derogations, however, are
possible for concrete platforms and for the footings
of steel installations with a jacket weight above
10,000 tonnes. All installations put in place after
9 February 1999 must be completely removed. The
Government encourages the re-use of facilities and
expects operators to show that they have
investigated such a course. It also encourages free
437
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
trade in mature offshore oil and gas assets, as a
means of extending field life and maximising
economic recovery. By August 2002, 22
decommissioning programmes, covering 25
redundant installations, had been approved by the
DTI.
Offshore safety
Offshore health and safety are the responsibility of
the Health and Safety Executive (HSE - see page
137). The Offshore Division (OSD) within HSE
ensures that risks to people who work in oil and
gas extraction are properly controlled. OSD’s
regulatory tasks range from providing advice and
guidance on operational and technical matters to
working with industry on reducing releases of
hydrocarbon.
The work includes:
■ inspecting and auditing offshore operations
and onshore oil and gas well operations;
■ investigating accidents and complaints;
■ assessing safety cases and other notifications,
including well operations and some
construction operations; and
■ providing technical information and statistics.
The Offshore Petroleum Industry Training
Organisation and the Norwegian Oil Industry
Association have approved the Warsash Maritime
Centre in Southampton as a recognised training
centre. It offers a range of basic safety and
emergency training courses for those employed in
the offshore oil and gas industry. The course is a
prerequisite that satisfies the United Kingdom
Offshore Operators Association guidelines.
Suppliers of goods and services
As the UK offshore oil and gas sector matures, UK
supply and manufacturing companies have
increasingly turned to work in other industrial
sectors and in overseas hydrocarbon producing
areas. The Oil and Gas Industry Development
Group in the DTI works with the PILOT
initiatives and takes other action to help the
industry realign to changing market
circumstances. In May 2002 a new website
containing contact details of over 3,000 companies
in the UK oil and gas supply chain was launched.
This website is maintained by the DTI and is
available for global buyers to seek information on
the capabilities and contact details of UK-based
companies in this sector.
Gas supply industry
Structure of the industry
The holder of a gas transporter’s licence in Great
Britain may not also hold licences for supply or
shipping in a fully competitive market.1 Of the
two entirely separate companies formed from the
demerged British Gas pic, the supply business is
now part of the holding company Centrica pic
(which still trades under the British Gas brand
name in Great Britain), while the pipeline and
storage businesses, most exploration and
production, and research and technology (R&T)
became part of the holding company BG Group
pic. In October 2000 BG Group pic demerged its
transport, telecommunications, R&T and other
businesses into a separately listed company, Lattice
Group pic, while the rest of the group continues as
BG Group pic. In April 2002 National Grid pic
and Lattice Group announced their intention to
merge to create National Grid Transco pic, and in
July 2002 the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry cleared the merger.
The national and regional gas pipeline network is
owned by Transco, part of Lattice Group, which is
responsible for dealing with leaks and emergencies.
It has also had a monopoly in gas metering, which
the energy regulator, Ofgem (see page 443), plans to
open to competition. Shippers participate in
balancing supply and demand in the pipeline
network, within a regime partly driven by
commercial concerns, and utilising gas trading
arrangements, which include a screen-based
on-the-day commodity market for trading in
wholesale supplies of gas. In addition, there are
auctions for the allocation of entry capacity into
the high-pressure national transmission system;
and commercial incentives for Transco to operate
and balance the system efficiently. Because of the
increasing use of gas for electricity generation, the
energy regulator is considering changes to the gas
balancing regime - the way gas supply is matched
to demand, at present on a daily basis.
In Northern Ireland supplies of natural gas have
been available since 1996, when the Scotland to
1 Suppliers sell piped gas to consumers; public gas transporters
(PGTs) operate the pipeline system through which gas will
normally be delivered and shippers arrange with PGTs for
appropriate amounts of gas to go through the pipeline system.

Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
Northern Ireland gas pipeline was put into
operation. Phoenix Natural Gas Ltd has a
combined licence for the conveyance and supply
of gas in Greater Belfast. There are proposals both
to extend the gas system to other parts of
Northern Ireland and for a South-North pipeline
from outside Dublin to the Belfast area.
Competition
Since 1994 suppliers other than British Gas have
captured 83 per cent of the industrial and
commercial gas market. Some 60 companies are
licensed to sell gas to the commercial sector.
By December 2001 about 6.8 million (out of 20
million) domestic customers no longer took their
gas supply from British Gas and were supplied by
one of 23 other companies now in the domestic
market. In 2001, a standard credit customer could
save, on average, £47 on his or her annual gas bill
by changing supplier. (The average annual bill in
the UK was £308 in April 2001, including VAT.)
Only companies that have been granted a supplier’s
licence are allowed to sell gas. Licence conditions
include providing gas to anyone who requests it
and is connected to the mains gas supply. Special
services must be made available for elderly, disabled
and chronically sick people. Suppliers must offer
customers a range of payment options; they are
able to set their own charges, but have to publish
their prices and other terms so that customers can
make an informed choice.
Ofgem (Office of Gas and Electricity Markets)
(see page 443) has removed price controls from
British Gas Trading, as it considers the market to
be competitive. However, it continually monitors
the market to ensure that anti-competitive
practices do not take place.
Between 1991 and 2001, the average price of gas fell
in real terms for domestic gas customers by
23 per cent. Over the same period industrial
customers saw prices fall by 15 per cent in real
terms (18 per cent excluding the climate change
levy - CCL - which came into effect in April 2001).
Consumption and the market
Demand for natural gas in 2001, at 1,119 terawatt
hours (TWh), was 0.5 per cent lower than in 2000.
Gas used for electricity generation in 2001, at 311.5
TW, was 4.0 per cent lower. Although two new
gas-fired power stations started to generate during
2001 and four others made their first full-year
contributions, high gas prices led to some stations
operating below full capacity. Consumption in the
domestic sector grew by 2.5 per cent to
379.2 TWh in 2001 as a whole, while consumption
in the public administration, commerce and
agriculture sector grew by 2.4 per cent.
Consumption in the industrial sector fell by
1.3 per cent to 192.0 TWh.
Sharp rises in the wholesale prices of gas have
occurred since spring 2000, affecting in particular
industrial and commercial customers. Between the
first quarters of 2000 and 2002 prices paid by
industry (excluding the CCL) have increased by
42 per cent in real terms. The major causes have
been arbitrage (trading on the price differences)
across the UK-Belgium gas pipeline, at a time
when continental gas prices are linked to oil
prices, which have themselves been at high levels,
and the associated tightening of the UK supply/
demand balance.
Downstream oil
Oil consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery consumption) in
2001 included 20.9 million tonnes of petrol for
motor vehicles, 16.4 million tonnes of DERV
(diesel-engined road vehicles) fuel, 10.3 million
tonnes of aviation turbine fuel, 6.5 million tonnes
of gas oil (distilled from petroleum) and 2.2
million tonnes of fuel oils (blends of heavy
petroleum).
Oil refineries
In 2001 the UK’s 13 refineries processed 85
million tonnes of crude and process oils, a slightly
lower level than in 2000. About 80 per cent of UK
output by weight is in the form of lighter, higher-
value products, such as gasoline, DERV and jet
kerosene. The UK is much more geared towards
petrol production than its European counterparts;
this accounts for about a third of each barrel of
crude oil, compared with a European average of
just over a fifth.
In 2001 UK exports of refined petroleum products
fell by 15 per cent to £4.1 billion. Virtually all
exports went to partners in the EU and in the
International Energy Agency, especially France,
Germany and the United States.
Coal
The UK coal industry is entirely in the private
sector. The main deep-mine operators in the UK
439
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
are UK Coal (formerly known as RJB Mining), in
England, Tower Colliery in south Wales, and
Hatfield Colliery (now owned by Coalpower), in
South Yorkshire. UK Coal, Mining Scotland,
H J Banks and Company and Celtic Energy, which
operates in Wales, are the main opencast
operators. In May 2002 there were 29
underground mines in production, including
16 major deep mines, employing around 8,600
workers (including contractors), and 56 opencast
sites, employing some 2,600 workers. Opencast
production accounts for most of the relatively
low-sulphur coal mined in Scotland and south
Wales, and contributes towards improving the
average quality of coal supplies. Opencast mining
is subject to approval by local authorities and can
take place only where it can comply with strict
environmental guidelines, which stress the highest
standards of operation, restoration and aftercare.
Market for coal
In 2001 overall demand for coal, at 64 million
tonnes, was up 9.6 per cent on 2000. About
79 per cent was used by the electricity generators,
12 per cent by coke ovens and blast furnaces,
1 per cent by other fuel producers, 3.8 per cent by
industry, 4 per cent by domestic consumers and
0.2 per cent by other final consumers. Exports
were 550,000 tonnes, while imports amounted to
35.5 million tonnes - mainly of steam coal for
electricity generation and coking coal. Total
production from British deep mines rose by
0.9 per cent to 17.3 million tonnes in 2001.
Opencast output rose from 13.4 million tonnes to
14.2 million tonnes in the same period. The
Government’s lifting of the stricter consents policy
on the building of gas-fired power stations has
helped win European Commission approval for
the UK Coal Operating Aid Scheme in November
2000. This has allowed for up to £170 million to
help the coal industry through short-term energy
market problems while its production costs are
higher than world market prices for coal.
Clean coal
Cleaner coal technologies reduce the
environmental impact of coal used for power and
industrial applications by increasing the efficiency
of its conversion to energy and reducing harmful
emissions, which are the cause of acid rain.
Improvements in the efficiency of coal-fired
power stations lead directly to reductions of
carbon dioxide (C02), a major contributor to
climate change. The DTI allocation of £12 million
during 1999/2000 to 2001/02 to the cleaner coal
research and development (R&D) programme
aimed to encourage collaboration between UK
industry and universities in the development of
the technologies and expertise. The DTI is also
developing a sub-commercial underground coal
gasification project to meet government criteria
on cleaner coal.
Coal Authority
The Coal Authority is a public body sponsored by
the DTI. It has five main responsibilities: licensing
coal-mining operations; repairing coal subsidence
damage; managing coalfield property; managing
minewater pollution and other environmental
problems associated with coal-mining; and
providing information to house buyers, other
purchasers of property and local authorities about
mining activity near property.
Nuclear power
Nuclear power generates about one-sixth of the
world’s energy and over a third of Europe’s. It
substantially reduces the use of fossil fuels that
would otherwise be needed for generation. In the
UK, nuclear stations generated 90.1 TWh in 2001
and contributed 23 per cent of total electricity
generation. The private sector company British
Energy owns and operates seven advanced gas-
cooled reactor stations - five in England and
Wales - and the pressurised water reactor (PWR)
at Sizewell B. British Energy’s reactors have a
declared net capacity of 7,140 megawatts (MW) in
England and 2,440 MW in Scotland. British
Nuclear Fuels operates six magnox power stations,
and five more that are being decommissioned.
Existing nuclear stations are expected to continue
to contribute to the country’s energy requirements
provided they do so to the high safety and
environmental standards currently observed.
Government projections suggest that nuclear
power generation could represent about
17 to 18 per cent of total generation by 2010 and
about 7 per cent of total generation by 2020.
These projections assume no new build and
recognise that plant lifetimes are dependent on
safety and economic factors.
In September 2002, as a result of experiencing
financial difficulties, British Energy asked the
Government for financial support. The
Government has provided a short-term loan to
British Energy in respect of the period until 29
November 2002. The Government stated that this
was in order to give sufficient time to clarify the
440
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
company's full financial position and to come to a
clear view on the options for restructuring the
company. The Government’s priorities are
nuclear safety and security of electricity supplies
while protecting the interests of the taxpayer.
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
BNFL is Britain’s primary provider of nuclear
products and services - including spent fuel
management, recycling, reprocessing oxide fuel,
decommissioning and cleaning up redundant
nuclear facilities, and treating historic wastes to
both UK and international customers. The
company’s turnover in 2001/02 was £2.26 billion.
In November 2001, the Government announced
that a Liabilities Management Authority (LMA)
would be established to take responsibility for
most of the UK’s public sector civil nuclear
liabilities, including those of BNFL. In June 2002
BNFL announced a restructuring, aligning the
existing business into two new business groups
designed to reflect the company’s main customer
groups: Nuclear Business Utilities Group and
Government Services Business Group. The
company restructuring and the LMA will allow
BNFL to operate in a more commercially
competitive environment and position the
company to aim for a public-private partnership
(PPP) for the business in the future.
UK Atomic Energy
The main activity of UK Atomic Energy (UKAEA)
{www.ukaea.org.uk) is the decommissioning of
nuclear liabilities. It is committed to do this in a
way that achieves value for money without
compromising safety. It has integrated plans for
the decommissioning and environmental
restoration of its sites at Flarwell (Oxfordshire),
Winfrith (Dorset), Dounreay (Caithness) and
Windscale (Cumbria). UKAEA’s objective is to
restore the sites for conventional use. It also
manages the fusion research centre at Culham
(Oxfordshire) which forms an integral part of the
European Union’s research into fusion energy.
Fusion research
Nuclear fusion research in the UK is funded by the
Office of Science and Technology and Euratom.
The UK Government spends £14.3 million a year
on research, of which the main focus is magnetic
confinement, based at Culham science centre. The
UKAEA operates both Europe’s fusion facility -
JET (Joint European Torus) - and the UK’s
domestic programme at Culham. 1 hrough the EU,
the Euratom/UKAEA Fusion Association
contributes to the international effort to
demonstrate the principle of power production
from fusion, currently embodied in the
International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor.
Nuclear safety
The safety of nuclear installations is the
responsibility of the nuclear operators within a
system of regulatory control enforced by FiSE.
Regulation of nuclear safety is primarily achieved
through a system of licensing that requires the
licensees to demonstrate that they meet 36 licence
conditions to HSE’s satisfaction. HSE assesses and
inspects the sites to satisfy itself that the licensees
meet their responsibilities for safety.
The International Convention on Nuclear Safety
has been ratified by 53 countries, including the
UK and members at the European Commission.
The UK has to submit a report showing how it
meets the articles of the Convention, which is the
subject of peer review by the other countries that
are party to the Convention. The latest UK report
for the Convention was prepared in September
2001.
The UK’s main contribution to the international
effort to improve safety in Central and Eastern
Europe and in the former Soviet republics is
channelled through the EU’s nuclear safety
programmes.
Energy consumption
Total UK energy demand was 249 million tonnes
of oil equivalent in 2001, of which 11 million were
for non-energy use. Transport was the sector with
the greatest level of consumption, accounting for
32 per cent of total final consumption. The
domestic sector was responsible for 28 per cent of
the total, the industrial sector for 20 per cent and
the service industries, including agriculture, for 13
per cent. Non-energy use made up the remaining
6 per cent.
Primary energy demand in 2001 was 1.2 per cent
higher than in 2000. Primary demand for coal
and other solid fuels was 9.0 per cent higher than
in 2000, but primary demand for oil and gas fell
by 1.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. On a
temperature-corrected basis, which shows what
annual intake might have been if the average
temperature during the year had been the same as
the average for 1961-90, energy consumption

Electricity
England and Wales
In December 2001, 72 companies held generation
licences in England and Wales. The New
Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) took
effect in March 2001 (see below). A new electricity
licensing regime, including the separation of
supply from the distribution networks, was
introduced in October 2001. The largest
generators are Innogy, PowerGen, AES, British
Energy, TXU Europe, Edison Mission Energy, and
BNFL’s Magnox Generation Group. The National
Grid Company pic owns and operates the
transmission system, and is responsible for
balancing electricity supply and demand.
Distribution - transfer of electricity from the
national grid to consumers via local networks - is
carried out by the 12 regional electricity
companies (RECs). Supply - the purchase of
electricity from generators and its sale to
consumers - has been fully open to competition
since 1999. All consumers in Great Britain are free
to choose their electricity supplier.
Cross-border acquisitions and takeovers have
become a feature of the European power market.
RECs are now restructuring as separate
distribution and supply companies, most of them
overseas-owned. All the main UK generators are
vertically integrating through ownership of supply
businesses. British electricity companies continue
to invest overseas.
In March 2001 the new wholesale electricity
trading arrangements came into operation in
England and Wales. NETA, along with plant
divestments, has introduced competition into
wholesale electricity trading. Generators, suppliers,
traders and customers are encouraged to enter into
bilateral contracts in forwards and futures markets
and short-term power exchanges. Participants are
free to trade electricity until 1 hour ahead of real
time for any half-hour period. From that point
until real time, the market operates through a
balancing mechanism run by the National Grid
Company pic - because of the need to balance the
system on a second-by-second basis. NETA took
effect through conditions inserted into generation,
supply and transmission licences.
Scotland
Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy
generate, transmit, distribute and supply
electricity within their respective franchise areas.
They are also contracted to buy all the output
from British Energy’s two Scottish nuclear power
stations (Hunterston B and Torness) until 2005.
The over 100 kW market in Scotland comprises
about 6,750 customers and accounts for around
45 per cent of all electricity consumed. All major
suppliers compete in Scotland. In 2000/01,
29.5 per cent of customers in the over 100 kW
market obtained their power from holders of
second-tier supply licences. In 1999 Ofgem
proposed the establishment of BETTA (British
Electricity Transmission and Trading
Arrangements), an extension of NETA to Scotland
and aimed at bringing greater competition to the
Scottish market. Included in the BETTA proposals
is the creation of a single system operator, which
442
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
would monitor the balancing of supply and
demand and trading. BETTA is scheduled to be
introduced by April 2004.
Northern Ireland
Three private companies, AES (NI) Ltd, Premier
Power Ltd and Coolkeeragh Power Ltd, generate
electricity from three power stations. Most of the
electricity generated is sold to Northern Ireland
Electricity pic (NIE), which has a monopoly of
transmission and distribution, and a right to
supply. The market has been gradually opened up
to competition since 1999. In 2001 the right to
choose a supplier was extended to 35 per cent of
the total market (mainly large industrial and
public sector consumers). In addition, a number
of second-tier suppliers are now operating.
In April 2002 the grid operator for Northern
Ireland and Electricity Supply Board National
Grid, the transmission system operator in the Irish
Republic, opened three upgraded electricity
interconnectors linking the electricity system of
Northern Ireland with the Republic. The main
North-South interconnector has a capacity to
trade 2 x 600 MW of power, enough electricity to
power several major towns. The interconnectors
enable trade of electricity between Northern
Ireland and the Republic and through the Moyle
Interconnector (Northern Ireland-Scotland) with
regions throughout Britain.
NIE’s parent company, the Viridian Group, made
a significant contribution towards a competitive
Irish market by investing in the North-South
interconnectors, the NIE Moyle Interconnector
with Scotland and the Huntstown power station
near Dublin. The wider interconnection strategy is
laying the foundation for a modern, competitive
all-island electricity market offering competition
and security of supply.
Regulation and other functions
The gas and electricity markets in Great Britain
are regulated by Ofgem, which is governed by an
authority whose powers are provided under the
Gas Act 1986, the Electricity Act 1989 and the
Utilities Act 2000. Ofgem’s principal objective is to
protect the interests of gas and electricity
customers, wherever appropriate, by promoting
effective competition. Other duties and objectives
include ensuring that reasonable demands for
electricity are met and that electricity and gas
licensees are able to finance their statutory
obligations. Ofgem is responsible for setting
performance standards for gas and electricity
companies, and for price regulation of companies
where competition has not yet fully emerged or
where there is a natural monopoly.
In Northern Ireland the energy regulator holds
two separate statutory appointments: Director
General of Northern Ireland Electricity and
Director General of Gas Northern Ireland.
Consumption
In 2001 sales of electricity through the public
distribution system in the UK amounted to 321.8
TWh. Domestic users took 36 per cent of the total,
industry 32 per cent, and commercial and other
users the remainder. The average price for
electricity in the UK fell by 27 per cent in real
terms between 1991 and 2001 for domestic
customers. Over the same period industrial
customers saw prices fall by 34 per cent in real
terms (37 per cent excluding the climate change
levy, which came into effect in April 2001). By
December 2001, just over 8.0 million customers
had chosen a supplier other than their historical
local electricity supplier. In 2001 these customers
saved an average of £18 on their annual bill over
customers who had not changed supplier. The
average annual domestic electricity bill in the UK
for a customer paying by standard credit (paying
monthly in advance by cheque or cash, at a bank
or post office) was estimated at £250 in 2001.
Generation
Non-nuclear power stations owned by the UK’s
major power producers consumed 55.8 million
tonnes of oil equivalent in 2001, of which coal
accounted for 54.9 per cent and natural gas for
42.7 per cent. Other power companies (for which
gas is the most widely used fuel) and over 2,000
small autogenerators (which produce power for
their own use) have equal access with the major
generators to the grid transmission and local
distribution systems. A ten-year programme to
control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx)
through the installation of low-NOx burners at 12
major power stations in England and Wales is in
progress.
Combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs)
In 2001 CCGT stations accounted for 33 per cent
of the electricity generated by major power
producers, compared with 16 per cent in 1995.
This increase has been balanced by a fall in
coal- and oil-fired generation. CCGT stations,
favoured by the smaller, independent producers

and using natural gas, offer cheap generation, and
give out almost no sulphur dioxide and some 55
per cent less C02 than coal-fired plant per unit of
electricity. At the end of March 2002, 27 such
stations in the UK (with a total registered capacity
of 20.5 GW) were generating power. With the
introduction of NETA (see page 442), the
Government has lifted restrictions on the building
of new CCGTs.
Combined heat and power (CHR)
CHP plants are designed to produce both
electricity and usable heat. They convert about
80 per cent of fuel input into useful energy,
compared with conventional generation, which
wastes at least half the energy content of the fuel
and emits considerably more C02. CHP thus
benefits the environment and contributes to UK
climate change targets by reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases. It is also used for cooling and
chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy sources.
It offers particular benefits where there is a regular
need for heat as well as electricity - in hospitals,
leisure centres and housing developments for
example - and can be provided on a local scale.
About 83 per cent of CHP plants are less than
1 MW capacity; however, large-scale plant (above
10 MW) represents just under 80 per cent of total
CHP capacity. In 2001 over 1,500 CHP schemes
supplied more than 4,800 MW of generating
capacity and produced a total of 22.3 TWh. This
represents 6 per cent of the UK’s total electricity
generated (and 6 per cent of electricity
consumption in the commercial and industrial
sectors). The Government aims to have at least
10,000 MW by 2010. EU strategy is to double
CHP’s share of the electricity market from
9 per cent in 2001 to 18 per cent by the same year.
The Government promotes CHP by administering
a quality assurance programme under the Energy
Efficiency Best Practice Programme (EEBPP)
(see page 445), to assess CHP schemes for
exemption from the climate change levy and for
other benefits. The Whitehall District Heating
system in London includes a CHP plant serving 23
government buildings, among them 10 Downing
Street.
Trade
National Grid and Electricite de France run a
2,000 MW cross-Channel cable link, allowing
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. The link has generally been used to
supply ‘baseload’ power - which needs to be
generated and available round the clock - from
France to England. Imports met just under
3 per cent of the UK’s electricity needs in 2001.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of under
6 GWh and generating capacity of over 9 GW.
The additional available capacity is used to
supply England and Wales through transmission
lines linking the Scottish and English grid
systems. This interconnector’s capacity is now

1,600 MW, with plans to increase it to 2,200 MW.
The 60-km 500 MW undersea interconnector
between Scotland and Northern Ireland (see page
443) will allow further exports of power from
Scotland.
New and renewable sources of energy
The Government is committed to meeting targets
to reduce UK emissions of greenhouse gases
(see page 434). It is putting in place measures
designed to ensure that the UK exceeds its
commitment to reduce emissions of these gases by
12.5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010. A growth
in the proportion of electricity generated from
renewable sources will play a vital role in these
efforts. The Government aims to increase the
percentage of electricity generated from renewable
sources from the current level of just under
3 per cent to 10 per cent by 2010, subject to the
cost being acceptable to consumers. The Orders
for the Renewables Obligation for England and
Wales and the associated Scottish Renewables
Obligation were implemented in April 2002. These
orders will oblige all licensed electricity suppliers
to ensure that a specified proportion of their
supplies is derived from renewable sources.
The Government is allocating over £260 million
during 2001-04 to promote renewables
technologies. This includes:
■ capital grants of £89 million for offshore
wind power, energy crops and small-scale
biomass from the DTI and the New
Opportunities Fund;
■ an expanded DTI R&D programme worth
£55.5 million; and
■ the allocation of £100 million following the
report by the Cabinet Office’s Performance
and Innovation Unit (see page 433).
Photovoltaics (solar electricity) will also benefit
through a major installation programme, the first
phase of which has been allocated £10 million.
DEFRA will distribute £12.5 million in grants for
the further development of energy crops.
A large number of British companies are involved
in an expanding global market for renewables
technologies, directly employing several thousand
people, and with a multi-million-pound export
business. A specific government unit, Renewables
UK, has been established to help manufacturers of
renewable equipment and technology. It will
promote the UK as a renewables manufacturing
base and support the renewables industries. Based
in Aberdeen, it aims to raise awareness of the
industry and to take advantage of transferable
skills from the established oil and gas industry.
Elean power station at Sutton (Cambridgeshire) is
the UK’s first straw-fired power plant. With a
potential output of 36 MW, it burns 200,000
tonnes of straw a year and generates enough
power for 80,000 homes. The world’s first
commercial wave power station has been
commissioned on the coast of Islay, Scotland,
following the award of a contract under the
Scottish Renewables Obligation. This is the Land
Installed Marine Powered Energy Transformer
(LIMPET), which has been developed by Wavegen
and Queen’s University Belfast with EU support,
and harnesses oscillating water column technology
to provide 500 kW for the national grid.
Wind power
Wind power has a significant role to play in
assisting the UK in reducing its carbon dioxide
emissions and combating climate change. National
Wind Power, PowerGen, RES and Scottish Power
plan, develop and operate wind energy projects
and together have a considerable portfolio of wind
farm projects, both in the UK and overseas.
Total UK wind generating capacity now stands at
500 MW, and wind power provides 0.37 per cent
of the UK’s electricity demand. Just over 64 MW
of wind power was installed in 2001, according to
the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA).
Nearly 100 MW of wind power construction is
confirmed for 2002, which would increase the
UK’s total installed capacity by about 20 per cent.
Britain’s coastal waters offer the potential of an
abundant supply of wind power, if it can be
harnessed effectively and efficiently. The UK’s first
offshore wind farm, off the Northumberland coast
at Blyth, consists of two 2 MW turbines and began
generating power in 2000. It was developed by the
Border Wind consortium, with financial help from
the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (which preceded
the Renewables Obligation) and an EU grant. The
Government is seeking to streamline the planning
consent process for wind power. A major step has
been the announcement of 18 potential sites as
having pre-qualified for leases from the Crown
Estates, which could result in a maximum of 540
turbines if all were to go ahead.

Energy efficiency
The Government funds a number of energy
efficiency programmes in the UK. Over
£200 million of the revenue from the climate
change levy in its first two years is going to
support energy efficiency measures and renewables,
including 100 per cent first-year capital allowances
for energy-saving investments. These initiatives are
an essential part of the UK strategy for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions (see page 434) and
achieving the Government’s domestic goal of a
20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2010.
The Carbon Trust was set up in 2001 as an
independent, non-profit-making company to
accelerate the take-up of low-carbon technologies
in the non-domestic sector. The Trust’s funding is
around £50 million a year from the UK
Government - partly from recycled receipts from
the climate change levy. It has taken over the
former non-domestic Energy Efficiency Best
Practice Programme (EEBPP), which was the
main source of independent authoritative
information and advice on energy efficiency and is
estimated to have produced energy savings of
more than 4 million tonnes of carbon a year by
2000. The Trust has also taken over the
administration of the Government’s Enhanced
Capital Allowance scheme for energy-saving
technologies, worth about £130 million in
2002/03, depending on take-up. In addition, it is
developing a Low Carbon Innovation Programme
that aims to accelerate the development of new
and emerging low-carbon and energy-efficient
technologies in the UK.
The Energy Saving Trust (EST) was set up by the
Government and the major energy companies to
work through partnerships towards the
sustainable and efficient use of energy. In 2001/02
it received £24.5 million in direct government
funding for work with the domestic and small
business sectors and £16.4 million on transport-
related programmes; its UK-wide programmes
brought in an extra £75 million of investment.
Since 1994 the public electricity suppliers (see
page 442) have invested nearly £26 million a year
in energy efficiency measures under the regulator’s
successive Energy Efficiency Standards of
Performance (EESOP) schemes. The energy
companies are increasing their investment in
EESOP schemes to about £55 million a year over
2000-02, including scheme delivery costs. Since
1994 EESOP programmes have resulted in more
than 500,000 insulation improvements and the
sale of 13.5 million energy-efficient light bulbs.
Under the Utilities Act 2000, the Government has
the power to set such energy efficiency
requirements. The Energy Efficiency Commitment
(EEC) for 2002-05 commenced in April 2002. The
EEC (which is replacing EESOP) places an
obligation on energy suppliers to promote
improvements in energy efficiency by domestic
consumers. It will make a contribution to carbon
savings in the domestic sector as part of the UK
Climate Change Programme. It will also help the
Government achieve its commitment to alleviate
fuel poverty by directing 50 per cent of energy
savings to lower income consumers.
Fuel poverty
The UK Fuel Poverty Strategy was jointly
published in November 2001 by DEFRA and DTI
in accordance with the Warm Homes and Energy
Conservation Act 2000. The general definition of a
fuel poor household is one that needs to spend
more than 10 per cent of its income on fuel to
keep warm. Approximately 4 million households
in the UK were in fuel poverty in 2000. The
Strategy commits the Government to end fuel
poverty for vulnerable households - the elderly,
those with children, and the disabled and long¬
term sick - by 2010. The Government’s approach
to tackling fuel poverty in England is based on
improving energy inefficient homes, reducing fuel
bills, and tackling low incomes and
unemployment.
The Fuel Poverty Strategy states that ‘the
Government believes that a substantial majority of
the 2.2 to 2.4 million vulnerable fuel poor
households in England will require assistance
through energy efficiency improvements’. The
main programme for the provision of energy
efficiency measures in England is the Flome
Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES), now marketed
as Warm Front Team (WFT). WFT has a budget of
over £600 million for the period 2000-04 and is
targeted specifically at vulnerable households in
the private sector. It offers grants of up to £1,500
for packages of insulation and heating
improvements (except central heating) for low-
income families with children and for the
disabled, and up to £2,500, including packages of
insulation and central heating, for those aged 60
and over on low incomes.
446
Economic affairs
28 Energy and natural resources
In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government is
making over £11 million available to fund HEES
during 2002/03, in order to tackle fuel poverty
among the estimated 220,000 affected households
in Wales. While broadly similar to HEES that
operates in England, there are a number of
differences. Grant rates are £1,500 for a basic
insulation package and £2,700 for heating and
insulation. The heating package is also available to
lone-parent and chronically sick and disabled
households, in addition to the over 60s.
Water supply
About 75 per cent of the UK’s water supplies is
obtained from mountain lakes, reservoirs and
river intakes and about 25 per cent from
underground sources (stored in layers of porous
rock). South-east England and East Anglia are
more dependent on groundwater than any other
parts of the UK. Scotland and Wales have a
relative abundance of unpolluted water from
upland sources. Northern Ireland also has
plentiful supplies for domestic use and for
industry.
Water put into the public water supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in England
and Wales averaged 15,259 megalitres a day
(Ml/d) in 2000/01. An average of 2,400 Ml/d was
supplied in Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the
figure was 720 Ml/d. In 1999/2000 the average
daily consumption per head was 151 litres.
Some 54,148 Ml/d were abstracted from all surface
and groundwaters (for example, rivers and
reservoirs) in England and Wales in 1999, of
which public water supplies accounted for 16,255
Ml/d. The electricity supply industry took 26,515
Ml/d and agriculture 142 Ml/d.
England and Wales
Water companies
The 24 water companies across England and Wales
have statutory responsibilities for public water
supply, including quality and sufficiency. Ten of
these companies are also responsible for public
sewerage and sewage treatment.
The Water Industry Act 1999 prohibits water
companies from disconnecting households and
other premises deemed vital to the community.
The 1999 Act also makes provision for the
protection of water customers on metered
supplies who are vulnerable to hardship because
of high bills. These include large low-income
families, the elderly and the disabled. Since 1989
water bills have risen by more than a third in real
terms. The UK Government’s draft Water Bill,
published in November 2000, contains clauses to
encourage the efficient use of water, including
changes to the licensing system for water
abstraction (with increased penalties for
abstraction and impounding offences), and
provisions to improve the regulation of the
water industry and promote the interests of
consumers.
Watermark (www.watermark.gov.uk), a
government-backed initiative, aims to develop a
database that will give the public sector, which has
a water bill of £600 million a year, reliable
benchmarks against which to measure its
consumption. Such data, it is estimated, could save
£60 million of this amount.
During 2000/05 the water companies are required
to pay for a capital investment programme costing
an estimated £15.6 billion,2 including £7.4 billion
on improving water quality and on meeting new
UK and EU environmental standards. The
Director General of Water Services, who heads
Ofwat (Office of Water Services)
(www.ofwat.gov.uk), the industry’s regulatory
body, has determined that the companies’
efficiency improvements will mostly fund the
investments specified. Household customers saw
an average increase of 2.3 per cent in their bills for
water and sewerage services for 2001/02, coming
after an average 11.3 per cent reduction in their
bills for 1999/2000. About 22 per cent of
households and 90 per cent of commercial and
industrial customers are currently charged for
water on the basis of consumption measured by
meter. Most homes are still charged according to
the rateable value of their property. Provisions
made in the Water Industry Act 1999 have given
customers increased choice over whether or not to
have their bills based on a water meter. As a result,
all water companies now supply free meters to
households on request. Average water and
sewerage bills were £236 for households without a

sewerage systems; providing new sewers, and tanks to prevent
sewage overflows; removal of lead from supply pipes; and
replacement of iron water mains, which cause discoloration.

The main role of the Drinking Water Inspectorate
(DWI) is to check that water companies in
England and Wales supply wholesome water and
comply with the requirements of the Water
Quality Regulation. In 2001, 99.86 per cent of the
2.8 million drinking water samples taken met the
quality standards. The Water Supply (Water
Quality) Regulations 2000 were introduced to
implement the European Directive on Drinking
Water Quality and require new standards to be
met by 2003, with the exception of the final
standard for lead, which needs to be met by 2013.
Competition
The UK Government and the National Assembly
for Wales intend to extend the opportunities for
competition in the water industry in England and
Wales and will take steps to safeguard water
quality, public health and wider social policies. In
July 2002 a joint consultation paper was issued
seeking views on the possible extension of
opportunities for competition, including the
licensing of new entrants into the market for
production and retail activities.
In March 2000, the Competition Act 1998 (see page
341) came into force and strengthened regulators’
powers against anti-competitive behaviour. The Act
has enabled the shared use of distribution networks
(often referred to as common carriage) and Ofwat
has actively encouraged water companies to
develop access codes. By September 2000 eight
‘inset appointments’ had been made under which a
water company can seek to be appointed to supply
a customer in another appointed water company’s
area. Five of these appointments have involved
Anglian Water, and one a new entrant. In August
2000 the UK Government lowered the ‘inset’
threshold in England from 250 million litres to 100
million litres a year.
Water leakage
Targets are set each year for water companies in
England and Wales to reduce leakage. In 2000/01,
3,243 megalitres per day of water put into the
supply in England and Wales were lost through
leakage, 37 per cent lower than in the peak year of
1994/95.
Scotland
Scottish Water is a new organisation created from
the merger of the three former water authorities
in Scotland as a result of the Water Industry
(Scotland) Act 2002. It provides water and waste
water services to household and business
customers across one-third of the land area in
Britain. Scottish Water remains in the public
sector and is answerable to the Scottish
Parliament.
Scottish Water is the fourth largest water services
provider in the UK and the twelfth biggest
business in Scotland by turnover. Its assets are
valued at £13 billion, and the company serves over
5 million customers with drinking water and also
provides sewerage services. It supplies
approximately 2.5 billion litres of water a day.
Scottish Water is accountable to a number of
regulatory bodies:
■ the Water Industry Commissioner for
Scotland;
■ the Scottish Environment Protection Agency;
and
■ the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for
Scotland.
Northern Ireland
The Water Service is an Executive Agency with the
Department for Regional Development. It is
responsible for the supply and distribution of
drinking water and the provision of sewerage
services to over 720,000 domestic, agricultural,
commercial and business customers throughout
Northern Ireland. It has an annual budget, before
capital charges, of £255 million and fixed assets
valued at £4.9 billion.
The Water Service envisages expenditure of up to
£2.5 billion will be required over 15-20 years to
bring water and sewerage services up to standard
and to meet increasing demand.
Non-energy minerals
Output of non-energy minerals in 2000 was 306.9
million tonnes, valued at nearly £2.4 billion. The
total number of employees in the extractive
industry was about 24,900.
The UK is virtually self-sufficient in construction
minerals, and produces and exports several

north-east England is the UK’s most important
non-energy mineral operation. Production in
2001 was 890,000 tonnes, of which 59 per cent
was exported. Sales of china clay (or kaolin), the
largest export, were 2.4 million tonnes, of which
87 per cent was exported.
The largest non-energy mineral imports are
metals (ores, concentrates and scrap - valued at
£2.0 billion in 2000), refined non-ferrous metals
(£3.9 billion), iron and steel (£2.2 billion), and
non-metallic mineral products (£6.6 billion, of
which rough diamonds account for £4.4 billion).

29 Finance and other service industries
Historically, the heart of the UK financial services
industry has been in the ‘Square Mile’ in the City
of London, and this remains broadly the case.
Among the major financial institutions and
markets in the City are the Bank of England, the
London Stock Exchange and Lloyd’s insurance
market. London is one of the three main financial
centres in the world and the premier financial
centre in Europe. Scotland (Edinburgh and
Glasgow) is the second financial centre in the UK,
and one of the main European centres for
institutional equities - at the end of 2001 over
£326 billion of funds were under management in
Scotland. Other sizeable UK financial centres are
Leeds, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham.
International Financial Services London (IFSL)
(www.ifsl.org.uk) promotes the international
activities of UK-based financial institutions and
related professional and business services. It also
seeks to raise awareness of the UK’s leading role in
international financial markets and highlight the
major contribution of financial services to the UK
economy.
Scale of the financial services sector
The UK's trade surplus on financial services is the
largest in the world. A report by IFSL in April 2002
confirmed the UK's strong international position in
financial services:
■ UK banking sector assets reached over £3,400
billion at the end of 2001;
■ assets under fund management in the UK were
over £2,800 billion in 2000, of which nearly
£600 billion was managed on behalf of overseas
clients;
■ London has the world's second largest
derivatives exchange;
■ London is the biggest international centre for
foreign exchange trading;
■ the revenue of UK management consultancies
reached £8 billion in 2001, up by £2 billion
compared with 1999; and
■ five of the ten largest law firms in the world are
international law firms based in London.
Bank of England
The Bank of England (www.bankofengland.co.uk)
was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and
Royal Charter as a corporate body. Its capital stock
was acquired by the Government in 1946.
As the UK’s central bank, the Bank’s overriding
objective is to maintain a stable and efficient
monetary and financial framework for the
effective operation of the economy. In pursuing
this goal, it has three main purposes:
■ maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
■ maintaining the stability of the financial
system; and
■ seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
Under the Bank of England Act 1998, the Court of
Directors is responsible for managing the affairs of
the Bank, apart from the formulation of monetary
policy, and comprises the Governor, two Deputy
Governors and 16 non-executive directors. The
Court is required to report annually to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Monetary policy framework
The Bank’s monetary policy objective is to
maintain price stability and, subject to that, to
support the Government’s economic policy,
including growth and employment objectives.
Price stability is defined in terms of the
Government’s inflation target (see page 334). The
responsibility for meeting this target and for
setting interest rates rests with the Bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee, which comprises the
Governor, the two Deputy Governors and six
other members. The Committee meets every
month and interest rate decisions are announced
as soon as is practicable after the meeting; the
minutes are published within two weeks and are
placed on the Bank’s website. The Committee is
accountable to the Bank’s Court of Directors, to
government and to Parliament.
Financial stability
Under the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Bank, HM Treasury and the Financial
Services Authority, the Bank is responsible for the
overall stability of the financial system, and its
Financial Stability Committee oversees its work in
452
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
this area. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank
may provide financial support as a last resort to
prevent problems affecting one financial
institution from spreading to other parts of the
financial system. It also oversees the effectiveness
of the financial sector in meeting the needs of
customers and in maintaining the sector’s
international competitiveness.
Other main functions
The Bank, through its daily operations in the
money market, supplies the funds which the
banking system as a whole needs to achieve
balance at the end of each day. By setting the
interest rate for these operations, the Bank
influences the general level of interest rates as the
interest rate at which the Bank deals is quickly
passed on through the financial system, which
in turn affects the whole pattern of interest rates
across the UK economy.
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It plays
a key role in payment and settlement systems.
Banknotes and coins
In England and Wales the Bank has the sole right
to issue banknotes, which are backed by
government and other securities. The profit from
the note issue is paid directly to the Government.
Three Scottish and four Northern Ireland banks
may also issue notes, but these have to be fully
backed by Bank of England notes.
The circulation of coins is the responsibility of the
Royal Mint. At the end of 2000 there were over

Banking services
The UK is a major banking centre, and UK
banking sector assets were valued at over
£3,400 billion at the end of 2001, nearly three
times the level in 1991, with over half being
owned by overseas banks, mostly from the EU.
At the end of March 2002 there were 184 authorised
banks incorporated in the UK and a further 113
authorised branches of banks incorporated outside
the European Economic Area. In addition,
377 branches of European-authorised institutions
were entitled to accept deposits in the UK.
‘Retail’ banking primarily caters for personal
customers and small businesses. Nearly all banks
also engage in some ‘wholesale’ activities, which
involve taking larger deposits, deploying funds in
money-market instruments, and making
corporate loans and investments, while some
concentrate on wholesale business. Banks feature
strongly among the UK’s top companies (see page
343). Six of the top 20 companies by market
Contribution of banking to the UK economy
A report by IFSL, published in April 2002, found that
the banking industry contributed about 3.6 per cent
of the UK's GDP and provided around 445,000 jobs,
or around 40 per cent of employment in financial
services. Banking generated £3.2 billion in overseas
earnings in 2001. Other strengths identified by the
report included:
■ banking sector deposits in the UK were the third
largest in the world, being exceeded only by
those in Japan and the United States;
■ the UK is the world's largest single market for
cross-border banking, with nearly 20 per cent of
international bank lending in December 2001;
■ London is one of the most important centres for
onshore private banking and the second most
popular destination for offshore wealth after
Switzerland; and
■ London is the largest investment banking centre
in Europe.

Scotland, Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HBOS and Abbey
National.
Retail bank services include current accounts,
savings accounts, loan arrangements, credit and
debit cards, mortgages, insurance, investment
products, share-dealing services and ‘wealth
management’ services. Around 92 per cent of
households in Great Britain have at least one adult
member with a bank or building society or other
savings account (see Table 29.3).
‘Universal banking services’, giving access to the
banks’ basic bank accounts and a new Post Office
card account, are expected to be available through
post offices from 2003. The services are intended
to tackle financial exclusion and bring those
people without bank accounts into the financial
mainstream, while ensuring that benefit recipients
and pensioners can continue to receive their
money in cash at their local post office when such
payments are automated in 2003. The major
financial institutions have agreed to contribute by
making their own basic bank accounts accessible

card account.
Traditionally, the major retail banks have operated
through their local branches, but the number of
such branches is falling as banks have taken steps to
cut costs. This is partly because more customers are
using telephone and Internet banking. According to
APACS (see page 455), over 15 million people in
the UK accessed their current accounts in 2001
using the telephone, the Internet or interactive
digital television. About a third of these used
remote banking to initiate 58 million payments in
2001, with the most popular application being the
settlement of credit card bills. The UK is the largest
European online banking market. Most major
banks have introduced Internet banking, either as
an additional option for customers or as a separate
stand-alone facility.
Supervision
Banks are regulated by the Financial Services
Authority (see page 463). They are required to
meet minimum standards on the integrity and
competence of directors and management, the
adequacy of capital and cash flow, and the systems
and controls to deal with the risks they
experience. If a bank fails to meet the criteria, its
activities may be restricted, or it may be closed.
These arrangements are intended to strengthen,
but not guarantee, the protection of bank
depositors, thereby increasing confidence in the
banking system as a whole.
Competition
A major review of banking services, Competition
in UK Banking: A Report to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, published in 2000, recommended a
more competitive policy framework for UK
banking. In response, the Government announced
measures designed to improve competition and
deliver benefits to consumers.
In March 2002 the Competition Commission
issued a report on small business banking, which
found that there was a complex monopoly in the
supply of banking services to small and medium¬
sized enterprises (SMEs) and identified practices
carried out by the UK’s eight main clearing banks
that restricted or distorted competition and
operated against the public interest. It
recommended a number of changes to the banks’
practices with the intention of reducing barriers to
entry, improving choice for SMEs and making
454
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
easier the switching of accounts between banks.
The Government has accepted the Commission’s
report and recommendations, and the Director
General of Fair Trading is seeking undertakings
from the banks on the proposed changes.
Investment and private banking
London is a major international centre for
investment and private banking, and accounts for
an estimated 50 per cent of investment banking
activity in Europe. Global banks dominate the
international market, and most have headquarters
or a major office in London.
Investment banks offer a range of professional
financial services, including corporate finance and
asset management. Advice on mergers and
acquisitions accounted for 57 per cent of
investment banking revenue originating in the UK
in 2001. Equity underwriting accounted for a
further 25 per cent, and banks facilitate a wide
range of equity finance transactions, such as
flotations, the issue or placing of new shares, and
management buy-outs.
The UK, along with the United States and
Switzerland, is one of the top centres for private
banking. Some £360 billion of private client
securities are managed by banks, fund managers
and stockbrokers in the UK.
Building societies
Building societies are mutual institutions, owned
collectively by their savers and borrowers. As well
as their retail deposit-taking services, they
specialise in housing finance, making long-term
mortgage loans against the security of property -
usually private dwellings purchased for owner-
occupation. Some of the larger societies provide a
full range of personal banking services. According
to the Building Societies Association (BSA)
(www.bsa.org.uk), about 15 million adults have
building society savings accounts (around
25 million accounts), and over 2.5 million
borrowers are buying their homes through
mortgage loans from a building society. The
chief requirements for societies are that:
■ their principal purpose is making loans which
are secured on residential property and are
funded substantially by their members;
■ at least 75 per cent per cent of lending has to
be on the security of housing; and
■ a minimum of 50 per cent of funds must be
in the form of deposits made by individual
members.
There are 65 authorised building societies, all of
which are members of the BSA, with total assets of
over £175 billion and around 2,100 branches. The
largest society is the Nationwide, with assets of
£75 billion in April 2002.
The number of societies has fallen substantially in
recent years as a result of mergers and as several
large societies have given up their mutual status
and become banks. Many of the remaining
societies have taken steps to defend their mutual
status, for example, by requiring new members to
assign to charity any ‘windfall’ payments arising
from a conversion.
Payment systems
Apart from credit and debit card arrangements, the
main payment systems are run by three separate
companies operating under an umbrella
organisation, the Association for Payment Clearing
Services (APACS) (www.apacs.org.uk). One system,
Cheque and Credit Clearing, covers bulk paper
clearings - cheques and paper credits. A second,
CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payment
System), is a nationwide electronic transfer service
for same-day payments. A third, BAGS (formerly
Bankers’ Automated Clearing Services), covers bulk
electronic clearing for direct credits, standing
orders and direct debits. A total of 31 banks and
building societies are members of one or more
clearing companies, while several hundred others
obtain access to APACS clearing through agency
arrangements with one of the members.
The Government plans legislation to establish a
new regulatory framework governing UK payment
systems. As a result, the Office of Fair Trading (see
page 341) would have new powers to promote
competition in payment systems.
Trends in financial transactions
Major changes in the nature of financial
transactions have included the rapid growth in the
use of plastic cards (which first appeared in 1966)
and of automated teller machines (ATMs).
According to APACS, there are about 137 million
plastic cards in issue in the UK, with 89 per cent
of adults holding one or more cards. In 2001 there
were over 6.6 billion plastic card transactions in
the UK. Most small non-regular payments are still

made by cash, but the trend is away from cash and
cheques towards greater use of plastic cards (see
Table 29.4).
Consumers now acquire more than half their cash
through withdrawals from ATMs, which in 2001
dispensed £127.7 billion in 2.2 billion transactions.
The number of ATMs has more than doubled in
the last ten years, to 36,700 at the end of 2001.
About two-thirds of adults use ATMs regularly,
making on average 70 withdrawals a year.
Direct debit and standing order payments account
for nearly 60 per cent of regular bill payments,
and 72 per cent of adults have set up at least one
direct debit or standing order. Many mortgage and
other loan repayments and life insurance
contributions are made by direct debit, as are the
majority of electricity, gas, water and council tax
bills. Direct debit payments rose by 7 per cent to
reach 2.2 billion in 2001.
Plastic cards
Debit cards, where payments are deducted directly
from the purchaser’s bank or building society
account, were first issued in 1987 and the number
of cards is growing strongly. They are often
combined with cheque guarantee and ATM
facilities in a single card. About 54 million cards
have been issued, and 80 per cent of adults in the
UK hold a debit card. Over half of adults are
regular users, with each making on average 116
debit card payments in 2001. The total number of
debit card payments in the UK was 2.7 billion in
2001, 15 per cent higher than in 2000.
There are about 56 million credit cards (including
charge cards) in use in the UK, and 60 per cent of
adults have at least one credit card. There are a
large number of credit card providers and over
1,300 different brands of card. They have become
increasingly popular as a source of consumer credit
and are also the most common way for adults to
buy goods and services using the Internet.
Fraud losses on UK-issued plastic cards have risen
considerably and totalled £411 million in 2001,
with counterfeit cards accounting for the biggest
proportion of card crime, about 39 per cent. To
combat fraud, banks are investing in highly secure
chip cards, in which information is contained
on a microchip embedded in the card. About
25 million chip cards have been issued. Cash
machines and point-of-sale terminals are also
456
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
being upgraded. By 2005 plastic cards will be
authorised in the UK by the customer keying in
his or her PIN (personal identification number)
rather than by signing a receipt.
National Savings and Investments
National Savings and Investments (NS&I)
{www.nsandi.com), an executive agency of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a source of finance
for government borrowing and offers personal
savers a range of investments. Formerly known as
National Savings, it changed its corporate name in
February 2002 to reflect the changes in products
provided and enhancements in services to its
customers. It is developing new products and
services, and in March 2002 launched its first
guaranteed equity bond, where the return is
linked to the performance of the FTSE 100 index.
Gross sales of NS&I products totalled £10.3 billion
in 2001/02 and over £62.4 billion remained
invested in NS&I products as at March 2002.
Premium Bonds are held by around 23 million
people and are entered in a monthly draw, with
tax-free prizes (instead of interest) ranging from
£50 to a single top prize each month of £1 million.
Other savings products include Savings Certificates
(both Fixed Interest and Index-linked), Pensioners
Bonds, Children’s Bonus Bonds, cash mini ISAs
(see page 460), and Ordinary and Investment
Accounts (where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at post offices).
Friendly societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals, offering
their members a limited range of financial and
insurance services, such as small-scale savings
products, life insurance and provision against loss
of income through sickness or unemployment.
Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000,
the Government removed on 1 December 2001
the remaining restrictions on the activities of
friendly society subsidiaries.
At the end of March 2002 there were 237 friendly
societies, of which life directive and incorporated
societies carrying on long-term business
accounted for 95 per cent of the movement’s total
funds. There were 36 life directive societies, which
are subject to the requirement of the EC Life
Insurance Directive, and six societies incorporated
under the Friendly Societies Act 1992.
Credit unions
Credit unions are mutually owned financial co¬
operatives established under the Credit Unions
Act 1979. They aim to promote thrift among
members, create sources of credit at a reasonable
rate of interest, and use and control members’
savings for their mutual benefit. There are 700
credit unions registered in Great Britain, with
a membership of about 300,000 and assets of
around £200 million.
Responsibility for registration and supervision of
credit unions passed to the Financial Services
Authority (see page 463) in December 2001 and
a new regulatory regime for credit unions took
effect in July 2002. Among the key features of the
regime are that credit unions have to meet a basic
test of solvency and maintain a level of initial
capital and a minimum liquidity ratio, while for
the first time members have protection for their
deposits through the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (see pages 463-4).
Private equity/venture capital
Private equity/venture capital companies offer
medium- and long-term equity financing for new
and developing businesses, management buy-outs
and buy-ins, and company rescues. The British
Venture Capital Association (BVCA)
{www.bvca.co.uk) has 169 full members, and
represents private equity and venture capital
sources in the UK. During 2001, according to a
report for the BVCA based on data provided by
97 per cent of its members, UK private equity and
venture capital firms invested in a record 1,597
businesses worldwide, although the amount
invested, at £6,164 million, was 25 per cent less
than in 2000. Of this investment, £4,752 million
(77 per cent) was in the UK. The Government is
encouraging the further development of venture
capital, including new Regional Venture Capital
Funds (see chapter 22).
Other credit and financial services
Finance houses and leasing companies provide
consumer credit, business finance and leasing, and
motor finance. The 109 full members of the
Finance and Leasing Association carried out new
business worth £74 billion in 2001.
Factoring and invoice discounting comprises a
range of financial services, including credit
management and finance in exchange for
outstanding invoices. The industry provides
working capital to nearly 30,000 businesses a year.
457
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
Member companies of the Factors & Discounters
Association {www.factors.org.uk) handled business
worth £89 billion in 2001, 16 per cent higher than
in 2000.
Insurance
The UK insurance industry is the largest in
Europe and the third largest in the world. In 2001
it employed almost 360,000 people in insurance
companies, Lloyd’s of London, insurance brokers
and other related activities, representing in total
over a third of all employment in financial
services. About 50,000 of these jobs are supported
by the London Market, a unique international
wholesale insurance market.
Net worldwide premiums generated by the UK
insurance industry reached £156 billion in 2001,
according to the Association of British Insurers
(ABI) {www.abi.org.uk). UK risks were
£119 billion and overseas risks £37 billion. The
industry has almost £1,100 billion invested in
company shares and other assets.
Main types of insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance: long¬
term (such as life insurance), where contracts may
be for periods of many years; and general, where
contracts are for a year or less. Most insurance
companies reinsure their risks; this performs an
important function in spreading losses and in
helping companies manage their businesses.
UK long-term insurance has been rising more
rapidly than general insurance, and in 2001
accounted for £117 billion of net worldwide
premiums by the UK industry, compared with
£39 billion of general insurance. Life insurance
accounted for 40 per cent of long-term premium
income, occupational pensions 31 per cent and
individual pensions 25 per cent. About 54 per cent
of households have life insurance cover.
Motor insurance accounts for over a quarter of
general insurance premiums. Other important
areas are property insurance, and accident and
health insurance. Independent intermediaries
distributed 57 per cent of general insurance
premiums in 2001, direct selling 21 per cent,
company agents 10 per cent and banks and
building societies 7 per cent. Direct selling in areas
such as motor and household insurance has
increased, reflecting the growth of insurers
offering telephone-based and Internet-based
services.
Structure of the industry
At the end of 2001, 808 companies were
authorised to conduct one or more classes of
insurance business in the UK. Nearly 600
companies carry on general business only, 160 are
authorised for long-term business only and about
60 are authorised to conduct both types of
business. About 400 companies belong to the ABI.
The industry includes both public limited
companies and mutual institutions (companies
owned by their policyholders), although the
mutual sector has gradually contracted. The
biggest insurance group in the UK is Aviva
(formerly CGNU), while Standard Life is the
largest mutual insurer in Europe.
Insurance firms and markets have recently been
adversely affected by a number of events, in
particular costs arising from the collapse of the
World Trade Centre in New York in the terrorist
attacks in September 2001 (see page 76) and weak
equity markets (see page 462). The Financial
Services Authority has relaxed some of its
requirements on solvency to ease the position for
insurance companies. In addition, the insurance
company Equitable Life has experienced particular
problems arising from guarantees offered to a
number of its policyholders, and closed to new
business in December 2000. In 2002 a
compromise scheme was agreed to put the
company on a more stable footing for the future.
The Government has set up an independent
inquiry to examine the events at Equitable Life
and to consider the lessons that can be drawn for
the conduct, administration and regulation of the
UK life assurance sector.
The London Market
The London Market is an international wholesale
insurance market-place accepting risk from
around the world. It is the main centre for world
reinsurance business and for marine, aviation,
satellite and other forms of transport insurance. It
consists of insurance and reinsurance companies,
Lloyd’s of London, protection and indemnity
clubs (originally created to serve the marine
industry) and brokers. Gross premiums of the
London Market from reported returns were
estimated at £20 billion in 2001. Virtually all
companies participating in the company sector of
458
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
the London Market are members of the
International Underwriting Association of
London (IUA) (www.iua.co.uk), which in mid-
2002 had 70 members. Over three-quarters of the
companies operating in the London Market are
overseas-owned.
Lloyd's of London
Lloyd’s (www.lloydsoflondon.com) is an
incorporated society of private insurers in
London. It is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of Lloyd’s
and Lloyd’s Regulatory and Market Boards.
Lloyd’s is the world’s second largest commercial
insurer and third largest reinsurer. For 2002 the
Lloyd’s market has a capacity to accept premiums
of over £12 billion. There are 88 syndicates
underwriting insurance at Lloyd’s during 2002,
covering all classes of business from over 100
countries. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing a
professional underwriter to accept insurance risks
and manage claims on behalf of the members. In
2001, although premium income rose sharply,
there was an overall loss, reflecting an exceptional
series of events, notably the terrorist attack on the
United States of 11 September (see page 76) where
the estimated net loss for the Lloyd’s market was
£1.98 billion.
In January 2002 Lloyd’s announced a series of
proposals to change the market. Following
consultation, the reforms were supported in
a vote of members in September 2002 and will
be implemented in the coming months. A new
franchise arrangement is envisaged, under which
Lloyd’s will be the franchiser and the managing
agents will be the franchisees. A single Franchise
Board will replace the Regulatory and Market
Boards and will help to shape the market’s
standards and business practices. Other changes
include annual accounting, which is intended to
improve transparency and efficiency; the
development of a range of investment schemes
aimed at attracting new capital on a non¬
membership basis; and from the beginning of
2003 there will be no new ‘Names’ - members
with unlimited liability.
Investment

management, which involves managing funds on

behalf of investors, or advising them how best to
invest their funds. The main types of investment
fund include pension schemes, life insurance, unit
trusts, open-ended investment companies
(OEICs) and investment trusts. The assets of these
institutions were worth £1,920 billion at the
end of 2000 (see Table 29.5), of which UK
company securities accounted for £955 billion,
UK gilt-edged stock £229 billion and overseas
company and government securities £415 billion.
The final report of the Myners review of
institutional investment, published in 2001, found
that there were a number of distortions affecting
institutional investment decision-making and
proposed a set of clear principles, which would
apply to pension funds and, in due course, other
institutional investors. In February 2002 the
Government issued three consultation documents
covering proposed legislation on pension scheme
trustees, including a proposed new duty for
trustees and fund managers to intervene in
companies where this is in the interests of the
beneficiaries, and a requirement for funds to have
an independent custodian.
Pension funds
Total assets of UK self-administered pension funds
were estimated at about £768 billion at the end of
2000. Pension funds are major investors in
securities markets, holding around 20 per cent of
securities listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Funds are managed mainly by the investment
management houses.
459
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
Unit trusts and open-ended investment
companies
Nearly 2,000 authorised unit trusts and OEICs
pool investors’ money in funds divided into units
or shares of equal size, enabling people with
relatively small amounts of money to benefit from
diversified and managed portfolios. In April 2002
total funds under management were £240 billion,
of which £46 billion represented funds in Personal
Equity Plans and £25 billion in Individual Savings
Accounts (ISAs). Most unit trusts are general
funds, investing in a wide variety of UK or
international securities, but there are also many
specialist funds.
There are nearly 140 unit trust and OEIC
management groups, of which 55 had total fund
values exceeding £1 billion in April 2002.
Investment fund management groups are
represented by the Investment Management
Association (IMA) (www.investmentuk.org),
formed in February 2002 by a merger of the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds
and the Fund Managers’ Association.
OEICs, set up in 1997, are similar to unit trusts,
but investors buy shares in the fund rather than
units. By April 2002, 740 OEICs had been set up
by 65 management groups, and OEIC funds were
worth £97 billion.
Investment trusts
Investment trust companies are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares can be
bought and sold in the same way as other
companies. They invest principally in the shares
and securities of other companies. Assets are
purchased mainly out of shareholders’ funds,
although investment trusts are also allowed to
borrow money for investment.
There are 395 investment trusts, which form the
largest listed sector of the London Stock
Exchange. Around 35 per cent of their shares by
value are held by private investors. About 305
listed trust companies are members of the
Association of Investment Trust Companies
(www.aitc.co.uk). At the end of May 2002 the
industry had £64 billion of assets under
management and a stock market capitalisation
of £48 billion.
Share ownership
The latest analysis by the Office for National
Statistics of share ownership showed that, at
31 December 2000, financial institutions held the
bulk of equities. UK financial institutions held
shares valued at £881 billion (48 per cent of the
total market value of £1,811 billion), with
insurance companies holding £381 billion and
pension funds £321 billion. Holders from outside
the UK had £587 billion (32 per cent). The value
of holdings of UK individual shareholders was
£290 billion (16 per cent). About 25 per cent of
households have at least one adult owning shares
(see Table 29.3).
According to ProShare (an independent
organisation encouraging share ownership), the
number of investment clubs - groups of individuals,
usually about 15 to 20 people, who regularly invest
in shares - has risen to around 12,000.
Tax-free savings
Tax-free saving is encouraged by the Individual
Savings Account (ISA), which in 1999 succeeded
Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) and TESSAs (Tax
Exempt Special Savings Accounts) as the main
method of tax-free saving. ISAs are guaranteed
to run until at least April 2009. Until April 2006
each individual can contribute up to £7,000 a
year in total. There are three main elements of
an ISA:
■ cash - up to £3,000 each year - such as in
a bank or building society ISA account;
■ stocks and shares - up to £7,000 a year
in a maxi ISA and £3,000 in a mini ISA
(see below); and
■ life insurance - up to £1,000 a year.
In addition, savers can roll over capital from a
matured TESSA into a cash ISA or a special
TESSA-only ISA.
There are two main types of ISA: a maxi ISA,
which can include all three elements in a single
ISA with one manager; and mini ISAs, which
allow savers to have different managers, for the
cash, stocks and shares, and life insurance
components. Savers can choose to put money into
mini ISAs or a maxi ISA, but not both, in each tax
year.
In 2001/02 subscriptions were made to about
12.0 million ISAs - 9.5 million mini ISAs and
2.5 million maxi ISAs - attracting £28.5 billion
(see Table 29.6).

Sandler review of retail savings
In July 2002 the Sandler review of medium-term and
long-term retail savings was published. It found two
main problems in the UK savings market: competitive
forces in the sector did not work effectively, and
savings levels were insufficient, particularly among
the less well-off, partly because of the high cost of
serving this group. Key recommendations of the
review to the Government and the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) include:
■ a series of simple investment products with
regulation of product features, which could be
sold outside the current regulatory regime for the
sale of, and advice on, investment products;
■ reforms to 'with-profits' policies' to make their
structure and management simpler and more
transparent;
■ a new model for the provision of independent
financial advice, with more stringent investment
qualifications for financial advisers;
■ tax measures aimed at simplifying the current
regime for retail savings products; and
■ measures to boost consumer education in financial
matters.
The Government will be taking forward the review's
suggestions, and intends to consult consumer
representatives, the industry and the FSA on these
'stakeholder' products and their design.
Financial markets
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange
(www.londonstockexchange.com) is one of the
world’s leading centres for equity trading,
particularly for trade in international equities where
in 2001 London accounted for more than half of
total cross-border trading. In 2001 turnover in
international equities was £3,676 billion and in UK
equities £1,905 billion. At the end of 2001, 1,809 UK
and 453 international companies were listed on the
main market, with a market capitalisation of
£1,524 billion and £2,580 billion respectively. A
further 629 companies, with a total capitalisation of
£11.6 billion, were listed on AIM, the Alternative
Investment Market, primarily for small, young and
growing companies. The ‘techMARK’ market brings
together 243 of the listed companies engaged in
technology or related sectors.
Several other products for raising capital are
handled, including Eurobonds (see page 462),
warrants, depositary receipts and gilt-edged stock
(see page 352). The London Stock Exchange
provides a secondary or trading market where
investors can buy or sell gilts. Turnover in UK gilts
on the Exchange was £2,030 billion in 2001.
The CREST computerised settlement system for
shares and other company securities is now

protection from market fluctuations.

Share price movements
A range of indices track share price movements on
the Exchange. The most widely quoted is the FTSE
100 index (the 'Footsie'), which relates to the 100
largest UK companies, by market capitalisation,
listed on the Exchange. Among the other indices
often quoted are:
■ the FTSE 250 index - the next biggest 250
companies;
■ the FTSE 350 index - the largest 350
companies;
■ the FTSE All-share - all the companies on the
main market;
■ the FTSE techMARK 100-the top 100
companies on the techMARK; and
■ the Eurotop 300 - the top 300 companies in
Europe,
During 2001 the FTSE 100 fell to a low of 4,434 in
September in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks
in New York and Washington (see page 76) - stock
markets around the world fell substantially in late
September but quickly recovered, and the FTSE 100
reached 5,370 in December 2001. However, during
summer 2002 it fell back again, reflecting concern
about the global economy. By the end of August
2002 the FTSE 100 was 4,227, 39 per cent below
the peak of 6,930 in 1999, and during September
2002 it fell below 3,700 to a six-year low.
settling over 300,000 transactions a day with a
value of nearly £500 billion.
Other equity exchanges
There are three other, relatively small markets in
the City of London for trading equities: Virt-x
(formed from a merger of‘Tradepoint’ and SWX
Swiss exchange), OM London, and OFEX. The
OFEX market for small companies became
directly regulated for the first time in December
2001.
Bond markets
London is at the centre of the Euromarket (a
major market in a variety of currencies lent
outside their domestic markets) and houses most
of the leading international banks and securities
firms. According to IFSL, London-based
bookrunners are estimated to account for about
60 per cent of Eurobonds issued and around
70 per cent of trading in the secondary market.
CoredealMTS acts as an exchange for transactions
involving such bonds.
Foreign exchange market
A survey by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) in 2001 showed that daily
foreign exchange turnover in the UK was
US$504 billion and that London was the world’s
biggest trading centre, with nearly a third of
global net daily turnover. Trading in London was
down by a fifth since the previous survey in 1998,
mainly reflecting the overall fall in global foreign
exchange trading. One factor in the decline was
the introduction of the euro in 1999, which
eliminated cross-trading between the former euro
currencies. Dealing is conducted through
telephone and electronic links between the banks,
other financial institutions and a number of firms
of foreign exchange brokers which act as
intermediaries.
Bullion markets
London is the world’s most liquid ‘spot’
(immediate) market for gold and the global
clearing centre for worldwide gold trading. It is
also the global clearing centre for silver. Around
60 banks and other financial trading companies
participate in the London gold and silver markets.
London fixes the world’s gold price twice a day
and the world silver price once a day, through the
members of the London Bullion Market
Association.
Derivatives
Financial derivatives, including ‘futures’ and
‘options’, offer a means of protection against
changes in prices, exchange rates and interest
rates. The UK is the most important ‘over the
counter’ (OTC) market-place, as measured by
booking location. According to the BIS, the UK
accounted for 36 per cent of the global OTC
derivatives market in April 2001, representing
average daily turnover of US$275 billion.
In 2001 the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE)
(www.lijfe.com) was acquired by the pan-European
stock exchange Euronext, which had been formed
by the merger of exchanges in Amsterdam,
Brussels and Paris. LIFFE has changed its name to
Euronext.liffe. It is the second largest derivatives
462
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
market in the world and also handles trade in
commodities such as coffee, cocoa and sugar.
LIFFE traded a record 216 million contracts in
2001, 65 per cent more than in 2000. Business
worth £375 billion a day was traded through its
electronic trading platform, LIFFE CONNECT.
The LIFFE market and its broad range of products
can now be accessed from 530 locations in 25
countries.
Other exchanges
Other important City exchanges include:
■ the London Metal Exchange (LME) - the
primary base metals market in the world,
trading contracts in aluminium, aluminium
alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc, and
handling 59 million lots in 2001;
■ the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE),
the largest energy futures and options market
in Europe - in 2001 it became a wholly
owned subsidiary of Intercontinental
Exchange Inc (ICE) of the United States; and
■ the Baltic Exchange, the world’s leading
international shipping market.
The London Clearing House (LCH) clears and
settles business at LIFFE, LME, IPE and Virt-x.
Regulation
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000,
which came into force on 1 December 2001,
created a new framework for the regulation of
financial services. It formally established the
Financial Services Authority (FSA)
(www.fsa.gov.uk), which had already been in
operation since 1997, as the single regulator for
the financial services industry. The FSA became
responsible for the regulation of investment
business, banks, building societies and insurance
companies previously handled by nine regulatory
bodies. In May 2001 it acquired responsibility
from the London Stock Exchange for acting as the
competent authority for listing companies in the
UK. A new single Financial Services
Compensation Scheme and a single Financial
Ombudsman Service have also been set up.
FSA objectives and functions
The FSA’s statutory objectives are maintaining
confidence in the UK financial system and
promoting public understanding of it, providing
an appropriate degree of consumer protection and
reducing the potential for financial crime. In
delivering these objectives, the FSA has to be
efficient and economic, facilitate innovation in
financial services, take account of the
international nature of financial services business
and minimise any adverse effects of regulation on
competition.
In November 2001 the Government announced
that the FSA would also be given responsibility for
regulating the provision of mortgage advice and
general insurance broking - it had earlier said that
the FSA would become responsible for regulating
mortgage lending. Currently the General
Insurance Standards Council sets standards for
selling general insurance products, while most
mortgage lenders and intermediaries are
signatories to the voluntary Mortgage Code,
which is overseen by the Mortgage Code
Compliance Board. The FSA is consulting on these
changes, which are expected to take effect in 2004.
During 2001/02 the FSA introduced or
announced, among other things:
■ proposals intended to enhance consumer
choice by reforming the way in which
financial advice is provided in the UK,
involving the end of the ‘polarisation’ regime
under which financial advisers have to be
either ‘independent’ (offering advice on all
products and companies in the market) or
‘tied’ (representing one company and selling
only its products);
■ comparative tables for consumers of a range
of financial products, including unit trust
ISAs, personal pensions (including
stakeholder pensions), savings endowments,
mortgage endowments and investment
bonds;
■ plans to strengthen regulation of the
insurance industry, including proposals to
reform the running of with-profits
investments; and
■ proposals for a simpler and more practical
pricing system for unit trusts and OEICs.
Compensation
The single Financial Services Compensation
Scheme (FSCS) (www.fscs.org.uk) came into
463
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
operation in December 2001, replacing eight
previous compensation schemes. It provides
compensation for:
■ deposits - when an authorised deposit-taking
firm (such as a bank, building society or
credit union) goes out of business or the FSA
considers that it is unable to repay depositors
or likely to be unable to do so. The maximum
level of compensation for a customer,
covering all of his or her deposits, is £31,700
(100 per cent of the first £2,000 and
90 per cent of the next £33,000);
■ investments - two kinds of loss are covered:
when an authorised investment firm goes out
of business and cannot return investments or
money, and a loss arising from bad
investment advice or poor investment
management. The maximum compensation
is £48,000 (all of the first £30,000 and
90 per cent of the next £20,000); and
■ insurance - 100 per cent cover for
compulsory insurance (such as third-party
motor insurance) and for other insurance
(including long-term insurance, such as
pensions and life assurance) 100 per cent
cover for the first £2,000, with 90 per cent
protection for amounts above this threshold.
Financial Ombudsman Service
The Financial Ombudsman Service is a one-stop
service for dealing with complaints about financial
services firms. The budget for 2002/03 is around
£28 million. All firms authorised by the FSA are
subject to the Ombudsman’s procedures, but
consumers have to seek a resolution to a
complaint from the firm in the first instance. If
the matter is not resolved satisfactorily, they can
ask the Ombudsman to intervene.
Introduction to other service
industries
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale is a major economic
activity. The large wholesalers and retailers of food
and drink operate extensive distribution networks,
either directly or through contractors.
With rising real incomes, consumer spending on
personal and leisure services has increased
considerably. Travel, hotel and restaurant services
in the UK are among those to have benefited from
long-term growth in tourism. The UK is one of
the world’s leading tourist destinations, even
though the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 and
the aftermath of 11 September caused a
temporary decline in visitor numbers.
Computer activities and research and
development are among the non-financial sectors
which experienced strong growth in turnover in
2001 (see Table 29.7).

Wholesaling and retailing
In 2002 there were over 107,000 enterprises (see
Table 29.8) engaged in wholesaling in the UK;
25 per cent were sole proprietors and 15 per cent
partnerships. There were 1.18 million employee
jobs in the UK in this sector in December 2001
and turnover in 2001 amounted to £375 billion,
1.2 per cent lower than in 2000.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small wholesalers
and independent grocery retailers belong to
voluntary ‘symbol’ groups, which provide access to
central purchasing facilities and co-ordinated
promotions. This has helped smaller retailers to
remain relatively competitive; many local and
convenience stores and village shops would not
otherwise be able to stay in business.
London’s wholesale markets play a significant part
in the distribution of fresh foodstuffs. New Covent
Garden at Nine Elms is the main market for fruit
and vegetables, London Central Markets at

The Co-operative Group (CWS) Limited was
formed from the merger of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS) and Co-operative Retail
Services (CRS) in 2000. As well as food retailing,
the Group’s operations cover funeral businesses,
travel retailing, motor trading and non-food
department stores. The merger created the UK’s
largest mutual retail group, with total sales of £3.2
billion in 2001.
The Co-operative Group has been the principal
supplier of goods and services to the Co-operative
Movement - comprising 43 independent retail
societies and 2,355 stores - and was a founder
member of the Co-operative Retail Trading Group
(CRTG). Formed in 1993, the CRTG acts as a
central marketing, buying and distribution
partnership for retail co-operative societies, and
now controls all Co-op food trade. Retail co¬
operative societies are voluntary organisations
controlled by their members, membership being
open to anyone paying a small deposit on a
minimum share.
The retail sector accounted for 33 per cent of all
consumer expenditure in 2001 and for 11 per cent
(2.87 million) of UK employee jobs in December
2001. In 2002 there were over 192,000 retail
enterprises in the UK (see Table 29.8); 42 per cent
were sole proprietors, 33 per cent partnerships
and the remaining 25 per cent companies.
Total retail turnover (including repair of personal
and household goods) in 2000 amounted to
£218 billion, 4 per cent higher than in 1999.
Businesses range from national supermarket and
other retail chains to independent corner grocery
shops, hardware stores, chemists, newsagents and
many other types of retailer. The large multiple
retailers have grown considerably, tending to increase
outlet size until relatively recently and to diversify
product ranges. Some also operate overseas, through
either subsidiaries or franchise agreements.
Small independent retail businesses and co¬
operative societies have been in decline for some
time. To help their competitive position, smaller
retailers are permitted by the Sunday trading laws
to open for longer hours than larger supermarkets
and department stores, which are restricted to six
hours on Sundays (except in Scotland). Some
major supermarket branches now open for
24 hours, six days a week.
The volume of retail sales rose by 28 per cent
between 1995 and 2001 (see also Table 29.9).
Growth in non-food stores (38 per cent) was
higher than in predominantly food stores
(18 per cent), with the most significant increase
(62 per cent) in household goods stores.
The largest supermarket chains, including Tesco,
J Sainsbury, Asda and Safeway, accounted for
62.5 per cent of total grocery sales, worth £103
billion in 2001. Tesco is the largest private sector
employer in the UK, employing 195,000 people.

The leading mixed retail chains are found in high
streets nationwide. Competition with lower-priced
outlets and discount chains has squeezed some of
the more traditional suppliers selling a range of
items. Several chains of DIY (Do-It-Yourself)
stores and superstores cater for people carrying
out repairs and improvements to their own homes
and gardens; they stock tools, decorating and
building materials, kitchen and bathroom fittings,
and garden products. Specialist shops, such as
those selling mobile telephones, have shown
substantial growth.
The large multiple groups have broadened their
range of goods and services. Large food retailers
have also placed greater emphasis on selling own-
label groceries and environmentally friendly
products (including organic produce), together
with household wares and clothing. In-store
pharmacies, post offices, customer cafeterias and
dry-cleaners are now a feature of large
supermarkets, which also sell newspapers,
magazines, books, audio cassettes, pre-recorded
videos, compact discs, DVDs and electrical goods.
Several large retailers offer personal finance
facilities in an attempt to encourage sales,
particularly of high-value goods, while others have
diversified into financial services. Some
supermarkets now offer banking facilities.
Franchising is the granting of a licence by one
company (the franchiser) to another (the
franchisee), usually by means of an initial
payment with continuing royalties. Franchised
activities operate in many areas, including
cleaning services, film processing, print shops,
fitness centres, courier delivery, car rental, engine
tuning and servicing, and fast-food retailing.
About 200 franchisers are members of the British
Franchise Association (BFA) (www.british-
franchise.org) which conducts an annual survey of
franchising. Its findings for 2002 estimated that
there were 671 fully fledged business-format
franchises, with around 34,500 outlets, accounting
for about 325,000 direct jobs in the UK and with
annual turnover of £9.2 billion.
Vehicle, vehicle parts and petrol
retailing
In December 2001 there were 543,000 employee
jobs in the UK in retailing motor vehicles and
parts, and in petrol stations. Turnover in the
motor trades industry in 2001 amounted to
£125.3 billion, 2.2 per cent higher than in 2000
(see Table 29.10).
Most businesses selling new vehicles are franchised
by the motor manufacturers. Vehicle components
are available for sale at garages which undertake
servicing and repair work and also at retail chains
and at independent retailers. Drive-in fitting
centres sell tyres, exhaust systems, batteries,
clutches and other vehicle parts. At the end of
2001 there were 12,201 retail outlets for petrol, a
decline of 842 over the year; the top three
companies accounted for 36 per cent of the total.
The number of petrol stations declined by
11 per cent between 1999 and 2001 alone,
reflecting intense competition in the sector, relatively
low profit margins and consolidation among
operators. This is particularly so in rural areas.
Petrol stations offer other retail services, such as
shops, car washes and fast-food outlets (there were

Shopping facilities
Since 1996, social, economic and environmental
considerations have led the Government and local
planning authorities to limit new retail
developments outside town centres. Out-of-town
superstores, retail warehouses and shopping
centres were felt to be undermining the vitality
and viability of existing town and district centres.
Government policy is now to focus new retail
development in existing centres and so revitalise
them. This is to ensure that everyone has easy
access to a range of shops and services, whether or
not they have a car; and to enable businesses of all
types and sizes to prosper.
All new retail development requires planning
permission from the local planning authority,
which must consult central government before
granting permission for most developments of
2,500 sq m or more. Retailers’ attentions have now
turned back to town centres, redeveloping existing
stores and building smaller outlets. Forecasts show
that completion of town centre shopping schemes
for 2002/03 are at the highest level reached in the
last 50 years.
There are eight regional out-of-town shopping
centres (see box), located at sites offering good
road access and ample parking facilities. Bluewater
is the largest such development in Europe. There
are no plans to build any further such out-of-town

shopping centres, as these are not compatible with

Home shopping
Traditionally, all kinds of goods and services are
purchased through mail-order catalogues. The
largest-selling items are clothing, footwear,
furniture, household textiles and domestic
electrical appliances. Electronic home shopping,
using a television and telephone, and ‘online’
shopping, where personal computers are linked to
databases, are growing rapidly. Internet sales in the
UK were estimated at £56.6 billion in 2000, and all
467

29 Finance and other service industries
forms of e-commerce sales at almost £162 billion
(5.8 per cent of total sales). The finance and
insurance sector had the largest value of
e-commerce sales (an estimated £43.7 billion),2
followed by the wholesale, retail, catering and
travel sector (£7.6 billion).
Hotels, restaurants and catering
The hotel and restaurant trades, which include
public houses (pubs), wine bars and other licensed
bars in addition to all kinds of businesses offering
accommodation and prepared food, had 1.65
million employee jobs in the UK in December
2001. Total turnover in 2001 amounted to
£56.6 billion, 7.2 per cent higher than in 2000.
Hotels and guest houses in the UK range from
major hotel groups to small guest houses,
individually owned. Holiday centres, including
traditional holiday camps with full board, self¬
catering centres and caravan parks, are run by
several companies.
In 2000 there were almost 51,500 enterprises in
the UK in the licensed restaurant industry
(including fast-food and takeaway outlets), an
increase of 3.0 per cent on 1999. Total turnover in
2001 was £18.2 billion, 12.1 per cent higher than
in 2000. Restaurants offer cuisine from virtually
every country in the world, and several of the
highest-quality ones have international
reputations. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Italian, French
and Greek restaurants are among the most
popular. ‘Fast-food’ restaurants are widespread,
many of which are franchised. They specialise in
selling hamburgers, chicken, pizza and a variety of
other foods, to be eaten on the premises or taken
away. Traditional fish and chip shops are another
main provider of cooked takeaway food.
Sandwich bars are common in towns and cities,
typically in areas with high concentrations of
office workers.
There were an estimated 49,500 pubs in the UK in
2001, a decline of over 8 per cent since 1990. They
accounted for 57 per cent of all fully licensed
premises, compared with 65 per cent in 1990.
2 As no sales data are held by ONS for much of the financial sector,
turnover from administrative sources was used to supplement the
percentages supplied by business and produce the estimates.
Accordingly, the estimates for e-commerce in the financial sector
have to be treated with caution.
Turnover was estimated at £14.7 billion in 2000,
approaching an annual average of £300,000 per
pub. Although brewers still own many of the
tightly controlled, and often branded, pub chains,
their share has declined to less than 25 per cent of
UK pubs. Such breweries either provide managers
to run the pubs or offer tenancy agreements and
tend to sell only their own brands of beer,
although some also offer ‘guest’ beers. Multiple
pub-owning ‘pub companies’ and venture capital
companies account for over 40 per cent of the
ownership. The remaining 36 per cent of pubs,
called ‘free houses’, are independently owned and
managed - these frequently serve a variety of
different branded beers.
Travel agents
Many British holidaymakers travelling overseas
buy ‘package holidays’ from travel agencies, where
the cost covers both transport and
accommodation. Long-haul holidays to North
America, the Caribbean, Australia and New
Zealand have gained in popularity in recent years.
Some people prefer more independence, and
many travel agents will make just the travel
arrangements.
In 2001 turnover in the travel agency and tour
operator businesses amounted to £18.7 billion,
12.6 per cent higher than in 2000. Around
70 per cent of high street travel agencies are
members of the Association of British Travel
Agents (ABTA) (www.abta.com). Although most
are small businesses, a few large firms have
hundreds of branches. ABTA’s 830 tour operators
and 1,700 travel agency companies have over 7,000
offices and are responsible for the sale of more
than 90 per cent of UK-sold package holidays.
ABTA operates financial protection schemes to
safeguard its members’ customers and maintains a
code of conduct drawn up with the Office of Fair
Trading. It also offers a free consumer affairs
service to help resolve complaints against
members, and a low-cost independent arbitration
scheme for members’ customers. The British
Incoming Tour Operators Association
(www.bitoa.co.uk), founded in 1977, represents the
commercial and political interests of incoming
tour operators and suppliers to the British
inbound tourism industry.

Tourism and leisure
Tourism is one of the UK’s key long-term growth
sectors, with total spending in 2001 estimated at
£72.8 billion (see Table 29.11). The bulk of
tourism services are provided by some 129,000
mainly independent small businesses such as
hotels and guest houses, restaurants, holiday
homes, caravan and camping parks. In all about
8 per cent of small businesses are engaged in
tourism.
A new £40 million tourism initiative entitled 'Only
in Britain. Only in 2002' was launched in May 2002
with the aim of attracting 1 million extra visitors
and generating an additional £500 million for the
British economy in 2002. The campaign focuses on
Britain's uniqueness in terms of its diversity,
heritage and humour.

There were an estimated 22.8 million overseas
visitors to the UK in 2001, 9 per cent fewer than in
2000. They generated earnings of £11.3 billion,
12 per cent lower than in 2000 (see Tables 29.11
and 29.13). A combination of the foot-and-mouth
outbreak (see chapter 26) and the aftermath of
11 September are likely to have contributed to this
£1.5 billion decline. The number of visitors from
North America fell by 13 per cent, those from the
European Union by 8 per cent and from all other
areas by 9 per cent. The UK’s share of world
tourism earnings reached 3.4 per cent in 2001 and
ranked seventh behind the United States, Spain,
France, Italy, China and Germany. Table 29.14
shows that the United States topped the league of
overseas visitors to the UK. Business travel, which
includes attendance at conferences, exhibitions,
trade fairs and other business sites, accounted for
30 per cent of all overseas visits in 2001. London’s
Heathrow and Gatwick airports, the seaport of
Dover and the Channel Tunnel are the main
points of entry.
Some 50 per cent of overseas tourists spend at
least half of their stay in London, while others
venture further afield to see the many attractions
in the English regions as well as in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Domestic tourism generated £59.5 billion in 2001.
For British residents opting to take their main
holiday in the UK, 21 per cent choose a traditional
seaside destination, such as Blackpool,
Bournemouth, Eastbourne, Llandudno and resorts
in Devon and Cornwall. Short holiday breaks (up
to three nights), valued at £8.1 billion in 2001,
make up a significant part of the market.

The UK’s historic towns and cities and its scenic
rural and coastal areas continue to have great
appeal for domestic and overseas tourists alike.
Their popularity reflects a growing interest in
British heritage, arts and culture. There are an
estimated 6,800 visitor attractions in the UK, which
in 2000 attracted 413 million visits, resulting in
revenue of £1.4 billion and providing employment
for 130,000 people. These attractions include
museums, art galleries, historic houses and castles,
which together make up 50 per cent of the total,
although only one-third of all reported visits.
Domestic and foreign tourists play an increasingly
important role in supporting the UK’s national
heritage and creative arts, in addition to the large
financial contribution they make to hotels,
restaurants, cafes and bars, and public transport.
Activity holidays are often based on walking,
canoeing, mountain climbing, or artistic activities.
Youth Hostel Associations operate a comprehensive
network of around 310 hostels in the UK, offering
a range of facilities, including self-catering, to
families and people of all ages.
Theme parks attract many million visitors a year.
Attractions in these parks include spectacular
‘white knuckle’ rides and overhead cable cars and
railways, while some also feature domesticated
and wild animals. The British Airways London Eye
was the most popular UK attraction charging
admission in 2001 (see Table 29.15). Another new
attraction, the Eden Project, occupied the third
position in its first full year. The largest tourist
attraction with free admission (and also the
largest overall attraction) was Blackpool Pleasure
Beach in Lancashire (see Table 29.16).
Tourism promotion
Tourism in England is the responsibility of the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the
Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly
Government and Northern Ireland Assembly have
responsibility for tourism in their respective
countries. The government-supported British
Tourist Authority (BTA)
(www.britishtouristauthority.org) promotes Britain
through its network of 27 overseas offices, located in
markets offering the best potential return and
covering 88 per cent of all visitors to Britain. There
are separate national tourist boards - in England the

The BTA and the national tourist boards inform
and advise the Government on issues of concern
to the industry. They also help businesses and
other organisations to plan by researching and
publicising trends affecting the industry. The
national tourist boards work closely with regional
tourist boards, on which local government and
business interests are represented. There are 551

The Government is working with the tourism
industry to raise standards of accommodation and
service, and to address certain key issues facing the
industry. These include: improving visitor
attractions; boosting business tourism;

Exhibition and conference
centres
The UK - along with the United States and France
- is one of the world’s three leading countries for
international conferences. London and Paris are
the two most popular conference cities. Many
British towns and cities - including several
traditional seaside holiday resorts which have
diversified to take advantage of the growing
business tourism market - have conference and
exhibition facilities.
Among the most modern purpose-built centres
are the National Exhibition and International
Conference Centres in Birmingham; the Queen
471
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
Elizabeth II and Olympia Conference Centres,
both in London; Cardiff International Arena; and
the Belfast Waterfront Hall. In Scotland,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen have major
exhibition and conference centres. Brighton (East
Sussex), Harrogate (North Yorkshire),
Bournemouth (Dorset), Manchester, Nottingham
and Torquay (Devon) all have exhibition and
conference centres. Other important exhibition
facilities in London are at the Barbican, Earls
Court, Alexandra Palace, Wembley Arena and the
ExCel exhibition and conference centre in
Docklands.
The Association of Exhibition Organisers
(www.aeo.org.uk) is the trade body for trade
exhibitions and consumer events. It estimates that
between 1999 and 2001 exhibitor spending rose

Of the 823 events recorded in 2001, 56 per cent
were trade exhibitions, 42 per cent public
(consumer) exhibitions and the remaining 2 per
cent a combination of both. Public (consumer)
exhibitions attracted 69 per cent of all visitors,
trade exhibitions 27 per cent and a combination
of both types the remaining 4 per cent. In
addition, there were more than 3.1 million visitors
to 32 exhibitions held in outdoor venues. A
further 1,001 exhibition events (mainly smaller
and often regional) took place in 390 venues,
attracting an estimated 5 million visitors.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), via
its Trade Partners UK operating unit, sponsors the
‘Trade fairs and exhibitions UK’ website
(www.exhibitions.co.uk), which offers a
comprehensive listing of all consumer, public,
industrial and trade exhibitions held in major UK
venues.
Rental services
A varied range of rental services, many of which
are franchised, are available throughout the UK.
These include hire of cars and other vehicles;
televisions, video recorders and camcorders;
household appliances such as washing machines;
tools and heavy decorating equipment (such as
ladders and floor sanders); and videos, DVDs and
computer games. Retailing of many types of
service is dominated by chains, although
independent operators are still to be found in
most fields. In December 2001 there were 156,000
employee jobs in the UK in the rental sector, with
turnover in 2001 amounting to £18.3 billion,
5.9 per cent higher than in 2000.
Computing services
The computing software and services industry
comprises businesses engaged in:
■ software development;
■ systems integration;
■ IT consultancy;
■ IT ‘outsourcing’;
■ processing services; and
■ the provision of complete computer systems.
It also includes companies that provide:
■ IT education and training;
■ independent maintenance;
■ support, contingency planning and
recruitment; and
■ contract staff.
In December 2001 there were 478,000 employee
jobs in the UK in computer and related activities.
Turnover of companies in this sector amounted to
£46.2 billion in 2001, 13.2 per cent higher than in
2000. British firms and universities have
established strong reputations in software R&D.
A number of international IT conglomerates, such
as Microsoft, have set up R&D operations in the
UK. Academic expertise is especially evident in
such areas as artificial intelligence, neural
472
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
networks, formal programming for safety-critical
systems, and parallel programming systems.
Software firms have developed strengths in sector-
specific applications, including systems for
retailing, banking, finance and accounting, the
medical and dental industries, and the travel and
entertainment industries. Specialist ‘niche’ markets
in which UK software producers are active include
artificial intelligence, scientific and engineering
software (especially computer-aided design),
mathematical software, geographical information
systems, and data visualisation packages. Some
firms specialise in devising multimedia software.
Distance learning, ‘virtual reality’ and computer
animation all benefit from a large pool of creative
talent.
One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry (see page 241). The
provision of almost all new telecommunications
services, including switching and transmission, is
dependent on software.
A special one-off survey by ONS in July 2001
estimated the size of the computer services market
in Great Britain in 2000 as £32.0 billion (including
exports). Table 29.18 shows a breakdown of the
activities. There was a further £5.4 billion of sales
activity in non-computer (but related) services,
the largest of which were wholesaling or retailing
of goods (£3.1 billion), and telecommunications
services (£1.2 billion).

business activities sector, which includes market
research, business and management consultancy
activities and advertising, and turnover in 2001
amounted to £161.7 billion, 10.8 per cent higher
than in 2000.
Market research
According to the British Market Research
Association (BMRA) {www.bmra.org.uk),
members’ turnover grew by 7.1 per cent in 2001 to
an estimated £1,147 million, following growth of
9.3 per cent in 2000. UK-owned market research

Management consultancy
The UK’s 60,000 management consultants supply
technical assistance and advice to business and
government clients. In 2001 revenues for the
industry were estimated at £8 billion, with exports
in excess of £1 billion. The 40 member firms of
the Management Consultancies Association
(MCA) {www.mca.org.uk), which accounts for
over half of UK revenues, earned a record income
of £4,345 million in 2001, 17 per cent higher than
in 2000 (see Table 29.20). Income from
outsourcing activities rose by 49 per cent and

Advertising Research Center
accounted for over 31 per cent of all UK fee
income.
Advertising and public relations
The UK is a major centre for creative advertising,
and multinational corporations often use
advertising created in the UK for marketing their
products globally. British agencies have strong
foreign links through overseas ownership and
associate networks. British television advertising
has received many international awards.
According to the Advertising Association
{www.adassoc.org.uk), total UK advertising
expenditure fell by 2.6 per cent in 2001 to
£16.5 billion, after nine years’ uninterrupted
growth (see also Table 29.21).
There are around 1,540 advertising agencies. In
addition to their creative, production and media¬
buying roles, some offer integrated marketing
services, including consumer research and public
relations. Many agencies have sponsorship
departments, which arrange for businesses to
sponsor products and events, including artistic,
sporting and charitable events.
Government advertising campaigns - on crime
prevention, health promotion, armed services
recruitment and so on - are often organised by
COI Communications (see page 483), an executive
agency of the Government.
The UK’s public relations industry has developed
rapidly, and there are now many small specialist
firms as well as some quite large ones. The Public
Relations Consultants Association
{www.martex.co.uk/prca) membership accounts
for 80 per cent of UK fee income. It had 122
members who employed almost 5,400 people in
2001, and generated £401 million of fee income,
6.4 per cent higher than in 2000.
Business support services
One of the major growth areas in the service
sector is in support services, reflecting the trend
among more and more firms to ‘outsource’ non¬
core operations. Initially, operating areas that were
outsourced or contracted out were in cleaning,
security and catering. However, firms are now
outsourcing other activities, such as IT and
personnel support services.
Consumer protection
The Government aims to maintain and develop a
clear and fair regulatory framework that gives
474
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
confidence to consumers and contributes to
business competitiveness. It works closely with
outside bodies that have expert knowledge of
consumer issues to develop policies and
legislation. A 1999 White Paper, Modern Markets:
Confident Consumers, set out a range of initiatives
aimed at improving consumer protection. Much
of the White Paper agenda has now been
implemented. The consumer voice has been
strengthened with new consumer councils for the
energy and postal industries, and a stronger, more
modern National Consumer Council. Information
and redress have been improved with the launch
of Consumer Support Networks and plans to pilot
new helplines on consumer advice and debt.
The regulatory regime has been strengthened with
the implementation of the Distance Selling
Directive and the introduction in June 2001 of
Stop Now Orders (see below) to tackle rogue
traders for whom existing sanctions are not a
sufficient deterrent.
Other measures are being taken forward in the
Enterprise Bill (see page 336), introduced into
Parliament in 2002. This will create a new Office
of Fair Trading (OFT) (www.oft.gov.uk) - for the
first time with a statutory Board that will reflect
the interests, among others, of consumers. The
OFT will also be given a range of new duties:
■ to promote competition;
■ to approve industry codes of practice;
■ to educate consumers; and
■ to consider ‘super-complaints’ about markets
that are failing consumers (see page 336).
Consumer legislation
■ The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 prohibits
misdescriptions of goods and services, and
enables regulations to be made requiring
information or instructions relating to goods
to be marked on, or to accompany, the goods
or to be included in advertisements.
■ The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is intended to
protect consumers in their dealings with
credit businesses. Most businesses connected
with the consumer credit or hire industry or
which supply ancillary credit services - for
example, credit brokers, debt collectors, debt
counsellors and credit reference agencies -
require a consumer credit licence. The
Director General of Fair Trading is
responsible for administering the licensing
system, including refusing or revoking
licences of those unfit to hold them. He also
has powers to prohibit unfit people from
carrying out estate agency work; to take court
action to prevent the publication of
misleading advertisements; to stop traders
using unfair terms in standard contracts with
consumers; and to take court action against
breaches of the Distance Selling Regulations.
■ The Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended in
1994) ensures that consumers are entitled to
receive goods which fit their description and
are of satisfactory quality.
■ The Consumer Protection Act 1987 covers
misleading indications about prices of goods.
The Act also makes it a criminal offence to
supply unsafe products, and provides product
liability rights for consumers. The regulatory
framework to control product safety is a
mixture of European and UK legislation,
voluntary safety standards and industry codes
of practice.
■ The Stop Now Orders (EC Directive)
Regulations 2001 (SNORs) enable the OFT
and certain specified bodies - Qualified
Entities (QEs) - to take swift action against
traders in the UK and in other EU Member
States who breach ten existing EC Directives,
where those breaches harm the collective
interests of UK consumers. The OFT has lead
enforcement responsibility for each Directive
area, including responsibility for co¬
ordinating the actions of all QEs and
publishing advice and guidelines on how the
Regulations work. The Regulations cover
consumer credit, unfair contract terms,
distance selling, misleading and comparative
advertising, doorstep selling, timeshare,
package travel and sale of goods.
■ The Enterprise Bill will, if enacted, replace
parts II and III of the Fair Trading Act 1973
and will extend the current injunctive powers
available to the OFT and other QEs under the
SNORs to all UK markets, both goods and
services. There will be a similar lead
enforcement responsibility for the OFT in
ensuring that action is co-ordinated and
475
Economic affairs
29 Finance and other service industries
guidance and information is published. It will
also enable the OFT to formally approve
business-to-consumer codes of practice.
The marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
Other law provides for the control of medical
products, and certain other substances and
articles, through a system of licences and
certificates. Changes to existing legislation were
introduced at the end of 1998 to strengthen the
protection of consumers from unscrupulous
doorstep sellers.
The EU’s consumer programme covers activities
such as health and safety, protection of the
consumer’s economic interests, promotion of
consumer education and strengthening the
representation of consumers. The interests of UK
consumers on EU matters are represented by a
number of organisations, including the
Consumers’ Association and the National
Consumer Council (see below).
Consumer advice and information
Citizens Advice Bureaux deliver advice from over
2,000 outlets across England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. They handled 5.7 million enquiries
during 2001/02 (see Table 29.22). Their work is
co-ordinated by a national association
(www.nacab.org.uk) linked to the bureaux by local
and regional committees. In 2000/01 an additional
405,000 problems were handled by Citizens Advice
Scotland (www.cas.org.uk). Similar assistance is
provided by trading standards and consumer
protection departments of local authorities in
Great Britain and, in some areas, by specialist
consumer advice centres.
The National Consumer Council (www.ncc.org.uk),
a non-departmental public body receiving much
of its funding from the DTI, works to represent
consumer interests to policy-makers, regulators
and suppliers in the UK and Europe. Associate
Councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
deal with the particular concerns of consumers in
those countries.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the consumer.

Some trade associations have set up codes of
practice. In addition, several organisations work to
further consumer interests by representing the
consumer’s view to government, industry and
other bodies. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, set up in 1957, with 974,000 members
in June 2002, funded largely by subscriptions to
Which? magazine (www.which.net). Over 60,000
subscribers have online access to the complete
range of Which? publications.

The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
The Official Yearbook is now in its 54th edition
and occupies a special place on bookshelves in
universities, libraries, businesses and homes across
the world.
Over the years, it has established itself as one the
best known and most respected reference works
on the United Kingdom, gathering together a
wealth of official information on the nation's
economic, social and cultural affairs, its network
of international relations, its physical environment
and the machinery of government.
The information in this edition has been fully
updated and revised. The colour pages provide a
photographic record of events over a year that
included the Queen's Golden Jubilee and the
Commonwealth Games. Numerous maps, charts
and tables provide facts and figures on every
aspect of the nation's life.
