INTRODUCTION
For ten years, successive editions of Britain : an official handbook have
been one of the main foundations of the reference and library facilities provided by
the British Information Services overseas. At first available only overseas in a
limited free edition, the Handbook was placed on sale throughout the world in
1954. The success of the venture has justified the decision to revise the Handbook
each year and to publish it as an annual.
With this edition, a change has been made in the date of publication; the Hand¬
book is to be published at the end of the year, instead of in the spring as formerly.
This change of timing makes it possible for each edition to include the Budget
statement and Departmental annual reports issued in the first half of the year which
it covers; thus each edition will contain more up-to-date information. This volume,
the 1958 edition, covers events up to September 1957-
BRITAIN: AN official handbook, prepared by Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information with the co-operation of other Government Depart¬
ments and many national organizations, contains factual and statistical information
on the United Kingdom as a whole, compiled from official and other authoritative
sources; separate facts or figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland are also given in some cases where these are available. The Handbook
covers the main aspects of national administration and national economy and gives
an account of the part played by the Government in the life of the community;
it does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt to describe the part
played by Britain in Commonwealth or world affairs.
Readers who require more detailed information on the United Kingdom should
consult the Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics,
issued by the Central Statistical Office, and standard works of reference and
Government publications, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end
of the Handbook. Readers are also asked to note that the Central Office of Informa¬
tion reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and marked with an
asterisk are available free of charge only at United Kingdom Information Offices
overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United Kingdom from the
Reference Division, Central Office of Information, on payment of a small charge.

I. THE BRITISH ISLES
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with a
total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest two islands are Great Britain
proper (comprising the greater parts of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland
(comprising Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). Off the southern coast
of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of
Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous
islands and to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands.
All these form administrative counties or parts of counties of the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the heart of the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great
Britain and France have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not
part of England, Wales or Scotland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border), has a total
area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into 40 geo¬
graphical or 49 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth), with an
area of 8,017 square miles, has 13 counties, Scotland, including its 186 inhabited
islands, has a total area of 30,411 square miles and is divided into 33 counties.
Northern Ireland, consisting of six counties, has an area of 5,459 square miles.
Together, these countries constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland with a total area of 94,2x4 square miles. The total land area of
the United Kingdom (excluding inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England,
50,051; Wales and Monmouthshire, 7,966; Scotland, 29,795 ; and Northern Ireland,
5,206, square miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they refer
to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for many
administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole. The position is further
complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth is sometimes included with
England. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the Isle of
Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles, which are
strictly not part of the United Kingdom, but are dependencies of the Crown. Since
southern Ireland became an independent republic, official statistics do not nor¬
mally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North just cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet Head,
is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o° passes through the old Observatory
of Greenwich (London), while the easternmost point of England reaches nearly
i° 45' East and the westernmost point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West.
It is thus rather under 600 miles in a straight line from the south coast of Britain
to the extreme north and rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to
the numerous bays and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles
from tidal water.
1

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow usually less than
50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the
north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 600 feet
to 3 000. These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish. The North Atlantic Current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect
of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Geology and Topography
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main geological
periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant to weather, and
have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south and east, and the
island can therefore be divided roughly into two main regions, Lowland Britain and
Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern England
have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and rising to chalk
and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet above sea level. The
boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth of the Tyne in the north-east
of England to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland, the Lake District in north¬
west England, the broad central upland known as the Pennines, almost the whole
of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of England coinciding approximately
with Devon and Cornwall. Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of
Great Britain and extensive uplands lying above the thousand foot contour. This
high ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologicallv the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks
(archaean and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly
more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures
which have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops
and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found on
the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of the
present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors of
present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age, and
at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north of a line join¬
ing the Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice caps and ice sheets.
The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had previously
been formed, so that when the ice eventually disappeared the hills stood out as
barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris boulders, boulder-clay,
sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked
up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried
up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by ice
sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption of the pre¬
vious natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland are irregularly
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,4°6 feet; in Wales, Snowdon, 3,560
feet; and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland) 3,210 feet.

disposed round the fringes of the island, and in the higher parts the moorland cover
resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Because of the complex geology and the varied relief which results, Britain enjoys
not only very attractive and contrasting scenery within short distances but a charac¬
teristic, ever different, coastline. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along
much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are notable features
in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the limestone
masses or forbidding slates of the Pembrokeshire coast 5 the red sandstone of St. Bees
Head; and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa. Even around
Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white lime¬
stone—the chalk—gives rise to the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or the
Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coast¬
line have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the
Humber and the Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for hundreds
of years some stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments.
These have occasionally been breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953,
which was caused by the abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally
high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of the
sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the short
British rivers1 valuable as natural havens. In times past every little cove round the
rocky coasts afforded shelter to a fishing village from the waves of the North Sea or
the giant rollers of the Atlantic.
Climate
Britain enjoys a temperate and equable climate. It lies in middle latitudes to
the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but as the prevailing
winds are south-westerly the climate is largely determined by that of the eastern
Atlantic, although occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring
a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for
many days or even weeks. The weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a generally easterly
or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British Isles. During the summer
months the Azores high pressure system extends its influence north-eastwards
towards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the northwards.
Winds. In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from
the south-east and east the least; easterly winds occur about half as often as south¬
westerly ones. In hilly country, wind direction may differ markedly from the
general direction owing to local conditions. Winds are generally stronger in the
north than in the south of the British Isles, on the coasts than inland, and in the west
than in the east. The strongest winds usually occui in the winter; the average speed
at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of London, varies from about 10*3
m.p.h. at 50 feet in January and February to a minimum in August of 7-5 m.p.h.
The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the north-west coast with about
40 gales a year; south-east England is the least stormy, with gales occurring on
about 18 days a year inland and 25 days on the Channel coast.
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only 210 and 200
miles long respectively.
THE BRITISH ISLES

Temperature. At stations near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from
450 F. in the Hebrides to 520 F. in the extreme south-west; it is slightly lower in
the eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The mean monthly temperature
in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 39° F. during the winter
(December, January and February) to 530 F. during the summer (June, July and
August): the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme
south, are 430 F. and 63° F. The average range of temperature between winter and
summer varies from 150 F. to 230 F., being greatest at inland stations in the eastern
part of the country. During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises
above 8o° F. in the south, but temperatures of 90° F. and above are uncommon.
Extreme minimum temperatures depend to a large extent on the environment,
but 200 F. may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, io° F. is rare, and o° F. or
below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe winters.
Rainfall. The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches,
while England alone has just over 30 inches. The distribution of annual rainfall is
mainly determined by topography, the mountainous areas of the west and north
having far more than the plains of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches
of rain fall on the summits of Snowrdon and Ben Nevis during the average year,
whereas some places in the south-east of England record less than 20 inches. Rain
is fairly well distributed throughout the year, but April, on the whole, is the driest
month, and December, with about twice as much, the wettest. A period of as long
as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and confined to limited areas.
Sunshine. The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general
decrease from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease
with altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the
mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five hours in western Scotland to eight
hours in the extreme south-east of England; during the months of shortest day¬
light—November, December and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an
average of 0-5 hours a day in the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District
(Derbyshire) and 1 -5 hours in the south of England.
Soil and Vegetation
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of Scotland,
the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of north-east
and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valley
lands and the plains where soils are deeper and richer, and villages and towns are
often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the whole
of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland stretches over the whole area
except where interrupted by urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultiva¬
tion the fertile soil of the low-lying Fenland of Lincolnshire and other nearby areas
in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of natural
vegetation cover. When the islands were first settled, oak woodland doubtless
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to thin forests of Scots pine on
higher or sandy ground, interrupted by extensive marshlands and perhaps some
open moorland. In the course of the centuries nearly all the forests have been
cleared so that forest and woodland now occupy only about 6 per cent of the surface

of the country Midland Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous
edgerows and isolated trees. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north
!! ^wi ? ’ m S°me PartS °f south-east England and in Monmouthshire
on the Welsh border.
The hilly moorland with its heather (and cotton grass in the wetter parts), with
M r‘U™eTrOUS, hl , frasses and the bracken fern, is a semi-natural wild vegetation.
Most of Lowland Britain consists either of grass pastureland, representing centuries
o careful management, or ploughland. Because the rainfall varies little in quantity
the^eTr011^ ^ m°nth’ streams rarely dry UP and grass remains green throughout
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession
o invaders and colonizers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after settling
in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating the French
nguage and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066

Censuses were taken on 8th April, 1951, by the appropriate authorities in the
United Kingdom, the islands of the British Seas and the Republic of Ireland.1 This
was the first simultaneous population count covering all these areas since the
censuses of 1911. The co-operation of the Republic of Ireland in arranging a
simultaneous census was of particular value, owing to the considerable sea and
land traffic and the movement of population between that country and the United
Kingdom. Nearly all the reports based on these censuses have now been published
(see the Bibliography, pp. 464-5).
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this chapter is
based mainly on census reports (including the 1951 censuses) and on the regular
returns of births, marriages and deaths, though some use has been made of other
special investigations.
Total Population
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken on
8th April, 1951, was, to the nearest thousand, 50,225,000, excluding 158,000 persons
in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the
United Kingdom.
The population had increased by about 2J million since mid-1939, by about
4 million since 1931, by about 6 million since 1921 and by about 43 million—or
about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a progressive
reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning
of the twentieth century. The population is still increasing, though relatively slowly,

and at mid-1956 the home (de facto) population of the United Kingdom (i.e. those
people actually in the United Kingdom at that time) was estimated at 51,208,000.
The population density of the United Kingdom is one of the highest in the
world. It was approximately 533 persons per square mile at the time of the 1951
censuses, and had risen to 544 persons per square mile at mid-1956.
Birth and Death Rates. During the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was
usually about 35 per thousand of the population. The annual death rate was just
over 20 per thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the
century, but the natural increase of the population changed but little. It rose from
12 per thousand in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand in
1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age groups,
produced a population of low average age. At each successive census the population
of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the preceding census, while
the short expectation of life further reduced the ratio of older to younger persons.
When, therefore, death rates in all age groups fell by an average of about 33 per
cent, as they did between 1880 and 1910, the result was first a very low general death
rate which helped to maintain the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth
rate, and, secondly, a gradual increase in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth-century
rate. Kven so, the population continued to increase slowly, though its average age
rose more rapidly (see diagram p. 7).
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary at around 12 per thousand of the population though death rates
have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particularly among pre-school
children, school children, and adults in their thirties and forties, with a consequent
lengthening of the expectation of life from about 50 years at birth in 1900 to 1910
to about 70 years at birth in 1952 to 1954. From 1933 onwards the birth rate
steadied itself and thereafter rose slowly up to the outbreak of the second world
war, after which all orderly movement was interrupted by the disturbed conditions
of the war years. The 1947 birth rate (20-7 per thousand of the population) was
the highest since i92I> but the 1948, I949> I95° and 1951 birth rates were pro¬
gressively lower, though higher than pre-war. Since 1951 the birth rate has been
fairly steady at about 15^ to 16 per thousand of the population, slightly higher than
pre-war (see diagrams p. 9).
Mortality Causes. The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in per¬
sonal hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on mothers
and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis and infant and
maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main acute
infectious diseases of childhood is less than one-hundredth and mortality from
tuberculosis is less than one-thirtieth of the rate prevailing in the mid-nineteenth
century. Infant mortality has fallen by about 70 per cent since 1900, and between
1934 and 1942 maternal mortality was nearly halved, and it is now only very slightly
over one-sixth of the 1934 rate. The reported mortality from many of the chronic
diseases of middle and old age has risen during the twentieth century, and this rise,
though exaggerated by the improvement in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medi¬
cine has not yet discovered effective measures to combat some of these diseases,

and improvement in positive health does not always bring increased immunity or
resistance to them.
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH years
Fertility Trends. The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and
the early part of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the number
of children born per married couple (the average size of the family), caused by the
spread of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago pro¬
duced on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the eighteen-sixties, and continued steadily until,
with the couples married in the nineteen-twenties, the average family size had been
reduced to between 2-2 and 2-i. The decline then stopped, and the figure has
remained stable in spite of the disturbance of the war years; the latest data suggest
a slight increase.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20 and
30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to replace
IO

the original generation. Those bom at the beginning of the present century had
only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for replacement. Since
then the figure has been rising again and may reach full replacement with the
generations born near the beginning of the second world war. But the rise has been
due more to the increased proportion of children surviving to adult life and of
women getting married than to the small increase in family size, and it seems un¬
likely at present to continue much above replacement level.
At first the decline in family size was most marked among the professional and
salaried classes. Among couples married between 1900 and 1930 the families of
manual workers were about 40 per cent larger than those of non-manual workers,
but this class difference appears to have been diminishing. The decline in family
size has been slower in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in England and Wales.
Migration. Over the whole 150 years since the beginning of the nineteenth
century, net migration has been markedly outward. About 25 million persons born
in the British Isles are estimated to have gone overseas in this period to settle in
the United States and Commonwealth countries. On the other hand large numbers
of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians have entered the
British Isles during the last 80 years. The net loss by migration since 1871 from the
present area of the United Kingdom is about 3J million. During the inter-censal
period 1931-51 the net balance of migration to and from the United Kingdom was
inward for the first time in the past century. The net gain to the United Kingdom
from civilian migration was about half a million, a net gain of three-quarters of a
million to England and Wales being offset by net losses from Scotland and Northern
Ireland. This net gain was the balance of a large outward movement mainly of
British subjects emigrating, mostly since 1945, to Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and South Africa, and a larger inward movement mainly of aliens from Europe,
many of whom were refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. Taking only the period
1946-51 the balance of migration was outward owing to the high net outflow (some
65,000 a year) of British citizens to Commonwealth countries overseas. In 1951
this net outflow reached a peak of 85,000, but it was subsequently reduced, chiefly
owing to increased immigration into Britain from other parts of the Commonwealth,
particularly the West Indies, and total net migratory movement for the years 1952 to
1956 has certainly been small and probably inward. In the fourth quarter of 1956,
however, there began a marked increase in emigration to Canada.
Age Distribution. The first effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the
number of children, and therefore the ratio of dependent population to working
population. This ratio was at a minimum in the 1930s. Since then the continuous
fall in death rates and the low inter-war birth rates have been increasing the propor¬
tion of elderly people, and thus reducing the proportion of the working population
to the total population. The small age groups born between the wars have been
coming to maturity. The size of the age groups reaching retirement age increases
yearly, as these groups were born during a period of rapidly expanding population.
The continuing fall of death rates in all age groups has still further increased the
number of old persons. Moreover, the higher birth rates since 1942 have arrested
the compensating fall in the number of dependent children. At mid-1956 the age
distribution of the United Kingdom was estimated as follows:
Under 15 .. .. 23-1 per cent
65 and over .. .. 11 -4 per cent
15 to 64 .. .. 65-5 per cent.
THE BRITISH ISLES
II
During the present decade an unusually large proportion of the population of
the United Kingdom (about 15 per cent) are between 40 and 50 years of age.
Assuming that mortality rates continue to fall, and disregarding migration, it can
therefore be shown that:
(1) over the next 15 years the population of working age will remain roughly
constant;
(2) the number of old people (over 65) will increase over the next 30 years by
about 2| million.
These predictions are independent of the future course of births.
Sex Ratio. Total live births of boys currently exceed those of girls by about 6 per
cent, but owing to the higher infant mortality rate among boys, and the higher male
death rates in all age groups, women have for the past 100 years outnumbered men
from adolescence onwards and in the total population. Their predominance in¬
creases with age and is now over 60 per cent among persons over 70 years of age.
The fall in mortality has affected the sex ratio by increasing the proportion of old
persons in both sexes, which has made female predominance in those age groups a
weightier factor in the sex ratio of the population as a whole. At the same time
there has been a slight rise in the proportion of boys among children under 15
years of age.
The proportion of females to males in the total population has not varied greatly,
however, as these two effects have counterbalanced each other. At present there are
between seven and eight per cent more females than males.
Population Policy
A growing concern with population problems—and particularly with the causes
and effects of the decline in the size of families—led to the appointment in March
1944 of a Royal Commission on Population to inquire into the facts concerning
British population trends, their causes and probable consequences; and to ‘con¬
sider what measures, if any, should be taken in the national interest to influence the
future trend of population’.
The Commission reported in March 1949* It found that the main cause, and
very probably the only cause, of the fall in family size was the spread of deliberate
family limitation. In the course of the nineteenth century, powerful economic, social
and cultural forces combined to tell against the continued acceptance of an uncon¬
trolled birth rate.
The Commission’s recommendations aimed at reducing the economic disadvan¬
tages of parenthood. It proposed increased family allowances; reform of income
tax to reduce the disadvantages of parenthood for the well-to-do; the building of
more houses with more than three bedrooms; the further development of family
health and welfare services; and research and education in population questions.
Most of these recommendations are gradually being implemented.

The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and of each

increases were in the eastern, southern, midland and south-western regions of
England, and in Northern Ireland. The smallest increase was in Wales. Since 1951
the main increases have been in the eastern, southern and north midland regions of
England.
The population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly urban
and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour demands of newly
developing industry drew great numbers from the countryside to the towns, the
urban element continuously and rapidly outgrew the rural element. At the end of
the nineteenth century 75 per cent of the British population was living within the
boundaries of urban administrative areas and the large conurbation1 was already the
dominant type of British community. By 1911, the economic and social limits of
these conurbations extended far beyond the administrative boundaries of the cities
which formed their core, owing to the building of outer suburbs which linked up
neighbouring towns. Since 1921, nearly 40 per cent of the population has lived in
the seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of London, Glasgow,
Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Bradford,
and Newcastle upon Tyne (see Table 2, pp. 14-15).
During the twentieth century the general character of urbanization changed, the
later increases in urban areas being relatively much smaller and much more due to
the natural growth of the towns than to the influx of population from rural areas.
Moreover, two new and decided trends became apparent: first, the outer rings of
conurbations and the suburbs of large cities began to increase in population much
more rapidly than the large cities themselves; secondly, there was a considerable
migration, particularly of young adults, to the expanding new light industries and
suburban residential areas springing up in and around London and Birmingham.
This movement was intensified by the heavy unemployment of the inter-war years
which affected with particular severity the textile and heavy engineering industries
of Scotland, Northern England and South Wales.
The combined effect of these two trends was that the outer rings of the London
and Birmingham conurbations increased most in population, while the remoter
country areas and some industrial towns of Scotland, Wales and Northern England
declined. In urban areas in England and Wales, the medium-sized towns of between
50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants increased most rapidly, while the populations of
very large or very small towns tended to decline.
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the
population of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many people
had returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. At the 1951 Census
many large cities and towns had larger populations than in 1939, but the popula¬
tions of others, notably London, were reduced. The decrease in the County of
London was about two-thirds of a million, and in spite of an increase in the popu¬
lation of the outer ring, the population of Greater London, 8,348,023, was 380,000
less than in 1939. The populations of many urban and rural areas surrounding
Greater London have continued to increase very rapidly.
Table 2 shows the distribution of the population by urban and rural districts
and the populations of the standard administrative regions, of the seven major
conurbations and of 16 large cities, some of which are the principal cities included
in the conurbations.

Census Reports and Estimates by Population Authorities.
(a) The boundaries of some of these administrative areas have been altered from time to
time. The population figures given for cities relate to the areas as these were defined in the
year noted at the head of each column. The figures for regions and conurbations, however,
relate as nearly as possible to areas as constituted in 1951.
(b) Area at the date of the 1951 Census of Population.
(c) Mid-year estimate.
(d) 1926 and 1937 census figures.
Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language pre¬
dominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic, is the first
language of most of the population in some of the central and northern counties
and was spoken by 29 per cent of the population at the time of the 1951 census.
In Scotland, nearly 100,000 persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness,
Argyll, and Lanark, speak the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few families
in Northern Ireland speak the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish
varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living languages, although, in the Isle
of Man, Manx is spoken by a few people, and is used in addition to English for
certain official pronouncements.
French is still the official language of Jersey, but, in Guernsey, English is now
used for almost all official proceedings. English is spoken throughout the Channel
Islands, although a Norman French patois is still also spoken there by some people.
Social Patterns
A general summary of trends in social organization, similar in scope to the fore¬
going summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful, however,
to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British households and
the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide a background to the
information given in later chapters on such matters as town planning, housing, and
transport.
Number and Composition of Households
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of private
households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population was enumer¬
ated by the censuses of 1911, 1921, I931 an<3 IQS1 ln institutions such as hotels,
schools, and hospitals.
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included
in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, and Argyll.
i6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1911 there were about nine million private households1 in Great Britain. By
1951, according to the censuses of England and Wales, and of Scotland, there were
about 145 million households, an increase of about 60 per cent. This expansion
seems out of proportion to the 19 per cent increase in the total population for the
same period. It was in fact comparable with the proportionate increase in the
population of persons over 24 years old and the slightly larger proportionate
increase in the number of married persons. In other words, the increasing age of
the population meant more but smaller families. The average size of household in
Great Britain fell from 4-5 persons in 1911 to 3-2 in 1951. In England and Wales
the number of persons living in households of one or two persons almost tripled
between 1911 and 1951. At the end of this period such households constituted about
40 per cent of private households and comprised about 20 per cent of the popula¬
tion in private households. About two-thirds of the persons living alone in 1951
were 60 years of age or over, while in 43 per cent of families of two persons, the
head of the household was 60 or over.
It has been difficult to increase the number of separate dwelling-places (houses
or flats) sufficiently rapidly to overtake the increasing number of private house¬
holds, and this difficulty was aggravated by the suspension of house-building and
the destruction of property during the second world war. There were in 1951 only
some 13-7 million structurally separate dwelling-places in Great Britain, and about
2 million households shared a home (see also p. 386). It is unofficially estimated
that about three-quarters of all dwellings in Great Britain are terraced or semi¬
detached houses (usually of 4 to 6 dwelling-rooms including bedrooms) while the
remaining quarter consists of detached houses and flats in approximately equal
numbers. The proportion of flats is greatly above average in Scotland (estimated at
about 60 per cent) and considerably above average in London (estimated at 17
per cent).
Of the 14! million private households in Great Britain in 1951, n| million were
estimated according to the 1951 Census One Per Cent Sample Tables (based on an
analysis of a representative one per cent sample of census returns in Great Britain)
to be of the simplest type, comprising married couples or widowed persons with
their children, if any, or persons living alone. More specifically, they comprised
3-2 million married couples with no children, 900,000 widowed persons living
alone, 6-9 million married couples or widowed persons with children of any age,
600,000 single persons living alone. Over a third of all married couples living alone
were 60 years old or over; less than a quarter of the married couples under 40 years
of age in these simplest types of household had no children; and the majority of the
single persons living alone were over 40 years old.
Nearly another million households were of these simple types except for the
inclusion of parents or non-married brothers or sisters of the head of the household.
Only 2 million households contained persons less closely related to the head than
parent or brother or sister, or contained non-relatives. There were nearly a million
families consisting of married couples, or married or widowed persons with
children, who were without their own homes, and the majority of these were living
in the homes of their parents. Apart from these satellite family groups, 1,102,700
households contained an aggregate of 1,240,000 other persons unrelated or distantly
related to the head of the household, the bulk of whom were presumably of the
status of boarders.2 Of these more than half a million constituted sole individual
1 Counting persons living alone as one-person households.
2 According to census definitions, persons paying for lodging and meals are boarders;
lodgers cook for themselves and therefore are enumerated as separate households.
THE BRITISH ISLES
17
additions to the more normal types of families with married heads. There were
nearly 300,000 households consisting of two persons who were distantly related or
were unrelated to one another.
Over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were estimated in the
1951 Census Sample Tables to be without children under 16, while another 3-1
million contained only one child.
In Great Britain as a whole it was estimated that, in 1951, 180,000 households
had resident domestic servants, who numbered, in all, 205,000. Of these, about
half were in households of one or two other persons, and over a quarter were
in the households of single or widowed or divorced persons, 40 years old or
over, living alone except for a servant. A sample analysis of 1931 census data
covering only England and Wales estimated 706,800 resident domestic servants
in private households, which compares with 178,000 in England and Wales in
WS1-
The small average size of households does not imply that wider family and kin¬
ship ties are without strength and social significance. Indeed, a recent study,
Family and Kinship in East Lcmdon (see Bibliography, p. 464) has stressed the
importance of the mutual help of relatives and neighbours in the long-established
and balanced communities living in the more crowded parts of East London. The
survey, which also covered a suburban area of Greater London, noted the dangers
of weakening such ties when households are moved out to more congenial
suburban surroundings.
Work and Leisure
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time gainful
employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in full-time
gainful employment (see p. 271). In many cases housewives also undertake part-
time or even full-time employment.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually about
44 hours a week, with some variation on each side. Actual weekly hours worked by
men average a little longer owing to overtime working, and actual hours worked by
women and girls average a little less (see p. 294). To these hours must often be
added the time taken in travel to and from work. The 1951 census showed that
a million of the million and a third persons working in Central London lived out¬
side it and that many travelled in from the fringes of Greater London and some
from farther away. A sample survey of travel in Greater London, made in 1954,
showed that 89 per cent of workers in Greater London made regular journeys to
work and that 56 per cent of workers used public transport. The average time
taken by such persons was 39 minutes each way, though for workers in Central
London it was 47 minutes each way.
In addition, there is often a long journey from home to the main shopping centre
in both urban and rural areas. According to a sample survey made in 1946 it
averaged about 18 minutes each way, and in many rural areas took much longer.
In most areas there are, of course, a few shops much closer at hand.
One consequence of the distance from home to work and to shops is the growth
of the habit of eating away from home. Food rationing restrictions during the
second world war and the early post-war years tended to increase this habit, which
has also been encouraged by the establishment of factory and office canteens
and the provision of midday meals in schools. About half the total number
of school children and many adults take some meals regularly outside their
homes.
x8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
According to a sample survey made in 1947, only 6 per cent of housewives
employ any paid help, and only 1 per cent1 have a resident servant. Such surveys
confirm, what would in any case be readily deduced from everyday experience, that
housewives have less leisure and considerably fewer periods of continuous leisure
of over one hour than other persons in Britain, in spite of the spread of labour-
saving devices for the home. (In 1955 one household in two had a vacuum cleaner,
one in six a washing machine and one in nine a refrigerator.)
Nearly all employees, in addition to 1J or 2 days’ holiday each week and 6 statu¬
tory public holidays a year, get at least one week’s continuous holiday in the year,
and most employees are now entitled to two weeks’ holiday a year (see p. 294). In
fact, about half the population take at least a week’s holiday away from home every
year, mostly in July and August. Some two-thirds of these spend their holiday by
the sea in Britain. A relatively small but rapidly increasing number of holiday¬
makers go abroad: over 2j million in 1956, including nearly half a million to the
Channel Islands and to the Republic of Ireland; in the same year, over a million
overseas tourists came to visit Britain (see p. 322).
At least a quarter of the adult population is interested in playing or going to
watch outdoor sports2; the most popular are Association football and cricket. In
England alone about 23,000 football clubs—mainly amateur clubs—are affiliated to
the English Football Association, excluding the numerous clubs in the armed forces,
universities and schools. Some 750,000 youths and men play in weekly football
matches during the winter months, apart from those playing in informal games;
spectators at professional football matches number between one and two million
weekly. Cricket is played by children, youths and men of every walk of life,
especially in England. Attendance at first-class cricket matches is somewhat
smaller than at professional football matches, but the ‘Test’ matches with the
cricket teams of Commonwealth countries have become of nation-wide interest.
Cricket is less popular in Scotland, where golf has pride of place. Race meetings
throughout the country draw large crowds, while many other sporting events, for
instance, rugby football matches in the winter months and, in the summer, tennis
tournaments, especially the annual lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, have
their smaller but devoted public. Amateur athletic associations flourish throughout
the country, and every form of outdoor pursuit from swimming, hiking, cycling
and motoring3 to hunting, shooting and fishing has an enthusiastic following,
though many sports, such as sailing, gliding, and rock-climbing, are practised only
by relatively few keen amateurs. Climatic and physical conditions in Britain afford
few opportunities for ski-ing and mountaineering, but numbers of people go abroad
regularly for these pursuits.
The spread of television has added a vast new audience of indoor spectators to
the crowds who go to watch sporting events and great national occasions. By the
end of December 1956, one out of every two homes had a television set; viewers are
fairly evenly distributed among all sections of the population, irrespective of
income. The number of television licences is still increasing rapidly; in the four
1 This estimate has been shown to be approximately correct by the analysis of house¬
holds employing servants made in the 1951 Census Sample Tables (see p. 16).
2 A social survey of Derby made in 1953 showed that half the adult population in that
town, including two-thirds of the men, were at least occasional spectators of sporting
events, and that over one-fifth, including over half those under 25 years of age, actually
participated, most of them regularly.
3 There were over 6f million licensed motor vehicles in the summer of 1956, of which
over 31 million were cars and over million were motor cycles. Many of these vehicles,
however, are used partly, if not primarily, for business purposes.
THE BRITISH ISLES
19
years from end-June 1953 to end-June 1957 the number rose by over 4! million
(from 2,415,305 to 7,169,509).
Television has caused a large fall in cinema attendances among adults and has
affected leisure habits in many ways. The cinema remains, however, the most
popular form of indoor entertainment outside the home. A quarter of all adults,
including two-thirds of those under 25 years of age, and one out of two school
children go to the cinema, on average, at least once a week. Attendances at theatres
are much smaller, though most people visit them occasionally. There are only some
400 to 500 theatres in the country, compared with some 4,400 cinemas (see p. 433),
yet the Derby Survey showed that half of the adult population of that town went to the
theatre more than twice a year. About a quarter of the adult population of Derby
sometimes went to concerts, and in the country as a whole there is known to be
an enthusiastic and growing public for concerts, ballet and opera.
Dancing is popular especially with those under 25 years of age. There have been
estimated to be some 450 regular dance halls in the United Kingdom which open
three times a week or more and employ a manager, and between 4,000 and 5,000
recognized schools of ballroom dancing. Dances and other social gatherings are also
often held in other halls or in club-rooms. The Derby Survey showed that in that
town nearly half the adult population, including 60 per cent of the men, belonged
to a social, sporting or cultural club and that over a third of them visited such a club
at least once a month.
Organizations of national importance in social life and in the promotion of social
gatherings include, in addition to those connected with religious denominations,
the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the
Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,500 clubs with about 2 million members
(mainly but not entirely men) which are affiliated to the Working Men’s Club and
Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recreational, though they also
arrange lectures and classes. Some 1,800 Townswomens Guilds, with a total
membership of about 180,000 are affiliated to the National Union of Townswomen s
Guilds. The Guilds are both educational and social in purpose, and they co-operate
in many public welfare activities. The declared objective of the National Federation
of Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; the Institutes make
an important contribution to rural life by providing meeting places for country¬
women and organizing social gatherings. There are in villages throughout England
and Wales over 8,300 Institutes with some 459,°°o members, while in Scotland
and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar aims and
interests.
One traditional social rendezvous, the public house, has maintained and even
increased its popularity, although there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness
and in consumption of alcohol per head since the nineteenth century. The public
house now attracts a very wide circle of casual customers (both men and women)
as well as many ‘regulars’, who meet for a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play
some traditional public house game such as darts. A recent, and in some ways rival,
feature of urban life, especially in London, is the coffee bar. A characteristic of
many of these coffee bars, which stay open until late at night and are popular as a
rendezvous for young people, is their modern ddcor. On the other hand many
people, especially the married and the elderly, spend much of their leisure at home
—reading, listening to the radio, viewing television, or pursuing hobbies. The most
widespread hobbies are practical, for example, gardening. The standard of town
and country gardens is high.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in some
form of group activity of a serious nature, connected, for example, with the
20
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
churches, trade unionism, politics, social welfare and reform, or with cultural
pursuits such as amateur dramatics or music. People with such interests are, of
course, in a minority,1 but they constitute an important and characteristic feature
of British life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the working of British
democracy.
1 The figures from the Derby Survey showed that 8 per cent of adults in that town
belonged to intellectual or cultural clubs or societies, 11 per cent were members of some
political party, 13 per cent went to church every week (although 9 out of 10 homes had a
Bible), and 3 per cent held some church office.
II. GOVERNMENT AND
ADMINISTRATION
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical state, whose origins go back to the ninth
century when all England was unified under a Saxon king. Wales and Ireland
became part of the kingdom before the end of the thirteenth century, and the
English and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in the person of James I and
VI in 1603. In 1707, the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland provided
that the two countries ‘should be forever united into one kingdom’, and one Parlia¬
ment (the Parliament of Great Britain) became the supreme authority in both
countries. In 1801, the authority of this Parliament was extended to the whole of
the United Kingdom by a provision of the Act for the Union of Great Britain and
Ireland, 1800, which joined the Irish Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain.
In 1922, the United Kingdom was diminished by the separation of the 26 counties
of Southern Ireland (now the Republic of Ireland). Meantime, the Government of
Ireland Act, 1920, had enacted a constitution for Northern Ireland which per¬
petuated Northern Ireland representation in the United Kingdom Parliament as
the supreme authority and, at the same time, provided that country with its own
legislature and executive, to deal with domestic affairs.
Fundamental policies on major issues are adopted for the whole of the United
Kingdom; methods of government, however, are flexible and adapted to individual
needs. Thus Welsh affairs are administered as far as possible in Wales and, in
recent years, a Cabinet Minister has been designated as Minister for Welsh Affairs.
Scotland has its own system of law, its own courts, its own established church, its
own educational system and its own Government Departments which are under
the direction of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a leading member of the
United Kingdom Government. The Northern Ireland Government Departments
are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies, not part of the United Kingdom) have
their own legislative assemblies and systems of local administration and of law, and
their own courts. At the same time, they have a special relationship with the
United Kingdom because of their proximity to the mainland and the antiquity of
their connection with the Crown. They are treated as part of the mainland for
purposes of trade and postal communication and are ‘territories for whose inter¬
national relations Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’. They are also
formally subject to the United Kingdom Parliament.
The United Kingdom is thus a multi-national nation; it is also one of the member
nations of the Commonwealth, all ofwhich (except the republics of India and Pakistan
and the Federation of Malaya) owe allegiance to the Crown. India, Pakistan and
Malaya, accept the Queen as the symbol of the free association of the member
nations and, as such, as the head of the Commonwealth.
Each member nation of the Commonwealth has its own separate constitution,
governed by different laws and customs, and subject to different powers of change.
21
22
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by common
law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions, which are not
part of the law of the land in that violation of them may lead to proceedings in a
court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable to the machinery of govern¬
ment. The rules of the constitution have never been codified, and can be changed
at any time by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by the general acceptance of
a new convention.
Under the present constitution, the organs of government are threefold:
(1) the Legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
(2) the Executive, which consists of the Cabinet and other Ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
Government Departments, most of them under the control of Ministers, and
all staffed by civil servants, who are responsible for administration at the
national level; local authorities, who administer and manage many services
at the local level; and statutory bodies, which are severally responsible for
the operation of particular nationalized industries or public services, and
which may be subject to ministerial control in varying degrees.
(3) the Judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The three organs of government are readily distinguishable: the same cannot be
said of their functions, which often intermingle and overlap.
This chapter will attempt to describe the machinery of government and adminis¬
tration of the United Kingdom in some detail in order to present a composite
picture of the processes through which the constitution now works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in spite of
interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon which
it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of
the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the year 829.
The Royal title in the United Kingdom is, according to the Royal Titles Act,
1953 : ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head
of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’. The form of the Royal title is varied
for the other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the
Crown, to suit the particular circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the other member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, the Queen is
represented by a Governor-General appointed by the Crown on the advice of the
Ministers of the country concerned. The functions of the Governor-General are to
fill the role of ceremonial head of the State and to exercise the prerogative powers
of the Crown in public administration according to the constitutional practice
obtaining in the country to which he is accredited. As the Queen’s representative,
the Governor-General is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government;
he is sometimes a national of the country in which he holds office. In the dependent
territories—the Colonies, the Protectorates and the Trust Territories—the Queen
is represented by Governors, High Commissioners or Residents, who are appointed
by the Crown, but who have, in addition, varying executive and legislative powers,

and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good governance
of the countries concerned. In the Channel Islands, and in the Isle of Man, the
Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor.
Both the permanence of the monarchy, and its divisibility, have been ascribed
to the fact that the United Kingdom has no rigid constitutional code. Principles
and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the constitution can be adapted to
changing conditions without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
Succession
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, i7OI> which laid it
down that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent
Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Subsequent Succes¬
sion to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and although succession is
not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a provision
of the Statute of Westminster, 1931) except by common consent of the member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide that
the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne according to
their seniority, or, if there are no sons, the daughters in order of seniority. When a
daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and powers of the Crown are
vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the
consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband ; but the converse does not
apply, and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession of
another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign is
proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and
other leading citizens of the City of London, and the High Commissioners in
London of the member nations of the Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
Coronation
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony, which has frequently been modified
in detail to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time, has remained
much the same in substance for nearly a thousand years. The service used at the
coronation of Queen Fdizabeth II in 1953 was derived from the service used at the
coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of repre¬
sentatives of the peers, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Common¬
wealth countries, and of representatives of foreign States.
Acts of Government
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in England
and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief of all the
armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established Church of
1 The Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
25
England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process, during which many
restrictions on the Royal Prerogative have been imposed, these powers have changed
from being the weapon of the monarchy to being the means of giving effect to the
public will. Today, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she
cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United King¬
dom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation during
the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers without any
necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; she opens the new
session with a speech from the throne; and she must give Royal Assent before a Bill
which has passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enact¬
ment. The Queen is ‘the fountain of justice’, and in spite of the fact that the
judiciary is now completely independent of the executive, ‘all jurisdictions of the
courts are either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’. As ‘the foun¬
tain of honour’, the Queen confers peerages, knighthoods and other honours,1 and
she makes appointments to all important State offices, including those of judges,
officers in the armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions
in the established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the realm
of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the State, the
Queen has the prerogative power to conclude treaties (see p. 32), to cede or
accept territory, to declare war and to make peace.
Other prerogative powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by
Royal Charter; the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of
infants and persons of unsound mind; the administration of charities; coinage; the
grant of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries; the right to treasure trove
(see p. 80); and the sole right of printing or licensing others to print the Bible, the
Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
There is clear ministerial responsibility for all these acts of government, as is
shown in the three ways in which the royal will can be constitutionally expressed:
by Order in Council (see p.38) made ‘ by and with the advice of the Privy Council ’;
by Order, Commission or Warrant under the sign manual, which generally bears
the signature of one or more responsible ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs,
Letters Patent, or other documents under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord
Chancellor in obedience to a Royal Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the smooth
working of government; for although the Queen has no personal authority and
must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be informed and con¬
sulted on every aspect of the national life to the widest possible extent. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has been
made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the
Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or if the Heir Apparent or the Heir Presumptive
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few, i.e. the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order, the Most Noble Order of the
Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle, are conferred by the
Sovereign personally.
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is under the age of eighteen on accession to the throne. In the event of the
Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appoint¬
ment of Counsellors of State to carry out those of the royal functions which are
delegated to them. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act, 1953—laid down
that the first potential Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh and thereafter
the Princess Margaret and then those in succession to the throne who are of age.
Ceremonial
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the British
Isles, and in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook of
both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are the same today
as they were many centuries ago.
The formal ceremony of Presentation still takes place, although now at the After¬
noon Presentation Parties held by the Queen, which have superseded the former
Courts. Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and royal funerals are still
marked by ancient ceremonial, although to a lesser degree than in former days.
The birthday of the Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many royal and public
functions, is today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on
the Horse Guards Parade.
State banquets still take place when a foreign monarch or head of State pays
a visit to the United Kingdom; investitures are still held at Buckingham Palace,
although today honours may be bestowed without the personal attendance of the
recipient upon the Sovereign. State processions are still an integral part of royal
ceremonial; they grace such social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as
Royal Ascot; and they add significance to the opening of Parliament, when the
Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating from
the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal ordinances,
ancient usage, established custom and the public will. The Queen’s presence at
the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial, and charitable works of national
importance ensures nation-wide interest and support.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the House
of Lords and the House of Commons—which together represent all the elements
in the nation.
The three sections of ‘ Parliament ’ in this sense are outwardly separate: they are
constituted on entirely different principles; they do different work in different
places and they meet only on occasions of great symbolic significance such as the
Coronation or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate with¬
out the concurrence of all its parts, except in the case of measures passed under
the Parliament Acts, 1911 and 1949 (see pp. 32 and 34).
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the United
Kingdom; it can legislate for all the British Islands; for the United Kingdom; for
Great Britain; for England and Wales separately, or for Scotland alone. It is not,
however, the only legislature, for the Northern Ireland Parliament (see pp. 21
and 37) has power to legislate in certain spheres, and within the British Islands
the ancient legislatures of the two Channel Island Bailiwicks (the States) and of the
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
27
Isle of Man (the Tynwald) both legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless, the
Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical limits
there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, the normal life of the United King¬
dom Parliament was fixed at five years (although it may be and often is dissolved
in less than that time); and since one Parliament cannot bind its successor (for
otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not be sovereign or supreme), each
assembly has a period of time of up to five years during which it may legislate
exactly as it chooses. During its life, it can make or unmake any law; it can destroy
by statute the most firmly established convention of the constitution; it can legalize
past illegalities and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has power
to prolong its own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years
without consulting the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice, Parliament
does not attempt to exert its supremacy in this way. In the first place, pressure of
business in recent decades has resulted in a large and increasing amount of delega¬
tion of legislative authority to ministers (see pp. 34-36), and of specific powers to
local authorities and to public corporations of various kinds. Powers delegated in
this way could, of course, be withdrawn by Parliament, but existing demands on
parliamentary time make such a development extremely unlikely. Secondly, the
system of party government in the United Kingdom effectively discourages Parlia¬
ment from acting in too arbitrary a fashion; any parliamentary majority which
abused its powers would almost certainly suffer severely at the hands of the electors.
The Meeting of Parliament
A ‘Parliament’, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with a
proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council. Such a
proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and, on the other,
orders the issue of writs for the election of a new one and appoints the day and
place of its meeting.
Formerly the death of a Sovereign involved the dissolution of Parliament, since
Parliament meets on the personal summons of the monarch. However, since the
passing of the Representation of the People Act, 1867, made the duration of Parlia¬
ment independent of the demise of the Crown, both Houses stand adjourned only
until their members have taken the Oath of Allegiance to the new Sovereign, which
occurs immediately after the Accession Council has made the order for Proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or dissolution
is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a commission under the Great
Seal, which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new session. The date so
appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The
effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate all business until Parliament is sum¬
moned again, when any measures not yet passed must be re-introduced, unless it
has been decided that they are to be abandoned.
During the session, either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A re¬
assembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by virtue of
powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinize each
legislative measure before it becomes law.
28
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The average length of a session is about 160 sitting days, divided by custom into
the following periods: one from November until Christmas lasting about 30 sitting
days, one from January to Easter of about 50 sitting days, one from Easter until
Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one from Whitsun until the end of July
lasting about 40 sitting days. In addition, in recent years, the session has usually
concluded with a short period of about 10 sitting days in October, after the long
summer recess.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of over 800 peers, as follows: (1) princes of the
royal blood (who nowadays take no active part in proceedings), (2) 26 spiritual
peers (the two archbishops and 24 senior bishops of the Church of England), (3)
all hereditary peers (other than minors and those who have not applied for a writ
of summons) of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom,1 (4) 16 hereditary
peers of Scotland elected from their ow n number for each Parliament in accordance
with the provisions of the Treaty of Union, 1707, (5) four representative peers of
'Ireland elected for life,2 and (6) nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary appointed to
perform the judicial duties of the House and holding their seats therein for life.
Temporal peerages are conferred as a mark of distinction by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister, who may be advised by his ministerial colleagues and
others. All, except the judicial peerages, are hereditary and, with the exception of
the Scottish and Irish peerages, they carry with them, for men over 21 years of age,
a right to a seat in the House of Lords. A summons to Parliament cannot be with¬
held from a peer who is entitled to it, but only about a quarter of the members take
an active part in the work of the House, although many more may attend on
occasions when some matter in which they have a special interest is being dis¬
cussed. During recent sessions the average daily attendance has been just under one
hundred.
Peers taking part in the debate in the House of Lords are generally persons of
very considerable experience, who can claim to speak with authority on the subject
under review. Many are elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in
public service. Peers receive no salary for their work in Parliament, but may claim
an expenses allowance. Party politics have little effect upon the membership of the
House, which remains relatively stable over a long period of time.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who is the Speaker
of the House. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and who pro¬
nounces the words of assent to Bills; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who
enforces the orders of the House; and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord
Chancellor.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is a popular assembly elected by an almost universal
adult suffrage and containing members from all sections of the community regard¬
less of income or occupation. There are at present 630 members of the House of
Commons (511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
1 Peerages created between 1707 (the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland) and
1800, are peerages of Great Britain; those created since the Act for the Union of Great
Britain and Ireland, 1800, are peerages of the United Kingdom.
2 By the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, 1800, the Irish peers were
entitled to elect 28 representatives, but since 1922 no new peers have been elected.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
2Q
Members of the House of Commons, who receive a salary for their parliamentary
work, hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They are elected either at a
General Election, which takes place after Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election, which is held when a vacancy
occurs in the House as a result of the death or resignation of a member during the
life of a Parliament.
For electoral purposes, the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to Parliament. In order that the people shall at all
times be equitably represented by this means, permanent Boundary Commissions
for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (established in 1944) keep con¬
stituencies constantly under review and submit periodic reports, either recommend¬
ing some alteration in boundaries if, for instance, movement of the population has
made this necessary, or recommending no change. Changes in the boundaries of
constituencies which came into effect for the 1955 General Election increased the
number of seats in the House of Commons from 625 to 630.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained in three consolidating
statutes, the most important of which is the Representation of the People Act, 1949,
which repeals and re-enacts in a single statute previous legislation relating to the
franchise, the conduct of elections and corrupt and illegal electoral practices. The
other Acts are the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, and the
Election Commissioners Act, 1949. Under the provisions of these Acts, election to
the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in which all United Kingdom
citizens (except members of the House of Lords) and all citizens of the Common¬
wealth and of the Republic of Ireland who are resident in the United Kingdom
are entitled to vote, provided that they are 21 years old or over, and unless they
suffer any legal incapacity to vote. A register containing the names of all electors is
prepared and published yearly by registration officers, who, in England and Wales,
are usually the clerks of local councils, and in Scotland are the lands valuation
assessors. Electors normally vote in person at polling stations specially established
for the purpose, although Service voters, i.e. members of the armed forces, Crown
servants of the United Kingdom employed overseas, and the wives of such persons
if resident overseas with their husbands may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in
certain cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for
such reasons as illness or the nature of his work. All entitled to vote may stand for
election, except undischarged bankrupts, clergymen of the established Churches of
England and Scotland, of the Church of Ireland and of the Roman Catholic Church,
and such persons as are disqualified under the Disqualification Act, 1957.
The chief parliamentary officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is
elected by the members as president of the House immediately after a new Parlia¬
ment is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means (see p. 34), and the Deputy-Chairman, who may act as Deputy-
Speaker; both these officers are elected by the House. In addition there are the
party officials, i.e. the Government and Opposition Whips. Non-parliamentary or
permanent officers of the House, i.e. those who are not members of Parliament,
include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who is charged with such matters as
keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing Orders; the Serjeant-at-Arms,
who attends the Speaker in the House; and the Chaplain to the Speaker.
Parliamentary Privilege
Both Houses of Parliament enjoy certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect them from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out their duties. These
privileges apply collectively to the Houses and individually to each member.
3°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown for the
Commons ‘ their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges ’ at the beginning of
each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil proceedings for a
period of forty days before to forty days after a session of Parliament; freedom of
speech in debate; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective
privilege of the House. Further privileges include the right (rarely exercised) to
debate in secret; the right to control internal proceedings; and the right to pro¬
nounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds.
The privileges of the House of Lords are freedom from civil arrest for peers as
for members of the House of Commons; freedom of speech in debate; freedom of
access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to commit for con¬
tempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House
of Commons; they exist independently without grant.
The Party System
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth cen¬
tury, and has now become an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the fact that there are three effective political
parties in the United Kingdom: Conservative, Labour and Liberal, each of which
lays rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a General Election, these
parties (and any minor parties that may be in existence at the time) may all put up
candidates for election; independent candidates may also stand.1 The electorate
then indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the majority
of votes) at a General Election, or which is able to command a majority of sup¬
porters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition, the leader
of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign, usually on
the formal advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding members
in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments
on the advice of the Prime Minister. The larger of the two minority parties becomes
the Official Opposition with its own leader and its own council of discussion or
‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or any Independents
who have been elected may support the Government or the Opposition according
to their party’s or their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.
In the General Election which took place on the 26th May, 1955, 76-8 per cent
of the electorate voted, compared with 76-1 per cent in 1945, 84 per cent in 195°.
and 82-6 per cent in 1951. The number of votes cast for the principal parties is
shown in Table 3.
The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the General
Elections of 1951 and 1955 is shown in Table 4.
The effectiveness of the party system rests to a considerable extent upon the fact
that Government and Opposition alike are carried on by agreement: that is to say,
the minority agrees that the majority must govern and, therefore, accepts its deci¬
sions ; and the majority agrees that the minority should criticize and, therefore, sets
time aside for that criticism to be heard. As far as is compatible with effective
1 In the General Election of May 1955, the choice was between Labour and Conservative
in'most constituencies. Liberal candidates numbered no. In a few constituencies, two of
the parties agreed to support the same candidate. The number of candidates representing
other political parties was very small.

candidates now represent both constituencies.

government, the Prime Minister meets the convenience of the Leader of the Opposi¬
tion and the Leader of the Opposition meets the convenience of the Prime Minister.
Through the respective Whips there is a measure of agreement on the subjects to
be debated and on the time to be allowed; sometimes even on the information to
be provided and the proposed line of attack. In this way, Parliament has a chance
of hearing a full discussion on policy from every point of view.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local organiza¬
tions ; inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips, who in addition to their other
32
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
functions are expected to keep their forces effective by all means in their power.
For the Government, this work is done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, the Junior Lords of the Treasury, and the political officers of the House¬
hold—the Treasurer, the Comptroller and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Opposition
Whips have no official position and are not paid from public funds, but their
parliamentary duties are the same.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on forms and rules, many of which date back
to the beginning of the sixteenth century and even earlier.
Each House has its own Standing Orders, but the system of debate is much the
same in the two Houses, except that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
much greater measure of control. In the House of Lords, the office of Speaker
could be held by a commoner, since the Woolsack on which the Lord Chancellor
sits as Speaker is technically outside the precincts of the House. In fact, the office
is always held by a peer, but it carries with it only a limited authority to check or
curtail debate. Such matters are decided by the general sense of the House and not
by rulings of its Speaker.
In the Commons, the Speaker has the prime duty of controlling debate. It is his
responsibility to see that parliamentary time is used to the best possible advantage
and, therefore, although he must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or any
infringement of minority rights, he has power to limit unreasonable obstruction and
his rulings on points of order cannot be challenged at the time. The Speaker has
the right to allow or disallow a closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end dis¬
cussion so that the matter may be put to the vote), to check irrelevance in debate,
and to refuse to admit delaying tactics. In cases of grave and continuous disorder,
he may even adjourn the House or suspend the sitting.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number of
votes is cast, the Speaker must give the decisive vote; he does this in such a way as
to avoid change and leave the question to be debated on another occasion.
The Speaker has the responsibility of deciding whether a Bill is a Money Bill
(i.e. a Bill dealing only with national taxation and finance, which comes within the
terms of the Parliament Act, 1911); and who, in case of doubt, is the Leader of the
Opposition. He is also responsible for such extraneous matters as the decision
whether a prima facie case has been made against persons accused of breach of
privilege; the issue of warrants for elections to fill vacancies in the House; and the
appointment of the chairmen of the Standing Committees.
All proceedings of either House (except secret sessions) are public, and a verba¬
tim record is published daily in the official reports, Parliamentary Debates {Hansard).
Parliamentary Functions
The main functions of Parliament today are (1) to make laws regulating the life
of the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make avail¬
able finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds necessary
for the services of the State, and (3) to criticize and control the Government (see
page 36). By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of certain
international treaties and agreements, in spite of the fact that the making of treaties
is a Royal Prerogative (see p. 25) exercised on the advice of the Government which,
strictly speaking, is under no obligation to obtain parliamentary approval at all.
In practice, there are two types of agreement about which Parliament is con¬
sulted : treaties which could not be implemented without legislation; and treaties of
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
33
such political importance that the Government feels obliged to arrange a debate on
the matter before becoming committed. In the case of other treaties requiring rati¬
fication, it is customary to presume parliamentary acquiescence unless disapproval
is expressed within 21 days from the date on which the treaty was laid before
Parliament.
In the past, legislation was initiated from both sides of the House; but in present-
day practice almost all Bills are brought forward by the Government in power as a
result of policy decisions taken in the Cabinet at the instigation of those Govern¬
ment Departments which will be responsible for their administration when the
Bills become law. The chief exceptions are Private Bills,1 which relate solely to some
matterof individual, corporate or local interest, and Private Members’ Bills, which
are Public Bills introduced by members on their own initiative on certain days set
aside expressly for the purpose.
Bills may be introduced in either House, unless they deal with finance or repre¬
sentation, when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however,
no Bills likely to raise much political controversy are introduced in the Lords, as
the House of Commons is considered a more suitable place of origin for measures
of that kind. On the other hand, legislation of an intricate but non-controversial
nature is frequently introduced and fully discussed in the Lords before being sent
to the Commons, who can then deal with it more speedily.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of Lords
as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading on introduc¬
tion ; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies between one and
several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it may be given a Second Reading
as the result of a debate on its general merits or principles. It is then referred, in
the Commons, either to one of the Standing Committees appointed for the purpose
by the Committee of Selection2 3 and composed of members of all parties in the same
proportion as in the whole House, or, if the House so decides, to the whole House
sitting in Committee; and, in the Lords, to a Committee of the whole House.
During the Committee stage, members may suggest appropriate amendments,
which will be incorporated into the Bill if the majority of the Committee agrees.
When this stage is finished, the Bill is reported to the House, and a further stage
takes place during which the Committee’s amendments may be altered, additional
amendments may be suggested and incorporated, and, if necessary, the Bill may
be recommitted to Committee. Finally, it is submitted for a Third Reading and, if
passed, it is sent on from the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to the
Commons (depending on its place of origin), where it enters on the same course
again. Any amendments which the second House makes to the Bill must be agreed
to by the first House or a compromise reached, before the Bill becomes law.
An exception to this procedure is made in the case of some financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorizes annual taxation and amends existing taxation,
and the Appropriation Bill, which authorizes expenditure on the Supply Services
from the Consolidated Fund.8 As a general rule, these Bills must be introduced in
1 Such Bills, which are usually promoted by persons or bodies outside Parliament, are
founded on petitions to Parliament, and promoters must give notice of their intention to
all persons and bodies whose interests may be affected by their proposals. Committees are
small, consisting of five members in the Lords and four members in the Commons. The
committee stage is quasi-judicial and provision is made for counsel to represent supporters
and opposers of the Bill.

the House of Commons upon Resolutions in a Committee of the whole House (the
Committee of Ways and Means) and they may be initiated only by a Minister of the
Crown.
All Bills which have passed through their various parliamentary stages are sent
to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, which is given either by the Sovereign in person
or (usually) by commission. The right of veto has not been exercised since the early
eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the Com¬
mons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; and they are
then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent. However,
should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would never reach the
Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—at any rate until a new
Government came into power, when it might be revived. The Lords, on the other
hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a Bill passed in the Commons from becom¬
ing law. In the normal course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons
and return it unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return
it for the consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to the
amendments made. They cannot require the Commons to agree to amendments;
nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in respect of Money
Bills; and since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1949, any other Bill which has
been passed by the House of Commons in two successive sessions may be presented
for Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed
between the date of the Second Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date
on which it is finally passed in that House. These limitations to the powers of the
Lords are based on the fundamental principle that the function of the Upper House,
which is a non-representative assembly, is not to thwart the will of the people, but
to use the combined experience and wisdom of its members to ensure that that will
is precisely and reasonably interpreted. In other words, proceedings in the House
of Lords impose a second stage in the legislative process which gives time for
reflection and is in itself worth while for eliciting new points of view.
Parliamentary Committees
There are three kinds of Parliamentary Committee, all of which exist to a varying
degree to relieve the full assembly of Parliament of some of the details of its more
specialized and complex work. They are: regular Standing Committees (see p. 33),
which are concerned with current legislation; official Parliamentary Committees,
such as the Committee of Privileges and the Select Committees on Public Accounts
(see pp. 300-1), on Estimates (see p. 301), on Statutory Instruments, and on the
Nationalized Industries (see p. 145), which are concerned with particular aspects
of parliamentary work; and a number of informal committees, consisting of mem¬
bers either of one party or of all parties, such as study groups concerning themselves
with particular issues (e.g., the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, see p. 420),
parliamentary party committees (e.g., the Labour Policy Committee) and back¬
benchers’1 organizations (e.g., the Conservative Members’ Committee, known as
the 1922 Committee). These groups have grown up spontaneously and have a
varying degree of influence upon the development of Government policy.
Delegated Legislation
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by Act of Parliament but by Orders
in Council, Orders, Warrants, Regulations and Rules, has been part of the parlia¬
mentary system for at least six hundred years. One of the earliest recorded examples
1 Members who are neither ministers nor, as a rule, ex-ministers.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
35
is to be found in a statute of 1337 which laid down that no wool should be exported
from England ‘till the King and his Council do otherwise provide’. Parliament,
however, made but sparing use of its power to delegate legislation (except during
a period of social, political and economic change in the second half of the fifteenth
and most of the sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth century, when
a changing conception of the part to be played by the State in the life of the com¬
munity made inroads upon parliamentary time and thus caused the system to be
adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing scope of Government
activity in domestic affairs during the past fifty years, pressure on parliamentary
time has become even more acute; as a result, the system of delegated legislation
has become generally accepted, and there are at present few Acts of Parliament
which do not contain provisions for its use.
The advantages of the system of delegated legislation, which empowers ministers
and other authorities to regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an
Act, are said1 to be: (1) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before Parliament, thus
enabling Parliament to deal with a greater volume of business and to give fuller
attention to matters of policy and principle which are its primary concern; (2) that
it encourages flexibility, for administrative details can be worked out as and when
the necessity arises ‘with greater care and minuteness, and with better adaptation
to local and other special circumstances than they possibly can be during the
passage of a Bill through Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for
it is ‘the means by which the legislature can dispense with its own deliberative
procedure and arm the executive with power to take immediate action’; and (4)
that it provides a speedy, convenient and accurate means of giving effect to the
policy of Parliament.
In order to minimize the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative
powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, such powers are
normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities directly responsible
to Parliament: to Ministers of the Crown, to Government Departments for which
ministers are responsible, or to organizations whose legislation is subject to con¬
firmation or approval by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament
for it. Moreover the Acts of Parliament, by which particular powers are delegated,
frequently provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made
in the exercise of these powers. There are cases in which an instrument2 must be
approved by Parliament or the House of Commons before it can have permanent
operation (‘ affirmative resolution procedure ’), or in which Parliament or the House
of Commons may secure the annulment of an instrument by a resolution passed
within a certain number of days of the instrument being laid before it (‘ negative
resolution procedure ’), and others in which drafts of proposed instruments must be
laid before Parliament or the House of Commons before they are made and must
then be subject either to affirmative or negative resolution procedure. The resolu¬
tion, in the case of an instrument to be annulled after it has been made, takes the
form of an Address to Her Majesty that the instrument be annulled (after which
the instrument may be annulled by Order in Council).

Law, by Sir C. T. Carr. Oxford University Press. 1942. pp. 33_34*
2 Almost all delegated legislation of the central Government is enacted by means of
‘statutory instruments’, made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory Instru¬
ments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893. Instruments
of delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as ‘statutory rules and
orders’ (‘S.R. & O.’).
36
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
As a further safeguard, the principal Act generally defines the precise limits of
delegated legislative power; and if these limits are surpassed, the courts can be
moved to declare that the action taken is ultra vires. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organizations which will be affected by delegated legislation before
such legislation is made.
Parliamentary Control
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised in the
final analysis by the power of the House of Commons to pass a resolution of
‘no-confidence’ in the Government, or to reject a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘ matter of confidence ’; and thus
to force the Government to resign.
The financial control necessary to ensure that money shall be spent only with
the authority of Parliament and for the purposes authorized by Parliament is
described on pp. 298-301. Methods of general control are provided by:
(1) the institution of Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary
time during which members may question any minister on matters for
which that minister is responsible, and may thus focus the attention of
the public on the day-to-day processes of government;
(2) the practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates in Committee of
Supply (see page 299) has ceased to be a consideration of the financial
requirements of the Government and has become an occasion, initiated by
the Opposition, for the examination of some aspect of the Government’s
administrative policy which has been included in the Estimates;
(3) the practice of bringing on a debate later in the same day by moving the
adjournment of the House, which is permitted only if the matter is deemed
by the Speaker to be definite, urgent, of public importance, and to be the
responsibility of the Government, and if 40 members rise in their places
to support it, or 10 members rise and the House grants leave on a division;
(4) the right of members to raise any matter on the motion for the adjournment
of either House at the end of each day’s sitting; and
(5) the power to confirm or annul ministerial Orders and Regulations (see
page 35).
In addition, Government policy and action are fully discussed in the important
debates which take place during the proceedings at the opening of Parliament and
in the motion for the adjournment of the House before a recess.
Parliament and the Public
The public’s attitude to the work of Parliament has, in late years, been one of
growing interest. This is evidenced by the queues which form outside the House
of Commons for admission to the public gallery, by the growth in the circulation
of the daily official report {Hansard) which has increased to nearly eight times the
pre-war figure, and by the large radio audience which listens to two regular BBC
programmes: Today in Parliament, a fifteen-minute summary of the day’s pro¬
ceedings in both Houses, broadcast each evening when Parliament is sitting; and
The Week in Westminster, a commentary on each week’s work given by members
from various political parties in turn.
The major news agencies and national newspapers have special parliamentary
correspondents to report on parliamentary activities. The Hansard Society for
Parliamentary Government, an unofficial non-party educational society, was
founded in 1944 to promote interest in parliamentary affairs.

The Northern Ireland Parliament
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and a
House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by a
Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her Majesty’s
name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio Senators (the Lord Mayor of Belfast
and the Mayor of Londonderry) together with 24 Senators elected by the House of
Commons according to the principle of proportional representation; and the House
of Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of parliamentary franchise
similar to that which operates in the United Kingdom. The House, unless sooner
dissolved, continues in existence for a period of five years.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order
and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters except those
especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, i.e. the Crown or
succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the postal services; the judi¬
ciary ; customs and excise; income and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights
and measures; trade marks; submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial naviga¬
tion; and lighthouses, buoys and beacons. The Northern Ireland Parliament is also
prohibited from making laws which would interfere with religious freedom, and
from taking property without compensation.
In consequence of these reservations, provision was made in the Government
of Ireland Act, 1920, for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland con¬
stituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; by virtue of this
provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Before the emergence of the system of Cabinet government in the eighteenth
century, the Sovereign in Council or the Privy Council was the chief source of
executive power in the State. As this system developed, however, the Privy Council
declined in importance; many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and
much of its work was handed over to newly created Government Departments. The
present-day Privy Council exists mainly to give effect to policy decisions made
elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn of
the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council (which is
retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in some branch of
public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1956 there were
just under 280 Privy Counsellors.
Procedure and Functions
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council. At meetings where
the Sovereign is present, three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but, as a rule not
fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called together
only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
Meetings of the Privy Council are presided over by the Sovereign. The duties of
the Lord President in connection with these meetings are to attend the Sovereign’s
person, to manage the debates, to put forward proposals from the Sovereign at the
council table and to report to the Sovereign the resolutions of the Council thereon.
The Lord President also presides over committees of the Council (see overleaf).
Since 1660 the office of Lord President has been a political appointment held by a
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
38
member of the party in power, who is usually a leading member of the Cabinet, free
to undertake duties of a general nature.
The Privy Council is responsible for the making of Orders in Council, of which
there are two kinds differing fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made
in virtue of the Royal Prerogative as, for example, when approving the draft of
royal instructions to Governors; and those which are authorized by Act of Parlia¬
ment and are a form of delegated legislation (see pp. 34-36). Members of the Privy
Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby
become personally responsible for the policy upon which the Orders are based;
this rests with the ministers in whose Departments the draft Orders were framed,
whether they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council must be
published in the London Gazette, which is an official periodical published by the
authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of Royal Proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as summoning,
or dissolving Parliament) which are of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
Committees of the Privy Council
Advisory functions still belong to the committees of the Council, whose meetings
differ from the meetings of the full Council in that the Sovereign cannot constitu¬
tionally be present. These committees may be prerogative, such as the committee
which deals with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man for ratification by Order in Council, and the committees
for medical research, scientific and industrial research, agricultural research and
nature conservation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and for the Scottish universities, and that
which deals with applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The Privy Council Office
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in the
Privy Council Office, which is an ancient prerogative Department under the control
of the Lord President of the Council. Parts of the work relating to research are
undertaken by the Office of the Lord President of the Council.
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal on
certain legal issues arising in Australia and New Zealand and their dependencies,
in Ceylon, and in the United Kingdom dependent territories. Its appellate jurisdic¬
tion derives from the principle of English common law which recognizes ‘ the right
of all the King’s subjects to appeal for redress to the Sovereign in Council’ if they
believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
Appeals come to it either where a right of appeal in limited categories of cases
has been specially created, e.g., by Statute, Order in Council or Letters Patent, or
by special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice of the Judicial Committee.
Appeals are heard by a board of three or five drawn from the committee, depending
on the significance of the case, the quorum being three. Invitations to sit on the
board are issued by the Lord Chancellor, who thus determines which members of
the committee shall hear particular appeals. In practice, boards are generally
selected from the Law Lords of the United Kingdom—the Lord Chancellor,
ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary—although Lords Justices of
Appeal and other members of the Privy Council who have held high judicial office
are also asked to sit when business is heavy. Chief Justices and certain judges from
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 39
other Commonwealth countries have usually been sworn of the Privy Council and
may be invited to sit on the committee’s boards.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.1
Composition
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The usual minis¬
terial offices may be classified under the following heads:
1. The Prime Minister (see also p. 40), who is the recognized head of the
Government but has no Department.
2. Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present seven Secretaries of State—for the Home Department,
Foreign Affairs, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, Colonies, War, and
Air. Most of the more recently created posts have the formal title of
‘Minister’. There are Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food;
Defence; Education; Health; Housing and Local Government; Labour
and National Service; Pensions and National Insurance; Power; Supply;
Transport and Civil Aviation; and Works. A few of the older posts have
special titles: the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the
Treasury and for a number of other financial and central Departments);
the President of the Board of Trade; the First Lord of the Admiralty; and
the Postmaster-General.
3. Non-Departmental Ministers, or Ministers who are the holders of various
traditional offices, but who have few or no departmental duties and are thus
available to perform any special functions entrusted to them by the Prime
Minister, e.g., the Lord President of the Council,2 the Lord Privy Seal, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who manages and controls the
Duchy,3 the Paymaster General, and, at present, a Minister Without
Portfolio.
4. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor has a
Department, but is in a somewhat special position as a Minister of the
Crown who is also head of the Judiciary in England and Wales. The four
Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the Attorney-
General and the Solicitor-General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and
the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
5. Ministers of State, who are deputy Ministers in Departments where the
work is particularly heavy or involves frequent travelling overseas. There
are at present five Ministers of State: two in the Foreign Office, one in the
Colonial Office, one at the Board of Trade, and the Secretary of State for
Scotland is assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State.
1 See pp. 30-32, The Party System.
2 The Lord President of the Council, who controls the Privy Council Office, is respon¬
sible to Parliament for the work of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,
the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council and the Nature Con¬
servancy, and has a general oversight of scientific matters.

it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and separately administered.
D
4o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
6. Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary
or, where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to
relieve their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in
parliamentary debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by
assisting in their departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury and the Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category
as Government Whips (see pp. 31-32).
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown (see p. 30) and all senior ministers
are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, since the
approval of that House is necessary for the general policy (and frequently for the
specific proposals) of the Government. There must, however, always be some
ministers in the House of Lords, partly because the Ministers of the Crown Act,
1937, limits the number of ministers who may sit in the Commons while receiving
salaries from the Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of
spokesmen of standing to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the
Lords.
The Prime Minister
The office of Prime Minister as head of the Government has been in existence
since the middle of the eighteenth century. The office is a conventional one in that
it is not defined by statute or rule of common law, and the Prime Minister’s official
title is First Lord of the Treasury. In 1905, however, the Prime Minister was given
precedence, after the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Lord Chancellor,
as the fourth person in the realm after the Royal Family. The unique position of
authority enjoyed by the Prime Minister derives on the one hand from his status
as leader of the majority party in Parliament and on the other from his power to
submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to obtain their resignation
or dismissal individually.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Crown of the general business
of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; to exercise a general supervision
over Departments, settling departmental differences where possible and approving
important departmental decisions where Cabinet reference is not required; to be
prepared to speak in Parliament both on general subjects and on the most impor¬
tant Government Bills; and to answer to Parliament for all actions of the Govern¬
ment, both at home and abroad. Only the Prime Minister can recommend to the
Sovereign a dissolution of Parliament if he wishes to put the Government’s policy
to the country before the normal time for a General Election has come. The Prime
Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of Church of England archbishops, bishops, some senior dignitaries, and
incumbents of Crown livings, as well as that of the Lord Chief Justice and of the
holders of other high judicial offices, Lords Lieutenant of Counties,1 Trustees of
National Museums and Regius Professors in certain universities. He also makes
recommendations for the awards of most civil honours and distinctions.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is a conventional organ of government composed of a number of
ministers selected by the Prime Minister. Membership is not fixed, although the
1 See footnote, p. 77.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
41
holders of certain important ministerial offices are always included; the number of
members is now usually fewer than 20.
The system of Cabinet government came into being as one of the results of the
passing of the Bill of Rights in 1689. In origin it was an informal gathering of those
Privy Counsellors who were also ministers, meeting at first with, and later without,
the Sovereign. The Cabinet assumed its present shape when the accession of the
Hanoverian kings with their limited knowledge of the English language, the British
constitution and the British way of life had severely curtailed the personal participa¬
tion of the Sovereign in executive government and made it essential that a substitute
should be found.
The Cabinet is not in itself an executant in that it has no legal authority, its
decisions being valid by convention and not by law. It is designed to formulate
general policy, to bring about co-operation between the different forces of the State
without interfering with their legal independence, and to exercise general control.
Its functions, as defined in the Report of the Machinery of Government Committee
(Haldane Committee) Cd. 9230, 1918, are:
(1) the final determination of the policy to be submitted to Parliament;
(2) the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with the policy
agreed by Parliament; and
(3) the continuous co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of the
several Departments of State.
In the performance of its functions the Cabinet makes considerable use of a
system of committees. The beginnings of this system can be traced back to the
nineteenth century and it has been developed to keep pace with government busi¬
ness during the past fifty years. The system involves the reference of any issue
either to one of the standing Cabinet committees or to an ad hoc committee com¬
posed of the ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail
and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations
for action.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its
members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose any informa¬
tion. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of Cabinet as well as of other
State papers, and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement involving dis¬
closure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign
through the Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet
decision is advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before it is made
public. From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential in the interests of unpre¬
judiced debate, which can take place only if there is no risk of publicity for every
statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times, the Cabinet meets for about two hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not
sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time if a
matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet meetings, deci¬
sions are reached on major issues of Government policy, and the Cabinet settles
any matters which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend Cabinet meetings when matters
affecting their Departments are under discussion; they may also be members of
Cabinet committees.
42
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance of
documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and the conclu¬
sions, are recorded; and even these records have a strictly limited circulation.
Responsibility for the keeping of records lies with the Secretariat of the Cabinet,
known as the Cabinet Office (see p. 43).
Ministerial Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which ministers
share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual responsibility
of ministers to Parliament for the work of their Departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the middle
of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to act not as
individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a united group. It
does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at every Cabinet meeting;
and the obligations of individual ministers may be passive rather than active when
the decision to be taken does not relate to their spheres of administrative responsi¬
bility. At the same time, every minister should be fully informed of the subject of
discussion beforehand, so that if he has any objections he may voice them at the
meeting. He may not repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies
which have received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies which have not
been agreed with other Departments (including the Treasury) which may be con¬
cerned. He must be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues, and
where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy. Any minister who feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of his
colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere must resign. If he does not resign, he is held
to be responsible, and cannot afterwards reject criticism on the ground that he did
not personally agree with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is bound to
offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his Department means
that, as political head of that Department, he is answerable for all its acts and
omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any
injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticized in Parlia¬
ment, whether he is personally responsible or not.
Since the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented in the Commons by
political subordinates qualified to speak on their behalf, i.e. by their Parliamentary
Secretaries and Under-Secretaries. Responsibility, however, cannot be delegated
and remains with the senior minister concerned.
Ministers are expected to take all decisions relating to their spheres of administra¬
tion, unless these are of such political importance that in their opinion Cabinet
sanction is required.
If any departmental decision brings a minister under fire of criticism in Parlia¬
ment he may be upheld by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of
confidence in itself; or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose
office.
Ministerial responsibility is an effective way of bringing government under public
control, for the knowledge that any departmental action may be reported to and
examined in Parliament discourages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered
decisions.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
43
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government Departments are the organs of Government used to give effect to
Government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They
may and frequently do work with and through local authorities (see p. 66), public
corporations (see pp. 135-6 and 144-5), and many Government-sponsored organiza¬
tions which, while not forming part of Government Departments, are under varying
degrees of Government control.
A change of Government does not generally affect the number or functions of
Government Departments, although a radical change in policy may be accom¬
panied by a corresponding change in the Departments concerned. The widening
scope of Government activity has, however, led to the formation of a substantial
number of new Departments in the past half-century. A few have existed for over
200 years.
The work of some Departments, e.g., the Post Office and the Customs and Excise
Department, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other Departments cover
Great Britain (England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland), e.g.,
the Ministry of Labour and National Service; others cover England and Wales
only, e.g., the Ministry of Health, and there are similar but separate Departments
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some Departments, e.g., the Ministry of
Education, make special arrangements for Welsh affairs.
Departments differ in size and in the number, type and complexity of their
functions, and some have regional and local offices. Most Departments have a
minister of their own in control; a very few have no minister responsible to Parlia¬
ment, e.g., the Exchequer and Audit Department under the Comptroller and
Auditor General, who is an officer of Parliament and not of the Government; and
some are in charge of ministers who have other duties. For instance, Treasury
ministers are responsible for the administration of a number of Departments,
including H.M. Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information, the Treasury
Solicitor’s Department, the Departments of the Government Actuary and of the
Government Chemist, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works
Loan Board, the National Savings Committee and certain museums and art
galleries.
This section provides an outline of the principal functions of the main Govern¬
ment Departments. Since much of their work is interconnected, they are not
grouped according to the subjects with which they deal, but are arranged in
alphabetical order, except for the Cabinet Office and the Treasury (which, in view
of their central position, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland
Departments, which are grouped at the end of the section. Further information on
the work undertaken by the various Departments is given in later sections of this
handbook under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, or Secretariat of the Cabinet, was introduced as an emer¬
gency institution during the first world war and has grown into an organ of great
importance in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level. The Secretariat is
responsible for the keeping of Cabinet records, for providing information and
advice to ministers, and for issuing directives or promulgating decisions of the
Cabinet or the Prime Minister to the Departments concerned. It has a military side
and a civil side. There is also a Central Statistical Office which is charged with the
collection, analysis and presentation of statistics relating to the national economy.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
44
The Treasury
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First
Lord of the Treasury (who is now invariably the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a Board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by two junior ministers, the Financial Secretary and the
Economic Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury who
is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons (see pp. 31—32).
The functions of the Treasury fall under four main headings: finance, control of
expenditure, general Civil Service establishment matters, and co-ordination of
economic policy. Finance may be further sub-divided into home finance and
overseas finance. Home finance includes taxation policy (though executive responsi¬
bility for the collection of revenue lies with the Board of Inland Revenue and the
Department of Customs and Excise), the provision of funds for the day-to-day
needs of the public services, currency and banking, and the management of the
national debt. Overseas financial questions have formed a greatly increased part of
the Treasury’s work since the second world war because of the post-war emphasis
on the problem of the balance of payments.
Control of expenditure is a matter partly for Parliament, partly for the Treasury,
and partly for the Departments themselves. Treasury control arises very largely out
of Parliamentary control and the scrutiny of detailed annual estimates for the great
majority of Government expenditure. The Treasury’s responsibility in general Civil
Service questions has developed gradually out of the control of expenditure.
Since the end of the second world war, the Treasury has acquired a new function
of co-ordination in economic affairs. This has come about for two reasons: the
acceptance by successive Governments since the war of responsibility for maintain¬
ing full employment, and the need to safeguard the balance of payments by ensuring
that economic resources are directed to essential ends.
Attached to the Treasury is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in which
Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
The Admiralty
The Board of Admiralty has been in existence since 1708. It is served by
the Admiralty Divisions of the Naval Staff and the Admiralty Departments. The
Divisions of the Naval Staff deal with operational and technical policy. The
Departments deal with the manning of the ships and establishments; the provision
of warships and other vessels, aircraft, weapons and munitions, stores, fuel and
other goods, equipment and reserve forces; the general organization and administra¬
tion of the Fleets and establishments; and the accounting and administration of the
moneys voted by Parliament for these purposes.
The Admiralty is responsible for the Government’s economic policy in the ship¬
building and ship repair industries and certain minor allied industries. It also under¬
takes research, principally to meet naval requirements; much of this research has
additional civil applications. It administers the Royal Observatory and the National
Institute of Oceanography.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was established by Order in
Council in April 1955 and assumed the responsibilities previously discharged by
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food.
The Ministry has a general responsibility for food supplies, both home pro¬
duced and imported, for food manufacture and food distribution.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
45
Its economic appraisements range from the annual review of farm prices to
assessments of food and agricultural imports in relation to the country’s balance
of payments.
The Department is responsible generally for the efficiency of the agricultural,
horticultural and fishing industries in England and Wales, and for the operational
control of epidemic diseases of animals, and of plant diseases and pests throughout
Great Britain. This involves supervision over County Agricultural Executive Com¬
mittees, which act locally as the Minister’s agents; the administration of schemes to
improve the quality of livestock, to control or eradicate animal diseases, to control
pests, and to facilitate production on marginal land; the provision of technical
advice on all aspects of food production; responsibility for agricultural education,
for research as applied to agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, and for such ques¬
tions as land drainage, the enforcement of agricultural wages awards and labour
supply. With other Government Departments, the Ministry is concerned with the
improvements of such rural services as housing, farm buildings, water supplies and
electricity, and with the supply of machinery, fertilizers and seeds.
The Department administers in England and Wales the guarantees to farmers
under the Agriculture Act, 1947; and in this connection it operates deficiency
payments schemes for fatstock and for the main cereal crops. It is also generally
responsible for schemes for milk, eggs, potatoes and wool operated through pro¬
ducers’ marketing boards.
The Ministry has primary responsibility for administering part of the food and
drugs legislation, in particular that part dealing with the composition of food and
with labelling and advertising. It is responsible for matters concerning slaughter¬
houses and for the inspection of meat, and for enforcing legislation relating to the
quality and cleanliness of milk.
The Ministry maintains relations with Commonwealth and other overseas
countries interested in the United Kingdom as a market for their food exports, and
is responsible for schemes such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement which is
operated through the Sugar Board. It contributes to the work of a number of inter¬
national bodies including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations, the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, and, for food
defence planning purposes, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The Ministry is also responsible for the Ordnance Survey and for Kew Gardens.
The Air Ministry
The Air Council was established in 1918 under the presidency of the Secretary
of State for Air to provide for the growing importance of aircraft in warfare by
taking over responsibility for the administrative control of the Royal Air Force.
The functions of the Air Ministry include strategic planning; the manning of the
Royal Air Force and its reserves and auxiliaries; the organization of flying, technical
and general training; the acquisition of lands required for air force purposes; and
the supervision of the finance and contracts of the Royal Air Force.
The Meteorological Office operates the State weather service. It has existed since
1855, at first under the Board of Trade, then as a self-contained unit, and since
1920 as a part of the Air Ministry. The Office provides meteorological services for
the general public, Government Departments, the Armed Forces and civil aviation.
It organizes meteorological observations in the United Kingdom and at certain
stations overseas and undertakes the collection, publication and distribution of
meteorological information from all parts of the world. Research is undertaken at
Dunstable (Bedfordshire), Harrow (Middlesex) and London, and at observatories
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
46
at Kew (Surrey), Eskdalemuir (Dumfriesshire) and Lerwick (in the Shetland
Islands).
The Colonial Office
The Colonial Office is the Department of the United Kingdom Government
which deals with the affairs of the great majority of the non-self-governing countries
of the Commonwealth. At the head of the Colonial Office is the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, who is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the general
administration of those territories. The main functions of the Colonial Office
are to convey to Colonial Governments the views and wishes of Her Majesty’s
Government on broad matters of policy; to see that the interests of Colonial
Governments and peoples are safeguarded and promoted; to provide, through
its staff of professional advisers and with the help of Advisory Committees com¬
posed of men and women eminent in many fields, guidance to Colonial Govern¬
ments on a wide range of matters; and to undertake expert services of many kinds,
including the allocation of moneys for development purposes under the Colonial
Development and Welfare Acts and the provision of administrative and profes¬
sional staff for the Overseas Civil Service. Other functions of the Colonial Office
include the care of Colonial students in the United Kingdom, the British Council
acting as agent in providing for their general welfare.
The Colonial Office does not directly administer the non-self-governing terri¬
tories with which it deals. Each of these has its own administration and an increasing
measure of autonomy.
Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service. Members of this Service are employed in
the public services of Colonial Overseas Territories and are paid by the Govern¬
ment of the territory in which they serve. The Service merges the former adminis¬
trative and professional branches of the Colonial Service. Its members are eligible
for employment in any post which the Secretary of State for the Colonies is
requested or authorized to fill, and may also be considered, as opportunity offers,
for any post in Commonwealth or foreign territories for which the United Kingdom
Government may be invited to recommend candidates. Recruitment into this
Service is undertaken in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries
when suitably qualified local candidates are not available for appointment to the
territorial public service.
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations are appointed
by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to act as commercial and financial agents
in the United Kingdom for the Governments of the territories for which he is
responsible. They also act by special arrangement for other Governments and
bodies.
The Commonwealth Relations Office
The Commonwealth Relations Office is the main channel of communication
between the United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the other
independent nations of the Commonwealth—Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana and the Federation of Malaya.
Through it, consultation and exchange of information takes place with the External
Affairs Departments of those Commonwealth countries, either directly or through
United Kingdom High Commissioners, on all subjects of mutual interest—foreign
affairs, defence co-operation, economic and other matters. Where foreign policy is
concerned, the Office works in close association with the Foreign Office.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
47
The Commonwealth Relations Office is also responsible for the conduct of rela¬
tions with the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (except in regard to terri¬
torial matters concerning Northern Rhodesia, which are dealt with by the Colonial
Office), and for the administration of the High Commission Territories—Basuto¬
land, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland.
The Commonwealth Relations Office was established in 1947, replacing the
Dominions Office (set up in 1925). In the same year the conduct of relations with
India and Pakistan was transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office from
the India Office, which was abolished; in 1948 the Commonwealth Relations Office
assumed responsibility in respect of Ceylon and, in 1957, for Ghana and the
Federation of Malaya.
The Commonwealth Relations Office remains the Department responsible for
the conduct of relations between the United Kingdom Government and the
Government of the Irish Republic, which left the Commonwealth in 1949.
The Customs and Excise Department
Commissioners to collect the Customs and the Excise revenues were first
appointed by the Long Parliament in 1643 (although after the Restoration the
older method of collection through private contractors was revived for a time).
The two branches of the Revenue remained distinct until 1909, when they were
amalgamated under Commissioners of Customs and Excise. The primary work of
the Customs and Excise Department is to collect and administer the duties of
Customs and Excise imposed from time to time in the annual Finance Acts or by
other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters
connected with them. The Department is also responsible for preventing and
detecting evasion of the Revenue laws, including smuggling and illicit distillation.
In addition to its revenue work the Department undertakes a wide range of
non-revenue agency work for other Departments, e.g., the enforcement of prohibi¬
tions and restrictions on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods,
exchange currency control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade
statistics from Customs import and export documents.
The Ministry of Defence
The Ministry of Defence was formally constituted in January 1947 following the
passing of the Ministry of Defence Act, 1946. The Act charges the Minister with
responsibility for ‘the formulation and general application of a unified policy
relating to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their requirements \ He
carries out this responsibility in accordance with general defence policy laid down
by the Cabinet.
In addition to its main function of co-ordinating the policies and requirements of
the three armed Services, the Ministry is responsible for the administration of
the Joint Intelligence Bureau, the Imperial Defence College, the Joint Services
Staff College and Amphibious Warfare Headquarters.
The Ministry of Education
The Ministry of Education was established in 1944 to take over the powers and
duties previously exercised by the Board of Education (1899-1944) in regard to
the promotion of the education of the people of England and Wales and of the
progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose. The Ministry
exercises this function in co-operation with the local education authorities—the
councils of the counties and of the county boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
the provision in their areas of adequate facilities for all forms of education. On
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
48
professional matters, contact with the local education authorities is maintained
through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Schools, organized in regional divisions
throughout England and Wales for its work of inspection, liaison and advice. A
separate Welsh Department of the Ministry deals with education in Wales.
The Ministry is concerned with the development of primary, secondary and
further education, including vocational education and education for leisure and
the social and physical training of young people. It deals with the supply, training
and superannuation of teachers; the building of new schools and other institutions;
the school health service; the special educational treatment of handicapped children;
and the provision of school meals and milk. It is responsible for the award of State
scholarships and other awards for university students; for the administration of the
Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum, London; and for the
maintenance of educational relations with the countries of the Commonwealth,
with foreign countries, and with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
The Imperial Institute. The Institute was founded in 1893. Its work is now
directed by a Board of Governors, some of whom are appointed by the Minister of
Education and others by the Governments of the member nations of the Common¬
wealth. The Institute houses permanent exhibitions of the peoples and products of
the Commonwealth, shows films on Commonwealth subjects, and does much educa¬
tional work in co-operation with the schools. It also arranges lectures and con¬
ferences and has study and recreational accommodation for Commonwealth
students. The Institute is financially dependent on an endowment fund and on
grants from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth Governments.
The Foreign Office
The Foreign Office, which is the headquarters of Her Majesty’s Foreign Service,
first became a separate Department of State in 1782. The Minister in charge of
the Foreign Office, and responsible to Parliament for the conduct of foreign affairs
and for the direction and operation of the Foreign Service, is styled Her Majesty’s
Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The Foreign Office acts as a channel of communication between the Government
of the United Kingdom and the Governments of foreign States, either through
the representatives of foreign States in the United Kingdom or through Her
Majesty’s representatives abroad, for the discussion and negotiation of all matters
falling within the field of international relations, including the drawing up of inter¬
national treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by which the United
Kingdom Government is represented in the United Nations and on other inter¬
national bodies and is kept informed of developments in foreign countries; by
which British subjects and interests abroad are protected and trade promoted; and
by which British policy is explained to the Governments and peoples of foreign
countries. The questions dealt with by the Foreign Office are primarily of a political
nature, but they also include many other matters such as questions of nationality,
the issue and renewal of passports, and the immunities and privileges of foreign
diplomatic representatives.
Her Majesty’s Foreign Service. The Foreign Office is staffed by members of the
Foreign Service, which is a separate and self-contained Service of the Crown formed
in 1943 as a result of the amalgamation of the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic
Service with the Consular and Commercial-Diplomatic Services. It provides an
interchangeable staff for service both at home and at United Kingdom diplomatic
missions and consular posts abroad.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
49
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Acts, 1919-47,
to promote the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation, and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain; the Forestry Act, 1951, places
responsibility on the Forestry Commissioners for the maintenance of reserves of
growing trees, through a system of licensing of felling.
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are responsible for forest policy in Great Britain.
The General Register Office
The General Register Office is responsible under the Registrar General for the
regulation of civil marriages and for the administration of civil registration in
England and Wales, for the preparation of statistics and reports relating to popula¬
tion, fertility, births, marriages, diseases and deaths, and for making arrangements
for the periodic census of the population.
The Ministry of Health
The Ministry of Health, created in 1919 to take over the powers and duties
previously attaching to the Local Government Board (established in 1871) and the
National Health Insurance Commission (formed in 1912), assumed in 1920 the
responsibilities in connection with mental illness formerly attached to the Home
Office.
Twice since 1944 there has been a transfer of some of the Ministry’s main
responsibilities to newly created Departments—in 1945 those in respect of national
health insurance and contributory pensions to the Ministry of National Insurance
(now the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance), and in 1951 those in respect
of housing, water and sewerage services, and the supervision of local government to
the Ministry of Local Government and Planning (now the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government).
On the other hand, in 1953, when the Ministry of Pensions ceased to exist, the
Ministry of Health became responsible for the medical and surgical treatment of
war pensioners, including war pensioners in the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man and those residing in the Republic of Ireland, and, in 1955, the Ministry
assumed responsibilities regarding food hygiene and welfare foods which had
previously been carried out by the Ministry of Food.
The main function of the Ministry of Health is the administration of the National
Health Service in England and Wales under the National Health Service Acts. The
Ministry is also responsible in England and Wales for supervising the work of local
authorities under certain Sections of the Public Health Acts and their services for
the care of the aged, infirm, blind, deaf and dumb and other handicapped persons
under the National Assistance Act, 1948.
The Home Office
The Home Office was created in 1782. Its head is the Secretary of State for the
Home Department (the Home Secretary), who is the principal Secretary of State
and is entrusted with all the responsibilities of national administration which have
not been especially assigned by law or convention to the remaining Secretaries of
State or Ministers. The Home Secretary is also the channel of communication
between the Sovereign and his or her subjects, and between the United Kingdom
Government and the Governments of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
5°
The chief matters with which the Home Office deals are: the maintenance of law
and order; the efficiency of the police service; the treatment of offenders, including
juvenile offenders; the efficacy of the probation service; the organization of
magistrates’ courts; legislation on criminal justice; the efficiency of the fire service;
the care of children by local authorities and voluntary organizations; the regulation
of the employment of children and young persons; the control and naturalization
of aliens; the law relating to parliamentary and local government elections; public
safety and public well-being; and preparations for civil defence.
Particular matters for which the Home Office is responsible, both in connection
with its general functions and otherwise, include: receiving and submitting
Addresses and Petitions to the Sovereign and preparing Presentations to Parlia¬
ment; preparing patents of nobility for peers and formal proceedings for the
bestowal of honours; advising the Crown on the exercise of the Prerogative of
Mercy; sanctioning byelaws made by local authorities in so far as they relate to
‘ law and order ’ and ‘ good governance ’; granting licences to experiment with
animals; ordering the exhumation and removal of bodies; supervising the control
of explosives, firearms and dangerous drugs; and administering the State Manage¬
ment Scheme for control of the liquor trade in the Carlisle district.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government was constituted in January
1951, under the title of Ministry of Local Government and Planning, to take over
the housing and local government functions of the Ministry of Health and the
planning functions of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning (1943-1951). It
was renamed the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in November 1951.
It is the Department generally responsible for local government, and, in this capa¬
city, it is responsible for sanctioning loans for most purposes for which local
authorities require to borrow money, and for acting as the main link between local
authorities and the central Government.
The Ministry exercises powers in regard to housing, water, sewerage and other
services administered by local authorities in England and Wales. In regard to these
services, the position, broadly, is that the Minister is responsible to Parliament
(1) for securing, so far as intervention by the central Government is necessary, the
performance of duties laid upon local authorities by Parliament, whether this
obligation is to be discharged by the aid of grants from national funds or not;
(2) for encouraging the exercise of powers given to local authorities in regard to
such services whether by grants paid out of national funds or otherwise; and
(3) for inquiring into difficulties and complaints concerning any local authority
services which may be brought to the Minister’s notice.
As the central Housing Authority under the Housing Act, 1936, the Minister
supervises the administration of the housing statutes and the national housing pro¬
gramme ; and his officers keep in close touch with the local authorities in England
and Wales. Local authority proposals for dealing with areas of unfit houses (slum
clearance) are also submitted to the Minister.
The town and country planning work of the Ministry includes the framing and
execution of the national policy on the use and development of land for the purpose
of achieving the best use of land in the public interest. The responsibilities of the
Minister include confirmation of the acquisition and disposal of land by local
authorities; and the payment of grants, for planning purposes, in certain cases of
acquisition, clearing and compensation. The Minister also has responsibilities in
connection with the establishment and work of the Development Corporations of
the New Towns, and with the National Parks Commission.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 51
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is also the Minister for Welsh
Affairs.
The Central Office of Information
The Central Office of Information was established in 1946 as the successor to the
war-time Ministry of Information. It is a common service agency for the produc¬
tion of information and publicity material and the supply of general publicity
services required by Government Departments. It produces and distributes books,
pamphlets, magazines, films (including films for television), exhibitions, photo¬
graphs and other visual material for the home and overseas ministerial Depart¬
ments. It conducts all official press and poster advertising except that of the
National Savings Committee, carries out social surveys, and distributes depart¬
mental news to the Press, the BBC and the television companies. For the overseas
Departments, it supplies British information posts with a daily service of topical
information, comment and official news and with a comprehensive reference
service, and arranges tours for official visitors from overseas to enable them to see
various aspects of life in Britain. Administratively, the Central Office is responsible
to Treasury Ministers, while the Ministers whose Departments it serves are
responsible for the policy expressed in its work.
The Board of Inland Revenue
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax and
surtax, profits tax, stamp duty, estate duty, and certain other direct taxes of lesser
importance; and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected
with them. The Board is also responsible for the valuation of real property for
various purposes such as compensation for compulsory purchase, local rates in
England and Wales, and estate duty.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service
The Ministry of Labour was created in 1916 and took over certain duties of the
Board of Trade. In 1939, when the Ministry became responsible for manpower,
both for the armed forces and for industry, its name was changed to the Ministry
of Labour and National Service. One of its principal functions is the administra¬
tion of the Employment and Training Act, 1948, and provision of facilities and
services for the purposes of assisting persons to select, fit themselves for, obtain
and retain employment suitable to their age and capacity, of assisting employers to
obtain suitable employees, and generally for the purpose of promoting employment
in accordance with the requirements of the community. Its services include the
operation of (1) a national system of Employment Exchanges, (2) a Technical and
Scientific Register, (3) Nursing Appointments Offices and (4) Government schemes
for vocational training.
The Ministry also has responsibility for manpower policy and co-operates with
other Government Departments on matters of general employment policy, includ¬
ing the distribution of industry and the maintenance of a high and stable level of
employment. Among its functions in this connection are the registration, medical
examination and calling-up of men for National Service and the resettlement in
civil employment of men released from National Service or the Regular Forces.
In the field of employment and training, the Ministry is concerned with the
central administration of a comprehensive Youth Employment Service provided
locally either by the local education authority or by the Ministry’s local office, and
the provision of a Disablement Resettlement Service with, where necessary, indus¬
trial rehabilitation and vocational training, to enable disabled persons to secure
employment.
52
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Ministry provides an important service in dealing with questions concerning
the safety, health and welfare of industrial workers in factories and certain other
premises. The provisions of the Factories Acts and associated legislation are
enforced by H.M. Inspectors of Factories. Related to this service is the adminis¬
tration of the Anthrax Prevention Act and of the Government Wool Disinfecting
Station at Liverpool. Another service is the collection and publication of statistics
and information on manpower, employment and unemployment, wage rates,
earnings, hours of labour, retail prices, industrial disputes, employers’ and em¬
ployees’ organizations and industrial accidents and diseases.
The Ministry assists in the promotion of good industrial relations, having
statutory powers which reinforce and supplement the voluntary arrangements
within industry, and it actively encourages the development of good personnel
management and of joint consultation in industry.
Responsibility for the relations of H.M. Government with the International
Labour Organization rests with the Ministry, which is also concerned with labour
policy in the international field, with overseas questions concerning employment and
with the employment of foreign workers in Great Britain.
Besides these principal functions, the Ministry undertakes agency work for other
Government Departments in connection with National Insurance, National
Assistance, repayment of income tax to unemployed persons, and the receipt of
applications for passports.
The Law Officers’ Department
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales1 (the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General) are the legal advisers to the Crown and to all Govern¬
ment Departments and appear in Court on their behalf in cases of importance.
In such cases the Law Officers are assisted by Junior Counsel to the Treasury.
The appointments, which are made from among the more distinguished members
of the English Bar, are generally, though not invariably, political, and the office
holders change with the Government.
The Attorney-General has a number of important functions in regard to the
administration of justice and he has wide powers in connection with the enforce¬
ment of the criminal law. The Director of Public Prosecutions acts under his
superintendence and is subject to his directions. Thd Attorney-General is the
senior Law Officer but the Solicitor-General, as his deputy, acts for him in all cases
where he is authorized or required to do so.
The Lord Chancellor’s Department
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office always carrying
Cabinet rank in peace time. The office is political in that it is held by an eminent
ex-member of the Bench or of the Bar, who is a member of the political party in
power.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian of
the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor is in charge of more than 20 different offices
and branches which are mainly concerned with legal practice and procedure. He
controls the machinery of the courts of law both through his patronage and through
administrative powrers conferred by the Judicature Act, I925, and other Acts; he
advises the Crown on many appointments to the judiciary in England and Wales;
and he is the Minister responsible for the Judge Advocate General’s Department.
This Department advises the War Office and the Air Ministry on all legal matters
arising out of the administration of military law, and, where necessary, reviews the

proceedings of army and air force courts martial.1 The Lord Chancellor is also a
member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, exercises ecclesiastical
patronage and is connected with a number of administrative tribunals, including
the Pensions Appeal Tribunals and also the Lands Tribunal which determines
questions relating to compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land and
hears rating appeals from local valuation courts. The Land Registry, which is
responsible for maintaining a State register of title to land,2 and the Public Trustee
Office, which may act as the executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased
person or as a trustee under a will or settlement, are both administered under the
Lord Chancellor.
The National Assistance Board
The National Assistance Board, responsible to Parliament through the Minister
of Pensions and National Insurance, administers the State service of financial
assistance to persons in need and unable to maintain themselves, and the non¬
contributory pension scheme under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936. The Board
is also responsible for assessing the means of persons applying for legal aid.
The Paymaster-General’s Department
The Paymaster-General’s Department acts as chief paying agent for Government
Departments other than the Revenue Departments. The majority of payments are
made through banks (to whose accounts the necessary transfers are made at the
Bank of England), but cash payments can be made and the payment of pensions,
mainly comprising those to retired teachers, officers of the Civil Service and the
National Health Service and members of the Armed Forces, and in certain cases
to their widows, is an important feature of the work of the Department.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance
In 1953 the Ministry of Pensions (established in 1917) and the Ministry of
National Insurance (established in 1944) were amalgamated.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance is responsible (1) for the social
security services established since the second world war by the Family Allowances
Acts, the National Insurance Acts and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)
Acts, and for reciprocal social security arrangements with other countries, and
(2) for the award and payment of war pensions and allowances for disablement and
death due to service in the armed forces of the Crown or in the Home Guard (now
disbanded), or due to war injuries sustained by naval auxiliaries, merchant seamen,
civil defence personnel and civilians in the second world war, and for the welfare of
pensioners and their dependants and war orphans. In addition to these responsi¬
bilities for war pensioners in the United Kingdom and in the Irish Republic, the
Ministry is responsible for the administration of war pensions and for the medical
treatment of war disablement of United Kingdom pensioners living in Northern
Ireland and, through its various agencies, in other countries overseas. The Ministry
maintains an office in Ottawa to serve pensioners in North America.
The Post Office
The Post Office wras set up in the seventeenth century to take over the responsi¬
bility for carrying letters, which was previously attached to the Crown. The

Minister at its head is the Postmaster-General. Its work is mainly concerned with
the operation of the inland postal, telegraph and telephone services and, in co¬
operation with other countries and interests, of the overseas postal and telecom¬
munications services. It also undertakes certain banking functions, including the
operation of the Post Office Savings Bank, the sale of premium bonds and the issue
of money orders, and it acts as an agent for many other Government Departments
in the collection of revenue (e.g., by the sale of broadcast receiving and other
licences and by the sale of stamps for National Insurance contributions) and the
payments of grants and allowances, such as National Insurance payments, retire¬
ment and certain other pensions and family allowances.
The Postmaster-General is the minister responsible to Parliament for broad
questions of national policy concerning sound and television broadcasting services.
The Engineering Department of the Post Office carries out a considerable
volume of scientific research and technical development relating to telephone,
telegraph and radio systems.
The Ministry of Power
The Ministry of Power was established in 1942 (as the Ministry of Fuel and
Power) when it absorbed the former Mines and Petroleum Departments of the
Board of Trade and the Board’s functions in relation to gas and electricity. It was
made permanent by the Ministry of Fuel and Power Act, i945> the title being
changed to Ministry of Power by Order in Council in January 1957*
Since 1942, the Ministry has had the general duty of ensuring the effective and
co-ordinated development of fuel and power supplies in Great Britain, and of
promoting economy and efficiency in their distribution and consumption. The
business of producing and distributing gas and electricity and of producing coal is
operated by the boards of the three nationalized industries, whose members are
responsible to the Minister on policy issues. The distribution of coal and coke is
carried out, under Ministry control, largely by private concerns. The Ministry is
also responsible for Government relations with the petroleum industry. In January
1957, the Ministry assumed the functions in relation to iron and steel previously
exercised by the Board of Trade and, at the same time, was made specifically
responsible for extending the use of atomic energy as a source of industrial power.
The Acts and Regulations governing the safety and health of workers in and
about coal mines, metalliferous mines and quarries are administered by the Safety
and Health Division of the Ministry, which includes the Inspectorate of Mines.
The Ministry is responsible for the general co-ordination of fuel research, and the
Chief Scientist’s Division itself conducts or arranges for scientific research on
specific projects and on matters affecting safety and health in mines and quarries.
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was set up as a Depart¬
ment of the Privy Council in 1916. It accounts for its own Vote in the Estimates and
is responsible to Parliament through the Lord President of the Council.
The work of the Department covers research (except defence research) in all
branches of natural science except medicine and atomic energy, and in all industries
except agriculture, fishery and forestry. Its primary functions are to undertake
research in the national interest for the benefit of the community and to meet the
requirements of other Departments; to encourage research and the application of
scientific knowledge in industry; and to encourage fundamental research at uni¬
versities and elsewhere, and the maintenance of an adequate supply of trained
research workers for laboratories of all kinds.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
55
The Stationery Office
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office was established in 1786. It is the Government’s
central organization for the supply of desk stationery, office equipment, office
machinery, printed matter, published books and periodicals for British Govern¬
ment Departments at home and abroad. It is responsible for the publishing and
sale of all Government publications. The Stationery Office also undertakes dupli¬
cating, addressing and distributing services for other Departments. The ministerial
head of the Stationery Office is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and questions
pertaining to the Department asked in the House of Commons are normally
answered by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.
The Ministry of Supply
The present Ministry of Supply was formed in 1946 by the amalgamation of the
war-time Ministries of Supply and of Aircraft Production.
The primary functions of the Ministry are to furnish supplies, which include
complete atomic weapons, to the armed forces; to undertake research on, and the
design and development of, equipment for these forces, principally for the Army
and Royal Air Force, but including aircraft, vehicles, some guns and ammunition
and other equipment for the Royal Navy. Other functions of the Ministry are to
carry out the primary Government responsibility in the field of electronics and in
the light metals industry, and to undertake research on, and development and pro¬
duction of, certain classes of equipment for civil use, e.g., civil aircraft and industrial
gas turbines.
The Ministry controls the Royal Ordnance factories and those experimental,
storage and other establishments which are owned by the Department; it is
responsible for the administration of such matters as labour supply, labour manage¬
ment, welfare, housing and transport in connection with these organizations.
The Board of Trade
The Board of Trade was formally constituted as a Committee of the Privy
Council by an Order in Council of 1786, which still provides the constitutional
basis for the Board. Since 1867, the President has been the only effective member
of this Committee and his authority is, in practice, similar to that of a Secretary
of State or other Minister of Cabinet rank; he is now assisted by a Minister of
State, who is specially concerned with overseas trade, and by a Parliamentary
Secretary.
The Board has a general responsibility in respect of the United Kingdom’s com¬
merce, industry and overseas trade, including commercial relations with other
countries, import and export trade, the protective tariff, industrial development
and consumer protection. It is also responsible for (1) the promotion of exports,
(2) statistics of trade and industry (both at home and abroad) including the Cen¬
suses of Production and Distribution, and (3) the administration of certain regu¬
lative legislation in relation to, for example, patents, registered designs, copyright,
trade marks, weights and measures, merchandise marks, companies, bankruptcy,
insurance, distribution of industry, films, and enemy property.
In addition, the Board exercises central responsibility for all industries which
are not specifically allocated to be the concern of other Departments. In this
respect it provides on the one hand, both a channel of communications with, and
and a point of contact for, the industries with which it is specifically concerned,
and on the other hand a focal point at which knowledge about those industries and
their problems is accumulated, analysed, and used as a basis for advising Ministers
and other Departments. The main industries which fall outside the scope of the
E
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Board’s specific concern are food, agriculture and fisheries, building and quarry¬
ing, iron and steel, shipbuilding, fuel and power and transport.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
In 1953 the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Civil Aviation were
amalgamated. This amalgamation was foreshadowed in November 1951, from
which time the two offices of Minister of Transport and Minister of Civil Aviation
were held by the same Minister. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has
two joint Parliamentary Secretaries.
The Ministry of Transport, established in 1919 ‘for the purpose of improving
the means of, and the facilities for, locomotion and transport’, assumed also, in
1941, the responsibility for merchant shipping formerly exercised by the Mercantile
Marine Department of the Board of Trade.
The Ministry of Civil Aviation was established in 1945 to organize, carry out
and encourage measures for the development of civil aviation, for the promotion
of air safety and efficiency, and for research on air navigation.
The powers and duties of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation relate to
the following aspects of inland transport and merchant shipping: railways; inland
waterways; roads, bridges and ferries, and the vehicles they carry; harbours,
docks, piers and river conservancy; national and international shipping policy;
ships, their masters, officers and men; safety of life at sea; navigation (including
pilotage, lighthouses, and other aids to safety in navigation); wreck and salvage;
and the Coastguard Service. The Ministry is the highway authority for trunk roads
and is responsible for providing and operating troopships.
In civil aviation matters, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation may give
general directions to the publicly owned airline corporations on matters affecting
the national interest. He also approves associate arrangements between airline
corporations and independent air transport companies for the operation of
scheduled services.
General civil aviation responsibilities include: the regulation of civil flying; air
safety; the provision, administration and equipment of State-controlled aerodromes
and other ground services; the negotiation of international air transport agreements;
the registration of aircraft; and the licensing of aircrew and aircraft maintenance
personnel.
The War Office
The office of Secretary of State for War was established in 1854. In i9°4 the
Army Council was constituted on the model of the Board of Admiralty, with the
Secretary of State as president and a membership of both military and civil
personnel.
The War Office is responsible for the administrative control of the Army, includ¬
ing appointments, promotions, postings and payment. Its functions include the
planning of operations and training; the collection and sifting of military informa¬
tion; the framing of policy on the composition, weapons and equipment of the
Army; the determination of financial and labour policy connected with the Army;
and the supervision of War Office civilian staffs both at home and abroad.
The Ministry of Works
The Ministry of Works, previously known as His Majesty’s Office of Works,
was established under its present title in 1943. Its main functions are: the provi¬
sion of office accommodation for Government Departments (including public build¬
ings overseas), and of many other types of accommodation required by Civil and
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
57
Service Departments; the design, purchase, supply and maintenance of furniture
and equipment for Government Departments and certain other bodies, and their
supplies of fuel, household articles and stores; the administration of the Ancient
Monuments Acts and the maintenance of those ancient monuments and historic
buildings which are in the Ministry’s charge; the making of grants, on the advice
of the Historic Buildings Councils, towards the maintenance of historic buildings
of outstanding interest; the maintenance of Royal Palaces and certain official resi¬
dences; the building, engineering and supplies services for certain State cere¬
monial occasions; the management and maintenance of the Royal Parks and certain
other open spaces.
The Ministry also has responsibilities for the efficiency and welfare of the build¬
ing and civil engineering and building materials industries, including: maintenance
of a list of all building and civil engineering firms and collection of statistical
returns; oversight of the production of building materials and fitments; consulta¬
tion with the industries at national and regional level; encouragement of apprentice¬
ship and training in the building and electrical contracting industries; review of
building research and development work to meet the industry’s requirements, and
to ensure that results of research are made available to the industry.
SCOTLAND
The first Secretary for Scotland was appointed in 1885 in recognition of the fact
that Scotland required a separate system of administration from that of England
and Wales. Forty years later, his powers and duties were transferred to a Secretary
of State, appointed by the Secretaries of State Act, 1926.
The functions of the Secretary of State, who is assisted at ministerial level by a
Minister of State and three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State (there are
also two Scottish Law Officers), are discharged by four main administrative
Departments of equal status, each under a Secretary responsible to the Secretary
of State for the discharge of the duties of the Department. The day-to-day admini¬
stration of the Departments is conducted in Edinburgh, but each Department has
representatives in London for liaison and parliamentary duties. This London office
is generally known as the Scottish Office, a term also used to describe all Scottish
administration responsible to the Secretary of State.
The four main Scottish Departments are the Scottish Home Department, the
Department of Health for Scotland, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland. The Scottish ministers are advised and
assisted (particularly in relation to questions where more than one of the Depart¬
ments is concerned or which fall outside the province of any of them) by the Per¬
manent Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office, who is free from departmental
duties.
The Scottish Home Department
The Scottish Home Department was set up in 1939 to take over the work that
had been undertaken previously by the Secretary of State’s Office, and by the
Fishery Board for Scotland and the Prisons Department for Scotland.
In the field of law and order, the Department is concerned with the police,
probation and remand home services, criminal justice, legal aid and the services
needed by the courts; and it is directly responsible for the administration of prisons
and borstal institutions.
The Department is the central Department in Scotland for the fire service and
civil defence; for the children’s service; for the control of transport facilities, e.g.,
it is responsible for the construction and maintenance of highways, piers and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
58
ferries; for the issue of motor vehicle and driving licences, and for all matters of
road safety other than those relating to the construction of vehicles; and for legisla¬
tion concerning shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed premises. Licensed premises
in districts in which State management of the liquor trade is in operation (State
Management Districts) are directly maintained by the Home Department.
The Department has general duties in connection with the structure and finance
of local authorities, including valuation and rating and the administration of the
Exchequer equalization grants; and it is responsible for the oversight and protec¬
tion of the Scottish inshore, deep-sea and freshwater fisheries. It is also closely con¬
cerned, in co-operation with the Board of Trade and other United Kingdom
Departments, with Scottish economic development, including the provision of
electric power and the rehabilitation of the Highlands generally.
The Department of Health for Scotland
The Department of Health for Scotland is responsible for the general supervision
of the National Health Service in Scotland; for the central administration of the
Housing (Scotland) Acts, for the supervision of the house-building programme and
for the distribution of grants to local authorities for housing purposes, and for the
control, under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts, of the use of land
and the establishment of new towns under the New Towns Act.
The Department is also responsible for supervising the administration of various
environmental services, including services connected with water supplies and
sewerage; for welfare services, e.g., the care of the aged and handicapped persons;
and for the medical and surgical treatment of war pensioners in Scotland (including
hospital services and the supply and repair of artificial limbs, surgical appliances
and invalid chairs).
The Scottish Education Department
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for supervising the admini¬
stration of the Education (Scotland) Acts, for guiding the development of public
education in Scotland in all its forms, for supervising the training of teachers, for
issuing teachers’ certificates and administering the Teachers’ Superannuation
Scheme, for controlling the distribution of Exchequer grants-in-aid of educational
expenditure, for conducting the annual examination for the Scottish Leaving
Certificate, and for exercising general supervision over approved schools and over
the administration of the Royal Scottish Museum.
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland is the successor of the Board of
Agriculture which was established in 1912. Its broad function is to assist, encourage
and improve home food production. It has a general responsibility for all Govern¬
ment measures for the promotion and development of farming in Scotland, and in
most cases the Department itself administers them. They include: guaranteed
prices for the major farm products, fixed in association with the other Agricultural
Departments in the United Kingdom; the provision of grants and subsidies and
other services in connection with food production; the application, through the
eleven agricultural executive committees in Scotland, of measures (1) for the
promotion of efficiency in husbandry and estate management, and (2) for pest
control; the management of the extensive agricultural property owned by the
Secretary of State; the use and improvement of land and the improvement of farm
stock and crops; the economics of the industry; the instructional, advisory and
research services provided by the three agricultural colleges and eight research
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
59
institutes in Scotland; measures to promote animal health; the regulation of agri¬
cultural wages; and the application to the agricultural industry of safety, health
and welfare measures.
Other Departments
In addition to the main Departments, there are a number of other Scottish
Departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such Departments include the Department of the Registrar
General for Scotland (the General Registry Office); the Scottish Record Office; the
Department of the Registers of Scotland; and the Scottish Information Office,
which undertakes information services on behalf of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, the Scottish Departments and, in some degree, for Great Britain Depart¬
ments in Scotland, and acts also as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of
Information. There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and United
Kingdom Departments under the direction of Controllers, who are responsible for
ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and procedure of their Depart¬
ments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and needs.
Legal Departments
The Law Officers for Scotland are the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General.
The Lord Advocate is in administrative control of two Departments: The Lord
Advocate's Department, which is responsible for drafting Scottish legislation,
providing legal advice on Scottish questions for other Departments, and assisting
the Scottish Law Officers in certain of their legal duties; and The Crown Office,
which exercises the powers of the Lord Advocate in relation to criminal proceedings.
NORTHERN IRELAND
There are a number of separate Departments for Northern Ireland, which are
controlled by the Northern Ireland Parliament. Most of these have functions in
Northern Ireland analogous to those performed for England and Wales by the
United Kingdom Departments of the same name—the Northern Ireland Ministries
of Home Affairs, Education and Agriculture; the Northern Ireland Assistance
Board; and the Exchequer and Audit Department for Northern Ireland. Other
Northern Ireland Departments cover activities which in Great Britain are divided
between several Departments. These Northern Ireland Departments include the
Ministries of Finance, Commerce, Health and Local Government, and Labour and
National Insurance.
The Ministry of Finance
In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for administrative work in connection with the
erection and maintenance of public works and buildings; for Government valuation
and survey; for land registry, the registry of deeds, and certain duties in connection
with land purchase; for the work of the Registrar-General; for the control of
Government publications; for the control and administration of charitable dona¬
tions and bequests; for the control of borrowings; for the collection of death duty,
entertainments duty (cinemas) and other transferred excise duties; and for the
administration of the Ulster savings movement.
Attached to the Department is the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsmen, in
which Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
6o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Ministry of Commerce
In addition to its commercial intelligence work, and its work in connection with
industrial production and the development of new, and the expansion of existing,
industries, the Department is responsible for the business of the Government in
relation to electricity and gas undertakings; roads and bridges and inland public
transport; railways; harbours and inland waterways; fisheries; the development of
the tourist traffic; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries; mineral
development; scientific development; weights and measures; the registration of
companies and trade unions; and the administration of the Assurance Companies
Acts and the Industrial Assurance (Northern Ireland) Act, 1924- The Ministry
also performs functions delegated by the Ministry of Power (Whitehall) relating to
the distribution and prices of coal and other solid fuels.
The Ministry of Health and Local Government
The Ministry was established in I944> and assumed functions in connection with
public health, housing and local government services. The Ministry also supervises
the housing and planning activities of local authorities.
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
The Ministry is responsible for the administration of the Factories Acts and other
legislation connected with industrial health and welfare; for the administration of
the Wages Councils Act; for the promotion in industry of joint machinery of
negotiation; for assistance in the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes;
for the administration of local employment offices and training centres and the
machinery for dealing with employment questions of all kinds under the Employ¬
ment and Training Act and Disabled Persons (Employment) Act; for the adminis¬
tration of the National Insurance Act and the National Insurance (Industrial
Injuries) Act, and of the Family Allowances Act; and for carrying out certain
statutory functions in connection with the National Assistance Scheme in conjunc¬
tion with the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose remunera¬
tion is found wholly and directly out of moneys voted by Parliament. The number
of civil servants under this definition amounts to more than a million; for it includes
some 4i8,3oo1 Government industrial employees in such establishments as Royal
Ordnance factories and Admiralty dockyards. The term ‘ Civil Service is, however,
generally used only to cover ‘ non-industrial ’ members of the staffs of the various
Government Departments in the United Kingdom, or working overseas either in
the Foreign Service (see p. 48) or for other Government Departments such as the
Commonwealth Relations Office (see p. 46). At 1st January, 1957, the total number
of non-industrial civil servants employed in all Departments, at home and overseas,
was 637,423^; nearly one-third of this total are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he serves
the Minister in charge of the Department in which he works, by advising in the
formulation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions once they have been
taken. From time to time the Minister may change, but the civil servant remains

being reckoned as equivalent to one whole-time officer.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 6l
to serve his successor. In Britain changes of government do not involve changes in
departmental staff; this continuity makes for administrative stability.
Development of the Modern Civil Service
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, Departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying standards
were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political jobbery was rife.
Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth century included the sub¬
stitution of open competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appoint¬
ments by favour or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, known
as the Civil Service Commission, to organize recruitment to the service. The great
expansion in State planning which has taken place during the last fifty years, and
the consequent expansion in the numbers of civil servants and the scope of their
duties, have led to further reorganization. During the last few decades, recruitment
competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system; co-ordination
between the various Departments has been improved; and the search for increased
efficiency in the conduct of public business has been the task of many Government-
appointed commissions and committees of inquiry. As a result, civil servants,
though they remain employees of their Departments, are today members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and common traditions
and standards of conduct which belong not to individual Departments but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
Departmental Organization
The responsibility for the policy and activities of each Department lies with the
Minister, who is answerable to Parliament for what the civil servants in the
Department say and do.
The internal organization of Departments is a matter for each Department to
decide and it varies according to the volume and nature of the work involved.
There are, however, features common to most Departments: for example, the
Minister of a major Department is likely to have at the head of his officials a
Permanent Secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those
Departments where the Minister is a Secretary of State) who is also Accounting
Officer and must appear periodically before the Public Accounts Committee; one
or more Deputy Secretaries; and a varying number of Under-Secretaries and
Assistant Secretaries. In addition, major Departments usually have a Principal
Finance Officer and a Principal Establishments and Organization Officer. A number
of Establishment Divisions have their own Organization and Methods (or ‘O & M ’)
Branch, the members of which act in an advisory capacity as ‘ efficiency experts
Many Departments also have their own Legal Advisers or Solicitors, and their
own Information Division. The use (wholly or in part) of the standard classes and
grades of civil servants, which are described below, is common to most Departments.
Control of the Service
The measure of uniformity in the Civil Service has largely resulted from the
fact that the Treasury exercises general control. One of the two joint Permanent
Secretaries to the Treasury is the official head of the Home1 Civil Service and the
principal adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service as
a whole, and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the Service (see p. 64).
The Treasury is also responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment of
1 Since 1943 the Foreign Service has been organized as a separate service (see p. 48).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
62
civil servants; it controls total numbers of staff and the creation of higher posts,
maintains a central Organization and Methods Division which serves all Depart¬
ments which do not maintain an Organization and Methods branch of their own,
deals with general questions relating to training after entry into the Civil Service,
and takes the lead on questions concerning the number of Departments and the
distribution of functions.
Glasses and Grades
The engagement and position of all civil servants are covered by regulation,
agreement and traditional practice—every civil servant being assured of a definite
status depending upon the post which he is called upon to fill. There are four main
classes of civil servants, each class containing a series of grades. The classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising Ministers on
policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
existing policy, and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class, which at 1st January, i957>
numbered 2,628, is recruited largely from university graduates.
2. The Executive Class (numbering some 67,900 at 1st January, 1957), which
is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of Government business, includ¬
ing the higher work of supply and accounts, within the framework of estab¬
lished policy. Members of this class must have reached a recognized
educational standard; after entry they may train for specialist work such
as that of auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about 183,700
officers including clerical assistants), which undertakes all the usual clerical
work involved in running departmental business, e.g., the preparation of
accounts and the keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in
accordance with known rules, and the summarizing and annotation of docu¬
ments for the assistance of senior officers.
4. The Typing Class (about 27,700 members), which consists of shorthand
typists, copy typists and learner typists.
Among other classes are: the Professional, Scientific and Technical Classes, which
consist of some 73,400 civil servants with the necessary qualifications (e.g., doctors,
lawyers, engineers and research workers) for carrying out the wide range of
specialized duties which are now discharged by the Government; the Ancillary
Technical Class, which includes machine and duplicator operators, prison officers,
forest workers and others, and numbers some 41,100; the Messengerial Class which,
in addition to messengers, includes paper keepers, office cleaners and similar
workers (in all some 36,70°); and the Minor and Manipulative Class (with some
200,000 members) which consists entirely of post office workers, e.g., postmen,
postal and telegraph officers, telephonists and telegraphists, and their immediate
supervisors.
The Foreign Service (see p. 48), which in 1956 numbered some 3,300 members
exclusive of messengerial grades, has its own nomenclature. Branch A corresponds
roughly to the Administrative Class of the Home Civil Service; Branch B to the
Executive and Clerical Classes; and Branch C to the Typing Class. All members
of these three branches are liable for service both at home in the Foreign Office
and abroad, and may be employed on any type of Foreign Service work—diplo¬
matic, consular, commercial, and ‘information’. Various specialists and advisers
63
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
who are seconded from the Fighting Services and from home Government Depart¬
ments (e.g., those concerned with financial, commercial or labour matters) are
attached to many overseas posts. In addition, at many posts abroad, some of the
staff are locally engaged on a ‘temporary’ basis, i.e. they do not normally qualify
for pensions.
Recruitment of Staff
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants is in the hands of the Civil
Service Commission which, in the selection of entrants, is independent of both
ministerial and parliamentary control; its members are appointed by the Crown
on the advice of the Government. The normal method of entry is by open competi¬
tion, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by the Treasury and con¬
sisting of written examinations or interviews, or both. The main points of entry
into the four main classes of the Home Civil Service are planned to correspond to
definite levels in the British educational system, and it is the Commission’s duty
to study the requirements of the Civil Service in the light of the education provided
by the schools and universities. _ .
In addition to holding examinations and conducting interviews, the Commission
is responsible for issuing a Certificate of Qualification in respect of each successful
candidate, for placing new entrants in Departments for which their qualifications
are appropriate, and for watching the careers of those it has selected in order to
ensure that current methods of recruitment are successful and up to date.
Temporary civil servants, who do not qualify for pensions, but are eligible for
gratuities, are normally recruited by the Department concerned, either directly or
with the help of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. No qualifying
examinations are required for entrance on a temporary basis to general service.
Training after Entry
Each of the larger Government Departments has a Training Officer and a number
of instructors, who organize both general and technical courses where necessary.
Types of courses vary from Department to Department, but nearly all have
systematic instruction of recruits in all classes. There are also ‘refresher courses
for more experienced staff covering technical subjects or broader subjects such as
management and supervision. . ,
Methods of training include discussion groups, instmctional films and educa¬
tional visits to enable civil servants to study the working of appropriate outside
bodies. In addition, officers in the early years of their service may be transferred
from Branch to Branch and, more rarely, from Department to Department, in order
that they may gain as wide an experience as possible of civil service activities.
Special leave schemes enable a few senior officers, each year, to travel abroad or
to undertake research at United Kingdom universities. _ . .
Civil Service training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division
of the Treasurv, which runs central courses for members of the administrative,
professional and scientific classes at different stages of their careers. In addition,
the Division trains departmental instructors and other special groups, such as
superintendents of typists, and secretaries.
Promotion
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by Departments; those
from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open only to
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
64
serving members of specified civil service classes), and partly by Departments
themselves. All promotions to the Administrative Class from other classes require
Treasury approval. Promotions to most of the highest positions in the Civil Service,
i.e. Permanent Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Principal Establishments Officer and
Principal Finance Officer, must be approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised
in these matters by the Joint Permanent Secretary to the Treasury who is the
official head of the Home Civil Service.
Conditions of Service
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council1 which is composed jointly of
official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections of the
Service is provided through the various staff associations, which civil servants are
encouraged to join (e.g., the Civil Service Clerical Association, the Union of Post
Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants), and through depart¬
mental Whitley Councils (of which there are about 75).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is intended to compare
reasonably with that paid for similar work outside the Service, and he normally
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to which he
belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of the
Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice he enjoys a con¬
siderable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent civil servant may
reasonably expect a full career in the public service, and a pension on retirement—
though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘ conditioned ’ to a given number of hours of atten¬
dance a week. Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary groups if
they work longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard working week in
the Service is 42 hours in London and 44 hours in the provinces. The highest
administrative officials, who work the longest hours, receive no extra remuneration
for extra work performed. Annual leave varies according to the grade up to a maxi¬
mum of six weeks, i.e. 30 working days, a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any
National Insurance benefit received, may be granted to established civil servants
for up to six months in any twelve months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum
of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants may participate in political activities subject to certain special rules.
Many grades are completely free to engage in national and local political activities;
others are free to engage in most political activities by permission and subject to
certain conditions; while others again are not allowed to take part in national
political activities, but are free to seek permission to engage in local political activi¬
ties. Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all citizens to
register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions, e.g., at a general
election or at local authority elections. Officially, the position and functions of a
civil servant remain the same whichever political party is in power; and it is his duty
to serve the Government of the day irrespective of his own political opinion.
Normally the Government is not concerned with the private political views of its
servants. There are, however, duties where secrecy is so vitally important to State
security that the State is not justified in employing any one to carry them out whose
1 See also p. 287.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
65
reliability is in doubt, and therefore no one who is known to be a member of, or
actively associated with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organizations is
employed in connection with such work. In general, however, every civil servant
may engage in such private activities as he wishes, provided that such activities do
not in any way conflict with his official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1906. A
civil servant must not, however, use his official position to further his private
interests; and he is therefore subject to restrictions in matters of commerce and
business from which the ordinary citizen is free, e.g., he may not hold private
interests in public contracts; and he may not use official information in writing,
broadcasting or lecturing without the express approval of his Department. Above
all, a civil servant is expected to conform to the high standards of integrity which
characterize the Service to which he belongs.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has been defined as government by elected local bodies charged
with administrative and executive duties in matters concerning the inhabitants of a
particular district or place and vested with powers to make byelaws for their
guidance.
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. It has existed in England continuously since
Saxon times. In its present shape, however, it dates back only to the later nine¬
teenth century, when the conception of local government by popularly elected
councils received statutory recognition.
The first 40 years of the present century witnessed a sharp increase in, and
expansion of, environmental and social services, and a corresponding increase in
the responsibilities of local authorities upon whom the greater part of the manage¬
ment of these services devolved. Legislation passed in the post-war period has
made some further changes; on the one hand the powers of local authorities relating
to the provision of hospitals, gas and electricity supplies and (in England and
Wales) valuation for rating purposes have been transferred to national boards or
to Government Departments, while on the other, local authorities (mainly the
councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales and of counties
and large burghs in Scotland) have been charged with certain additional or new
responsibilities in connection with the health services, care of children, town and
country planning, care of the aged and a number of other welfare services.
Reforms in the general structure of local government in England and Wales
(outside Greater London), the redistribution of certain functions as between county
councils and county district councils, and changes in local government finance in
Great Britain as a whole are proposed in a series of White Papers1 issued in 1956
and 1957. The Government has expressed the view that there is no convincing
case for a radical reshaping of the existing form of local government in England and
Wales, but that it should be overhauled and improved in such ways as are necessary
to bring it up to date. Certain guiding principles, and the machinery that would be
appropriate for applying them to the main problems, are outlined in the White
Papers. Legislation is to be introduced to implement these proposals, and a Royal
Commission is to be set up to study the position in Greater London.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Relationship between Central and Local Government
As the supreme authority in the United Kingdom, Parliament controls local
authorities through Acts of Parliament, which require elected local councils to
implement policies prescribed and defined in those Acts. The scope of local
government is limited by the same means; no council may go beyond the bounds
fixed for its activities by an Act of Parliament.
Legislation is supported by departmental supervision: Parliament makes certain
ministers responsible for securing the efficient functioning of local government
services. Departmental supervision is exercised by means of inspections, inquiries,
examinations of statistics, authorization of loans, the issue of advisory circulars and
statutory instruments, the approval of byelaws, and the administration of Govern¬
ment grants. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link
between local authorities and the central Government in England and Wales; in
Scotland the Scottish Home Department is generally responsible for local govern¬
ment; and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
Principal Types of Local Authority
For purposes of local government, England and Wales and Northern Ireland
are divided into county boroughs and administrative counties. Administrative
counties are further divided into three types of county district: municipal or non¬
county boroughs; urban districts; and rural districts, which are themselves sub¬
divided into parishes (except in Northern Ireland). Each of these divisions is
administered by a different kind of local council, as follows:
England and Wales1
county councils (61) rural district councils (474)8
county borough councils (83) parish councils (some 7,300) or
non-county borough councils (318) parish meetings (some 3,800).
urban district councils (563)
Northern Ireland
county councils (6) urban district councils (24)
county borough councils (2) town commissioners (3)
borough councils (9) rural district councils (32).
Scotland
The local authorities in Scotland are:
county councils (33, of which two pairs are combined for certain purposes)
town councils (197, consisting of: the authorities for counties of cities, 4; other
large burghs, 20; and small burghs, 173)
district councils (199; two counties are not divided into districts).
There are, in addition, the local authorities for London, which are unlike those
in the rest of the United Kingdom. They are:
the London County Council
the Corporation of the City of London
the metropolitan borough councils (28).
Excluding the county of London.
Including the Isles of Scilly.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

Functions and Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
environmental and social services as it may be required to provide and administer
by an Act of Parliament. It may provide additional services under the permissive
powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon the type of council. In
England and Wales and Northern Ireland, for example, county borough councils
are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county district councils
have particular functions allotted to them, which they exercise independently to a
considerable extent, although there is a certain degree of delegation from county
councils to county district councils especially in the fields of planning and, in
England and Wales, education. In Scotland, the town councils of the counties of
cities are all-purpose authorities; elsewhere the county councils exercise very many
local government functions. In large burghs, they administer education, valuation
for rating, and, in some cases, the police service, all other functions being exercised
by the town councils. In small burghs, county councils undertake a number of
important functions, but housing and some other services are administered by the
town councils. The smallest authorities (the parish councils or parish meetings in
England and Wales and the district councils in Scotland) have a few functions which
they may exercise of right.
The services provided by the councils, which are described more fully in later
chapters, may be considered under three heads:
1. Environmental Services, which are services designed to secure and improve the
citizens’ surroundings. The majority are public health and sanitary services
administered in England and Wales either by county borough or county district
councils (in London by the metropolitan borough councils, in Northern Ireland
by the county district councils, and in Scotland by the county and town councils),
e.g., the inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleans¬
ing, refuse collection and disposal, the supervision of water supplies, measures for
ensuring food hygiene (including inspection of premises where food is prepared,
sold or served, and the analysis of food samples), measures for preventing the pollu¬
tion of air, rodent control and the provision of baths and washhouses. There are also
the services for street lighting, public safety on the highways, and the provision of
amenities such as parks and recreation grounds, which are generally administered
by the same authorities and also by district councils in Scotland. The important
work of town and country planning is done in England and Wales by the county
and county borough councils, except where it is delegated to county district councils,
and in Scotland by county councils and the town councils of large burghs. County
borough councils, as all-purpose authorities, provide and administer their own
environmental services.
2. Protective Services, which include the fire service, the civil defence service
and the police. The fire service is administered throughout England and Wales by
the county borough councils and the county councils, or by joint authorities (or
joint committees) set up by those councils if they amalgamate; and in Scotland, by
the county councils and the town councils of most of the large burghs or by joint
boards. These authorities and, in London, the metropolitan borough councils and
the City Corporation, are also responsible for the local organization of most civil
defence services; they may delegate important civil defence functions to constituent
district councils. The police service is maintained by Standing Joint Committees
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in the counties of England and Wales, by Watch Committees in the county
boroughs or by joint boards in the case of combined police authorities. In London
the maintenance of the City of London force is a matter for the Common Council
of the City while the police authority for the Metropolitan police force is the Home
Secretary. The appointment of the Commissioner of Police for the City of London
and of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis are subject to the approval
of the Sovereign. The police authorities in Scotland are the county councils, the
town councils of large burghs, or joint committees for combined forces.
3. Personal Services, which are services designed to ‘cultivate the best physical,
mental, and moral potentialities of each individual’. The type of authority con¬
cerned depends on the nature of the services, which range from maternity and
child welfare, education, care of children and housing to the provision of entertain¬
ments. Services under this heading also include certain health services, services for
the aged and infirm, and the provision and upkeep of libraries, museums and art
galleries.
There are also some trading services, e.g., passenger transport, water supply,
and harbour, dock and pier services, although these are now less numerous than
before and during the war.
Local Authority Elections
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government
is three years; aldermen who are elected to county, county borough and borough
councils in Great Britain (and to county borough and borough councils in Northern
Ireland) from among the councillors or persons qualified to be councillors, hold
office for six years. In some local authority areas the whole council retires every third
year and another is elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually,
when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government elections
is governed by rules laid down in the Representation of the People Act, 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at a
local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age or over and a
British subject, or a citizen of the Irish Republic, and is registered as a local govern¬
ment elector for the area for which the election is held. In Great Britain, a person
qualifies for registration as a local government elector if on the qualifying date for
the register he or she is resident in the area or occupies as owner or tenant any
rateable land or premises in the area of a yearly value of not less than £10. In
Northern Ireland in order to qualify for registration as a local government elector
a person must have been born in Northern Ireland, or, alternatively, have resided
continuously in the United Kingdom for the whole of seven years immediately
prior to the qualifying date and must have either a resident occupier’s qualification,
or a general occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned, under
the supervision of a presiding officer specially appointed for the purpose. The pro¬
cedure governing voting methods in Great Britain is similar to that followed at
Parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more restricted.
Candidates for election stand either as Independents or as representatives of one
of the national or local political parties. Each candidate must be nominated by two
electors, as proposer and seconder; and in England and Wales (except in elections
for metropolitan borough councils, rural district councils and parish councils) eight
other electors for the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland, county and
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 69
district council candidates require proposers but no assenters, town council candi¬
dates a proposer and five assenters. A candidate for election as a councillor must be
of British nationality and over 21 years of age and must either (1) be registered as a
local government elector in the Register of Electors for the area for which he seeks
election, or (2) have resided within that area during the whole of the twelve months
preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils), or (3) in
England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the area. Candidates are also
subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable
persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by
Electoral Regulations made by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland.
These regulations are similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though differ¬
ing in certain particulars; for example, the town clerk or the clerk to the council is
the returning officer for all elections to the authority; there is no postal voting and
the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
In parliamentary elections, the contest is normally between several candidates
for one seat. In local government elections there are usually a good many seats to
be filled, and nearly all county boroughs, non-county boroughs and metropolitan
boroughs in England and Wales and the larger burghs in Scotland are divided into
wards. Except in metropolitan boroughs, the number of councillors for each ward
must be three or a multiple of three. All other local authority areas, except the ad¬
ministrative counties, may be divided into wards or they may be left as single units,
depending on their size. The administrative counties are split up in accordance with
orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department or the Secretary
of State for Scotland, into electoral divisions which return members to the county
council. The London County Council is organized in three-member divisions,
which are the same as the parliamentary constituencies in its area.
Internal Organization of Local Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own internal
arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they will discharge
their responsibilities. The arrangements made by most councils are briefly as
follows: questions of policy and principle are decided by the whole council, which
appoints committees to carry out the detailed administration of its various services.
The more important of the committees of the larger authorities divide their work
among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee in a relation similar
to that of the main committees to the whole council. The execution of the policy
decided upon by the council and the committees rests with salaried officers and
employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small rural district
to several thousand in the large counties and in the larger county boroughs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of specialists
on committees and the length of time certain members may hold office, committees
of councils are remarkably free from legal restrictions; even those known as
‘statutory’ committees are constituted according to individual requirements and
not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes of classification, however,
they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary committees and joint committees.
Ordinary committees may be further divided into statutory committees, the
appointment of which is compulsory under an Act of Parliament; standing com¬
mittees, which are appointed in accordance with the standing orders of the council
on a permanent basis according to the extent of the council’s business; and special
committees, which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
7o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Joint Committees or Joint Boards consist of representatives of more than one
authority. They are usually established when local authorities co-operate for services
which cannot be dealt with on purely local lines, e.g., water supply, or sewerage.
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers and
duties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders or, in the
case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s administrative scheme.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees except its powers in con¬
nection with raising loans, levying rates or issuing precepts, which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole.
Officers and Employees
About i^ million persons (including teachers, transport staff and building
workers) are employed in local government service in Great Britain.
Every council is empowered to appoint such staff as it deems necessary to carry
out its work. Certain appointments are compulsory (e.g., the Clerk, the Treasurer,
the Medical Officer of Health, the Surveyor and the Public Health Inspector), but
otherwise the choice of personnel is left to a great extent to the individual council.
Officers are normally of three kinds: heads of departments, whose duties are
mainly of an administrative and managerial kind; subordinate officers employed in
a professional, clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed
to do the actual physical work for which the council is responsible. As a rule, senior
staff appointments are made at the instance of the committee or committees
particularly concerned; while most junior appointments are made by heads of
departments, who are also responsible for engaging the manual labour required.
Appointments and engagements are always made in conformity with a set establish¬
ment, and committees are informed of any appointments which they have not
made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council (except where the proposed salary of an
officer requires the approval of a Government Department, as in the case of the
clerk of a county council in England and Wales). They are based on recommenda¬
tions made by the Whitley Councils (see p. 287), of which there are several,
including the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative,
Professional, Technical and Clerical Services, the National Joint Industrial Council
for Local Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers), the National Joint
Council for County Council Roadmen, and, in Scotland, the Joint Negotiating
Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities (Scotland) and the Joint
Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In England and Wales there are
also two special joint committees, which have made recommendations with regard
to the salaries and conditions of service of town clerks, county district council
clerks and other local authority chief officers.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of conduct:
as public servants they ‘ must not only be honest in fact, but must be beyond the
reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
Local Government Finance
Total local authority expenditure on current and capital account amounts annually
to over £1,500 million. Income derives from Government grants (paid in Northern
Ireland by the Government of Northern Ireland), from local rates, from loans, from
trading receipts, rents, fees and other miscellaneous sources.
Government grants, which provide over 30 per cent of total income, are of five
main types: assigned revenues, which are the proceeds of certain national taxes
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
71
handed over to local authorities, e.g., the proceeds of dog, game and gun licences
and of the licence fees for hawkers, pawnbrokers, money-lenders and refreshment
houses; percentage grants, which are agreed proportions of local authority expendi¬
ture upon services approved (in most cases) by Government Departments, e.g.,
education, health, roads, fire, police and children’s services; unit grants, which
depend exactly on the service provided, e.g., housing subsidies; equalization grants,
which are contributions to the general revenues of the poorer local authorities; and
special grants, which are grants paid from time to time for some particular pur¬
pose.
Proposals for changes in the local government financial system, contained in the
two White Papers on this subject, issued in July 1957, include a proposal to replace
most of the percentage and unit grants by a general grant of an amount fixed in
advance for a short period of years, though not necessarily at the same level for
each year of the period.
Rates are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers of land and buildings in
a local authority area as contributions to the cost of local services. They are levied
by a poundage on the rateable value of property, which in England and Wales is
equivalent to the yearly rent at which the property might reasonably be expected
to let if the tenant paid rates and taxes and also the cost of insurance and repairs,
and they provide over a quarter of the total income of local authorities. Valuation
is undertaken by the Valuation Officers of the Board of Inland Revenue; appeals
may be made to independent Valuation Panels and thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland the primary basis of valuation at present is the annual rent payable;
valuation on a basis similar to that in England and Wales will come into force in
1961. Valuation areas are the counties of cities and administrative counties, and
valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of these areas. Appeals
lie to the Valuation Appeal Committee of each valuation area and thereafter to the
Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation
Advisory Council has been established by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales lies
with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London, with the
City Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. County councils finance
themselves by issuing a precept on the county districts (in London the metropolitan
borough councils and the City Corporation) for the sums of money required;
while parishes are financed by rates levied by the appropriate rural district council
on property within the parish as an addition to the general rates. Rates in Scotland
are levied by the town councils in burghs and by county councils elsewhere; to
cover their expenditure, district councils issue a requisition each year to the county
council; a town council has to meet an annual requisition from the county council
in respect of the burgh’s share of the expenditure on functions exercised by the
county council throughout the county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland,
county councils are responsible for making, levying and collecting the rates, except
in such parts of the county as fall within the jurisdiction of the county borough,
borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for items of capital expenditure
which could not well be met out of current revenue, subject to the approval of the
Government Department responsible for the service for which the capital is
required. Such loans may be raised either on the open market or from the Public
Works Loan Board, which was originally constituted under the Public Works
Loans Act, 1875, to make certain local loans out of moneys provided by the
Exchequer and which for a brief period (1945-52) was the only source from which
local authorities could normally borrow. Freedom to borrow on the open market
F
72
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
was restored to local authorities in January 1953 (see also p. 305); they are now
encouraged to raise finance in this way. Government loans provide some 16 per
cent of the total income of local authorities.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned by a
finance committee, whose function is to keep the financial policy of the council
under constant review. External control is carried out by means of an annual
audit, which in the case of all councils in England and Wales (except for certain
general accounts in about two-thirds of the borough councils) is operated by
district auditors appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
Borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts which
relate to education, national assistance, children, local health services, coast pro¬
tection, motor tax, rate collection, police, fire, civil defence and town and country
planning, but they may and sometimes do employ a professional firm of auditors
to do other work. In Scotland, all accounts are audited by a professional auditor
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and paid by the council.
THE LAW
The maintenance of public order in the United Kingdom is effected, generally
speaking, by two agencies—the judiciary and the police. Both are concerned in
different ways with the obedience of the citizen to the law.
Law is said to be based on the concepts of order and compulsion. In the legal
sense, it has been defined as any rule which will be enforced by the courts; as it
applies to a country, it is usually understood as the set of rules by which the
citizens of that country will expect to regulate their conduct in relation to their
fellow citizens and to the State.
There is no written code of law in the United Kingdom. The question whether
a particular rule is recognized as part of law is determined by consideration of the
authorities, which may be statutes, statements made by legal writers, or reports of
decided cases. If none of these exists, the judge uses a process of analogy: that is to
say, he bases his decision in a case on its similarity to a previous case in which
judgment has already been given.
The sources of law in the United Kingdom are common law which is law
recognized by the courts as binding on some other grounds than express enact¬
ment, equity (see below), and statute law. The origins of common law are to be
found in the customs of the realm. Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and
delegated or subordinate legislation made under powers conferred by Parliament
(see pp. 34-36).
The Scottish common law is different from that prevailing in England and
Wales and (as a rule) in Northern Ireland, since ancient differences were perpetuated
by the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland, 1707, under which Scotland
retained her own system of law. Equity was introduced into English law to modify
the older common law system during the Middle Ages. Its purpose was to temper
justice with mercy when conscience was opposed to the rigours of the law, and
to enforce and provide more effectual remedies for existing legal rights. In 1873
the courts of equity were fused in the courts of common law, so that all courts now
apply both systems, but where they conflict, equity prevails. The greater part of
statute law applies uniformly in all four countries of the United Kingdom, although
in many fields of legislation there are statutes applying to Scotland only.
The two main branches of the law in the United Kingdom, as in most other
countries, are civil law and criminal law. Civil law has been defined as ‘ relating to
the maintenance of private claims and the redress of private wrongs, which may
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
73
not involve moral guilt’.1 Criminal law deals with offences against the State and
their punishment on behalf of the community.
Criminal Justice
English law provides that if anyone is arrested or detained otherwise than upon
lawful grounds,2 the writ of Habeas Corpus may be invoked to set him free, and he
may sue the person who detained him for false imprisonment. The writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted by a Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench Division or by
any judge of the High Court (see p. 76) against the person who detains the prisoner,
and this person must then appear before the court on the day named to show cause
for the detention; if he can show no cause, the prisoner must be released forthwith.
Lawful arrest may be either by warrant (which must contain a statement of the
specific offence with which the accused is charged) or, in certain cases, without
warrant. Any person arrested must be charged at once and, unless granted bail by
a senior police officer, brought without delay before a magistrates’ court sitting in
public. It is a basic principle of the legal system that every accused person must
be presumed innocent until his guilt has been proved by the prosecution, and it
has been laid down that, in the conduct of a criminal case, the prosecution shall
neither have, nor appear to have, any advantage over the defence. Therefore, no
prisoner can be compelled to answer the questions of the police before trial; but
if he is prepared to do so, he must be warned that anything that he says may be
taken down and given in evidence at his trial.3 Private interrogation before an
examining magistrate prior to public trial forms no part of English criminal
proceedings.
Prisoners awaiting trial either before a magistrates’ court or before a higher
court may, at the discretion of the court, be released on bail—that is to say, they
may be temporarily discharged subject to their entering into a recognizance, with
or without sureties, for a reasonable sum of money, to appear in court at the time
appointed for the trial.
Any person accused of a crime may be assisted at his trial by a professional
lawyer. If he cannot afford to pay for legal representation he may be granted legal
aid (see p. 83); this is at the discretion of the court, except in the case of a person
charged with murder, who must be granted legal aid if his means are insufficient.
During his trial, the accused person or defendant has the right to hear and sub¬
sequently to cross-examine all the witnesses for the prosecution, to call witnesses
on his own account, and to address the court. Once acquitted no accused person
can ever again be charged with that particular offence in any court of law.
The Jury System
Generally speaking, all the more serious crimes, i.e. crimes known as indictable
offences because a formal written accusation or indictment is required for their
prosecution, must be tried in a superior court before a jury. As an exception,
however, certain specified indictable offences may be dealt with instead at a
1 Outlines of Central Government, J. J. Clarke.
2 These are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for civil debt (this is now permitted only
where a person of proved capacity to pay refuses to do so); by order of a court of law or of
either House of Parliament, upon the ground of contempt; detention of persons found to
be insane or mentally defective; detention of children by their parents or guardians.
3 The police can ask questions of a person not in their custody without warning him, but
once the police officer has made up his mind to prefer a charge against the person, he must
warn him in similar terms.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
magistrates’ court if the defendant consents. Conversely a criminal case which
would ordinarily be dealt with in a magistrates’ court must usually be heard before
a jury if the offence is punishable by more than three months’ imprisonment and
the defendant elects to be so tried.
A jury consists of twelve persons duly summoned in pursuance of a precept
from the court. Most property ov/ners and ratepayers (men and women alike) are
liable to be summoned for jury service if they are British subjects and are between
the ages of 21 and 60, unless they are disqualified as, for example, having been
convicted of any infamous crime. Members of certain professions are, however,
exempt from service, and no person can be summoned to serve on any jury more
than once in any one year unless all the jurors on the list have already been sum¬
moned to serve during such year.
In trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to determine
questions of law, including questions as to the admissibility of the evidence, and
for the jury to decide questions of fact. In criminal cases, therefore, the jury has
to decide whether, on the evidence placed before them and the summing-up of that
evidence by the judge, the defendant is guilty or innocent; if it finds the defendant
guilty, sentence is passed by the judge. The judge never accompanies the jury when
it retires to consider its verdict. The verdict of a jury must be unanimous; if its
members are unable to reach agreement, the case must be retried before a new jury.
Both the prosecution and the defence have the right to object to any member of
the jury on the grounds of his lack of impartiality; it is an offence to assault,
threaten, or attempt to corrupt a juryman; and no jury can be penalized for its
verdict, though it be apparently contrary to the evidence or to the summing-up of
the judge.
Procedure under Scottish law differs from the foregoing in a number of impor¬
tant respects; notably, the verdict may be by a bare majority of the jury (which in
Scotland consists of fifteen persons) and, in addition to ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’,
may also be given as ‘ not proven ’; this last verdict, which does not exist in English
law, involves acquittal in the same way as ‘ not guilty
In England and Wales, either party may insist on trial by jury in civil courts in
cases involving claims for defamation, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment,
seduction, breach of promise to marry, or fraud; other civil cases are only tried by
jury if the court, in its discretion, so orders on the application of a party. Where
there is no jury, the trial is by judge alone. In the trial of a civil action, the jury is
responsible for deciding questions of fact (as in the trial of criminal cases) and also
the amount of damages to be awarded to the injured party.
The procedure in civil cases in Scottish courts again differs in some respects.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts (see pp. 79-80) a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died. The
jury in this instance consists of not fewer than seven and not more than eleven
jurors. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether
objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘ treasure trove ’ (see p. 80).
Law of Evidence
The law of evidence (evidence being all the legal means, exclusive of mere
argument, which tend to prove or disprove any matter of fact, the truth of which
is submitted to judicial investigation) is, in general, the same in criminal and in
civil trials; but, because of the peculiar nature of a criminal trial—the gravity of the
issue, the extent to which the public interest is involved and the penalty to which
the prisoner may be subjected—some of the rules, as they relate to the proof of the
case against the prisoner, are applied with greater rigour and severity in the course
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
75
of criminal than in the course of civil proceedings. Thus, although the uncorro¬
borated evidence of one witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, a convic¬
tion solely on the evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is, in practice, never
allowed, unless the judge has warned the jury of the dangers of convicting without
corroboration. In Scotland, apart from a few statutory exceptions, no person can
be convicted unless there is evidence of at least two witnesses implicating him in
the commission of the crime with which he is charged.
Evidence of admissions of guilt by an accused person are accepted in a criminal
trial only subject to certain strict conditions designed to ensure that the prisoner
fully understood that his confession might be used in evidence, and that it was a
voluntary confession, not obtained from the prisioner either by fear of prejudice or
hope of advantage. Nor may the previous history of the prisoner be used against
him unless he has either expressly set up his own virtuous character as an argument
for his innocence, or attacked a witness or the prosecutor (or given evidence against
a co-defendant), in which case he may, should he choose to give evidence himself,
be asked questions about his own previous convictions provided that they are rele¬
vant and not too remote in time. And finally, a witness must not, as a general rule,
repeat in court statements made by a third party; first, because to admit such
evidence would be to accept the statement of a person not on oath, and secondly,
because that person cannot be cross-examined.
THE COURTS
The courts that apply the law in the United Kingdom are broadly speaking
divided into civil and criminal courts, although, since the distinction is a com¬
paratively modern one, no hard and fast line can be drawn. Quite a number of
civil cases are, in fact, heard in criminal courts; while occasionally a criminal case
may be heard in what is primarily a civil court.
Civil Courts in England and Wales
The more important of the civil courts in England and Wales are:
The County Courts
The County Courts are so arranged that there is no part of the country more
than a reasonable distance from one of them. These courts may be regarded as
‘ popular tribunals ’; nearly three-quarters of a million cases are entered in them
every year, although comparatively few ever reach the stage of trial, many being
settled out of court. County courts are presided over by a paid judge, who usually
sits alone, although he may sit with a jury. Eighty county court judges may be
appointed (see p. 82).
Most of the county courts (of which there are over 400) do not sit continuously,
so that one judge can preside over several courts. If pressure of business is so great,
however, as to cause delays in the administration of justice in any district, the Lord
Chancellor may, on representations made to him by the judge of the district,
appoint a person (who must previously have held office as a judge or have been a
barrister of at least seven years’ standing) to act for the judge at any sitting of the
court.
The general jurisdiction of the county court covers all common law actions,
(though some claims, e.g., for libel, can only be tried there in exceptional circum¬
stances) where the personal reputation of the defendant is involved, provided that
the amount claimed does not exceed £400. Actions which may involve awards in
excess of this sum may be transferred to the High Court by order of the presiding

76
judge on application by the plaintiff. Cases which fall under the specific jurisdic¬
tion of the county courts, e.g., those connected with agricultural holdings, rent
restrictions, hire purchase agreements and other matters governed by statute or
ministerial order, are tried irrespective of the amount involved.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts, with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and some of them have little or no work to do at the present time.
Two or three, such as the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court
and the Bristol Tolzey Court, are still comparatively well used.
The Mayor's and City of London Court
This court, which is the County Court for the City of London, is the amalgama¬
tion of two courts, the Mayor’s Court, with a jurisdiction unlimited as to amount,
and the City of London Court, a court for small cases. It is usually presided over
by a judge appointed by the City of London.
The High Court of Justice
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. The
Supreme Court of Judicature largely took its present form in 1873. It is composed
of the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
The High Court sits in three divisions: the Queen’s Bench Division, the
Chancery Division, and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. These divi¬
sions derive from the old courts of the same names which existed before 1873,
and cases are distributed between them as tradition and convenience dictate.
The Queen’s Bench Division is staffed by the Lord Chief Justice and 25 puisne
judges, i.e. judges without special office of their own. These judges are mainly
concerned with ordinary civil actions, e.g., debt cases, actions for damages, revenue
cases, insurance cases and commercial cases; but they also hear criminal cases at
assizes (see p. 78).
The Chancery Division is officially headed by the Lord Chancellor; but most of
the work is done by seven puisne judges who remain in London all the time. The
jurisdiction of the Chancery Division derives from the equity system (see p. 72),
and its work covers actions for the administration of the estates of deceased persons,
partnership actions, actions connected with trusts and mortgages, some tax cases,
the care of infants’ estates, and company and bankruptcy matters.
The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division deals, as its name implies, with
the proof of wills; with Admiralty and shipping cases; and with divorce cases, many
of which are heard (at present) either before judges or before specially appointed
commissioners—often county court judges.
Appellate Courts
There are two Appellate Courts in civil law actions—the Court of Appeal, which
is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature (see above), and the House of Lords.
There are several ex officio members of the Court of Appeal, but its effective
head is a judge called the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eight Lords
Justices of Appeal. Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal from the county courts, the
Mayor’s and City of London Court and the civil side of the High Court. The
Court of Appeal generally sits in two or three divisions, with three judges to a
division.
From the Court of Appeal, a further appeal is possible to the House of Lords,
with the leave of the House of Lords or of the Court of Appeal. Such appeals are
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
77
usually heard by five of the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who are paid pro¬
fessional judges with peerages for life. In addition, the Lord Chancellor and any
peers who have held ‘high judicial office’ are entitled to sit. The House of Lords
is the supreme court of appeal in civil cases in the whole of the United Kingdom.
Civil Courts in Scotland
Sheriff Courts
Sheriff Courts in their civil capacity correspond roughly to county courts in
England and Wales, but they have a wider jurisdiction unlimited by the value of
the case. They also have power to try (summarily or by indictment) all but the
most serious crimes and offences. Scotland is divided into 12 Sheriffdoms, each
provided with a Sheriff and a number of Sheriffs-Substitute. The work of the
sheriff court is normally done by a Sheriff-Substitute, against whose judgment an
appeal may be made to the Sheriff or directly to the Court of Session.
Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices
of the peace.
The Court of Session
The Court of Session is the supreme civil court in Scotland. It was established in
1532 and consists at present of 15 judges. The court is divided into two parts—the
Inner House, which is mainly an appeal Court, and the Outer House, a court of
first instance, where, inter alia, all actions for divorce are taken. The Inner House
is divided into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges; the
First Division being presided over by the Lord President, and the Second Division
by the Lord Justice Clerk. From the Inner House, an appeal may lie to the House of
Lords.
The Scottish Land Court
This is a special court in Scotland for dealing with certain agricultural matters.
The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and dignity of a
judge of the Court of Session.
Criminal Courts in England and Wales
The criminal courts in England and Wales include:
Petty Sessional or Magistrates' Courts
Magistrates’ courts are courts of summary jurisdiction where persons accused
of all kinds of minor offences and a large number of the less serious indictable
offences may be tried without a jury (see pp. 73-74). These courts are also used for
committal proceedings, i.e. the public conduct, by magistrates, of preliminary
inquiries into indictable offences to determine whether or not an accused person
should be committed for trial in a higher court. In 1956, over 97 per cent of all
persons convicted were convicted at magistrates’ courts.
The majority of magistrates’ courts consist of two or more unpaid ‘lay’ magis¬
trates or justices of the peace, who are appointed, in each county and for each
borough which has its own commission of the peace, by the Lord Chancellor, who
is advised as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant1 with the assistance of an advisory
committee, and as to boroughs by separate advisory committees. There are also
a few persons who are authorized by statute to act as justices, by virtue of holding
1 The office of Lord Lieutenant in the county was first created in the sixteenth century.
Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
78
some other public office, e.g., mayors of county and non-county boroughs and
chairmen of county councils.
In central London, the courts consist of a paid metropolitan magistrate sitting
alone; some of the larger towns also have stipendiary magistrates.
Juvenile Courts in England and Wales are specially constituted magistrates’
courts which deal with those of under 17 years of age who are charged with any
offence except homicide, or are brought before the courts as being in need of care
or protection or beyond control, or persistant truants. Juvenile courts also deal
with most applications for the adoption of children.
Outside the London magistrates’ courts area the justices for each petty sessional
division elect from their number a panel of justices specially qualified to deal with
juvenile cases. The panel for the London area is appointed by the Home Secretary.
A juvenile court consists of not more than three justices drawn from the panel
and must, except in special circumstances, include a man and a woman. A juvenile
court must sit either in a different room or building from that in which other courts
are sitting, or on a different day. Only persons within certain specified categories are
admitted and only limited publicity is allowed.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of whom one
should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic proceedings is separated
from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the public is excluded.
Courts of Quarter Session
There are two different kinds of Quarter Sessions—county sessions and borough
sessions; both are normally held four times a year, although additional sittings
may be held, when necessary, by way of adjournment.
Each of the 65 courts of county quarter sessions is presided over by a legally
qualified chairman or deputy chairman, who may or may not draw a salary, sitting
with a number of the magistrates of the county. In London and Middlesex, where
the courts have continuous sittings, the chairman and deputy chairman normally
preside alone. In the 96 boroughs, which hold separate quarter sessions, the courts,
which do not sit continuously, are presided over by a Recorder (usually a part-time
judicial officer), who is a salaried barrister, as sole judge. Trial by jury applies
at both borough and county sessions.
The jurisdiction of quarter sessions covers all but the most serious indictable
offences; the courts are debarred, for example, from trying any crime that carries
the death sentence or (subject to certain exceptions) imprisonment for life (see
page 85).
Assizes
The Courts of Assize are branches of the High Court of Justice. They are held
in the county towns and in certain big cities three times a year, a Queen’s Bench
judge or a Commissioner of Assize (who may be a barrister commissioned to act as
a judge) presiding. The assize judges work on circuits covering England and Wales,
and travel from one county town to another in the course of their duties. They can
try any indictable offence committed in the county.
At the winter and summer assizes, civil business as well as criminal may be
taken, but except in a few large towns the autumn assize is confined to criminal cases.
The Crown Courts
The Crown Courts are new courts established at Liverpool and Manchester by
provision of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1956, to act as courts of
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
79
assize in and for the West Derby Division of Lancashire and the Salford Division
of Lancashire. They also act as courts of quarter sessions for the cities of Liver¬
pool and Manchester. The Crown Courts are presided over by the Recorders of
Liverpool and Manchester, who are whole-time judicial officers.
The Central Criminal Court
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey acts as the court of assize for the
criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts of the Home Counties. The
judges include: a judge, chosen from the Queen’s Bench Division in rotation, for
each monthly session of the court; the Recorder of London; the Common Serjeant;
and two additional judges of the Mayor’s and City of London Court.
Criminal Appeals
Appeals may be made direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court on a
point of law; but the more usual kind of appeal is the appeal of a convicted person
against his conviction or his sentence. Appeals of this kind from a magistrates
court are heard in the counties by the Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions, con¬
sisting of between three and twelve magistrates, and in the boroughs by the
Recorder; in neither case is a jury required.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or Crown
courts go to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Appeals may be made on any point of law,
and also, by leave, on a point of fact.
The Court of Criminal Appeal consists of the Lord Chief Justice and a number
of Queen’s Bench judges; three in session is the usual number.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords on a
point of law can be made if the Attorney-General grants a certificate affirming that
the appeal is of ‘ exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public
interest that a further appeal should be brought’. Appeals of this kind are very rare.
Criminal Courts in Scotland
The bulk of the criminal prosecutions in Scotland are dealt with in the sheriff
courts (see p. 77), and only minor offences are tried in police courts in burghs and
in justice of the peace courts in counties. Cases involving serious crime are taken
in the High Court of Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
It also functions as an appeal court from inferior criminal courts. It consists of the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session), the
Lord Justice Clerk and thirteen Lords Commissioners of Justiciary who are also
judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the
judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns. Appeals to the High Court
are heard by three or more judges; there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
Courts in Northern Ireland
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England
and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller community. The main
difference is that all petty sessional cases are dealt with by resident magistrates, who
correspond to the metropolitan or stipendiary magistrates of England and Wales.
The inferior courts, that is to say the courts where the less serious cases are tried,
are administered by the Parliament of Northern Ireland; the administration of the
superior courts has been reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Coroners’ Courts
Where a person appears to have died a violent or unnatural death, or a sudden
death of which the cause is unknown, or in certain other circumstances, the death
8o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
must be reported to a coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by a county or a county
borough council), within whose jurisdiction the body is lying. When a death is
reported to a coroner, he inquires how, when, and where the deceased died.
A coroner may hold an inquest in court for this purpose and he must hold an in¬
quest if he has reasonable cause to believe that the deceased has died a violent or
unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which an Act of
Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. A jury must be summoned if
there is reason to suspect that the deceased came by his death by murder, man¬
slaughter, or infanticide, or from an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle in
a street or public highway, or in certain other special circumstances. If the jury
returns a verdict of murder, manslaughter or infanticide by a particular person, the
coroner commits that person for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden
death of which the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest but may
order a post-mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death.
Any person finding objects of gold or silver hidden in the soil or in buildings, the
original owner of which cannot be traced, must report the find to a coroner. The
coroner then holds an inquest with a jury to inquire whether the objects are
‘treasure trove’ and who wras the finder thereof. If it is decided that the objects
are treasure trove, then, though the law is that treasure trove vests in the Crown,
the declared finder will either receive them back or be paid their full market value.
In Scotland, the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal inquires
privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may report the
results of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown Counsel may
consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
Ecclesiastical Courts
The established Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts, which
constitute a graduated hierarchy. They include the Court of the Archdeacon, the
Consistory Court of the Bishop of each diocese and the provincial courts of the
Archbishops of Canterbury and of York.
The ecclesiastical courts, which are still courts in the full sense of the word, have
jurisdiction only in matters of purely ecclesiastical concern, such as questions of
doctrine and ritual, ordination, consecration, and the celebration of divine service
(see also p. 401).
Administrative Tribunals
A number of administrative tribunals1 exist in various parts of the United King¬
dom for the exercise of special judicial functions; broadly speaking they fall into
three groups:
(1) those which deal with a class of dispute in which a Government Department
or public authority is almost always interested, e.g., Local Valuation Courts
(rating), Pensions Appeal Tribunals, General and Special Commissioners of
Inland Revenue (income tax);
(2) those which deal with a class of dispute where specialized knowledge or
experience on the part of the tribunal is required, e.g., the Lands Tribunal
(assessment of values of interest in land), and Rent Tribunals (assessment
of fair rents for furnished premises);
1 In 1957, a committee, appointed to inquire into the practice and procedure of admini¬
strative tribunals, issued its report, which is now being considered by the Government.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
8l
(3) those which enforce professional discipline, e.g., the General Medical
Council (doctors), and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society
(solicitors).
Appeals from these tribunals normally lie to the appropriate minister (if there is
one) or, on a point of law, to the superior courts of England and Wales, Scotland
or Northern Ireland, as the case may be.
Military Courts
The jurisdiction of military courts or courts martial is exclusively over persons
subject to military law, and appeals lie to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, set up
by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act, 1951. The powers of courts martial are limited
to those conferred on them by statute, and if these powers are exceeded, the person
injured has his remedy in the High Court.
THE JUDICIARY
The judiciary of the United Kingdom is independent. That is to say, it is free
to administer the law under the protection of the lawr without fear or favour. All
judges, from those of the House of Lords and the superior courts to the ‘lay’
magistrates or justices of the peace, must not only be, but must appear to be, com¬
pletely impartial, for it is of fundamental importance that ‘justice should not only
be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done’.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts in that ‘ all jurisdic¬
tion of the courts is either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’,1
but since the end of the seventeenth century it has been established that the execu¬
tive cannot disturb or delay the course of common justice, attempt to force the
judges to act otherwise than impartially, or use the prerogative powers of the
Crown to create courts to administer any system of law other than common law.
The independence of the judiciary vis-a-vis the legislature is likewise strictly
observed. Originally laid down by the Act of Settlement, 1^01, the law governing
the matter was re-enacted in the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act,
1925, which provides that all judges of the High Court and the Court of Appeal,
with the exception of the Lord Chancellor (who is a member of the Cabinet), shall
hold their offices during good behaviour subject to a power of removal by the
Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament. During the
centuries that have passed since i7OI> only one such address has been moved
(against a judge convicted of misappropriation of funds, in the nineteenth century);
and it can be stated with confidence that Parliament would never interfere in this
way with judicial independence. Similarly, although no court in the United King¬
dom would ever question the validity of an Act of Parliament which had been duly
passed by both Houses of Parliament and duly promulgated and published by the
proper authority, it might, through its interpretation of the statute, come to a
decision contrary to the policy of the Government which introduced the Act. In
such a case, it would be open to the Government to persuade Parliament to clarify
or amend the statute, or to pass a new Act. It would not be open to it to penalize
the judge or to try to influence the court in any other way.
Administration of the Judicial System
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. The central responsi¬
bility for the administration of the judicial system in England and Wales lies partly
1 Blackstone’s Commentaries.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
with the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown the
appointment of the Lord Justices of Appeal and that of the Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary (see pp. 76-77).
Apart from the appointment of the Lord Justices of Appeal, Crown appoint¬
ments to the High Court bench are made on the recommendation of the Lord
Chancellor, who appoints justices of the peace and is also responsible for recom¬
mending to the Crown the appointment of county court judges (except in Lan¬
cashire where they are nominated by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster),
Recorders of boroughs and metropolitan and stipendiary magistrates. The admini¬
strative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the appointment of court
officials is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the hands of the
appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is a member of the Rule Committee
which makes the rules of the Supreme Court; he also appoints the County Court
Rule Committee and has power to alter or to disallow the rules made by it. In
addition, responsibility for initiating proposals for judicial reform, save in the field
of criminal law, lies with the Lord Chancellor, who is advised in this matter by
the Law Reform Committee and the Private International Law Committee, both
established in 1952.
The Home Secretary is responsible for approving appointments of clerks to
justices throughout England and Wales, and for the general administration of
magistrates’ courts, except in relation to their judicial functions in which they can
be controlled only by the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court. The local
responsibility for the administration of magistrates’ courts lies with the magistrates’
courts committees, of which there is one for each county and county borough.
In Scotland, the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment of
the Lord President and Lord Justice General and also of the Lord Justice Clerk
(see p. 79). Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies with the
Secretary of State for Scotland on the nomination of the Lord Advocate. The High
Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session are administered by the Clerk of the
Justiciary and his staff and the Principal Clerk of Session and his staff respectively.
Powers of appointment and removal of justices of the peace, formerly held by the
Lord Chancellor, were transferred in 1955 to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
THE LEGAL PROFESSION
The legal profession of England and Wales is strictly divided into two classes of
lawyers—barristers and solicitors. The distinction, which is due mainly to historical
causes, is found also in Northern Ireland, Scotland and certain parts of the
Commonwealth.
No hard and fast line can be drawn between the work of the solicitor and the
work of the barrister, since there are many barristers who do little advocacy, and
there are solicitors who do little else, and who have made considerable reputations
for themselves in the courts in which they are permitted to appear. In general,
however, it may be said that solicitors are professional men who undertake legal
business for lay clients; while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors, and conduct legal proceedings in the higher courts.
A barrister is required to have reached an accepted educational standard, to have
passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of Legal Education and to
have become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s
Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple. A barrister with a substantial
junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him

Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding that is known as ‘ taking silk The highest appoint¬
ments in the legal profession, including those of Attorney-General, Solicitor-
General, and other Law Officers of the Crown, are usually, though not necessarily,
made from among barristers who have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional
conduct of a barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar;
but disciplinary powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
A prospective solicitor must be considered suitable by the appropriate Com¬
mittee of the Law Society, the professional organization of solicitors, and he must
enter into ‘Articles of Clerkship’ with a practising solicitor of not less than five
years’ standing before he can begin his professional career. The term of articles
lasts for three or five years, depending upon the educational qualifications of the
student. An articled clerk must pass the necessary examinations held by the Law
Society and, unless he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university,
he is generally required to attend a course of studies at a recognized law school.
Once a solicitor is qualified, he may also become a member of the Law Society.
In Scotland, the conditions for admission as, and the standing of, advocates and
solicitors are much the same as those applying in the case of barristers and solicitors
in England and Wales.
LEGAL AID
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources have
existed in some courts and to a limited extent for centuries in England and Wales
and in Scotland. The schemes were revised in 1949 when the Legal Aid and Advice
Act and the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act received Royal Assent. These
Acts were introduced to improve and extend the existing arrangements in civil
proceedings so that no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and
reasonable claim or to defend a legal right, and to make the facilities already avail¬
able in criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those who needed them. The
Acts also provided that solicitors and barristers acting for persons receiving legal
aid should no longer be required to act gratuitously in civil cases, but should be
remunerated for their services from public funds.
The Acts, and in particular the provisions relating to free legal advice (as distinct
from assistance in the conduct of litigation), are not yet fully in operation.
Legal Aid in Civil Cases
Legal aid in civil cases is now available to persons whose income, computed in
accordance with rules applied by the National Assistance Board, does not exceed
£420 a year, and whose capital, as so computed, does not exceed £500. W here an
assisted person can afford to make a contribution to the costs of his case, he is
required, as a condition of receiving legal aid, to pay an amount which is settled
with due regard to his financial resources.
In England and Wales, legal aid in civil cases is already available in connection
with proceedings in the High Court, in the Court of Appeal, in county courts and
in certain local courts of similar standing. Eventually the scheme will cover repre¬
sentation in courts of all types, from magistrates’ courts up to the House of Lords.
The scheme is operated through the Law Society under the general guidance of
the Lord Chancellor. The cost is met from a Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three
sources: contributions from assisted persons; costs recovered from opposite parties
in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
For the purposes of the scheme, England and Wales are divided into twelve areas.
In each area a committee of solicitors and barristers, known as an area committee,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
84
is responsible for the scheme’s initial organization and subsequent administration.
These committees are responsible for setting up legal aid centres to which anyone
seeking legal aid may apply. Committees hear the facts, and if they consider that
there is a prima facie case they give it their support. The person who wishes to bring
the action is then allowed to select from a panel a solicitor and, if necessary, a
barrister, to conduct his case. Certain types of action, including breach of promise
to marry, and libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland, the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of Scotland
through a supervisory Central Committee, a Supreme Court Committee and
twenty-one local committees. Legal aid is at present available for civil proceedings
in the Court of Session and the sheriff courts. An applicant for legal aid in Scotland
is required to show a ‘ probable cause ’ and produce in support of his application a
statement corroborated according to the requirements of Scottish law.
Legal Aid in Criminal Courts
Free legal aid is already available in the criminal courts in England and Wales
under the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, 1930, and, in case of appeal, under the
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, and the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933.
The Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, makes certain procedural changes in the
system and, when fully implemented, will transfer financial responsibility for pay¬
ing for free legal aid from local to central funds. It also lays down the principle of
allowing fair remuneration according to the work actually and reasonably done.
Under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, i952> the courts also have power, in the
case of an indictable offence, to order the reasonable costs of the defence to be paid
out of local funds when the accused has been discharged by the magistrates’ court
or acquitted. A magistrates’ court has power under the Act, if it dismisses an
information on summary trial, to order such costs to be paid to the accused by the
prosecutor as it considers just and reasonable.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act,
legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons in Scotland under the Poor’s
Roll system, which is administered on a voluntary basis by the legal profession.
In Northern Ireland, free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945. The cost of providing
free legal aid is met out of public funds.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are deterrence and
reformation. The principle underlying the system is that its effectiveness depends
less on the punitive treatment of the detected offender than in its total impact—fear
of detection, public trial and conviction and the possibility of punishment, whether
by imprisonment or otherwise. The treatment of offenders is therefore based as far
as possible upon measures for the social rehabilitation of the offender rather than
upon measures intended simply to punish the offender for his crime.
The penalties which may be imposed by the courts according to the law depend
on the circumstances of the offence and the offender, and although maximum
penalties are prescribed by law, the courts have discretion (within the limits pro¬
vided) in imposing sentence. In general, the courts have power to impose either
imprisonment or a fine for serious offences, and, in certain cases, both; while most
minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the alternative of imprisonment
if the fine is not paid. Moreover, it is at the discretion of the court, instead of sen¬
tencing an offender, to discharge him absolutely, or, in England and Wales only, to
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
85
discharge him conditionally (i.e. subject to the condition that he commits no
offence during a specified period not exceeding twelve months), or to place him
on probation (see p. 91). There are special provisions governing the treatment of
young offenders (see pp. 8Q-9*)* The Criminal Justice Act, 19481 and the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act, 1949, provide that courts shall not sentence a person under
21 years of age to imprisonment unless they consider that no other method of
dealing with him is appropriate.
The death penalty is now imposed, under the Homicide Act, 1957, only for those
forms of murder (to be known as ‘ capital murder ’) which strike most directly at
the maintenance of law and order and the public peace, i.e. any murder done in
the course or furtherance of theft, any murder by shooting or by causing an explo¬
sion, any murder committed to escape lawful arrest or to effect or assist escape or
rescue from lawful custody, or any murder of a police officer (or person assisting
him) or of a prison officer, acting in the execution of his duty. The penalty for
murder not in these categories is imprisonment for life,1 2 except that the death
penalty continues to apply where a person who is convicted of murder has pre¬
viously been convicted of another murder committed on a different occasion.
Persons under the age of 18 years at the time that the crime was committed are
not sentenced to death or to life imprisonment, but to be detained at Her Majesty s
pleasure ’. Persons suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially
impairs their mental responsibility cannot be convicted of murder; a conviction
of manslaughter is substituted in such cases. The Act maintains the long-established
practice for the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland to review
every capital case before the law is allowed to take its course and to consider whether
there are grounds for advising the Crown to exercise the Prerogative of Mercy.
Where a reprieve is recommended, the sentence of death is commuted to one of
imprisonment for life.
Two special types of treatment have been devised to deal with the persistent
offender. Offenders of 21 years of age or over may be sentenced to corrective train¬
ing if they are convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term
of two years or more and have been convicted on at least two previous occasions
since attaining the age of 17 °f offences punishable with such a sentence. Corrective
training is imposed for not less than two or not more than four years (seven years
in Northern Ireland), as the court decides.
Persons who are not less than 3° years of age and are convicted of offences
punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more and have been
convicted on at least three previous occasions since attaining the age of 17 of
offences punishable with such a sentence and have been sentenced to borstal train¬
ing, imprisonment or corrective training on at least two of these occasions, may be
sentenced to preventive detention. Preventive detention is primarily for the protec¬
tion of the public, and the sentence runs for not less than five years (three in Northern
Ireland) or more than 14 years, as the court decides.
1 A sentence of imprisonment for life is never carried out literally. The periods are
determined by the Home Secretary in accordance with the circumstances of the individual
case, each case being reviewed at least every four years. Under present practice, almost no
one serves more than fifteen years—the normal is much less than that and it is by no
means uncommon, where circumstances of the crime are pathetic and there is no need to
keep the prisoner in custody for a long period, for life-sentence prisoners to be granted an
early release.
2 In Northern Ireland, the Governor acts for the Crown in this matter on the advice of
the Cabinet.
86 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Administrative Authorities
In England and Wales, general responsibility for all institutions for the treatment
of offenders is vested in the Home Secretary. His statutory powers and duties in this
connection include the making of rules for the governance of such institutions, the
recommendation of persons for appointment by the Crown as Prison Commis¬
sioners, and the appointment of Boards of Visitors.
In the discharge of his duties relating to the treatment of offenders, the Home
Secretary is advised by an Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders, which
also acts as the National Working Group for the Economic and Social Council of
the United Nations, and as the National Committee of the International Penal and
Penitentiary Commission.
Responsibility to the Home Secretary for the administration of prisons, borstal
institutions and detention centres in England and Wales lies with the Prison
Commission, assisted by inspectors and by a professional and technical staff.
The Prison Commission consists of not more than five Commissioners, who are
appointed by the Crown, including the chairman, who is appointed to that office
by the Home Secretary. There are also a number of Assistant Commissioners who
are inspectors under the Prison Acts.
The oversight of each of these institutions is the responsibility of either Visiting
Committees appointed by the justices for those prisons to which convicted persons
are committed direct from their courts, or Boards of Visitors appointed by the
Home Secretary for the other prisons and institutions. The main functions of
the committees and boards are: to act as the superior disciplinary authority of the
prison or institution; to constitute an independent judicial body to which any
prisoner or inmate may make a complaint or request; and to report direct to the
Home Secretary, both by formal annual report and as occasion may require, on
every aspect of the administration of the prison. In borstal institutions and preven¬
tive detention prisons, the boards also advise the Prison Commissioners on the
release of the inmates on licence.
The prison systems of Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of
the Secretary of State for Scotland and of the Minister for Home Affairs respec¬
tively, and are administered by the Home Departments in Edinburgh and in Belfast.
Prisons
Prisons in England and Wales are of the following types: local prisons (of the
ordinary type which receive all classes of prisoners direct from the courts, and of a
special type, which may be open or walled, for short-sentence prisoners, chiefly
first offenders); regional training prisons, some of which are open, for first offenders
and trainable prisoners of other categories; corrective training prisons; and central
prisons for long-term recidivists, preventive detention prisoners and long-term
prisoners of the ‘ Star ’ class1—one for the latter class is an open prison.
In Northern Ireland, with its smaller population, the necessity for several kinds
of prison for the separation of various classes of prisoners does not arise to the
same extent as in England and Wales. The Scottish system of classification of
prisoners is broadly the same as that of England and Wales; but each prison in
Scotland accommodates more than one classification group.
Full-time prison officers of all ranks, except chaplains, are permanent civil
servants. At the end of 1956, prison staff of all grades in England and Wales
numbered about 7,300. Some 8 per cent of this number were women.
1‘Star’ class prisoners are those who have not previously been convicted of serious
crime and are not of habitually criminal or depraved habits.

Classification of Prisoners
Every person committed to prison is first received in the local prison serving the
court from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his whole
sentence at the local prison or he may be sent to another institution, depending on
his age, the length and nature of his sentence, and his personal history and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of young
persons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners and of civil
prisoners from criminal prisoners; secondly to prevent contamination, among
convicted prisoners, of the better by the worse; and thirdly to provide training
appropriate to their needs for those among convicted prisoners who seem likely to
benefit therefrom.
Training
The main elements of prison training (including corrective training) have been
defined as (1) the provision of work which will, so far as is practicable, help to fit
prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training in skilled trades
for suitable persons, (2) the provision of suitable educational facilities, and (3) the
provision of every opportunity for the development of a sense of personal responsi¬
bility, including (for suitable persons) training in open conditions.
Full training can be given only in prisons set aside for the purpose, which provide
vocational training courses, based on a Ministry of Labour and National Service
syllabus, at which prisoners may receive a theoretical and practical training in a
number of skilled trades. The principles on which training is based, however, hold
good for all prisons and are applied as far as individual conditions permit.
Employment
Prison industries are organized under the control of a Director of Industries,
who has a head office staff of technical officers and supervisors, including a super¬
visor of farms and gardens, and industrial managers at the prisons.
Except in local prisons, where the hours are shorter, prisoners in England and
Wales spend at present about 40 hours a week in the workshops or in other employ¬
ment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening, in company with
their fellow prisoners, and conversation is allowed. In most of the Scottish and
Northern Ireland prisons, prisoners are also employed for nearly 40 hours a week.
All prisoners are entitled to earn a limited amount from the first day of their
sentence; in England, Wales and Scotland, these amounts may be increased for
satisfactory output after a specified lapse of time. In Northern Ireland, there is a
progressive system of earnings, which are not related to output or to work done.
Education
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the Government Departments
responsible for education in their respective countries, and in Northern Ireland by
the Ministry of Home Affairs. The local authorities are reimbursed for the full cost
of their services, and the work in England and Wales is under the organizational
control of the Assistant Commissioner for Education in the Prison Commission.
Evening Institutes have been established; and a wide range of correspondence
courses is made available for those who have a serious desire to improve their
education and qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays,
concerts, and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison library,
which in most cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough library committee.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Religion and Welfare
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland and
in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland, and Presbyterian Church) and a
Roman Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the Methodist
Church and of other denominations are either appointed or specially called in as
required. The chaplain is generally responsible for welfare in the prison to which
he is appointed. Regular services are held, and chaplains and other ministers may
visit prisoners in their cells.
Prisoners may also be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals
and, in England and Wales, by recognized prison visitors asked to serve in this
field by the Prison Commissioners. The voluntary work of these visitors is co¬
ordinated and guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Remission of Sentence
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to imprison¬
ment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence (one-fourth
in Northern Ireland), provided that this does not reduce their sentence below
31 days. The Home Secretary may at any time, if he thinks fit, release on licence
anyone sentenced to life imprisonment (see footnote 1, p. 85). A prisoner sentenced
to corrective training becomes eligible for release on licence after serving two-thirds
of his sentence. A prisoner sentenced to preventive detention becomes eligible for
release on licence after serving two-thirds or five-sixths of his sentence according
to an assessment of his character, conduct and prospects, which is made after he
has served a substantial part of his sentence. In addition, at successive stages of a
prisoner’s sentence, he becomes entitled to additional privileges; for example, he
is allowed to have meals and recreation with his fellow prisoners and to have some
of his personal belongings in his cell.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the Governor or the Visiting Committee or
the Board of Visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission (or postponement
of the date of release) and forfeiture of privileges.
After-Care of Prisoners
Prisoners from local prisons are assisted on discharge by Discharged Prisoners’
Aid Societies, which are local and voluntary bodies supported partly by private
and partly by public funds. The work of the local societies is co-ordinated by the
National Associations of Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies for England and
Wales and for Scotland, both of which depend on a grant from public funds for
their administrative expenses. For persons discharged from other prisons and from
borstal institutions, after-care in England and Wales is in the hands of the Central
After-Care Association, a voluntary body financed from public funds and governed
by a council appointed by the Home Secretary, which includes in its membership
representatives of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, of the National
Assistance Board and of the Probation Service. The Secretary of State for Scotland
appoints an After-Care Council to carry out similar duties in Scotland.
In England and Wales, the Association works through local associates, usually
probation officers, who, since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act, have added
after-care to their other duties, and, in Scotland, through voluntary guardians. These
officers make all arrangements for the reception of the prisoner after his discharge,
and will advise, assist and befriend him for as long as is necessary or required by
statute.
In Northern Ireland, the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the
Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies with the help of probation officers.

Treatment of Young Offenders
Under the English and Scottish legal systems, a child under the age of eight
cannot be charged with an offence, and a child over eight but under fourteen years
old charged with an offence other than homicide must be dealt with in a juvenile
court. In England and Wales, a young person between fourteen and seventeen years
of age charged with an indictable offence (see p. 73) niay be dealt with summarily
(as is usually the case) or committed for trial by jury. In certain cases young persons
may claim to be tried by jury, though this right is rarely exercised. In Scotland and
Northern Ireland, all young persons up to the age of 17 years of age charged with
offences must be dealt with in juvenile courts, unless they have been charged in
conjunction with adult offenders.
The following methods of treatment are available in law for dealing with children
and young persons who have been found guilty of committing an offence. absolute
discharge; conditional discharge (in England and Wales only); fines (imposed upon
the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents); probation (see p. 91);
committal to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until
the age of 18; or a period of detention in one of the different types of institution
which are available when institutional treatment is considered necessary.
Remand Homes
In England, Wales and Scotland, remand homes are provided by local authorities
for the safe custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their appearance in
court, or between court appearances (while inquiries are made as to the best method
of treatment for them), while they are awaiting vacancies in approved schools, or
for a short period (up to a month) of punitive detention. There are facilities for
observation, and valuable reports can be provided as a result of the stay in a remand
home.
In Northern Ireland, the responsibility for providing or arranging for the provi¬
sion of remand homes rests with the Minister of Home Affairs.
Approved Schools
Approved schools are residential schools approved by the Home Secretary under
the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, by the Secretary of State for Scotland
(working through the Scottish Education Department) under the similar Scottish
Act of 1937, and by the Minister of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland under the
similar Northern Ireland Act of 1950, for the education and training of young
offenders and children committed to them by the courts as in need of care or
protection. Approved schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organizations concerned with the welfare of children on a national scale, or by local
committees formed for the purpose by people interested in such work. The number
of approved schools in England and Wales at the end of 1956 was 119. There are
23 approved schools in Scotland and five, known as training schools, in Northern
Ireland. „ . ,
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are formally classified
according to the ages of the children on admission, and include separate schools
for Roman Catholic children. The assignment of a child to a school in the appro¬
priate age group is determined by a variety of considerations, including the location
of the school in relation to the child’s home, the type of training provided, and the
probable reaction of a child to the individual personalities of the staff. In general,
the education follows the lines of that given in ordinary schools, with vocational
training for older boys and girls; the emphasis is on character building, and close
attention is given to after-care.
90
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The period for which a child or young person may be detained in an approved
school is determined by law. In Great Britain it is three years, except for children
under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal, who may be kept
until the age of 15 years and 4 months, and those over the age of 16 on committal,
who can be detained only up to the age of 19, or 19 J if they have been found guilty
of absconding or of serious misconduct in an approved school. Managers of all
approved schools are under an obligation to review the progress of each child in
their school towards the end of the first year of detention and thereafter at least
quarterly, with a view to granting a release on licence as soon as the situation
warrants it.
Statutory responsibility for after-care rests on the school managers. A boy or girl
on release remains under the care of the managers during the periods of licence and
supervision. The period of licence lasts until the expiry of the time for which the
boy or girl might have been legally detained in the school. The period of super¬
vision lasts for three years more, or until the boy or girl reaches the age of 21,
whichever is the shorter period. Managers are assisted in their after-care work by
welfare officers and social service organizations.
Attendance Centres
Attendance centres have been established in England and Wales in some 36
towns to deal with boys between the ages of 12 and 17 found guilty of offences for
which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment, started
in 1950, is designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them
some instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must do so
during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may be required
to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for not more than twelve
hours in all. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts, or a lecture
(e.g., on first aid) and a period of physical training or disciplinary tasks, under
supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys to join a youth club
or other suitable organization.
Detention Centres
Detention centres are designed to provide a ‘ short sharp shock ’ for those who
have not yet developed a definitely anti-social attitude, but who need to be taught
that the law cannot be defied with impunity. The offender is normally sent to the
centre for three months, though in certain circumstances the courts have power to
commit for a shorter or longer term up to a maximum of six months. The regime
is designed to deprive the boy of his liberty and of all the elements of what he
thinks of as a ‘good time’, and to oblige him to live a brisk, disciplined life, main¬
taining the highest possible standards at the highest possible tempo. Each boy in
a detention centre must be alert, punctual and tidy, and emphasis is placed on the
inculcation of obedience, cleanliness and good manners. The routine provides a
normal working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to physical
training. Boys of compulsory school age receive full-time education, and classes of
further education are provided for others in the evenings. In 1956 there were three
detention centres in England and Wales—two junior centres for boys over 14 and
under 17, accommodating about 70 and 60 boys respectively, and a senior centre
for boys over 17 and under 21, accommodating about 75 boys. A second senior
centre was opened in 1957.
Borstal Institutions
There are various types of borstal institution, which aim to provide suitable
conditions and training courses for different types of young offenders between the
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
91
ages of 16 and 21 years. For boys in England and Wales there are three borstal
allocation centres, and 13 training borstals, one correction centre and one recall
centre; and there are two training borstals and one recall centre for girls. In
Scotland, there are four borstals for boys and two for girls; and in Northern
Ireland, one for boys and one for girls. The period of the sentence is in effect four
years (three years in Scotland and Northern Ireland); it is divided between training
in a borstal institution and controlled freedom under supervision. In Scotland the
supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution or
until the expiration of three years from the date of sentence, whichever is the
shorter. The system of training seeks the all-round development of character and
capacities, and is based on progressive trust demanding increasing personal deci¬
sion, responsibility and self-control. There is much freedom of movement, and many
borstals are conducted in open conditions. An initial period of classification ensures
that each boy or girl is sent to the institution best suited to his or her requirements.
Probation
The probation system is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender
while he remains at work or at school in the community under the supervision of a
probation officer, whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal
feature of the system is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before
making a probation order, the court must explain its effects to the person con¬
cerned and inform him that if he fails to comply with its requirements he will be
liable to be dealt with for the original offence. A probation order cannot be made
without the consent of the person concerned unless (in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland only) he is under 14 years of age. The order usually requires the
probationer to keep in regular touch with the probation officer, to be of good
behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may also require him to live in a
specified place, or to submit to treatment for his mental condition. A probation
order is made for not less than one year and not more than three years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available the
services of probation officers of both sexes. At the end of 1956 the total numbers
were: 1,297 whole-time and 69 part-time probation officers in England and Wales,
14 whole-time and one part-time in Northern Ireland, and 120 whole-time and
34 part-time in Scotland. In London, the appointment of probation officers is the
responsibility of the Home Secretary; elsewhere it is the responsibility of probation
committees appointed by magistrates in England and Wales, and by local authori¬
ties in Scotland (except for certain ex officio members), but all appointments are
subject to confirmation by the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland
and theMinister of Home Affairs inNorthern Ireland, respectively. Training facilities
in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the advice of the Proba¬
tion Advisory and Training Board and are made available, by arrangement, to
Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland training is provided during the first year of
appointment and before the officer is allowed to make probation work his perma¬
nent career.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organized and controlled on a local basis
under the guidance of those Ministers of the Crown who are responsible for the
maintenance of law and order in their respective countries. In England and Wales
the responsible Minister is the Secretary of State for the Home Department (the
Home Secretary); in Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern
92
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ireland the police force (see p. 95) is controlled by an Inspector-General, who is
responsible to Northern Ireland’s Minister of Home Affairs.
POLICE IN GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
There are 126 separate, independent police forces in England and Wales, defined
according to area of responsibility as county forces, borough forces, combined
forces (which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over neighbouring
counties or boroughs), the Metropolitan Police Force (which is responsible for the
county of London, the county of Middlesex, parts of adjoining counties and three
county boroughs) and the City of London force. In Scotland there are 33 forces,
including county forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland, police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus, in 1957, the Metro¬
politan Police Force had a strength of 16,419, while that of the smallest force in
Scotland was 16.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain at the end of 1956 was
approximately 66,000 men and 2,200 women.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are the police of certain public ser¬
vices, e.g., the British Transport Commission Police, the Civil Aviation Constabu¬
lary, the Port of London Authority Police and other dock and harbour forces (who,
although not subject to the supervision of the Home Secretary or the Secretary of
State for Scotland, have duties and powers analogous to those of ordinary con¬
stables but limited to the premises and immediate neighbourhoods of their em¬
ployers), the police of the Service Departments, i.e. the Admiralty Constabulary,
the War Department Constabulary, which guards War Office lands and military
property, the Royal Marine Police, who are employed chiefly in dockyards, and
the Air Ministry Constabulary.
Police Authorities
In the counties of England and Wales the police authority is the Standing Joint
Committee, half of whose members are members of the county council while
the other half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs the police authority is
known as the Watch Committee and is elected by the council from its members.
The police authority of a combined force is made up of representatives of the
constituent areas as prescribed in the scheme under which they combine.
In the Metropolitan Police District the Home Secretary is the police authority.
In the City of London the Common Council is the police authority, although it
usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county or joint county
council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain efficient
police forces for their areas. They are also responsible for the appointment of the
chief officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary
in the provinces of England and Wales, to the approval of the Crown in the City of
London, and to the approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland. In
the Metropolitan Police District the chief officer of police and his immediate sub¬
ordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
93
Central Authority
Co-ordination and a certain measure of central control are exercised through
detailed police regulations which are issued for their respective countries by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are required by
the Police Act, 1919, ‘to act in consultation one with another’ in this connection.
The police regulations cover such matters as discipline, mutual aid, pay, allowances,
pensions, clothing, expenses and conditions of service of the members of all police
forces to which the Act applies.
The Secretaries of State are advised on questions relating to the conditions of
service of the police by the Police Council for Great Britain, a negotiating body,
representative on the one side of all ranks of the police service and on the other of
the police authorities, which was established in 1953. In their supervisory responsi¬
bilities they are assisted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary, who inspect
each force (except the Metropolitan Police Force) at least once a year. At the end
of 1956 there were four inspectors in England and Wales and one in Scotland.
Central control also derives from the fact that all police authorities receive a
Government grant equal to half their net expenditure reckoned in accordance with
the provisions of Orders made under the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act,
1950 (as regards England and Wales), and the Police (Scotland) Act, 1956 (as
regards Scotland). These Orders empower the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland to withhold the grant in whole or in part, permanently or for
such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police area is effi¬
ciently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered, or that the
rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Centrally Run Services
During recent years a number of common services have been established to
supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use. In England
and Wales such services include a training service, which provides a number of
residential district training centres and a central police college; an installation and
maintenance service of wireless equipment for the police; and a forensic service,
which provides laboratories for the use of regional groups of forces. In Scotland
there is a central police college, which provides training courses for recruits and
courses of higher training; but the installation and maintenance of wireless equip¬
ment is a direct charge upon the police authorities concerned and there is no centrally
run forensic science service. The Glasgow police force, however, operates an
extensive laboratory, the service of which is available to the whole of the Scottish
police, and the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews
render assistance when required.
A number of national services are provided by the Metropolitan Police Force,
whose functions in this respect include: (1) the maintenance of the central Criminal
Record Office, which is a national registry of criminals and crime, containing a
Central Fingerprint Bureau, the services of which are available to all police forces
of the United Kingdom and certain foreign forces; (2) the publication of the Police
Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people wanted for crime and details of
stolen property, and is supplied without charge to the police forces of the United
Kingdom and to certain Commonwealth and foreign forces; (3) the organization
and control of the Special Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department at
New Scotland Yard, whose duties include the protection of Royalty, Ministers of
1 A Scottish Police Gazette is published by the City of Glasgow Police Force.
94
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Crown, and distinguished foreign visitors; and (4) the carrying out of extradi¬
tion orders made by the courts. For certain of these services, the Metropolitan
Police Force receives an additional Exchequer grant.
Police Officers
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular police
officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension;
members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost entirely of police
pensioners or men with previous police experience who are prepared to give whole¬
time paid service to a particular force in an emergency, whether national or local;
members of the Special Constabulary, which consists of volunteers who perform
short periods of duty without pay in their spare time from their normal occupations.1
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 19 and 30, although an exception may be made in the case of ex-regular Navy,
Army and Air Force men of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in England
and Wales must be between the ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and
30 years old. The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and con¬
stable. The following intermediate ranks may also be adopted where the field of
operations renders them necessary: assistant chief constable, chief superintendent,
chief inspector and, in England and Wales only, station inspector, station sergeant
and acting sergeant. In the Metropolitan Police District the chief officer is the
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a Deputy Commis¬
sioner and four Assistant Commissioners. Next in rank are commanders, then
deputy commanders; thereafter (i.e. from chief superintendent downwards) the
ranks are the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are
the same as in the provinces except that the chief officer is called the Commissioner
of Police and the second in command is an Assistant Commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political bias,
but must also be seen to be free of it (see p. 284). The Police Act, 1919, however,
laid it down that the police should have a statutory representative organization of
their own. This is known in England and Wales as the Police Federation and in
Scotland as the Scottish Police Federation and all constables, sergeants and in¬
spectors belong to it. Any part of the organization can make representations to
the individual police authority, to the individual chief officer of police, or, in
England and Wales, to the Secretary of State for the Home Department and,
in Scotland, to the Secretary of State for Scotland. Delegates from the Joint Central
Committees of the two Federations sit on the Police Councils.
Police Duties
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office.
His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common law, are
exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself. Thus, unless acting in pursuance of a magistrate’s
warrant, a police officer is liable for any wrongful or mistaken action on his part,
for he is not the servant of the police authority, and in discharging his duties must
rely on his own discretion and his own knowledge of the law.
1 In Scotland, the employment of special constables, other than in emergencies, is sub¬
ject to strict limitations.
95
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
The manifold functions of a police officer as a constable range from road or street
patrolling and traffic control to criminal investigation (all county and county
borough police forces have their own criminal investigation departments) and
arresting persons committing offences or, in certain cases, under suspicion of act¬
ing in an unlawful way. In England and Wales (although not in Scotland where the
police investigate cases and report to the prosecutor) the police are responsible for
initiating, and in most cases conducting, prosecutions, except those which must be
dealt with by the Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e. if the offence is punishable
by death; or when an offence is referred to him by a Government Department,
subject to his discretion; or in any case which appears to the Director to be ot
importance or difficulty or which for any reason requires his intervention
In addition to their duties as constables, police officers may be required by the
police authority to carry out other duties connected with the police, e.g., t e
licensing and inspection of hackney carriages, but such duties have latterly been
considerably reduced.
Police Cadets
Many police forces offer training and employment in police offices and stations
to boys between school-leaving age and the age at which they may be called up tor
National Service. Selection is limited to boys who are likely to become useful
members of the Force. On completing their full-time National Service, or at the
age of 19 years if deferment of National Service is granted, the cadets are eligible
for appointment as constables. One police force has a cadet scheme for girls.
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Royal Ulster Constabulary
The general control of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which is a State force, is
vested in an Inspector-General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
The cost of the force is met from the Northern Ireland Exchequer, the County
Borough of Belfast contributing a token sum of £25,000 annually towards the cost
of policing the City of Belfast. , , f
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary at the end of 1956 was 2 7^
officers and men. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the lines of the
police service in Great Britain, the general duties pertaining to the tasks being
similar in all respects. . . _ _ 1 t 1 j
In addition to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, there exists in Northern Ireland an
auxiliary police force called the Ulster Special Constabulary, which is also under
the general control and direction of the Inspector-General. In the mam, this force
is a part-time force and its duties cover training and assistance to the regular force
on special occasions. If necessary, however, its part-time personnel may be
mobilized for full-time duty and its duties extended to cover ordinary police duties.
The strength of the Special Constabulary at the end of 1956 was 10,543 officers
and men.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organized on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control exercised by the Secretary of State for the ome
Department (in England and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland (in
Scotland) The fire services in Northern Ireland are described on pp. 98-99-
Every place throughout the United Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
96
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
FIRE SERVICES IN GREAT BRITAIN
At the end of 1956 there were 135 local authority fire brigades in England and
Wales and 11 in Scotland.
Fire Authorities
The responsibility for fire-fighting functions, which was vested in the two
Secretaries of State on a national basis as an emergency measure during the second
world war, was restored in 1948 to local government control under the Fire Services
Act, 1947- The effect of the Act was to transform the National Fire Service (estab¬
lished in 1941) into separate fire brigades administered, in England and Wales, by
the county or county borough councils, who were created the fire authorities for
their areas and were given powers and duties which they exercise either separately
or as combined authorities w'here neighbouring councils care to make such arrange¬
ments to increase the efficiency of the service. The Act provides that each fire
authority which is a county council (except London) must establish a fire brigade
committee, consisting of both county council members and representatives of the
county district councils in the county, to deal on the county council’s behalf with
matters concerning fire prevention and control. In Scotland, the local authorities are
grouped in eleven areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow,
where the town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is admini¬
stered by a joint committee representative of the councils of the counties and large
burghs in the area.
Central Control
The Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are empowered to make regulations prescribing such matters as conditions
of service, standards of efficiency and the organization of training in the local fire
brigades. In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding regulations
about conditions of service and similar matters) each Secretary of State is advised
bY a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the
local authority associations, representatives of the Chief Officers (Firemasters in
Scotland) and other members of the brigades, and other persons having special
qualifications for the purpose. The Advisory Councils are not concerned with the
conditions of service of members of the brigades. On these subjects the Secretaries
of State are advised by the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire
Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint Council for Chief Officers of
Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain.
Central control is also exercised through the Inspectors of Fire Services, whose
duties include advising the Secretaries of State on technical matters. At the end
of 1956 there were 11 inspectors and assistant inspectors in England and Wales
and one inspector and an assistant inspector in Scotland.
Establishment Schemes
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and loca¬
tion of fire stations and the number and type of vehicles and appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Details of establishment
schemes, which must be approved by each Secretary of State for his own country,
vary considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned; but in an English
county of about 500,000 acres and a mixed urban and rural population of some
/5o,ooo, for example, there might be 30 whole-time and part-time fire stations
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
97
equipped with 150 vehicles and appliances and served by a whole-time force of
approximately 250 and a part-time force of approximately 400 officers and me .
PIt is the duty of each fire authority to purchase such vehicles and equipment as
are required under the establishment scheme. Equipment is standardized, an
appliances are bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications which ensure
that essential standards are maintained, and yet allow sufficient freedom of design
to meet local requirements and further developments.
Operational Methods . . ...
Each fire authority is required to appoint a chief officer (firemaster in Scotian )
to be the chief administrative and executive officer for the fire services in its area.
The appointment must be ratified in England and Wales by the Secretary of State
for the Home Department and in Scotland by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The chief officer or firemaster is responsible to the fire authority for seeing tha
both the fire brigade and the fire department (which is the administrative centre
and staff headquarters for the fire brigade) are organized and managed m accordance
with policy laid down. ... n
Operational control is centralized at headquarters; but it is generally exercised
on a more local basis by divisional officers, in charge of geographical divisions into
which most areas are divided for the purpose. Each divisional officer has at h
disposal a small staff of whole-time, and a varying number of part-time, officers
and men; and he is responsible for mobilizing this force in the strength necessary
for dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters; and if at any time an
outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional force, help is
sent from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area or even from the area of
another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire
authorities the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless ot
area boundaries.
Firemen
Firemen in Great Britain include: whole-time firemen; part-time firemen
either ‘retained’ firemen, who undertake, in return for a small retaining fee, to
attend fires if they are called upon to do so, or ‘volunteer firemen, who receive
no remuneration; auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as part of the local authority
civil defence organization as members of individual brigades under the command
of chief officers or firemasters, and whose activities are restricted (except in a
war emergency) to such duties as are desirable for training; and members of fire¬
fighting organizations with specialized functions, which are outside the scope of
the 19^ Ac" e.g., those maintained by the War Office, the Air Ministry, the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and by some of the more importan
industrial and commercial concerns. , . r ^
Ranks in the fire services (for men) are chief officer, assistant chief officer (fi -
master and assistant firemaster in Scotland), divisional officer, assistant ^visional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. Ranks in the
women’s branch, which is mainly concerned with controls, administrative ckit
and duties of a clerical nature, are (for Great Britain as a whole) group officer,
assistant group officer, senior leading firewoman, leading firewoman, and fire-
woman. Promotion in the lower ranks of the fire-fighting forces is by examination
and by merit, and in the higher ranks by merit only. . 1 or,rl
Training for full-time firemen in England and Wales includes practical and
theoretical instruction given to recruits at a training school, which is run either by
98
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the fire authority itself or by a neighbouring authority, and refresher courses for
firemen, arranged by fire departments. The training of recruits and junior ranks
in Scotland is carried out at a central training school which is the responsibility
of the Scottish Home Department. Courses for officers and potential officers of
fire authority brigades are held at the Fire Service College, at Wotton House,
near Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home Department as the central training institution for the fire services.
Finance
Every fire authority is required to submit to the Home Secretary or to the
Secretary of State for Scotland an annual statement showing its expenditure and
income in connection with the provision of fire services during the preceding year.
The Government pays a grant of 25 per cent of the net expenditure approved by
the Home Office or the Scottish Home Department, less an annual contribution
towards the expenses of the Fire Service College (and in Scotland a contribution
towards the Scottish Central Training School); the rest of the money is raised
from local authority funds.
Research
The principal means by which research on fire prevention and fire-fighting is
carried on is the Joint Fire Research Organization, the cost of which is shared
equally between the Government and the Fire Offices’ Committee (a committee
of the insurance companies dealing in fire risks). The Organization makes con¬
tinuing research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire-fighting and controls a
Fire Research Station at which practical tests are carried out.
FIRE SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The fire authorities in Northern Ireland, as established by the Fire Services
(Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, are the Belfast Corporation, which
controls the Belfast Fire Brigade and is responsible for the area inside the city
boundary, and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which covers the rest of the
country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an establish¬
ment of 190 officers and men manning 12 appliances, while the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry and 42 other stations
throughout the remainder of the area, and an establishment of 89 whole-time
officers and men and 681 part-time firemen, manning 68 appliances.
Ranks of Firemen
The ranks of firemen in Northern Ireland are: for the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority fire force commander, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer,
senior company officer, company officer, section leader (retained brigades only)’
leading fireman and fireman; and for the Belfast Fire Brigade—chief officer, divi¬
sional officer grade 2, divisional officer grade 3, assistant divisional officer, station
officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. There are only a few women in
the Northern Ireland fire services, all of the rank of firewoman.
Finance
The Fire Services (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1956, provides that
the amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire Authority
should be 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure which
99
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
do not exceed £60,000, and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which the loan
charges exceed £60,000, together with 50 per cent of the first £150,000 of other
net expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that amount. Expenditure in
excess of the fire service grant is apportioned among the constituent local authori¬
ties. Under the Fire Services Acts the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for the
payment of fire service grant.
III. DEFENCE
THE DEFENCE SYSTEM
An adequate general survey of the principles which govern United Kingdom
defence policy is possible only in the wider context of the United Kingdom’s inter¬
national relationships, its place in the Commonwealth and in world affairs, and its
responsibilities towards British dependent and protected territories—subjects
which, as explained in the Introduction, fall outside the scope of this handbook.
This chapter, therefore, can attempt little more than an outline of the present
pattern of development of Britain’s armed forces.
DEFENCE POLICY
The national defence policy has been increasingly based on the realization that,
with the formidable new weapons of mass destruction, no country can protect
itself in isolation and the defence of Britain is possible only as part of a system of
collective defence arrangements. Policy is therefore determined largely by Britain’s
obligations to contribute to the collective defence organizations of which it is a
member—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Western European Union,
the Bagdad Pact, the SEATO and ANZAM defence systems in South-East Asia—
as well as to discharge its own special responsibilities in many parts of the world:
and defence planning is carried out in close co-operation with Britain’s partners
in these organizations with the aim of creating integrated allied forces.
Close liaison is maintained with other Commonwealth countries, between whose
forces there is considerable standardization of equipment, weapons and training
techniques and interchange of personnel; regular Service conferences are held and
there is intimate co-operation over regional planning and strategy.
At the same time the United Kingdom continues to work for the attainment of
international agreement on the control of all forms of armaments.
Machinery of Higher Defence Planning
The Queen is the titular head of all the armed forces. Decisions on broad lines
of defence policy are matters for the Cabinet as a whole. The Minister of Defence
determines the shape and size of the defence forces necessary to put this policy into
effect. Under the general direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, of
which he is a member, the Minister is answerable for the ‘ formulation and general
application of a unified policy relating to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole
and their requirements’. Supreme control is in the hands of Parliament, which
makes annual financial provision for defence needs. By limiting provision to the
current year, Parliament ensures an annual review of the state of each Service.
The Minister of Defence answers for all matters of policy common to the three
fighting Services—the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force—and their
supply. He is responsible for the apportionment of available resources between
them and for seeing that the composition and balance of forces within each Service
xoo
DEFENCE
IOI
accord with strategic policy. Each of the three Service Ministers the First Lord
of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War (who deals with the Army), and
the Secretary of State for Air—is responsible to Parliament for the administration
of his own Service; and the Minister of Supply is similarly responsible for the
Service supplies procured by his Department. The Chiefs of Staff Committee,
which comprises the professional heads of the three Services with a chairman who
is Chief of Staff to the Minister of Defence, is responsible for preparing and
advising upon strategic plans and policy for consideration by the Minister of
Defence and the Cabinet. Policy within each Service is controlled by an administra¬
tive directorate: the Board of Admiralty, the Army Council and the Air Council,
each headed by the responsible Minister.
In addition to his co-ordinating functions, the Minister of Defence also has
responsibility for certain inter-Service organizations such as Amphibious Warfare
Headquarters, the Joint Intelligence Bureau, the Joint Services Staff College, and
the Imperial Defence College.
Britain’s defence policy is reviewed in the annual Statement on Defence pre¬
sented each spring to Parliament by the Minister of Defence immediately before
the detailed Estimates of the Service Departments. The statement outlines the
programmes of the three Services for the ensuing year and summarizes the
proposed defence budget.
In 1957, in place of the usual annual Statement, a White Paper Defence: Outline
of Future Policy, Cmnd. 124, set out a five-year plan for the reshaping of the defence
forces in the light of changes in the international situation, the rapid progress in
military technology, and the need to relieve the burden which defence require¬
ments had been imposing on the country’s financial and economic strength. This
programme, described as involving ‘the biggest change in military policy ever
made in normal times ’ is now being put into effect. Details of its application to
the individual Services are still being worked out and the changes will come into
effect gradually. A Defence Administration Committee, composed of the Permanent
Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Supply and the three
Service Departments, together with Service members of the Board of Admiralty
and of the Army and Air Councils, has been set up to carry out a comprehensive
review of the administrative machinery and to eliminate overlapping between the
Services.
The Long-term Plan
Britain’s armed forces, the 1957 White Paper stated, must be able to perform
two main tasks:
(1) ‘to play their part with the forces of allied countries in deterring and
resisting aggression;
(2) ‘ to defend British colonies and protected territories against local attack,
and undertake limited operations in overseas emergencies.
* The aim must be to provide well-equipped forces sufficient to carry out these
duties, while making no greater demands than are absolutely necessary upon
manpower, money, and other national resources.’
The new plan provides for smaller, highly trained, mobile all-regular forces
equipped with the most modem weapons and organized on up-to-date lines. To
permit reductions in the numbers of men maintained in all the various places over¬
seas where Britain has defence responsibilities, there will be a central reserve and

it’, priority is given to the production of deterrents—nuclear weapons and the
means to deliver them—though it is emphasized that conventional forces armed
with conventional weapons will still be essential. It is not the intention to rely
exclusively on nuclear weapons for all purposes.
The intention is that there should be no further call-up of men for National
Service (see pp. 103—5) after the end of i960 and that by the end of 1962 the armed
forces should become wholly regular and nearly halved. If, however, voluntary
recruiting fails to produce the numbers required it may be necessary to have some
limited form of compulsory service after 1962. During the year ending April 1958,
the adult male strength is being reduced from 690,000 to about 625,000.1 The
rate of run-down in later years will depend on the international situation and the
requirements of the regional defence organizations of which Britain is a member.
The aim is to stabilize at a strength of about 375,000 adult males by the end of 1962.
DEFENCE AND THE ECONOMY
The shape of the defence forces as they existed at the time of the 1957 White
Paper was the result largely of the rearmament programme launched at the time of
the Korean war in 1950. After the end of the second world war the strength of the
armed forces had been drastically reduced. It was not until growing world tension
made it inevitable that this trend was first halted and then reversed. Following the
outbreak of war in Korea, the United Kingdom embarked on a programme for
building up its defence forces, which originally envisaged the spending of £4,700
million over three years.
Between 1950 and 1953 annual defence expenditure was nearly doubled, rising
to some £1,400 million in 1952-53, and over the same period the total strength
of the active forces increased from just under 700,000 to a peak of about 875,000
at the beginning of 1953. With the end of hostilities in Korea, the programme was
revised to meet the changed conditions and to keep it within the limits of the
country’s economic resources in the face of rising costs. In place of a short rearma¬
ment spurt there was substituted the policy of the ‘ long haul ’; the programme was
slowed down and spread over a longer period, and some further modifications were
made in subsequent annual reviews.
Nevertheless the burden on the economy continued heavy. Over the five years
1952—56, defence absorbed on average 10 per cent of Britain s gross national pro¬
duct. In 1956, some 7 per cent of the working population were either in the Services
or supporting them, and one-eighth of the output of the metal-using industries
vital to the economy as a main source of exports—was devoted to defence. The
very heavy cost of maintaining large British forces abroad (which in 1956 involved
expenditure of some £178 million in foreign currency) placed a severe strain on the
balance of payments. The total net defence budget, at £i,500 million in i956—57
(after allowing for receipts from United States aid under the Mutual Security
Programme and German contributions to the cost of British forces stationed on
the Continent as part of the NATO forces), equalled one-third of total Central
Government current ordinary expenditure.
Current Defence Budget
The gross estimates for 1957-58 totalled £1,483 million (as against about £1,600
million for 1956-57, which would have risen to about £1,700 million for i957_58
had the programme been allowed to continue unchanged). From this total must

be deducted the German contribution towards the United Kingdom forces
stationed on the Continent and United States defence aid, which were expected
to be about £50 million and £13 million respectively, giving a net estimate of
about £1,420 million. Taking into account the reduced receipts expected from the
United States and Germany the reduction in net cost compared with 1956-5?
is £?8i million. Because of the increasing complication of modern weapons and
equipment and the higher cost per man of regular forces, expenditure in later
years will not show a reduction proportionate to that in the manpower strength.

The Ministry of Defence estimate consists mainly of contributions to inter¬
national defence organizations, including contributions to the NATO common
infrastructure programmes.1
Defence expenditure by civil Departments in 1957-58 (including loan expendi¬
ture by the Post Office) was estimated at £21-9 million.
MANPOWER
Each of the three fighting Services is at present made up of a combination of
voluntary recruited regulars and men called up for National Service, and each
includes a corps of women volunteers who form part of the regular forces. An
analysis of the strength of the forces in April i957> with estimates for 1958, is
given in Table 6.
In addition, reserve and auxiliary forces with training liability (volunteers and
part-time National Service men) totalled 596,500 at 1st April, 1957-
Arrangements for recruitment and training of regulars are summarized for each
Service separately later in this chapter. An increase in regular recruiting, especially
for the Army, will be necessary to achieve an all-regular footing by 1962. Steps
are being taken to improve the conditions of Service life. A Regular Forces Resettle¬
ment Service has been set up by the Minister of Labour to assist Regular officers
and other ranks to find civilian employment on leaving the forces.
National Service
Compulsory military service in peace time was first introduced in Britain in
1939, shortly before the outbreak of the second world war. Under the National
1‘NATO common infrastructure’ has been defined as capital investment in basic
facilities, such as airfields, signals systems, headquarters, etc., designed for common use.
By March 1957, shared expenditure under the infrastructure programmes amounted to
about £400 million and further programmes had been agreed for implementation by 1961
which, it was estimated, would bring the total to about £1,000 million. 1 he L nited
Kingdom is contributing 11J per cent of the cost of the programmes.

Note: (i) Figures for the Navy include the Royal Marines.
(2) The estimated strength figures of the Army and R.A.F. at 1st April, 1958,
cannot as yet be divided between Regulars and National Service men.
Service Acts, 1948-50, fit male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 26
ordinarily resident in Great Britain are liable (with certain limited exceptions) to
serve for two years in one of the armed forces.1 After this period of full-time service
they must serve for a period of 3^ years with one of the reserve forces, giving in all
5^ years of whole-time and part-time service. During the latter period they may be
called upon to undergo up to 60 days’ training in all, if required, but not more than
21 days in any year. In addition, National Service men called up before 31st
December, 1953, remain statutorily liable, on completion of their 5! years’ National
Service liability, to recall as reservists up to 30th June, i959> but are not required
to carry out training during this latter period of reserve liability.
Men employed in certain occupations are granted deferment of National Service,
in the national interest, for as long as they are engaged in those occupations. This
provision applies to men in certain coalmining occupations, merchant seamen, sea¬
going fishermen who are members of the Royal Naval Reserve (Patrol Service),
regular whole-time agricultural workers whose call-up would mean a loss in food
production, crofters, some graduate teachers, a small number of highly skilled
scientists and engineers engaged on work of high priority or on fundamental
research, a very small number of shale oil underground workers, and a limited
number of police cadets.
Deferment for a limited period is granted to students and apprentices to enable
them to undertake or complete approved courses of full-time studies or training.
Postponement of call-up may also be granted on ground of exceptional domestic,
business or other hardship.
Men registering as conscientious objectors are subject to the decisions of local
tribunals of impartial persons appointed by the Minister of Labour and National
Service, with the right of appeal to an appellate tribunal.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service calls up the men from civil life
for registration and medical inspection, and allots them to the Services. The Army
is by far the biggest user of National Service men. In 1957 nearly half the Army’s

case of men absent from Great Britain in the last year of their liability. The National
Service Acts operate for a limited period and they do not apply to men bom after 1940.

active male strength was provided by National Service men as against about 30
per cent of the Royal Air Force and less than 9 per cent of the Royal Navy.
In October 1955, the Government announced its decision to reduce the size of
the active forces (then nearly 800,000) to about 700,000 by March 1958, by slowing
down the rate of call-up for National Service and allowing the general age of call-up
to rise from 18 to 19 years. It was also stated that, in general, it would not be neces¬
sary to require National Service men, who have a maximum liability for 60 days’
training during their 3J years’ part-time service, to do more than 20 days
training in all. In the spring of 195?, the decision was taken to plan on the basis
that the reduced manpower required under the new defence plan could be obtained
by voluntary recruitment and that there would be no further call-up for National
Service after the end of i960. The last National Service men will therefore be due
to complete their full-time service by the end of 1962.
During the run-down period not all those men liable for service will be required,
and the intake will be diminished by further slowing down the rate of call-up. It
is intended to rely as far as possible on men in the age-groups already called up
who had been granted deferment to enable them to complete training or studies;
they will be called up after completing their courses and will be supplemented by
younger men, mainly those not eligible for deferment. Men born after the third
quarter of 1939 are unlikely to be called up.

Staff Colleges
Co-operation between the fighting Services is illustrated in the system of staff
training for selected officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force. After about 10
years’ service, they are sent to separate staff colleges at Greenwich (London),
Camberley (Surrey), and Bracknell, Berkshire (or Andover, Hampshire), respec¬
tively, where they learn the elements of staff work. At a later stage in their careers
selected officers from the three Services go to the Joint Services Staff College at
Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where they live and work together and w here particular
attention is paid to the inter-Service aspects of staff work. This College caters for
about a hundred and fifty students a year from the Navy, Army and Air Force,
the Civil Service and the Commonwealth. Finally, there is the Imperial Defence
College in London, which caters for a few specially selected and more senior
officers from the Services, the Civil Service and the Commonwealth.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
The Ministry of Supply is responsible for the procurement of all weapons and
equipment used by the Army and Air Force. It is also responsible for the procure¬
ment of aircraft, some guns and ammunition, guided weapons and a certain amount
of miscellaneous equipment used by the Royal Navy. The Admiralty is responsible
for the procurement of ships and associated equipment.
Production and Research
Production for the Services is carried out to a great extent by private industry
on a contract basis, but also by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dock¬
yards and other establishments operated by the Ministry of Supply and the
Admiralty. The Ministry of Supply’s research establishments carry out research
and development on behalf of the War Office and Air Ministry, and also for certain
aspects of Admiralty requirements, in particular naval aviation. Among the most
important of these establishments are: the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farn-
borough; the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern; the National Gas Turbine
Establishment, Farnborough; and the Guided Weapons Establishment at Aberporth,
Cardiganshire. The Admiralty has its own research establishments which carry out
research on ships and maritime equipment and also on certain kinds of electronic
equipment on behalf of all three Services. Current production and development
programmes are summarized later in this chapter in the sections dealing with the
three Services individually.
Production of and research on nuclear warheads to meet Service requirements
are carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority (see pp. 414-6) under contract from
the Ministry of Supply, which is responsible for the completed weapons. The
Authority is also co-operating with the Admiralty in research on the development
of nuclear propulsion (see p. 108).
Service officers attend courses at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment,
Harwell, and have also been attached to industrial firms manufacturing guided
weapons during the development stage.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Supply’s research establishments
and at the Woomera range set up in Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/
Australia Guided Weapon Project. Sendee firing trials will be carried out at the
Inter-Service Guided Weapon Establishment which is being established on South
Uist in the Hebrides. There is close collaboration with the United States in the
exchange of information and of visits by technical personnel.
Some military equipment, including guided weapons, aircraft and radar equip¬
ment, is being supplied to Britain by the United States under the Mutual Security
Programme. Part of this equipment is manufactured in the United Kingdom and
financed by the United States under the ‘off-shore procurement’ programme.
Under this programme the United Kingdom is also making equipment for other
NATO countries in Europe. The total value of such contracts placed in the United
Kingdom to the end of 1956 was $717 million.
Ships are also constructed for Commonwealth countries in the Royal Naval
dockyards and some ships from the Royal Navy have been lent or sold to Common¬
wealth navies.
Nuclear Weapons
During the second world war, British research workers played an essential part
in the allied project that led to the production of the first atomic bombs in the
United States. After the war, an Act of the United States Congress1 prohibited
1 The Atomic Energy Act, 1946, known as the MacMahon Act.
DEFENCE
107
the exchange of information on atomic weapons and the United Kingdom decided
to develop its own independently. The first test explosion of a British atomic
weapon was carried out in 1952 in the Monte Bello Islands off the north-west
coast of Australia; further tests took place a year later near the Woomera rocket
range in Central Australia, and early in i954 it was announced that delivery ot
atomic weapons to the armed forces had begun. Two more series of tests were held
in 19s6 in the Monte Bello Islands and at the weapons proving ground at Maralinga
in the South Australian Desert. Atomic bombs are now in steady production in
Britain and the Royal Air Force holds a substantial number of them.
In February 1955, the Government announced its intention to begin the develop¬
ment and production of thermo-nuclear weapons. The first test explosions were
successfully carried out in May and June 1957 near Christmas Island in the central
Pacific j.
The chief means of delivering these weapons are at present the RAF’s medium
bombers of the V-class; they will be supplemented by ballistic rockets.
THE FIGHTING SERVICES
THE ROYAL NAVY
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty. The First Lord of the
Admiralty is the minister responsible to Parliament for the Navy. TIm other nine
members of the Board are the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, who is the
professional head of the Service and is a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee,
the Second Sea Lord and Chief of Personnel; the Third Sea Lord and Controller
of the Navy, responsible for engineering, equipment, ordnance, and research; t e
Fourth Sea Lord and Chief of Supplies and Transport; the Deputy Chief of Naval
Staff and Fifth Sea Lord, responsible for air matters and for questions of tactics,
technical policy and fighting efficiency; the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff responsible
for operations, intelligence and plans; the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary,
the Civil Lord; and the Permanent Secretary, who is a civil servant and responsible
for the general conduct of Admiralty business.
The Shape of the Fleet
When rearmament started in 1950, the Admiralty gave particular attention to
the need to build up anti-submarine and minesweeping forces, and to expand t e
Fleet Air Arm; and priority was given to construction work which wou d s ow
quick results. The building of aircraft carriers and ‘ Daring Class escort ships
already in hand was therefore pressed forward as quickly as possible and a large
programme of modernization and conversion of ships and a much increased
building programme were started. , . ,
By the beginning of 1957 a strong force of new and modernized carriers was
being built up; eight ‘Daring’ class escorts (larger and more heavily armed than
the older destroyers) had joined the fleet; the frigate building programme had
made good progress and the minesweeper building programme was almost com¬
pleted ; and several new submarines were in commission including Britain s rst
experimental high-speed submarine Explorer (see photograph facing P- io3)-
The new defence plans envisage a Navy that is smaller than in the past but highly
mobile. The main elements will be based on a small number of carrier groups,
each composed of one aircraft carrier and a number of supporting ships. Apart
from carriers, the number of large ships will be restricted to the minimum. Cruisers
will in due course be replaced by ships of the ‘Tiger’ class, now under construc¬
tion For smaller vessels the policy will be to have fewer but more modern ships,
io8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
some of which will be equipped with guided missiles. Many ships in reserve,
including battleships, are being disposed of.
The modem carriers are being equipped with the angled flight deck, the steam
catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device, and the mirror and ‘Audio ’ land¬
ing aids (all British inventions), and the new arrester gear. A new carrier, Hermes, is
under construction. In the spring of 1957 there were in the active Fleet four front¬
line carriers—Ark Royal, Eagle, Albion and Bulwark; a fifth, Warrior, was employed
on special trials and a sixth, Ocean, on training. Two others, Victorious and Centaur,
were being modernized.
The first ‘Tiger’ class cruisers, with fully automatic guns and latest control
equipment, are expected to start trials early in 1959. Four new-design escort vessels
larger than present types are on order and will be fitted with a ship-to-air guided
missile, the Sea Slug.
Guided weapon trials have been carried out on the experimental ship Girdle Ness.
One of the main purposes of the Reserve Fleet is to have ready, at short notice,
ships to replace those in the Active Fleet which are damaged or withdrawn for
refit or modernization. Under the new defence policy the Reserve Fleet is to be
smaller than in the past but is being maintained at a higher state of readiness.
Afloat support to the Fleet for replenishment at sea, or in harbours or anchorages,
is provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service, comprising tankers, store issuing
ships, tugs and salvage vessels. These ships fly the Blue Ensign and are manned
by Merchant Navy officers and seamen.
Research and Development
Among recent developments, important research has been carried out on guided
missiles and on the application of nuclear propulsion both to submarines and to
surface vessels; studies have been made of methods of protection of ships against
nuclear attack; there have been advances with submarine detectors and locators;
techniques for the detection and location of mines, and methods of sweeping them,
have improved; and further progress has been made in the development of radio
communications. Plans are in hand for the construction of a prototype nuclear
propulsion submarine to be named the Dreadnought.
Stations
The Navy’s commands in home waters are Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham,
Rosyth in Scotland and the Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet. Abroad, the com¬
mand structure has been reorganized and several of the former stations have been
merged with others. The Mediterranean station, with headquarters in Malta and
with Gibraltar as a secondary base, covers the Red Sea (but not Aden) as well as
the Mediterranean. The East Indies Station broadly covers the Indian Ocean.
The Far East Fleet operates from Singapore, with a second base at Hong Kong.
The former America and West Indies Station was abolished in 1957. In the North
Atlantic, command arrangements were integrated with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the former Commander-in-Chief of this station was translated to
the NATO post of Deputy Supreme Commander, Atlantic; United Kingdom
possessions and interests in the Caribbean were covered by the creation of a
smaller West Indies Station under a Senior Naval Officer who flies his pennant
afloat; and a combined South Atlantic and South America Station was formed
whose Commander-in-Chief, when not afloat, flies his flag at Cape Town.
The navies of other Commonwealth nations operate in their respective areas
from their home bases, the use of which is made available to the Royal Navy at
the discretion of their Governments.
DEFENCE
109
Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham, Rosyth, Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore and .
Hong Kong are also dockyards for the Navy with major supply and repair facili¬
ties. There are also a number of naval air stations at home and abroa .
A programme to modernize the Royal Dockyards in the United Kingdom and
to reconstruct those damaged in the second world war, was put in hand in 1954 55
and was expected to extend over four or five years.
Fleet Air Arm
The Hawker Sea Hawk and the de Havilland Sea Venom provide the day and
all-weather fighter strengths of the Fleet Air Arm, but they are ^ shortly to be
succeeded respectively by the Scimitar (N. 113), fitted with a flap-blowing
system to facilitate landing and take-off from carriers, and the Sea Vixen (DH 10),
with armament which includes an air-to-air guided weapon, the Firestreak.
The anti-submarine turbo-prop Fairey Gannet has been in service since 1954.
A new strike aircraft, the Blackburn NA 39, is being developed to replace the
Wyvern; it has a greater range and speed and is able to carry an atomic bom .
British-built helicopters, the Whirlwind and the Widgeon, are now in service with
the Fleet Air Aurm.
Royal Marines
The Corps of Royal Marines is a body of men trained for service on sea or land.
Its official existence^dates from .664. The present-day funct.ons Co^ps am
, To supply detachments for HM ships, which (a) man a proportion of the

2. To provide personnel for the Commando Brigade.
3. To provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties icquire
for amphibious assault.
Women’s Royal Naval Service
The Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) is an integral part of the Naval
Service. Its members serve both at home and overseas. It has its own disciplinary
code.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Navy
The main entry for Naval officers is the cadet-entry. Cadetships are available
to young men between the ages of approximately 17 and 19, and those selected
except Electrical Branch cadets, spend two years at the Britannia Royal Naval
College Dartmouth, after which they join the Fleet as Acting Sub-Lieutenants.
Cadets training in electrical engineering spend one year at Dartmouth and en
take a three-year course up to honours degree standard at a university.
Short service commissions as pilot or observer in the Fleet Air Arm are open to
young men between the ages of i7 and 26, and those accepted have opportunities
of obtaining a permanent commission. Doctors, dental surgeons and mstructo
officers all enter on short service commissions after completing their professional
tuning, and permanent commissions are awarded to them according to vacancies
^Commissions in the Royal Marines are gained through the same examination
as are cadetships in the Royal Navy, and successful candidates are given a special
training, part naval and part military, which lasts three years.
The age limits for entry as a rating in the Navy are as follows, seaman branc ,
1 Si to 23; artificer apprentices, 15 to i7; communications, engineering naval air¬
man electrical, and supply and secretariat branches, 16I to 23; sick berth branc ,
no
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
17^ to 23; artificers (trained), 19! to 28. The initial engagement is for a period of
9 years except for artificer apprentices, for whom it is 12 years. Age limits for entry
into the ranks of the Royal Marines are: marines, 17 to 23; boy buglers, 15 to 15!;
boy or recruit musicians, 14 to 18; musicians (trained), 17! to 23. Women may
enter the Women’s Royal Naval Service between the ages of 18 and 28 and most
WRNS officers are selected from serving ratings.
On entry, all Naval and WRNS ratings and Royal Marines other ranks are given
a basic training at the appropriate school or shore establishment and are given
‘ refresher ’ courses at regular intervals during their time in the Service.
Reserve and Auxiliary Forces
The principal naval reserve forces are the Royal Fleet Reserve (RFR) composed
of men who have completed their service as regulars; the Royal Naval Reserve
(RNR), consisting of officers and men of the Merchant Navy who volunteer to
serve in the Royal Navy in war; the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR),
whose members voluntarily undertake part-time training for various aspects of
naval service (its Air Divisions have been disbanded); the Royal Naval Special
Reserve which includes most of the National Service men who are discharging their
liability for part-time service; the Royal Marines Forces Volunteer Reserve
(RMFVR) and the Women's Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (WRNVR) which are
the Royal Marines’ and WRNS’s counterparts of the RNVR. Behind these fully
trained reserves, available to meet immediate needs on mobilization, is the vast
background of officers and men with past war-time and peace-time service in the
Royal Navy who are liable, if still fit for service, to recall in the event of war.
Royal Naval Mine watching Service
The RNMWS, a civilian organization composed of men and women volunteers,
is responsible in time of war for manning posts around the coast and overlooking
the main navigable waterways. Its object would be to spot mines dropped from
aircraft, and to plot and report their positions.
Sea Cadet Corps
The Sea Cadet Corps, which is administered by the Navy League in conjunction
with the Admiralty, is the oldest pre-Service movement for boys in Britain, its
origin dating from the time of the Crimean War in the mid-nineteenth century.
Its aim is to give technical training to, and instil naval tradition in, boys under the
age of 18 who intend to serve in the Royal and Merchant Navies and also to those
sea-minded boys who do not intend to follow a sea career but will, given this
knowledge, form a valuable reserve for the Navy. It also aims to provide for the
social and educational welfare of the cadets and to develop character and good
citizenship.
THE ARMY
The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary
of State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council are the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial Secretary of the
War Office, who performs parliamentary duties, and the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for War, a civil servant who acts as secretary to the Council.
The military members of the Army Council comprise the Chief of the Imperial
General Staff; the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who is responsible
for strategic policy and plans, operations and intelligence; the Deputy Chief of
the Imperial General Staff, responsible for war organization, equipment, weapons

and training; the Adjutant-General to the Forces, responsible for manpower,
personnel, discipline, medical services, welfare, education, and the women’s ser¬
vices; and the Quartermaster-General to the Forces, responsible for supplies,
transport, and works services.
Organization of the Active Army
The Army is organized in thirty-one arms and services, which include the House¬
hold Cavalry, the Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic
Cavalry Regiments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery,
the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides land
and wireless communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Brigade of
Guards), the Infantry of the Line (grouped into 14 brigades and the Parachute
Regiment), the Royal Army Service Corps, responsible for the provision of food
and fuel supplies and transport vehicles, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, res¬
ponsible for most other equipment and stores, the Corps of Royal Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers, and the Royal Army Medical Corps.
The Women's Royal Army Corps (formerly the ATS) is a corps in the Regular
Army, the officers and other ranks of which, with minor exceptions and modifica¬
tions,’are subject to the Army Act and Queen’s Regulations to the same extent
as members of any other corps.
The Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps is also a corps of the Regular
Army and provides the nursing services within the Army.
Within the United Kingdom, the Army is organized into commands and districts
as follows: Scottish, Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, London District, and
Northern Ireland District. There are three main commands overseas: Middle
East Land Forces, Far East Land Forces, and the British Army of the Rhine
(which forms part of Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces).
The reduction which is taking place in the Army s manpower is involving a
considerable reorganization which is not yet complete. Trials have been carried
out in the British Army of the Rhine to determine what should in the future be
the basic field formation in nuclear war and it is probable that this will take the
form of flexible, self-contained infantry and armoured brigade groups, able to
fight, to move and to maintain themselves under minimum direction from head¬
quarters.
As the strengths of overseas garrisons are reduced, increased importance is
being attached to the Central Reserve in the United Kingdom, which has been
reconstituted and is organized for either limited or global war. Steps are being
taken to ensure that elements of the central reserve can be moved overseas to any
point of danger by air and at short notice.
Headquarters in the United Kingdom have been reduced in numbers and size
and the Coast Artillery has been disbanded.
Equipment
By the end of the five-year programme initiated in 1957 the weapons of the
1939—45 war will have almost completely disappeared and the Aimy will be com¬
pletely rearmed. With the development of nuclear weapons, attention is being
given to the need to increase mobility without loss of fighting capacity and, in
the interests of economy, the aim is to simplify the Army s equipment as much
as possible and ‘ to produce a family of weapons with no overlapping members .
The programme of rearmament launched in 195° concentrated at first on the
production of tanks and other armoured vehicles, infantry weapons, and modernized
engineering and signal equipment. The Army was equipped with a complete new
112
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
range of wheeled vehicles and with large numbers of the Centurion medium tank,
which proved outstandingly successful during the Korean war. Production was
also begun of a heavy gun tank, the Conqueror, which by 1957 had undergone
Service trials. The 1957-58 production programme also includes home production
of the FN self-loading rifle, a weapon of Belgian origin adopted by the United
Kingdom in the interests of standardization with other NATO forces, which is
in service in large numbers and has fully come up to expectations; large-scale
production of a new sub-machine gun to replace the Sten and the development of
a possible replacement for the Vickers medium machine gun; a powerful armoured
car, the Saladirr, a versatile scout car, the Ferret; a new and lighter anti-tank
weapon; a new light anti-aircraft gun, the L. 70, with improved radar fire control;
and a new medium tank in an advanced state of design. A new range of radio
equipment is reported to be giving a performance greatly superior to previous
systems.
Progress is being made in the introduction of surface-to-surface guided weapons,
the first of which are being supplied by the United States. The first guided weapon
course was started at the Royal Military College of Science in Wiltshire as early
as 1950. In 1955, groups of Army instructors began to receive training in the United
States in the use of the Corporal guided missile; training in Britain is now given
at the School of Artillery at Larkhill. Formation of the first guided missile regiment
began in the spring of 1957 and it was planned to raise a second regiment in the
course of the year. An anti-tank guided weapon is under development. For anti¬
aircraft protection for armies in the field, surface-to-air guided weapons are being
developed and a production order has been placed for the English Electric
Thunderbird, which will provide training with this type of weapon, and which can
deal with targets at a wide range of altitudes.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Army
The normal method of entry for a regular commission in the Army is through
the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey), where selected
cadets undergo a course lasting two years before receiving their commissions. 1 his
course gives a general military and academic background for all arms and services,
and young officers on leaving Sandhurst then attend special Arm Courses to pre¬
pare them for their own arm, some attending Technical Courses at the Royal
Military College of Science (Shrivenham, Wiltshire) and at Cambridge University.
Cadets may enter Sandhurst direct from school or after they have enlisted in the
Army or been called up for National Service.
The War Office also maintains a boarding school, known as Welbeck College,
at Worksop, Nottinghamshire, where 150 boys are educated for two years between
the ages of 16 and 18 years. These boys pass into Sandhurst at the end of their
school course and are normally commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals,
Royal Army Ordnance Corps or Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers. A few may be commissioned into the Royal Engineers.
University graduates may be accepted for direct regular commissions.
A small number of schoolboys are selected to take engineering or science degrees
at the Royal Military College of Science as National Service officers and thereafter
to be granted regular commissions. Regular commissions may also be granted to
other officers already serving on National Service commissions or on Short Service
commissions. Candidates for National Service commissions are trained at the
Officer Cadet Schools, Eaton Hall, Chester, or Mons Barracks, Aldershot, depend¬
ing on the arm or service for which they are selected. At these schools the course,
which consists of purely military training, lasts for four months.
DEFENCE
US
Men wishing to enlist in the ranks must be British subjects between the ages of
17^ and 30 years, of good character, medically fit and able to pass an intelligence
test. Men with certain trade qualifications may be accepted up to the age of 33
years. _ . .
Men can sign on for 22 years (with the option of finishing their Colour bervice
at the end of 6 years or at the end of any consecutive period of 3 years thereafter,
provided they give six months’ notice in writing).
Men may choose the corps in which they wish to serve and their wishes regarding
trade training are met as far as possible.
On entry into the Army, other ranks are trained at the Depots or with the Train¬
ing Units of the arms or services for which they have been selected. This initial
training consists of six weeks’ basic military training common to all arms and
services, and a further period of training which is special to the arm or service
concerned. This latter training varies in length of time, depending on the arm
or service, e.g. Infantry, four weeks; Royal Signals electronic technician, 22
weeks
A boy can enlist in the Army as an Army apprentice tradesman, between the
ages of 15 and 17; a junior leader, between the ages of 15 and 16^ ; and a drummer,
band boy, tailor or piper, between the ages of 15 and 17^.
After the age of 18 years, boys who have enlisted as Army apprentice tradesmen
and junior leaders in the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps and the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers serve nine
years with the Active Army and three years in the Reserve. All other boys serve
six or nine years in the Active Army and three years in the Reserve.
The object of the Junior Leaders’ Units is to produce long-term Regular
warrant officers and senior non-commissioned officers, and that of the Appren¬
tice Schools is to produce WO and NCO tradesmen for the Regular Army, some
of whom may become specialist commissioned officers.
Women may enlist into the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps or
into the Women’s Royal Army Corps between the ages of xyi and 33 years.
The Reserve Army
The Reserve Army includes the Army Emergency Reserve and the Territorial
Army, both of which have been recently reorganized.
The Territorial Army consists of volunteer officers and other ranks (including
women), National Service officers and men carrying out their statutory obligation
of three and a half years’ part-time service after completing their whole-time service
with the Army, and the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers. With the end of
National Service it will become a wholly volunteer force. Its main role in the event
of war would be the defence of the United Kingdom, but some units might be
needed overseas and all its members are liable for service in any part of the world
when the army reserve is called out by proclamation. Volunteers are required to
attend annual camp and to carry out a minimum number of training periods. While
the military authorities are responsible for policy, training and discipline, local
administration of the Territorial Army is carried out largely by county Territorial
and Auxiliary Forces Associations.
The Army Emergency Reserve has as its main function to provide essential com¬
munications and the technical and administrative services required on mobilization
by both the Regular and the Territorial Armies. It consists of specialist units and
pools of skilled men—both volunteers and part-time National Service men—who
can be called upon at short notice to fill gaps in Regular units. It also provides units
of the Mobile Defence Corps (see p. 120).

Cadet Forces
The Combined Cadet Force and the Army Cadet Force provide training on Service
lines for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The Combined Cadet Force
provides training in schools in which education is continued to the age of 17 or
above. Cadets receive a general basic training and then specialized training in the
Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force Sections. Contingents are affiliated to
Regular units and establishments of the Services. The Army Cadet Force is
recruited from schools which do not raise contingents of the Combined Cadet
Force, and from boys who have left school.
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council, composed of eight
members, including the Secretary of State for Air who is president. The Parlia¬
mentary Under-Secretary for Air is vice-president and the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for Air, who is a civil servant, is secretary of the Council. The
Service members include the Chief of the Air Staff, who is responsible for strategic
policy and the fighting efficiency of the RAF; the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff,
responsible for inter-Service policy, operations, intelligence, liaison with other
air forces, standardization and ground defence; the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff,
responsible for the preparedness for war of the RAF, for command, staff and air
training, and for policy regarding future aircraft and weapons; the Air Member
for Personnel; and the Air Member for Supply and Organization.
Commands
The Royal Air Force is organized into Commands administered by the Air
Council:
At Home: Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training, Technical
Training, Maintenance and Home (formerly known as Reserve)
Commands.
Overseas: Second Tactical Air Force (stationed in Germany as part of Britain’s
contribution to the NATO forces), R.A.F. Malta, the Middle East
Air Force (headquarters in Cyprus) and the Far East Air Force
(headquarters at Changi, Singapore).
Commands are subdivided into groups and wings, a certain number of squadrons
being allotted to each group or wing. Squadrons are subdivided into flights.
Aircraft and Equipment
The spearhead of the RAF is the force of four-engined jet bombers, which is
building up steadily. The Valiant element is at full strength, Vulcans are already in
service and their numbers will increase, and the Victor will enter service during
1957-58. Stocks of nuclear weapons are increasing together with Bomber Com¬
mand’s ability to carry them. Improved marks of the V-bombers will carry a
powered guided bomb and will form for many years the foundation of Britain’s
deterrent power, though ballistic missiles will gradually play an increasing part.
The light bomber force in Bomber Command is equipped with the Canberra
twin-engined bomber, which is being equipped to deliver nuclear weapons. This
force is committed to NATO.
Manned fighters will continue in service for a considerable time, although in
many roles they will eventually be superseded by guided missiles. The Javelin
all-weather fighter is now well established in Fighter Command and day-fighter
squadrons are being equipped with the latest mark of Hunter. A production order
has been placed for the P.i, a supersonic fighter.
DEFENCE
US
Air defences are being recast in order to concentrate on the defence of nuclear
bases. In 1957, a new organization was set up in the Air Ministry to co-ordinate
and speed up the introduction of defensive guided missiles and their associated
radar, and to integrate them with the existing control and reporting and fighter
defence systems. _ .
The system of control and reporting, which has been built into a highly etticient
organization, is closely linked with the radar systems of Continental allies. Great
advances in the development of radar have been made in recent years. A recon¬
structed radar chain now covers the whole of the United Kingdom, and vital parts
of the system have been put deep underground and protected by massive thick¬
nesses of concrete. The high performance of the latest system makes it possible
to have greatly improved cover with a smaller number of stations.
Full-scale Service trials of the RAF’s first air-to-air guided missile, Fireflash,
began in 1957 with Swift aircraft, for experimental work and training purposes.
A more advanced missile, the Firestreak (also to be used by the Fleet Air Arm),
will in due course be fitted to Javelins and P./s.
The development of surface-to-air guided weapons is well advanced. 1 he first
RAF missile station is under construction at North Coates, Lincolnshire, and will
be brought into use for service trials and training in 1958. Initially it will be
equipped for the operation of ground-to-air missiles of the semi-active homing
type known as Bloodhound. The Thunderbird is also on order for the RAF. More
advanced types are being developed. .
Coastal Command’s long-range maritime reconnaissance force, which is com¬
mitted to NATO, is now wholly equipped with Shackleton aircraft. An improved
version—the Shackleton Mark ///—is being introduced.
Transport Command is bfeing re-equipped to provide increased mobility for the
strategic reserves of both land and air forces. A Comet II squadron was formed
in I956—the first pure-jet transport squadron in any air force—and has proved
very successful. Britannia aircraft are planned to come into service in 1950 for
long-range transport; for short and medium ranges, use will still be made of piston-
engined Hastings. The Beverley freighter, now in service, is a versatile aircraft
which can lift large loads. u s- ns.
Increasing use is being made of helicopters for operations and tor the Air/bea
Rescue Service. The Sycamore and Whirlwind helicopters have given good service,
particularly in Malaya, and the Bristol 192 twin-engined helicopter is on order.
Following a decision by the Air Council to base initial flying framing on jet
aircraft, a substantial order has been placed for the Jet Provost trainer. The R
is the first air force to adopt all-jet training. . ,
In recent years there has been a great deal of airfield development in the United
Kingdom to provide for the operation of the V-bombers and the new fighters, and
a major programme of airfields, depots and technical facilities has also been carried
out for units of the United States Air Force stationed in Britain.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Air Force
The Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire, trains cadets for per¬
manent commissions as pilots and navigators, while technical cadets are trained
at the Royal Air Force Technical College, Henlow, Bedfordshire. The training of
some technical cadets includes a three-year honours degree course at a university.
Royal Air Force Regiment cadets start at the Royal Air Force Regiment Depot
at Catterick, Yorkshire, and then spend 18 months at the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey). , „ , _
It is the aim of the Air Council that all pilots and navigators shall be officers.
n6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most of them enter on direct commissions. Officers with direct commissions have
the choice of serving for eight or twelve years on the active list and going out with
a gratuity, or of staying in the Service until they qualify for pension. Flying training
lasts for up to 18 months.
Officers in ground branches are usually found from people in civil life, some of
whom already hold professional qualifications, who enter the Royal Air Force on
short service commissions. Short service officers may be selected for permanent
commissions while in the Royal Air Force.
Airmen are recruited from the age of 17! and may enlist for three, four, five,
nine, ten or twelve years in a wide variety of trades, for most of which they will
be given training in the Service. After four years, they may apply for an engage¬
ment which can last until they are 55 years of age and qualifies them for a pension
when they have served for 22 years. Airmen may be promoted either as non¬
commissioned officers or as technicians, and there are opportunities for them to
obtain commissions. Boys can come into the Service as apprentices or boy entrants
and be trained in a trade.
Women’s Royal Air Force
Women play an important part in the work of the Royal Air Force and of its
reserve and auxiliary formations. The WRAF is an integral part of the Royal Air
Force and its members train with and work alongside airmen in the same trades,
serving both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Nursing services are provided
by Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Auxiliary and Reserve Forces
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of fighter control and radar reporting
units raised and maintained by Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations.
The Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which is part of the Royal Air Force
Reserve, provides a pool of officers, airmen and airwomen mainly with previous
Air Force service, who, like the personnel of the Auxiliary Air Force, train on a
part-time basis. It includes members of the university air squadrons.
Part-time National Service men serve in the Royal Air Force Reserve of Officers
and Class H of the Air Force Reserve.
Royal Observer Corps
Over 17,000 men and women from all walks of life form the Royal Observer
Corps, a voluntary civilian organization, administered by Fighter Command,
devoted to the specialized tasks of identifying and reporting the movements of
aircraft. The corps originated in the first world war to report the movements of
German aircraft and zeppelins over Great Britain and was officially established in
1925. Recently it has undertaken the additional duty of measuring and reporting
on radioactivity in the event of nuclear attack.
Air Training Corps
The Air 1 raining Corps provides pre-Service training for boys between the ages
of 14 and 18. Like the other pre-Service formations, it seeks to inculcate citizenship
as well as training for the RAF.
HOME DEFENCE
The experience of the second world war showed the importance of having trained
and organized bodies of men and women ready to mitigate the effects of enemy
air attacks on the civil population; and the Civil Defence Act, 1948, recognized
DEFENCE
117
that a permanent system of civil defence is essential to national safety. The develop¬
ment of nuclear weapons, while it has greatly intensified the problems of civ
defence and has called for much replanning which is still in process, has
lessened the need for an efficient civil defence organization. This need hfs recently
been endorsed in the i957 White Paper on Defence, which recognized that civil
defence ‘must . . . play an essential part in the defence plan . ,f
In the event of nuclear attack, the problems of rescue, fire-fighting and welfare
operations would be intensified by the presence of radmactmty, which wou
have to be detected and its extent and intensity measured. The first call would
have to be met by the civilian services on the spot, but these though vital and
increasingly mobile, might not be sufficient, and support would be available from
all the armed forces in the country at the time, whether regular or reserve, w ic
were not immediately required for combat operations. The Minister of Defence
is charged with planning the part which the armed forces would play in home
defence, and with co-ordinating the plans of the military authorities with th
of the civil authorities. „ j ^ •„:i
The country’s economic capacity limits the effort which can be devoted to civil
defence preparations; and the main defence objective must be the nuclear deterrent,
which will serve not to prepare for war but to prevent it. In home defence the
main task is to keep a local organization in being as a framework for expansio
if necessary, to provide training equipment and to proceed with essential research.
The Government has declared its conviction that, if the deterrent were to fail,
countless lives could be saved by civil defence preparations made in advance.
Organization of Civil Defence
Civil defence planning in the United Kingdom is the responsibility of a number
of ministers each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would repre¬
sent a natural extension of his peace-time functions. As the development of effec¬
tive civil defence services involves much detailed planning at local level, the centra
Government has enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of industry
and commerce and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organiza¬
tions such as the Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Voluntary Services.
Under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the Home Secretary is responsible for
co-ordinating all the Government’s civil defence preparations. The Secretary o
State for Scotland is responsible for civil defence matters in Scotland.
In England and Wales, the Home Secretary is responsible for the civil defence
activities of the police and fire services, and he administers the Civil Defence Corps
and the Industrial Civil Defence Service as well as such matters as war-time light¬
ing restrictions, air-raid shelter policy and the national air-raid and fall-out warning
and monitoring system. The Civil Defence Department of the Home Office is under
the charge of a Director-General of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Secre¬
tary. Other Government Departments have direct responsibility forthe civil defence
applications of the services which they control; for example, the Ministry of Health
is responsible for the hospital and first-aid services, and the Post Office for tele¬
communications. .  ,.
In Scotland, the Scottish Home Department deals with questions correspond g
to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales, and the Department
of Health for Scotland is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid
In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence (Northern Ireland) Act, i95°> Places
responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs which may
arrange for other Departments to undertake some functions on its behalf.
n8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The co-ordination of civil defence planning in Great Britain necessarily involves
much work by interdepartmental committees, on which all Departments wTith civil
defence responsibilities in Great Britain are represented, in order that plans and
programmes may be constantly reviewed to take account of changes in the scale
and nature of possible attacks.
England is divided into ten Civil Defence Regions in charge of Regional Directors
of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Office, and there is also a Director of
Civil Defence for Wales. Their duties include liaison with the armed forces and
the planning of combined exercises. There is no corresponding regional organiza¬
tion in Scotland, where planning is carried out centrally, although the country is
divided into zones for operational purposes.
The Civil Defence Services
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks, the following
services, in which in times of peace only part-time service is required, are raised
in Great Britain1 by voluntary recruitment of civilians, both men and women:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which was created by the Secretary of State’s
Warrant in May 1949. to assist local and other authorities to carry out their
civil defence functions.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence units
formed in industrial and commercial premises.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, to reinforce the fire services maintained by
local authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947. (The Fire Service would
become a national organization in time of war.)
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained nurses
and persons willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries to reinforce the
National Hospital Services in England and Wales. In Scotland, there is
also an Ambulance Section to provide the additional manpower for the
war-time operation of the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed forces,
recruits for all formations are drawn from men and women who are willing to
serve as long as they are able and who will undertake to train regularly. The Govern¬
ment does not pay the volunteers for their services but reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses are reimbursed.
Strengths in Great Britain at 31st March, 1957, were:
Civil Defence Corps . . . . . . . . . . 353,137
Industrial Civil Defence Service (at 31st October, 1956) 209,539
Auxiliary Fire Service . . . . . . . . . . 20,331
National Hospital Service Reserve . . . . . . 52,756
The Civil Defence Corps is recruited and organized by certain local authorities
(mainly the councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales, or
1 In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence Corps (Head¬
quarters, Warden and Welfare Sections), the Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service, and the
Hospital Service Reserve.

large burghs in Scotland) in local divisions. The local divisions are subdivided
into five sections1 as follows:
Headquarters:
Wardens:
Rescue:
Ambulance
and Casualty
Collecting:
Welfare:
control of civil defence operations, communications, recon¬
naissance (including the identification of toxic agents),
assistance and advice to the public, reporting the effects of air
attack, organization of street and village parties, movement of
the homeless.
rescue of trapped persons and rendering first aid to them,
first aid, conveyance of casualties to hospital, and the organi¬
zation of stretcher-bearers.
escort and welfare of homeless and evacuees, assistance with
billeting, rest centres, supervision and welfare of public in
shelters, emergency cooking and feeding, public information
centres.
Training
Members of the Civil Defence Corps are required to undertake the training
necessary to enable them to carry out the duties of an ordinary member of the
section of the Corps to which they belong, and thereafter to undertake a few hours’
refresher training, including exercises, each year. If they wish to increase their
knowledge they may undertake courses of additional and advanced training.
Civil defence instructors (except instructors in first aid) are trained either at one
of the three central training schools or locally, under arrangements made by local
authorities, in accordance with directions given by the Home Office or Scottish
Home Department. Courses and studies for senior officials concerned with civil
defence are held at the Civil Defence Staff College at Sunningdale, Berkshire.
In 1955, a Fire Service Tactical Training Centre was opened at Reigate, Surrey.
Here experiments were conducted in the use of new emergency appliances and
equipment, particularly in mobile formations; and courses of instruction in these
matters have been given to officers and men of regular brigades.
The Police
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the maintenance
of law and order and the control of traffic, and they would also be responsible for
certain additional war-time and civil defence tasks. In all these duties they would
have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
Role of the Armed Forces
The Services have a vital role to play in civil defence; all armed forces, whether
regular or reserve, in the country at the outbreak of war will have to be prepared to
assist in the struggle for survival. The armed forces are in no sense a substitute for
civil administration; the aim will be to support the civil authorities by all possible
means.
1 Four in Scotland, where there is no Ambulance and Casualty Collecting section,
ambulance services being provided by the Hospital Service, and casualty collecting being
a warden duty. In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence Corps is organized directly by
the Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authorities. As in Scotland, it consists
of four sections only, the Ambulance Service being a part of the Hospital Service.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All units of the Regular and Reserve Armies are trained in peace-time for the
civil defence tasks they may be expected to perform in war. The Reserve Army
includes the Mobile Defence Corps (MDC), specifically raised for civil defence tasks,
consisting of volunteers and selected Army National Service men trained in rescue
and casualty evacuation at one of the MDC Training Centres at Epsom (Surrey) or
Millom (Cumberland). The Mobile Defence Corps will normally act as the spear¬
head of the military assistance for the civil authorities provided by the armed
forces. The Royal Air Force does not take part in MDC activities, but RAF
National Service men are given special fire-fighting training at the Home Office
Centres at Washington Hall, Chorley (Lancashire) and at Moreton-in-Marsh
(Gloucestershire) as potential reinforcements to the national fire service.
The United Kingdom Commanders-in-Chief Committee, under the chairman¬
ship of the Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Land Forces, is responsible to
the Chiefs of Staff for co-ordinating Service plans for home defence, including
Service assistance to civil authorities both for civil defence and for national
recovery. While fulfilling those functions the Committee will maintain close liaison
with the Director-General of Civil Defence.
There is close liaison in peace time between the civil and military authorities at
all levels. Joint exercises are continually being held and everything possible is
being done to align the civil and military chains of command. As a result, the
functions which the military authorities could undertake in support of the civil
authorities have been more clearly defined: there is also a growing understanding
among the civil authorities of the part that the military authorities can best play.
There are two main ways in which the fighting Services can render assistance:
by assisting the civil authorities to maintain control; and by the direct employment
of units on various tasks such as aid to the police in the maintenance of law and
order and traffic control, aid to the fire service, assisting in the reception and care
of the homeless, treatment and evacuation of casualties and in the clearance of
radioactive fall-out zones, the provision of guards, the maintenance of road, rail
and water communications, light rescue, reconnaissance and the provision and
running of camps.
IV. THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
The United Kingdom ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world,
with about o-i8 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, with about 2 per
cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks ninth. In density of population it is fourth:
of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands are more crowded;
and there are eleven times as many people to the square mile in the United King¬
dom as in the United States. In world trade, it ranks second. It takes about a fifth
of the world’s exports of primary products, and provides about a fifth of its exports
of manufactured goods. ,
The United Kingdom, from its own soil, provides only half of the lood it needs,
and—apart from coal and some low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources;
so it is the world’s largest importer of wheat, for instance, and of meat, butter,
fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, and tobacco; also of wool, iron and steel scrap,
and hard timber. In return, it is one of the world’s largest exporters of ships, air¬
craft, locomotives, motor vehicles, electrical equipment, textiles and most types of
machinery. Few countries in the world have such a high proportion of the popula¬
tion living in towns (80 per cent) or such a small proportion of the working popu¬
lation engaged in agriculture (less than 5 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the Sterling Area (see p. 33°)>
an area with a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the sterling
area use sterling in their international transactions, and it has been estimated that
about half the world’s trade is conducted in sterling. By its membership of the
European Payments Union of the Organization for European Economic Co¬
operation, the United Kingdom provides a payments link between the sterling
area and the countries of Western Europe. . .
The short section on the national economy which follows gives a brief description
of its development up to the second world war; an account of the losses suffered m
the war; a short account of the main economic developments since the end of the
war; and, finally, a set of tables from the National Income statistics illustrating the
structure of the economy.
The Economy before 1939
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to support
a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living. It was Britain s
commerce in cotton goods, above all, which gave it the leading position in world
trade; cotton cloth provided 40 per cent of its exports in 1851. It was in this
period also that the country became so largely dependent on imports: it has been
estimated1 that retained imports, which were only 12 per cent of net national
income at factor cost (i.e. cost after discounting the effect of indirect taxes and sub¬
sidies), in 1820, rose to 28 per cent in 1870. (The 1956 figure was 23 per cent.)

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The period from 1870 to 1890 was the high-water mark of British industrial
expansion as compared with that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 grow¬
ing industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make itself
felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly cotton textiles
and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by the continued demand
for British textiles from India and other eastern countries, and by the continued
high level of overseas investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and Japan,
where labour costs were lower, established themselves firmly in the large eastern
markets, to a great extent replacing the higher-priced and often higher quality
British product. The extension of the world demand for coal was slowed down by
the increasing use of oil, while coal from the new European mines competed
severely with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of indus¬
tries (e.g., locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world demand fell away after
a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of
the expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products (e.g., cars and
electrical goods). Most countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some
sought deliberately to protect nascent and even established industries by sheltering
them behind tariffs and (later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned the effect of a
fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high. The loss of export
markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple industries—coal, cotton,
iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering. The result was heavy
unemployment, the general rate of which averaged 14 per cent in the years 1921-39,
reaching a peak of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its
worst. In districts relying mainly on one of the staple industries, the rate was much
higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment took
place, stimulated by an increase in home investment, by some revival in world
trade and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
Effects of the Second World War
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic capital by
about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of
industrial maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in a considerable altera¬
tion in Britain’s financial and trading position, which may be summarized thus:
1. Loss of overseas assets. Over £ 1,000 million worth of overseas investments—
including £428 million in North America—were sold to pay for war supplies.
The income from these assets had paid for a substantial part of pre-war
imports into the United Kingdom.
2. New overseas debts. New external debts, totalling £3,000 million, were
accumulated.
3. Terms of trade. The price of imported raw materials rose sharply after the
war, and by 1948 about one-fifth more goods had to be exported than in
1938 to bring in the same quantity of imports.
4. Reduced exports. By 1944, exports, curtailed as part of the war effort, had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 123
5. Smaller reserves. The real value of the gold and dollar reserves was reduced
to about half the pre-war level.
6. World dollar shortage. The physical destruction of the war led to an increased
dependence on the part of Britain, the rest of the sterling area and many
other countries on supplies of all kinds from North America. Dollar earnings
by non-dollar countries were inadequate to pay for these supplies.
Post-War Developments
Since the war, the economy of the United Kingdom has experienced a period of
almost uninterrupted prosperity with a constantly increasing supply of goods and
services and a virtual absence of unemployment. The post-war years have, at the
same time, been an era of marked technical advance, notably in the development
of nuclear power and in the aircraft industry. In the initial post-war years, external
assistance in the form of Marshall Aid and loans from the United States and Canada
overcame a serious deficit in the balance of payments, and, more recently, the rapid
recovery of Britain’s export trade has enabled an appreciable payments surplus to
be achieved, although still insufficient to supply in full the requirements of overseas
countries for investment capital. The demands upon resources have, however,
imposed at times a heavy strain on the economy and, as in most other countries,
prices in Britain have shown a steady upward trend.
The Balance of Payments
The loss of income from overseas investments as a result of the war, an adverse
movement in the terms of trade, and an increased demand for imports caused by
the expansion of industry, together created an over-riding problem—the need to
secure a large increase in British exports. In 1944, at the peak of the war effort,
the volume of exports had fallen to less than one-third of the level of 1938,
but by 1950 it was already two-thirds higher. Then a switch of industry to defence
needs and a period of stronger competition in overseas markets, especially from
countries unaffected by rearmament, such as Germany and Japan, led to a pause
in the upward trend until 1953; in the following years the annual increase in the
volume of exports averaged 5 per cent. Imports increased more slowly, partly
because of controls in the early post-war years, and did not reach 1938 volume
until 1955.
In 1950, a current surplus of £300 million indicated that equilibrium had once
more been restored. The necessity for the diversion of resources to rearmament
on a large scale following the outbreak of war in Korea and a swift rise in the cost
of imports caused a setback, and the adverse balance in the year 1951 alone
totalled £403 million. With the improvement in the balance of payments in the
previous year, it had been intended to dispense with financial assistance from the
United States, but the additional burdens imposed by the Korean war necessitated
direct aid being retained for a further year.
Monetary and fiscal measures were introduced to correct the situation, and sur¬
pluses on current account were recorded in the following three years—1952 to
1954. A marked increase in internal investment and consumption led to a deficit
in 1955, but a policy of disinflation was quickly effective and, in the following year,
1956, the balance of payments was again in surplus despite the disturbances caused
to international trade by the Suez crisis. In the five years 1952-1956, there was an
average surplus of £160 million on current account, including £70 million received
from the United States in the form of Defence Aid.
This margin, however, is not large enough to allow the United Kingdom to meet
its extensive international and Commonwealth responsibilities. It was fully absorbed

by the provision of long-term capital for investment abroad, the reduction in sterling
balances and the repayment of debts, leaving nothing for the rebuilding of the gold
and dollar reserves. Consequently, when international confidence was shaken to¬
wards the end of 1956 by the tension in the Middle East (see p. 123), the reserves
had to be strengthened by a drawing on the International Monetary Fund.
Production and Employment
Since 1941, the level of unemployment in Britain has been very low; on average
2 per cent of the working population was unemployed between 1948 and 1956 as
compared with an average of 14 per cent between the two world wars (see diagram,
p. 125). Industrial production has been rising in the post-war period by an average
of s per cent each year; the national income in real terms has been advancing by
about 3 per cent each year (see diagram, p. 124). As the size of the population of
working age is virtually static, and the number at work has risen only slowly, the
expansion of output of goods and services is mainly the result of higher produc¬
tivity which, in manufacturing industry, appears to have shown a larger increase
since 1938 than that of any other European country.
The increased resources made available by higher production have been used
principally to raise exports and investments and to maintain a higher level of Govern¬
ment expenditure than pre-war (see diagram, p. 124). Consumer expenditure per
head stayed below the pre-war level till 1952, and though it has since risen markedly,
its value at factor cost continues to be a lower proportion of the national product.
Gross capital formation has risen continuously since the war, except in 1950 and
in 1952, and in 1956 it absorbed 16 per cent of the gross national product compared
with 12 per cent in 1938. The rate of increase in exports was most rapid in the
immediate post-war years, while Government expenditure dropped as a result of
the post-war cuts in defence outlays, but rose again markedly following the rearma¬
ment programme introduced in 1950. Since 1952, defence spending has taken no
less than 9 per cent of the gross national product.
Extensive physical controls over industry, which were retained in the years
directly following the war, have in the main been discontinued. Government influ¬
ence on the course of the economy is principally exercised through fiscal and mone¬
tary measures such as changes in the Bank Rate, the Budget, control over new
capital issues, restrictions on hire purchase and the operation of exchange control.
A high level of industrial investment has been required to make possible the
rapid rate of scientific and technological advance. The most spectacular achieve¬
ments have perhaps been in the sphere of nuclear power and aerodynamics, espe¬
cially the development of new types of commercial aircraft, but notable progress
has also been made in employing new materials and introducing new types of plant
and machinery throughout British industry.
Problem of Prices
Britain, like almost every other industrial country, has been faced with the
problem of post-war rises in price levels. In the ten years to 1956, prices in Britain
rose by about 50 per cent. In some degree this is explained by the increase in prices
of imported goods, by the abolition of subsidies and by increases in purchase tax
and other taxes, but the main immediate cause of the increase has been the ten¬
dency for all types of income—wages, salaries and profits—to advance at a higher
rate than the increase in output. The problem of combating inflationary trends
has been one of the most pressing issues facing post-war governments and, as in
other countries, is currently the most important factor shaping economic policy.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
127
THE NATIONAL INCOME 1948-1956
Size and Source
In a comparison of national income per head in different countries (which
provides a very approximate measure of living standards) the United Kingdom
ranks below the United States and Canada, and roughly on a par with Australia,
New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland. From 1948 to 1956 the
gross national product (which is a measure of the total goods and services pro¬
duced) is estimated to have risen in real terms at a rate of about 3 per cent a year:
in 1956 it was £18,002 million at current prices and (with allowance made for price
changes) was 25 per cent higher than in 1948.
The sources used in compiling Tables 7 to 13 are the Government publications,
National Income and Expenditure 1956, Economic Survey 1957 and Preliminary
Estimates of National Income and Expenditure 1951 to 1956.
The predominance of industry in the United Kingdom economy is brought out
in Table 7. In 1956, manufacturing, mining and building were responsible for
about 47 per cent of the gross domestic product; agriculture, forestry and fisheries
provided 5 per cent.

To these supplies from home production, imports added rather more than
one-fifth.
Distribution
Out of the total supply of goods and services (including imports), rather over a
half has been going into personal consumption, and a fifth into exports. Investment
took about an eighth of the total, and current expenditure by central Government
and local authorities took about a seventh. Comparison with earlier years shows
that there has been a decrease in the proportion of supplies taken by consumer
expenditure and an increase in the proportion taken by investment. The figures
are set out in Table 8.

There has been a significant change in the distribution of personal incomes (see
Table 9). The income of employees has increased more than the income of any
other group. In 1938, employees’ incomes were 60 per cent of the total of personal
incomes; by 1956 the share had risen to 72 per cent. In contrast, personal incomes
from rent, dividends and interest had fallen to 11 per cent from the 1938 figure of
22 per cent.

The redistributive effects of taxation and the general increase in incomes have
resulted in concentrating the bulk of personal income after tax in the ranges of
income of £250 to £1,000 a year and, compared with 1938, greatly reducing the
share taken by the highest incomes (see Table 10). The latest figures available are

Note: Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.
The distribution of personal expenditure is influenced by the incidence of in¬
direct taxes, particularly the very heavy taxes on drink and tobacco. If the effects
of the latter taxes were excluded, the proportion spent on food would be about
40 per cent and that spent on drink and tobacco about 6 per cent of the total (see
diagram, p. 125, which shows the proportions in 1955).
Government Income and Expenditure
The Government’s share in the total supplies available in 1956 has been given in
Table 8 as 15 per cent. But the percentage of total incomes which the Government
takes is higher, since public authorities raise a considerable part of their income,
not to spend it on goods and services, but to redistribute it as pensions and other
personal payments, or as subsidies. If the total income of the central Government;
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY

local authorities and the National Insurance Fund is compared with the total
income received by everyone (including companies) for work done, the percentage
is about 37.
Table 13 gives a summary of the way in which public authorities—the central
Government, local authorities, and the National Insurance Fund—collected and
spent their incomes in 1956.

V. INDUSTRY
ORGANIZATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialized. Eleven people work in mining, manufacturing and building for every
one in agriculture. The United Kingdom is one of the world’s largest exporters of
manufactured goods per head of population and the range of its industrial manufac¬
tures reflects its position as an outstanding workshop of the world.
Location
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many and
various. During the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, one of the
most important influences was the proximity of coal, then the major source of
power, particularly when it was associated with ease of access to other raw materials
such as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for chemicals) in Cheshire, and to
the coast which in turn offered easy access to imported raw materials and a quick
outlet for exports. In the course of the past hundred years, the pull exercised by
coal has been progressively weakened as improved means of communication and
an alternative source of power in electricity have been developed and have enabled
advantage to be taken of other sites—e.g., those near to big consumer markets and
plentiful supplies of labour. During the inter-war period there was a tendency for
the ‘new’ industries such as those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods
and rubber products to develop rapidly in the South (especially in and around
Greater London) and the Midlands. On the other hand, this period was one of acute
depression and mass unemployment for the older industrial areas which specialized
in the great staple industries—coalmining, steel, shipbuilding, marine engineering
and cotton manufactures. These conditions prompted official action which, since the
second world war, has aimed at encouraging new industrial development and
diversification in the areas concerned where labour and other resources are to be
found, and discouraging further industrialization in congested areas such as Greater
London and Greater Birmingham.
Although industry is today widely dispersed, the main areas of industrial con¬
centration are still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the begin¬
ning of Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Northern Ireland), are on or near coalfields. These areas and their main industries
are listed below (see also map, pp. 142-3). Four of them—Lancashire, South Wales,
Tyneside, and Central Scotland—contain Development Areas (see p. 134) where, as
in Northern Ireland, considerable success has been achieved by Government
action to diversify the industrial structure at the same time as prosperity has
returned to their staple industries.
Greater London. London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing and food
and drink industries, of printing, of the manufacture of furniture, of materials for
the arts, of film production, of precision instruments and of many other specialized
goods. Small firms predominate in all these industries, and the average size of
manufacturing firms in London is well below the national average. London is also
132
INDUSTRY
133
an important centre for light engineering and chemicals, and has some heavy
engineering plants. Indeed, London is so large and its industries so diverse that
it is a main centre for many of the broad groups of manufacturing industries, with
the notable exception of textiles and metal manufacture.
Midlands. The main Midland industrial area consists of the great conurbation
centred on Birmingham and Wolverhampton which includes portions of Stafford¬
shire Worcestershire and Warwickshire, where there is a wide variety of industry,
including notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering goods and
vehicles, and also jewellery, rubber products and domestic metalware. The smaller
adjacent conurbation of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent, may be
considered as a separate industrial area and is devoted chiefly to the manufacture
of pottery and china and to the mining of coal. Leicester, Coventry, Rugby, Derby
and Nottingham are the principal industrial towns in the rest of the Midland area.
One of the richest coalfields in the country is situated in the north-east of the area
and continues into Yorkshire.
Yorkshire. The West Riding of Yorkshire still contains much the bigger section
of the British woollen and worsted industry, though Leeds is now more concerned
with clothing and a variety of steel and engineering products. The modern woollen
and worsted industry lies farther west, at Bradford, Halifax (which also specializes
in carpets), Huddersfield and neighbouring towns. York is an important centre tor
chocolate and sugar confectionery. The city of Sheffield, in the extreme south o
Yorkshire, is famous for its high-quality steel manufacture, its cutlery, plate and
tool industry and its heavy engineering. There are extensive coalfields in the West
Riding of Yorkshire. Hull is one of the world s largest fishing ports.
South-east Lancashire. Manchester is the commercial centre of the cotton textile
industry. Most cotton yarn is spun in towns within a ten-mile radius of Man¬
chester, but weaving is mainly carried on somewhat farther to the north in t e
Preston, Burnley, Nelson, Blackburn and Colne areas. Manchester itself, besides
having the variety of industry typical of a large city, is one of Britain s chief centres
of electrical and heavy engineering and dyestuffs. There are also coalfields m t e
Manchester area. The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume
of overseas trade, links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through important
industrial towns such as Warrington with its metal industries, Widnes with its
chemicals, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching
the Mersey estuary. Liverpool is one of Britain’s main ports and commercial
centres and, after London, the greatest centre of foodstuffs processing. Among its
older industries is ship repairing: shipbuilding is a major industry across the river
at Birkenhead. In recent years many new industries, including electrical engineer¬
ing and other heavy industrial equipment, have been rapidly assuming a place ot
importance in the Liverpool area.
South Wales. Coalmining, including the production of such special coals as steam
coal and anthracite, has been and remains the chief industry of South Wales. The
other basic industry is steel, including tinplate, in which extensive modernization
is in progress. Since 1934, new manufacturing industries have been introduced
into Wales to ensure diversity of employment, and these now provide capital and
consumer goods on an extensive scale. The new industries include the manufacture
of plastics, chemicals, textiles, aircraft and electrical and radio equipment.
Tyneside and Tees-side. In Northumberland and Durham, but not in north York¬
shire, coalmining is the principal industry. The region is also a centre for the iron
and steel industry, the chemical and engineering industries and is of increasing
134

importance for lighter industries; it is second only to Clydeside as a shipbuilding
and ship-repairing area. Most of the shipyards are on the lower reaches of the
rivers Tyne, Wear and Tees.
Central Scotland. The largest shipbuilding centre in Britain is on Clydeside. It
has a marine engineering industry and important neighbouring coalfields in the
Lothians, Fife and Lanark, although activity in this last-named field is now declin¬
ing as the seams become worked out. There is also a flourishing iron and steel
industry. The commercial importance of Glasgow and the size and varied appoint¬
ments of the great ships built on Clydeside have assured for this area a variety of
manufactures. The whole of the central lowlands of Scotland from the Clyde to
the Forth is industrialized.
Belfast. Another important shipbuilding area is Belfast, in Northern Ireland,
even though it has no local supplies of coal and iron. It has also an engineering
industry, primarily marine engineering, and there is a growing aircraft assembly
industry. The traditional industries of Belfast are linen, rope and tobacco.
Distribution of Industry Policy
Government policy is particularly concerned with the distribution of industry.
The Government cannot direct a firm to go to any particular area or site, but the
Board of Trade has statutory powers under the Town and Country Planning Acts,
1947, to ensure that new industrial development throughout Great Britain is carried
out consistently with the proper distribution of industry. A certificate to this effect
from the Board of Trade is necessary before planning consent may be given by a
local planning authority for a new industrial building or extension with an area
exceeding 5,000 square feet. One use of these powers has been to discourage the
expansion of industry in congested areas such as Greater London or Birmingham.
Moreover, areas in Great Britain where there is likely to be a special danger of
unemployment may be scheduled by the Board of Trade as ‘Development Areas’
under the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. The purpose of this Act, and of the
Distribution of Industry Act, 1950, is to promote the growth of new industry and
the expansion of existing industry in the Development Areas. The main advantages
which these Acts give to Development Areas are that the Board of Trade may build
factories for letting to suitable industries and the Treasury may help by making
loans or grants to undertakings which are unable to secure finance through normal
channels. The Board of Trade factories are built and managed by Industrial Estate
Companies. The directors of these companies are unpaid and are appointed by the
Board of Trade, and their capital is provided from Government sources. The
companies include North-Western Industrial Estates Ltd., North-Eastern
Trading Estates Ltd., Scottish Industrial Estates Ltd., Wales and Monmouthshire
Industrial Estates Ltd., and the West Cumberland Industrial Development
Company Ltd.
There are Development Areas in the following parts of England and Wales: the
mining and coastal areas of Northumberland and Durham; West Cumberland;
South Wales and Monmouthshire; Wrexham; South Lancashire; Merseyside;
and North-East Lancashire, which became a Development Area in March 1953.
In Scotland, the industrial area in and around the Clyde Valley, the Dundee area,
and part of the Highlands have been scheduled as the Scottish Development Area.
New industrial buildings and extensions of over 5,000 square feet completed in
Great Britain between the beginning of 1945 and the end of 1956 totalled over 300
million square feet. Of this total, about 30 per cent was in the Development Areas
which have, by contrast, some 18 per cent of the country’s insured workers in
manufacturing industry.
INDUSTRY
135
Government assistance is not limited to Development Areas: the Board of Trade
gives attention to the needs of other areas of persistent unemployment and
tries to steer suitable new industry to them. In some of these places, and in
new towns or expanded towns (intended to receive population and industry moving
from London, Glasgow and other congested centres) factories may be built by
local authorities. In rural and fishing areas (for example, the Buckie-Peterhead
Area in north-east Scotland) which need a small amount of manufacturing industry,
the Development Commission has agreed to consider sympathetically requests for
financial help in building small factories for industrialists who are prepared to go
there. In Scotland, the services of the Scottish Industrial Estates Ltd. are available
for the construction of such factories.
The Distribution of Industry Acts do not apply to Northern Ireland because,
under the Northern Ireland constitution, the matters they deal with are the con¬
cern of the Northern Ireland Parliament, which has passed its own legislation to
encourage industrial expansion and diversification. The Northern Ireland Govern¬
ment builds factories and provides grants and loans for new industrial undertakings,
and the Board of Trade gives Northern Ireland priority as if it were a Development
Area for the purposes of encouraging and guiding new industrial development. As
a result, over 115 firms have started production for the first time in Northern
Ireland and 82 schemes of expansion have been put into effect since 1945. These
new firms and expansion schemes are already providing employment for 27,000
people. The United Kingdom Government also gives manufacturers in Northern
Ireland, as in Development Areas in Great Britain, some preference in the matter
of placing Government contracts.
The Structure of Industry
The pattern of ownership and organization in industry is varied. Personal, cor¬
porate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different forms,
and all play an important part in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary in scale
from the many small workshops to vast organizations such as the National Coal
Board, a public corporation with some 700,000 employees; Imperial Chemical
Industries Ltd., a limited liability company which, with its subsidiaries, employs
some 115,000 persons in the United Kingdom; and the Co-operative Wholesale
Society Ltd., a co-operative society with some 50,000 employees.
Role of Public Enterprise
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the public sector tended to
grow relatively to the private sector. This tendency is connected largely with the
increasing concern of Government with such matters as health, education and
housing. But up to 1950, and particularly in the decade 1940-50, there was also
an increase in the State’s direct participation in productive economic activities,
although since 1951 this increase has been checked, and in two instances steel
and road transport—the return of ownership to private enterprise has almost been
completed. State participation is effected mainly through special statutory bodies
set up to deal with a particular activity. Such bodies, though not part of a Govern¬
ment Department, are under a considerable but varying degree of public control
(see pp. 144—5). The most important of these statutory bodies have been the public
corporations which operate major industries and services in the public interest.
The public corporation in its twentieth-century form is, generally speaking, a
public body having a clearly defined and specific task. Its board of directors and
its staff are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they
are not civil servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their
K
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
136
actions in a variety of ways, they are free from full and continuous ministerial
control. Certain of the corporations are self-supporting. Others receive Exchequer
grants to help them in carrying out the duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were established,1
designed to reorganize and to operate for the public benefit some service that
required co-ordination on a national scale or required control by a body responsible
for the public interest. Their constitutions had no standard pattern and their
governing bodies differed in the method of appointment and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the Nationalization Acts set up public
corporations to run certain major industries and services, including coalmining,
inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply, and civil air trans¬
port. These post-war corporations are less varied in the structure of their govern¬
ing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible Minister, who has full powers of
dismissal.
The following corporations are now operating or controlling industries or
services:
The Bank of England (see pp. 308-9 ).
The British Broadcasting Corporation (see pp. 439-40).
Cable & Wireless Limited (see p. 268).
The British Transport Commission (see pp. 238-40).
The Ulster Transport Authority (see p. 251).
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (see pp. 253-4 and 255-7).
British European Airways (see pp. 253-4 and 257-9).
The National Coal Board (see pp. 182-3).
The Gas Council and Area Gas Boards (see pp. 195-6).
The Central Electricity Authority (see pp. 188-90).
The Electricity Board for Northern Ireland (see p. 190).
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (see p. 190).
The South of Scotland Electricity Board (see p. 190).
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (see pp. 414-16).
Under the Iron and Steel Act of 1949 most of the undertakings engaged in the
iron and steel industry were brought under public ownership, but the process was
reversed by subsequent legislation and nearly all have now been returned to
private ownership (see pp. 206-7).
1 The principal corporations appointed before the second world war were: (1) the
Central Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, to rationalize
electricity generation and build and operate a main transmission system; (2) the British
Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a national
broadcasting service; (3) the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, established by the
Electricity (Supply) Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, to develop electricity supplies in
Northern Ireland outside the two County Boroughs, Belfast and Londonderry; (4) the
London Passenger Transport Board, established by Act of Parliament in 1933, to operate
the public transport system of the London Metropolitan area; (5) the Northern Ireland
Road Transport Board, established by the Road and Rail Transport Act (Northern Ireland),
I935> to acquire public road transport services in Northern Ireland outside the County
Boroughs; (6) the British Overseas Airways Corporation, established by the British Over¬
seas Airways Act, 1939, to take over the operation of the two main existing air transport
companies—Imperial Airways and British Airways.
INDUSTRY
137
The greater part of the road haulage services which were taken over by the
British Transport Commission from private operators have also been returned to
private ownership (see pp. 246-7).
Mining and Quarrying
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is
coalmining. The coalmining industry of Great Britain is operated as a single co¬
ordinated enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board. For an
account of the coal industry see pp. 182-6.
All other mining and quarrying (e.g., iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk, limestone,
salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprise, usually
owned and operated by limited liability companies. About 80,000 workers are
employed in the mining industry other than coalmining.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Some excep¬
tions are locomotives and rolling-stock for use on British Railways, mostly built in
workshops owned and operated by the British Transport Commission, a consider¬
able quantity of arms and military equipment made in Royal Ordnance factories
and other factories operated by the Ministry of Supply, and some fighting ships
built in naval dockyards operated by the Admiralty. Some printing and book¬
binding is undertaken by staffs of the Stationery Office, while the repair, and to a
limited extent the construction, of Post Office equipment is carried on in factories
run by the Post Office.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more than
10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour and National Service,
the results of the surveys, based on returns rendered by employers in December
1955, are shown in Table 14.
About a third of all employees in manufacturing industries are in establishments
employing from 100 to 500 persons. A high proportion of the biggest establish¬
ments are in the heavy industries, while the average size of establishments in indus¬
tries making consumer goods is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole.
Comparisons with results obtained in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that
there is a slow but significant trend towards an increase in the average size of manu¬
facturing establishments: in December i95S> establishments with 1,000 or more
employees were found to employ 2,640,000 persons, over ten per cent more than
two years previously and more than twice as many as in 1935.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manufacturing
firms, as a single firm may own several establishments. There are no general sur¬
veys of the size of manufacturing firms comparable with the survey of establish¬
ments. It is known, however, that in a few industries a small number of big
companies are responsible for most of the total production. Shares in these com¬
panies are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is unusual
for a few large holders to have a controlling interest.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between different
firms varies from industry to industry. In the cotton industry, for example, it is
usual for different firms to undertake the various main processes of production
(spinning, weaving, finishing), while in the woollen section of the wool textile
industry all these processes are commonly undertaken within the same firm. Some
of the leading establishments in the vehicles group of industries are primarily
engaged on the assembly of parts, many of which have been built for them under
contract by specialist firms.

INDUSTRY
139
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 205-27.
Building and Civil Engineering
In building and civil engineering large-scale work is usually carried out by private
contractors. Since the end of the second world war, most new houses have been
built by firms under contract to local authorities, but an increasing number are
now built under contract to persons or companies, or for sale. A few local authori¬
ties employ some direct labour in the construction of new houses, while the
majority employ some labour for repair and maintenance work. . .
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and civil
engineering work and those concerned with highly specialized work, many of
which operate outside as well as inside the building industry. Building is an indus¬
try of small firms; more than half of the firms employ fewer than twenty employees.
For a fuller account of the building and civil engineering industries see pp. 202 5.
Industrial Association
From the middle of the nineteenth century private industrial undertakings have
increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different purposes.
Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices. Under the Restrictive Trade Practices
Act of 1956, restrictive trading arrangements (as defined in the Act) must
be registered with the Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements
(see pp. 145-6)-
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying com¬
pleteness, most of British industry but there are wide sectors of industry where
there is no collective agreement to regulate trading practices. Associations which
deal with labour matters usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of
manufacturing process. Organizations mainly concerned with representations to
Government, provision of common services or the regulation of prices are built
up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector concerne
wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all the
required functions. „ , , z .
There are about 270 national federations and probably about 1,600 other em¬
ployers’ organizations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of t e
national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of
work. Most of the national federations are in turn affiliated to the British Employers
Confederation, the national body representing employers on labour questions
affecting industry generally (see p. 282).
The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned with providing common
services and regulating prices and trading methods is not known precisely, but
according to a survey carried out by Political and Economic Planning between
1953 and 1956, some 1,300 are in existence, varying greatly in importance structure
and activities. There are about 300 national organizations affiliated to the Federa¬
tion of British Industries (FBI), the national body recognized as the spokesman for
British industry on economic, commercial and production (as distinct from labour)
matters. The FBI has offices in the main industrial centres in the United Kingdom
and is very widely represented abroad.
140
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A number of the organizations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour matters
and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two organizations
work closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National Union of
Manufacturers (NUM) and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The
members of NUM are over 5,000 manufacturing firms, mainly small or medium
sized, and some 70 trade associations are affiliated to it. Like the FBI it has regional
branches. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is the central organi¬
zation to which about 100 local Chambers of Commerce are affiliated. In Scotland,
there is also a central organization, the Council of Scottish Chambers of Commerce.
These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist for promoting
the interests of local industry and commerce. The FBI, the NUM and the Chambers
of Commerce often act jointly in matters of common concern.
In Scotland, the Scottish Council {Development and Industry), with a wide mem¬
bership including local authorities, trade associations, trade unions, Chambers of
Commerce, co-operative societies and banks, is concerned with the economic
development of Scotland. It assists the expansion of existing industry, fosters the
growth of new industries especially in areas requiring development, encourages
exports, organizes exhibitions and publicizes Scottish trade and industry.
An Advisory Development Council for Northern Ireland was established in 1955
to study means of encouraging economic development, to attract the settlement of
industry in the area, to make more widely known the facilities offered by Northern
Ireland and to advise the Government of Northern Ireland on the use of funds
made available for these purposes.
Relations with Government
The Government is able to exercise influence on the course of industry in a
number of ways—through fiscal and monetary policy, by means of physical con¬
trols and inducements, as well as by providing information and advice.
A system has grown up whereby a particular Government Department acts as
the main point of contact, a ‘production department’ for each major industry.
The Department through which the Government’s relations with trade and
industry are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade, and the Board’s responsibili¬
ties cover a wide range of industries and
however, are the responsibility of other

The Treasury is responsible for overall economic policy, and specifically for
fiscal and monetary policy through which it is able to influence the level of eco¬
nomic activity and the utilization of the nation’s resources, in particular the volume
of investment. The Ministry of Labour and National Service is the channel through
which manpower policy is conducted, for example, the measures taken to attract
workers into key jobs.
During and after the second world war, many operations of industry and com¬
merce were subject to Government control. Most of these controls have been
relaxed, but some remain. Thus, the consent of the Treasury is required for the
issue of large amounts of fresh capital; and that of the Board of Trade for the
import or export of certain goods. The Board of Trade also has certain powers to
influence the location of industry (see pp. 134-5). and the Ministry of Housing
and Local Government, acting through local planning authorities, has powers to
control the use of land (see pp. 39I_7)- .
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office, was
established in 1940 to provide a comprehensive statistical service to assist the
authorities in framing economic and financial policy. Although Departments them¬
selves compile statistics relating to their particular responsibilities, and may pub¬
lish them in their own standard publications; the comprehensive publications, the
Monthly Digest of Statistics and the Annual Abstract of Statistics are prepared
by the Central Statistical Office. It is also the source of the annual estimates of
national income and expenditure published in the annual Economic Survey of the
United Kingdom, issued before the Budget statement.
All Departments which are production authorities, and some others, have a
responsibility for promoting increased productivity and efficiency in industry. Pro¬
duction authorities, for example, encourage the establishment, within each industry
and within individual undertakings, of joint councils and committees in which repre¬
sentatives of employers and of workers discuss together improvements in methods
and technique. They also work with and through various statutory and voluntary
bodies concerned with the same ends, and make grants to them in appropriate
cases. Such bodies include employers’ associations (see pp. 139-4°) and trade unions
(see pp. 282-4); the British Productivity Council (see p. 14?). a voluntary body repre¬
senting employers and trade unions; the various management and professional
associations including the British Institute of Management (see p. 148), the Council
of Industrial Design (see p. 427), and the Development Councils which may be set
up under the provisions of the Industrial Organization and Development Act, 1947,
by Departments responsible for the industry concerned. The purpose of the
Development Councils is to provide firms in an industry with those services
(research, design, statistics, and personnel training) which individual firms cannot
afford out of their own resources. There are at present Development Councils for
the cotton industry {The Cotton Board), and for the furniture industry. The Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 412), whose chief purpose is to
promote the researches which are the main basis of the long-term growth of e
ciency, is also concerned with direct productivity research and with the provision
of a technical advisory service. The national standards organization is the British
Standards Institution, a voluntary non-profit-making body, incorporated by Royal
Charter. It seeks to promote industrial efficiency by voluntary standardization and
simplification, i.e. by getting manufacturers to agree to substitute a defined number

of sizes and qualities of a product where there exists an unnecessary variety. It is
governed by a General Council consisting of representatives of the main organiza¬
tions of employers and workpeople, the professional institutions and the larger
Government Departments, and it receives a Government grant.
The Board of Trade is the Department responsible for co-ordinating official
activities for the promotion of productivity, and has administered, in consultation
with other Departments and with the United States International Co-operation
Administration, the sterling counterpart funds of United States Conditional Aid
which during the years 1953-56 formed an important part of the public funds used
to further higher productivity in trade, industry and agriculture (see p. 147).
The Board of Trade also conducts information activities bearing on the efficiency
of British industry and in particular on methods of increasing industrial produc¬
tivity. It is responsible jointly with the Ministry of Labour and National Service
for the editorial policy of Target, a monthly productivity bulletin circulated to
firms and trade unions.
Technical advice is available for those firms which ask for it through such services
as the National Agricultural Advisory Service of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, and the Personnel Management Advisory Service of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service.
To ensure that industry is fully aware of Government policy and also that policy
is framed with a full knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of
consultative bodies have been set up representing Government, employers’ associa¬
tions and trade unions. Among the more important of these are the National Pro¬
duction Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and the National Joint Advisory
Council (NJAC). The NJAC consists of representatives of private employers, the
boards of nationalized industries and trade unionists, under the chairmanship of
the Minister of Labour and National Service, and is concerned with matters affect¬
ing the relations between employers and workers (see p. 286). The NPACI, which
covers the wider problems of industrial production, is under the chairmanship of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and includes representatives of the Regional Boards for
Industry (see below) and of certain Government Departments as well as of employers
and workers. Northern Ireland has its own Production Council, corresponding to
the NPACI, to the meetings of which it sends two representatives as observers.
An important body, which is purely advisory to the Government rather than a
channel of communication with industry, is the Economic Planning Board. It was
established in 1947 to advise on economic policy; its proceedings are confidential.
The chairman of the Board is one of the two Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury,
and its membership includes representatives of the Treasury, the Board of Trade,
the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Labour and National Service, and
nominees of the Trades Union Congress, the Federation of British Industries and
the British Employers’ Confederation.
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad national
point of view. There are, in addition, consultative bodies concerned with the special
problems of Scotland and Wales and of the English regions. The most important
of these are the Regional Boards for Industry and the corresponding Scottish and
Welsh Boards for Industry, whose main functions are to keep the Government
informed on industrial conditions in the nine English regions and in Wales and
Scotland, and to provide a link between central Government and local industry.
Government and Nationalized Industries
The extent to which the responsible Minister has power over the working
of the Boards, which have been set up to run the nationalized industries varies
INDUSTRY
145
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First the Minister appoints the chairman and members of each Board and
secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how the industry should
be run but does not interfere in day-to-day management. It is usually also laid
down that the Board shall give to the Minister any information, statistics and
financial accounts which he may require. , .
The usual financial arrangement is that the Board is required to conduct is
business so that receipts at least balance outgoings over a period of years. I he
responsible Minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say
what shall be done with any surplus should the Boards make a profit. A new pro¬
cedure for financing the nationalized industries was introduced as part ot the
1056-157 Budget. The capital requirements of these industries are now met from
the Exchequer, bank advances being used only for normal requirements of short¬
term capital once outstanding loans have been repaid.
The Minister responsible for each nationalized industry must take steps to see
that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually done
by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints
and suggestions made to them, and to advise the Board or the Minister on t e
changes they think desirable. It is recognized that these arrangements are still to
a great extent experimental. . . ,
Government policy towards the nationalized industries is subject to the approva
of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by debates,
including debates on the annual reports and accounts of the nationalized industries,
and by answers to parliamentary questions.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalized industries is
informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalize
Industries was established in March 1957- The terms of reference of the Com¬
mittee are to examine the reports and accounts of the nationalized industries estab¬
lished by statute, whose controlling Boards are appointed by Ministers of the
Crown and whose annual receipts are not wholly or mainly derived from money
provided by Parliament or advanced by the Exchequer. , . . ,
In most other respects the nationalized industries have the same relations with
the Departments responsible for them as do the private industries; they look to
them for sponsorship and advice on productivity, and are subject to the same
controls.
Control of Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Competition may be limited either by agreements (whether formal or informal)
among several parties or as a result of monopoly or other restrictive practices
There are separate legislation and procedures for the two forms of impairment of
C°ThetlRestrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, provides for the registration of
restrictive trading agreements (including those relating to common prices, approved
lists of dealers and restriction of production) by the Registrar of Restrictive Tra ing
Agreements. Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not registerable but
have to be notified to the Board of Trade. The Registrar has two mam functions.
First, he maintains the register of agreements which may be inspected by the
public. Secondly, he is responsible for bringing agreements before the Restrictive
Practices Court, set up by the Act, comprising a High Court judge and two lay
members, which has power to determine whether such agreements are in the
public interest. Agreements are presumed to be against the public interest unless
it can be shown that they afford one or more of certain advantages and that the

degree of restriction is not unreasonable. If this cannot be shown, such agreements
are void and, moreover, the Court can make orders to prevent attempts to enforce
them. Monopolies and other arrangements which are not within the scope of the
Court may be referred by the Board of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for
investigation and report. Production Departments (see pp. 140-1) take appropriate
action on the basis of these reports.
The 1956 Act also makes unlawful the maintenance of resale prices by collective
action to withhold supplies or by other collectively enforced discriminatory
arrangements; at the same time the Act strengthens the powers of individual
suppliers to enforce their retail prices through the civil courts.
Prior to the passing of the 1956 Act, a Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Commission, established under the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry
and Control) Act, 1948, had investigated a number of industries. Several industries
modified their practices in accordance with its recommendations.
Production and Productivity
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and
contracting, and gas, electricity and water) which, in 1956, was more than 50 per
cent greater than before the war, increased rapidly in the immediate post-war years
as industry was turned over from war production and manpower was released from
the Armed Forces. It had regained the pre-war level by 1946 and was 15 per cent
greater by 1948. The course of production, employment and productivity since
1948 is shown in Table 15.
TABLE 15
Production, Employment and Output per Man-year in Industry
Trends Expressed as Indices, 1948 = 100
Source: Monthly Digest of Statistics.
The slackening in production, employment and productivity in 1952 was due
mainly to a fall in demand at home and overseas which affected particularly the
consumer goods industries of textiles and clothing. The levelling off in production
in 1956 reflected the fiscal and monetary measures taken to check inflationary
symptoms and to restrain internal demand, which involved some readjustment of
the pattern of industrial output and labour supply.
INDUSTRY
147
Over the post-war period as a whole, the greatest increases in production have
been in the engineering, shipbuilding and electrical goods group, the vehicles
group and chemicals group, with increases between 1948 and 1956 of approxi¬
mately 50 per cent, 60 per cent and 85 per cent respectively.
The increase of productivity has been a constant concern of Government and
industry. During the years 1953-56, the promotion of productivity in the Unlted
Kingdom was greatly assisted by activities financed under the Conditional Aid
Scheme from United States economic aid. The objects of the scheme were the
promotion of productivity in industry and the stimulation of competition. The
programme of activities designed to further these objects provided for the estab¬
lishment or expansion of technical information and advisory services, the promo¬
tion of technological studies, the provision of films and books through which
improved techniques could become better known, and for a programme of studies
in subjects concerned with the improvement of industrial efficiency. The scheme
also provided for the establishment of Revolving Funds to make loans available
to small and medium-sized firms in industry and to agricultural interests. With
the exception of the Revolving Funds the scheme is no longer in operation, but
many of the activities to which it gave rise have stimulated the interest of industry
to the extent that they are being continued independently.
The Board of Trade is the Department chiefly concerned with the promotion of
productivity, but the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and all
Production Departments and Departments dealing with economic matters also
play their part. The Anglo-American Productivity Council, which was wound up
in 1952 after four years of work, performed valuable services in promoting pro¬
ductivity by sending ‘ Productivity Teams ’, made up of representatives of manage¬
ment, technical and workshop levels from a series of British industries, to study
techniques and methods in the United States. . .
The work of the Council has been continued by the British Productivity Council,
formally established in November 1952. This is an independent body on which the
following organizations are represented: the British Employers’ Confederation, the
Federation of British Industries, the Trades Union Congress, the Association of
British Chambers of Commerce, the National Union of Manufacturers and the
nationalized industries. It operates through 72 local productivity committees, 32
local productivity associations and a work study unit, set up in 1954 t° stimulate a
wider appreciation of work study. Its activities include the publication of a monthly
bulletin, a large number of booklets and pamphlets and the making of productivity
films.
Management
There are probably about 400,000 to 500,000 persons in the United Kingdom
who hold managerial posts in commerce or in industry.
During the present century, and particularly during and since the second won
war, there has emerged in the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, a growing awareness
of the importance of management as a subject requiring special skills and know'-
ledge; this has been stimulated partly by the need to raise productivity in order to
compete successfully in world markets, and partly by the conditions of full employ¬
ment and pressure upon supplies of basic commodities such as steel, all combining
to require the most effective employment of men, materials and machinery. Thus,
there is now in the United Kingdom a considerable body of information about,
and interest in, such subjects as the uses of industrial engineering (including work
study, work simplification, plant layout and planned maintenance), the financial
tools of management, such as cost accounting, and the techniques of such matters
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
148
as production planning and product standardization. In addition, increased
attention is being paid to human relations in industry, and to the importance of
communication between management and labour.
A number of specialized management associations have come into being, requir¬
ing educational and other qualifications for membership, while, since the first world
war, the professional engineering institutions have included industrial administra¬
tion in the syllabus of their qualifying examinations.
During the second world war, the need was recognized for a central institution
to co-ordinate education, information and research in management subjects. Soon
after the end of the war a committee was appointed by the President of the Board
of Trade to formulate precise proposals for such an institution, and, following its
report, the British Institute of Management (BIM) was formed in 1947. The Institute
receives a grant-in-aid from the Government, but companies who support it as
corporate subscribers are the main source of finance. Interest in scientific manage¬
ment is widespread; such problems as work study and cost accounting, at one time
the preserve of the specialist, are widely discussed and developed.
Facilities for management training at all levels have been much extended, though
only a minority of managers are members of any management body or have
received systematic training in the principles of management. One of the most
notable recent developments is the growth of work study training courses, whether
run by industries, firms, trade unions or technical colleges. Education for manage¬
ment is developing mainly in four ways:
(1) a national scheme operating through the principal technical and commer¬
cial colleges throughout the United Kingdom;
(2) an external examination system operated by the Institute of Industrial
Administration (now amalgamated with the BIM, see above);
(3) independent courses conducted by universities and adult education centres
including the Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames; and
(4) the training schemes of trade associations, trade unions and individual
firms.
Capital Formation and Investment
In recent years, gross fixed capital formation has accounted for more than one-
seventh of gross national expenditure. In 1956, its volume, as distinct from its
value, was some 40 per cent greater than in 1938 and about 55 per cent greater
than in 1948.
The actual course of fixed capital formation in 1938 and between 1948 and 1956
(at current and constant prices) was as follows:
Year 1938 1948 1950 1952 1953 1 954 1955 1956
l million (current prices) 656 1,435 1,700 2,114 2,368 2,550 2,855 3,088
£ million (1948 prices) 1,559 1,435 1,643 1,673 1,851 2,007 2,132 2,199
Thus, in real terms, investment did not increase significantly between 1950 and
1952. The pressing needs of defence and exports in these years made it necessary
for the Government to take measures to curtail investment. In 1953 it was possible
to reverse this policy of restraint, and incentives were provided in the 1954 Budget.
In the latter half of 1955, the Government took measures to restrain the rate of
growth of internal demand and these were reinforced by the withdrawal of special
investment allowances under the 1956-57 Budget proposals. A high level of invest¬
ment spending was maintained throughout 1956 and the plans for re-equipment

and development already in hand in many industries indicate that capital expendi¬
tures are likely to continue to absorb at least the existing proportion of economic
resources.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialized country relying on
imports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and most
important industries. It employs about 1 million people or 4*3 per cent of those
in civil employment and provides about 4‘5 Per cent of the gross national product,
using 48 million of the 60 million acres of land.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
IS®
THE LAND AND ITS USES
The land in general is highly fertile, and current agricultural practices, founded
upon an age-old tradition of good husbandry improved by the application of
modem scientific methods, result in some of the world’s finest pedigree livestock
and most successful varieties of seeds. Of 120 United Kingdom entries at the 1956
Royal Show of Canada, for instance, 103 gained prizes, including one world
championship, one championship and four reserve championships.
The agricultural industry is less subject to serious dislocation caused by extreme
climatic conditions than it is in some other countries; crops and livestock, for
example, are seldom subjected to the dangers of drought, or floods, or severe cold.
Nevertheless, abnormal climatic conditions such as, in recent years, the severe
winter of 1946-47, the East Coast floods of 1953, and the wet summers of 1954 and
1956, do sometimes occur.
Farms: Numbers and Ownership
There are about 524,000 agricultural holdings (excluding holdings consisting
entirely of rough grazings) in the United Kingdom: 315,000 in England; 55,000
in Wales; 73,000 in Scotland; and 81,000 in Northern Ireland. About three-fifths
of the total holdings are under 50 acres in size (crops and grass, excluding any area
of rough grazings), but 97,000 (18 per cent) are over 100 acres and 15,800 (3 per
cent) over 300 acres.
Many farmers own their own land freehold, but the more usual arrangement is
for a tenant farmer (who has a measure of security of tenure, see p. 160) to operate
the farm and own the stock, crops and equipment, while the landlord owns the
land and buildings, is responsible for their maintenance and is looked to for their
improvement. Returns made in 1950, for the purpose of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization’s World Census, showed that about 36 per cent of
holdings in England and Wales were wholly owned by the occupier; 49 per cent
were wholly rented and 15 per cent were part-owned and part-rented. The propor¬
tion of owner-occupiers was substantially higher in the case of holdings of under
five acres, but did not vary appreciably from size group to size group in the case
of the larger holdings. In general, farms in Britain are run as businesses, each by
a single manager, usually the farmer himself. Most fanners belong to one or more
of the various organizations, such as the National Farmers’ Unions, which exist to
represent their collective interests, and also to agricultural co-operative societies,
which provide them with bulk-purchase and bulk-selling facilities.
Types of Farming
In England and Wales out of a total of 29-7 million acres of agricultural land,
24-5 million acres are under crops and grass, the remainder being rough grazings.
Types of farming vary with difference of soil and climate. In general, the eastern
half of England is devoted predominantly to arable, and the western half of England,
together with Wales, to dairy farming. Pasture farming accounts for 37 per cent
of agricultural land, arable for 22 per cent and mixed farming for 29 per cent, the
remainder being unclassifiable or of little agricultural value. The chief crop is
wheat, followed by barley, oats, mixed com and potatoes. Market gardens are
usually found near towns, but much of the vegetable production is now on arable
and mixed farms. Fattening of animals for food is widespread but is carried on
particularly in the south-eastern and eastern counties and the Midlands; stock¬
rearing is prevalent in Wales and in the North of England.
In Scotland, out of a total of over 15 million acres of agricultural land, 4! million
acres are under crops and grass, the rest being rough hill grazings (about 11 million

acres) or land only able to support deer and game. The chief crop is oats; next
come root crops for stock-feeding; potatoes, especially seed potatoes, and barley
are also important crops. The area under wheat is small. In the south-west, dairy¬
ing is the chief branch of the industry, while cropping and fattening cattle are
carried on mainly in the east. The rearing of stock (especially sheep) is of importance
in the hill areas.
In Northern Ireland, the total of 2 89 million acres of agricultural land in 1956
included 2-21 million acres under crops and pasture. The land is intensively
farmed, the chief crops being potatoes, oats, flax, and ryegrass for seed. Between
80 and 85 per cent of Northern Ireland’s agricultural income is derived from
livestock and livestock products.
Horticulture
It is estimated that horticultural produce is grown on about 70,000 holdings in
the United Kingdom and that, on about 35,000 of these, horticulture is the sole
or major interest. In 1955, approximately 798,000 acres were used for growing
horticultural crops (excluding potatoes) and total output included 2,315,000 tons
of vegetables and 716,500 tons of fruit, which together with flowers and other
horticultural produce had an estimated value of £133-5 million net at the farm.
This is about one-tenth of the value of the total agricultural output of the United
Kingdom.
As a result of improved methods of cultivation and better control of pests and
diseases the output per acre is considerably higher than it was before the second
world war. About 85 per cent of total supplies of vegetables and 50 per cent of
fruit are home-grown.
Although horticultural produce is grown to some extent in all parts of the United
Kingdom, most of the principal growing areas are close to, or within reasonable
reach of, the large consuming centres. Some localities are, however, particularly
suitable for certain crops, e.g., winter cauliflowers in Cornwall, carrots in Norfolk,
pears and cherries in Kent, apples in Kent and Essex, onions in the Fen district,
early strawberries in Hampshire, maincrop strawberries in Kent and Norfolk, and
tomatoes under glass in the Lea Valley and near Worthing. Early vegetables are
supplied from the Channel Islands.
During the second world war, the area devoted to flowers was drastically reduced
by official controls. It has taken the nursery industry some time to recover from
this setback but the output of flowers and nursery stock is now probably greater
than before the war. Certain areas are noted for particular types of production,
e.g., Surrey for ornamental trees and shrubs, Sussex and Essex for fruit trees,
Cornwall and Devon for anemones, Sussex and Hertfordshire for orchids, and the
Isles of Scilly for early bulb flowers.
Smallholdings and Allotments
There are some 19,000 smallholdings provided by county councils and county
borough councils in England and Wales and by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. Of these, some 11,000 are capable of providing a full-time
occupation for the tenant. These smallholdings are let only to people with practical
experience in agriculture, preferably agricultural workers, with the object of afford¬
ing them an opportunity to become farmers on their own account. Loans may be
made to the tenants of up to 75 per cent of the working capital they require.
Of the smallholdings provided by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, approximately 1,000 situated on 18 different estates are managed on the
Minister’s behalf by the Land Settlement Association Limited, which was
INDUSTRY
153
originally formed in 1934 to develop smallholdings for unemployed men from indus¬
trial areas. The Association provides centrally on each estate various services for the
tenants’ use. These services include the supply of agricultural stores and requisites,
the operation of a machinery pool, and the packing and marketing of produce.
The Welsh Land Settlement Society, which was also formed to assist in the settle¬
ment on the land of unemployed industrial workers, created one estate similar to
those of the Land Settlement Association and a number of profit-sharing farms,
which still operate.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central Govern¬
ment, which now owns and maintains some 452,000 acres of Land Settlement
Estates with over 4,200 holdings.
There are also rather more than one million allotments in the United Kingdom;
most of these are allotment gardens1 and about half are permanent statutory allot¬
ments provided by local authorities who, under the Allotments Acts, have the
duty to provide allotments, if practicable, wherever there is a need.
The growing of vegetables and fruit and the keeping of small livestock such as
poultry, rabbits, bees, pigs and goats by gardeners and allotment-holders is wide¬
spread in Britain. Voluntary organizations exist to provide advice, guidance and
trading facilities and generally to assist those interested in such activities. The
National Council for Domestic Food Production, formed in 1951 by the Minister of
Agriculture, co-ordinates the work of these organizations and encourages the
development of domestic food production as a form of self-help, providing social
and recreational benefits.
Scottish Crofts
Crofters are tenant farmers resident in the seven Scottish counties known as
crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty,
Sutherland and Shetland—whose holdings are either rented at less than £5° a
year or are not more than 50 acres in area. In 194?, there were in these counties
20,918 crofts out of a total of 23,209 separate holdings. In i9S2—53> the value of
the annual production of these crofts was £7‘9 million, about half the total agricul¬
tural output of the seven counties and 5 -66 per cent of that of Scotland as a whole.
The problems of the crofting areas—such as declining population and falling
agricultural production—led to new legislation in i955> under which a Crofters
Commission (see p. 159) was appointed to reorganize, develop and regulate crofting.
Changes since 1870
In the middle of the nineteenth century Britain was largely self-sufficient in
agricultural production. Then, wool, grain and, later, meat all produced cheaply
from virgin lands overseas—were increasingly imported and, as a result, the farming
industry had to adapt itself to the changing conditions by concentrating much more
on milk, eggs, pigs and horticultural produce. These changes in production and types
of farming, in successive attempts to meet changes of fortune, resulted in a con¬
tinuous trend away from an agricultural industry based mainly on grain to one
based more on livestock and livestock products and, among crops, an increasing
emphasis on vegetables.
The arable area in Britain declined continuously from 1872 until 1939, except
during the first world war; the meat, dairy and poultry industries becoming in¬
creasingly dependent on imported feedingstuffs. The outbreak of the second world

154
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
war was, however, followed by an immediate reversal of farming practice, for
shortage of shipping space for imports demanded a greatly increased home pro¬
duction of crops for direct human consumption, such as wheat and potatoes, largely
at the expense of livestock and livestock products other than milk. The post-war
world food shortage and Britain’s balance of payments problems made it necessary
for Britain to maintain increased grain production, but since 1947 an expansion
of output of livestock, livestock products and animal feedingstuffs has been en¬
couraged concurrently with the maintenance of a high level of production of grain
and other crops.
Recent Trends
Recent trends in agricultural policy have resulted in greater emphasis on stock¬
rearing for meat and less stress on further increases in milk production.
The use of agricultural land for the various crops (see also map, p. 151) and the
numbers of livestock on farms in the United Kingdom since i924 are shown in

PRODUCTION
Before the second world war, Britain produced about 31 per cent of its food
supply (in terms of calories for human consumption). By 1956 had risen to
nearly 40 per cent, and in terms of value represented about one half compared
with a little over one-third before the war. Imports of food and feedmgstuffs
(including oils and oilseeds) accounted for 45 per cent of total imports pre-war
and 38 per cent in 1956. The percentages by weight of total supplies of certain
foods provided by home production in post-war years compared with the pre-war
average are shown in Table 19.

Production trends since the war for some of the main agricultural products are
shown in Table 20. The increase in agricultural production (of the order of 50
per cent since pre-war) has been achieved in spite of a slow decline in the agricul¬
tural labour force since the war. There has, in fact, been a very large increase in
the productivity of labour due to improved crop and livestock varieties, more
intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides, and greatly increased
mechanization, which has made it possible to work much larger acreages of arable
land. The increase in agricultural production and productivity has been a major
objective of Government policy, and the developments which have conduced to
it have been fostered by assurances, inducements, advisory services and controls.

Mechanization
The estimated number of tractors (excluding small market-garden types) in the
United Kingdom in 1925 was about 21,000, in 1939 about 55,000, and in 1956
about 450,000. Britain has probably the greatest tractor density in the world, one
tractor per 40 acres of arable land. The increase in some of the newer agricultural
machines has been even more notable; thus it is estimated that over 31,000 com¬
bined harvester-threshers were in use in the 1956 harvest; in 1939 there were only

150. As so often happens in agriculture, the solution of one problem creates
another; in a climate such as Britain’s, the widespread use of these combines gives
rise to the need for grain-drying and grain-storage facilities on a substantial scale.
How to provide these on sound technical and economic lines is a problem which
is being studied by the many public and private interests concerned.
Considerable, but as yet not complete, success has attended intensive efforts to
solve the problem of mechanizing the cultivation and harvesting of root crops—
especially potatoes and sugar beet—which make so heavy a seasonal demand on
labour.
Great strides have been made in the development of a wide range of equipment
to assist the production of grass in the various forms silage, hay and dried grass
upon which British farm livestock very largely depends.
Improvement of Crops and Livestock
Improved varieties, the use of new insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, to¬
gether with advances in husbandry methods have led to a steady improvement in
the yield of cereals.
Research at the Grassland Research Institute and elsewhere has directly in¬
fluenced agricultural practice in the production and use of grass. Improved
management of both permanent grass and temporary grass leys and the more
effective utilization of grass by means of ensilage or drying, together with the
extended use of fodder crops, such as kale, help to economize in the use of purchased
feedings tuffs.
Britain is noted for its exports of pedigree livestock and since the end of the
second world war there has been a marked recovery of the export trade in livestock
of high quality (for regulations on livestock breeding see p. 167).
It is mainly the beef breeds (e.g., Shorthorns, Herefords, Aberdeen Angus)
which have made a reputation overseas, but interest in British dairy stock is
increasing. The rise in milk consumption since 194® resulted in concentration
at home on dairy breeds, but many breeds have maintained the dual-purpose type
of qualifications. In Scotland, while milk production has expanded, an even
greater increase in numbers of beef cattle has taken place. Schemes for communal
use of sires are in operation, with special schemes in the Highlands and Islands
for the loan of bulls and rams (free of charge) to communities of smallholders.
Cattle-rearing in the United Kingdom is encouraged by subsidies on calves to be
reared for beef and on hill cows (see p. 163). Northern Ireland sends to Great
Britain all fatstock which is surplus to its own requirements.
MARKETING
During the second world war, marketing of nearly all farm crops was closely
controlled by the Government. A great many of the controls over marketing have
now been removed and free markets now exist for most agricultural products.
Farmers continue the traditional practice of bringing crops and livestock to the
weekly market in the local market town, though an increasing amount of business
is also done by telephone and correspondence, or through co-operative marketing
societies. Such societies are especially active in egg-packing, in which they handle
40 per cent of the national trade, and are an appreciable factor in the marketing of
grain and potatoes, fruit and vegetables, bacon and livestock.
For certain commodities, however. statutory marketing schemes have been estab¬
lished through the setting-up of marketing boards and other arrangements (see
p. 166), while for all the main agricultural products (but not for fruit and vege¬
tables) the Government operates a system of price guarantees and makes deficiency
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
158
payments which are usually intended to cover any shortfall of average market
prices below the guaranteed prices (see pp. 161-2).
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The Government has wide functions in relation to agriculture, and almost all
of these functions are exercised by the Agricultural Departments, i.e. the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in England and Wales, the Department of
Agriculture for Scotland, and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
The severe agricultural depression which followed the fall in the general price
level after 1920 resulted in 1931 in the introduction of forms of protection and
financial assistance for agriculture. Commodity commissions were set up, for
various agricultural products, with the responsibility of administering Government
subsidies or other forms of direct financial assistance for the production of those
commodities with which they were concerned. In addition, producer-controlled
marketing boards were established with powers to regulate the marketing of par¬
ticular products.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agricultural
production and marketing were closely controlled by the State, and county war
agricultural executive committees, composed of local representatives of agricul¬
tural interests, acted as the Government’s local agents, as did similar committees
during the first world war. As a result of Government control, the functions of
marketing boards, commodity commissions and similar bodies were largely sus¬
pended. Most of these organizations have now had their powers restored to them
or their functions have been superseded by other arrangements.
The main basis of present agricultural policy and the powers to implement it
are provided in England and Wales by the Agriculture Act, 1947) and in Scotland
and Northern Ireland by similar Acts passed in 1948 and 1949 respectively. The
main principle underlying these Acts is to secure ‘ a stable and efficient agricultural
industry capable of producing such part of the nation’s food and other agricultural
produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom,
and of producing it at minimum prices consistent with proper remuneration and
living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return
on capital invested in the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered
to provide guaranteed prices for the main agricultural products and to afford
security of tenure to tenant farmers. In return for these guarantees, the Govern¬
ment expects farmers and landowners to maintain a minimum level of efficiency
in husbandry and estate management and has powers to enforce this.
When the Acts first came into force, during the period of post-war control, they
were administered in conjunction with a system of State purchase of food, far-
reaching controls over agricultural production and marketing, and food rationing.
In 1947, plans were made to secure an increase by 1952 in the volume of annual
agricultural net output to about 50 per cent above the pre-war level. This objective
was in fact achieved, the official index number (pre-war average = 100) being 153
for 1952-53. The index number for 1956-57 is provisionally 159 (see Table 20).
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own agricultural production and trading
position have improved in the last few years, the Government has gradually
restored to private business both the import of food and all domestic trading in
food. All consumer rationing of food ended in Britain on 3rd July, 1954- But the
Agriculture Acts with their basic principles, including guarantees to farmers,
have remained.
The ending of the period of control over agricultural production was accompanied
by some change in emphasis of the objectives of agricultural policy. Economic and
INDUSTRY
159
efficient production in accordance with market requirements, increasing technical
efficiency, diminishing unit cost, and economies in the use of imported feedingstuffs
have been emphasized rather than maximum production of end products.
The Government continues to look to the following means of increasing the net
output of the industry:
(1) more beef production; and more mutton and lamb (particularly if unit
costs of production can be reduced);
(2) continued and steady improvement in crop yields; and
(3) a saving in the heavy bill for feed imports by (a) more ley farming,
improved management and use of grass, and (b) skill and economy in the
use of concentrated feedingstuffs.
The Government’s long-term objective is to achieve a steady improvement in
the competitive position of the industry.
County Agricultural Executive Committees
In England and Wales, County Agricultural Executive Committees (CAECs),
which superseded the County War Agricultural Executive Committees, were set
up under the provisions of the Agriculture Act, 1947- In Scotland, 11 similar
bodies, now known as Agricultural Executive Committees, were set up, while in
Northern Ireland each county has a Committee of Agriculture which acts mainly
in an advisory capacity to the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. An
Agricultural Executive Officer, working directly under the Northern Ireland
Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for carrying out the Government’s
agricultural policy in each county.
Each County Agricultural Executive Committee in England and Wales consists
of 12 members. Five are appointed directly by the Minister, and seven from panels
nominated by the interests concerned, three being farmers, two landowners and
two agricultural workers. The Committees, which are represented locally by Dis¬
trict Committees, are charged with promoting agricultural development and effi¬
ciency and have in fact acted as local agents for the implementation of Government
policy. Technical and office staffs of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food are attached to the committees to help them to carry out their work.
In practice, the Committees have hitherto been concerned partly with the admini¬
stration of controls, partly with the administration of trading services, subsidies
and routine executive work and partly with the provision of technical and advisory
services. The present aim, however, is to reduce their participation in routine
executive, subsidy and trading service work so that they may concentrate mainly
on assisting the Minister in formulating agricultural policy and on promoting
technical development and advisory work in their localities.
The Crofters Commission
The Crofters Commission was set up under the Crofters (Scotland) Act, 1955,
to reorganize, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties of Scotland
(see p. 153), to promote the interests of crofters there and to keep under review
matters relating to crofting. In particular, when a croft becomes vacant, the land¬
lord is required to notify the Crofters Commission and to advise it of his proposals
for letting the croft. The Commission has power to approve or veto these pro¬
posals, to require that a vacant croft be let as an enlargement to another croft,
and generally to ensure that all vacant crofts are let in the best interests of the
crofting communities. For the same purpose the Commission has power to dis¬
possess absentee tenants who are, however, able to retain their croft houses in
i6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
certain circumstances. Aged persons who are unable to cultivate their land may,
with the Commission’s approval, give up their land while still remaining in occupa¬
tion of their houses. The Commission has special power to carry out the reorgani¬
zation of derelict or decaying ‘ townships ’ if a majority of the resident crofters are in
favour of the scheme. Such a scheme provides for the reallocation of the land in
the township in a way which, in the Commission’s opinion, would lead to the proper
and efficient use of the land and the general benefit of the township. The Com¬
mission has powers to ensure that crofters work their crofts according to the rules
of good husbandry, and it is responsible for approving regulations governing the
use of common grazings. The Commission acts as agent of the Secretary of State
for Scotland in the administration of schemes of loans and grants for the develop¬
ment of agricultural production on crofts.
These powers are designed to enable the Crofters Commission to ensure that
the fullest use is made of crofting lands. The economic well-being of the crofting
communities, however, depends also on developments in other directions, and the
Commission has the specific duty of collaborating with other bodies in carrying
out measures for economic development and social improvement.
SECURITY OF TENURE
Successful farming is a long-term business and adequate security of tenure helps
the good farming tenant to plan ahead. The effect of the legislation passed after
the war was to give the farming tenant a considerable measure of security of tenure
and at the same time to confer power on the Government to insist on good farming
and to discipline bad farmers, even if they are owner-occupiers.
In England and Wales, the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923. required at least
twelve months’ notice to be given to quit an agricultural holding and gave the
tenant a right to compensation for disturbance on leaving his holding; a tenant
had no statutory right of contesting the notice to quit. The Agricultural Holdings
Act, 1948, gave the tenant the right in normal circumstances to contest a notice
to quit, which would then have to be referred to the County Agricultural Executive
Committee (acting for the Minister); either tenant or landlord could then appeal
against the committee’s decision to an Agricultural Land Tribunal (see p. 161). The
Scottish Act of 1949 applied similar provisions to Scotland, with a right of appeal
to the Scottish Land Court. There are no farm landlords in Northern Ireland,
where, under various Acts passed between 1870 and 1925, every farmer is either
the owner, or is in process of becoming the owner, of his holding.
Under the Agriculture Act, 1947, however, the Minister of Agriculture was
given the power to place under supervision an owner or occupier considered guilty
of bad estate management or bad husbandry. This power he has delegated to the
County Agricultural Executive Committees. If the owner or occupier fails to
show satisfactory improvement in his standard of management or of husbandry
after twelve months under supervision, or earlier if he has failed to comply with a
direction, he may be dispossessed. Dispossession of an owner implies compulsory
purchase. Dispossession of an occupier means that his occupation is terminated
and the new occupier has to be approved by the Committee. An owner or occupier
may appeal to an Agricultural Land Tribunal against a proposal that he should
be dispossessed.
The Committees referred to above reported that they had met with a variety of
conflicting opinions on the operation of these provisions of the 1947 and 1948 Acts.
In June 1956, the Minister announced the opening of discussions with the organi¬
zations concerned, to review this matter.
INDUSTRY
161
Agricultural Land Tribunals
Agricultural Land Tribunals, which are independent bodies each consisting of
a chairman appointed by the Lord Chancellor (usually for three years), and two
members representing landowners and farmers appointed by the chairman from
panels nominated by the Lord Chancellor after consulting representative bodies,
were originally set up in England and Wales in 1948 under the Agriculture Act,
1947. Their task is to hear and to decide cases in which decisions and proposals
(generally notices to quit or proposals to dispossess) of the Minister of Agriculture,
or of the County Agricultural Executive Committees acting on his behalf, are
referred to them at the request of one of the parties concerned. Under new regula¬
tions made in 1954 a Tribunal may, at the request of any interested party or at the
direction of the Court, refer questions of law to the High Court of Justice.
PRICE GUARANTEES
In accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture Acts, the Agricultural
Departments, in consultation with the farmers’ representatives, hold annual reviews
of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry, and guaranteed
prices are determined in the light of these reviews. The Acts also provide for special
reviews to be held at any time if the Ministers concerned consider that there has
been a sudden substantial change in costs or other conditions.
In practice, annual reviews have been held normally in February, and price
guarantees, which may be related to the level of output of particular products, have
been determined for livestock and livestock products for the next year, and for
crops to be harvested in the year following that in which the review was held.
Further assistance has also been given by production grants. In addition, at alter¬
nate annual reviews, minimum prices for livestock and their products have been
fixed for two to four years ahead.
One of the main criticisms of these arrangements has been that annual reviews
make for uncertainty and afford assurance for only a short time ahead, while the
minimum prices determined every other year for livestock and livestock products
have not proved as effective as was intended, since the circumstances at the time
at which they became operative cannot be taken into account when they are
determined.
Following the 1956 Annual Review, the Government held a series of discussions
with the farmers’ representatives to consider whether any practicable methods of
providing long-term assurances of support for the industry could be devised. In a
White Paper (Cmnd. 23) published in November 1956, the Government announced
new long-term assurances for agriculture, which were welcomed by the farmers’
representatives as a sound and satisfactory basis for future confidence and the
necessary forward planning of the industry. The Agriculture Act, i957> among
other provisions, gives statutory form to these assurances.
Subject to the new assurances, annual reviews will continue broadly as in the
past; special reviews will also be subject to new arrangements. The total value of
the guarantees and production grants will be maintained each year at not less than
97'5 per cent of the total value of the guarantees in the preceding year, adding
cost increases or subtracting cost decreases on review commodities since the last
annual review. The guaranteed price for each review commodity will be maintained
each year at not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous year, with a provision,
in the case of livestock and livestock products, that, in any period of three years,
reductions in the guaranteed price for a particular commodity will not amount in
total to more than 9 per cent. Crop guarantees will be determined after each annual

review for the immediately succeeding harvest instead of for the harvest of the
following year, so that costs and other circumstances affecting the farmers’ liveli¬
hood are less likely to change radically between the determination of the guarantee
and the harvest to which it relates. These new arrangements were observed by
the Government at the 1957 Annual Review, and the Agriculture Act, 1957. gave
statutory effect to them. To help the industry to increase its working efficiency,
a major new scheme of grants for assisting the provision of permanent fixed equip¬
ment on farms and the making of long-term improvements to land was also
announced.
The guaranteed prices determined at the Annual Reviews fall broadly into three
different groups—deficiency payments schemes, fixed guarantee prices, and mini¬
mum or support prices.
Deficiency payments schemes, under which the Government determines a standard
price for a particular commodity and pays each producer the deficiency, if any,
between this price and the average realized market price multiplied by the volume
of his sales, apply to wheat, rye, barley and oats; but for barley and oats the price
deficiency is converted into a payment per acre. This method also applies to fat
cattle (except fat cows), fat sheep, fat lambs and fat pigs. The guarantee is to pro¬
ducers collectively; it safeguards the incomes of producers as a whole, and thus
the individual producer may get more or less than the standard price depending
on the return he realizes from the market. A similar method applies to milk, but
the guarantee is to the five Milk Marketing Boards in the United Kingdom, which
are responsible for determining monthly prices to producers. The Government pays
each Board any deficit between its net commercial returns and its entitlement
under the guarantee, subject to a profit-and-loss sharing arrangement designed to
encourage efficient marketing. The guaranteed price for milk to each Board also
applies only to a standard quantity, so that if total sales of milk exceed this, the
effective level of the guaranteed price per gallon is reduced.
Fixed guarantee prices, the general form of guarantee before the return to free
markets, continue to apply to sugar beet and to wool. The British Sugar Corpora¬
tion buys beet according to a scale of fixed prices related to sugar content. The
wool guarantee is operated through the Wool Marketing Board; a guarantee of
the Board’s gross return enables the Board to fix producers’ prices in advance,
after making an allowance for wholesale marketing costs. Receipts in excess of the
guarantee are paid into a price stabilization fund and only a part of the excess is
retained by the Board. This arrangement is designed to encourage the Board to
market efficiently.
Minimum or support prices apply to eggs and potatoes and are intended to protect
farmers from low prices resulting from periodic gluts. Guarantees for eggs,
announced in the Annual Review and Determination of Guarantees, 1957 (Cmnd.
109), are implemented through the British Egg Marketing Board (BEMB), under
the British Egg Marketing Scheme, 1956, confirmed by producers in 1957 (see
p. 167). Potatoes have been guaranteed since the 1955 crop, but in Great Britain
the support price arrangements are operated on behalf of the Government by the
Potato Marketing Board, which bears a small proportion of any loss incurred in
administering the guarantee.
OTHER SUBSIDIES AND GRANTS
Besides providing financial stability through guarantees to farmers, the State
promotes efficiency by various other subsidies and grants aimed at encouraging
the full use and development of the land. The estimated total cost of subsidies

Crops and Grass
The aim of the Government is to see on each farm the most profitable balance
between crop and grass production, with, for the country as a whole, the main¬
tenance of a large arable acreage. Financial assistance is therefore given to farmers
for ploughing up grassland.
Drainage and Water Schemes
The State makes substantial contributions towards the cost of land drainage and
water supply in Britain. In England and Wales, for example, under various Acts,
grants for farm drainage may be up to 50 per cent of the approved cost; for main
river drainage they can range up to 80 per cent. Farm water supply grants are at the
rate of 25 per cent of the approved cost where the connection is to a public main,
and 40 per cent where a private source is utilized. Separate legislation provides
grants for these services in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Improvement of Livestock Rearing Land in Upland Areas
The Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts provide for grants for owners
and occupiers of livestock rearing land in upland areas who wish to put their farms
into sound working order. The Acts also apply to some areas, e.g., Orkney and
Caithness, which are not much above sea level. The object is to encourage the
breeding and rearing of store cattle and store sheep (i.e. cattle and sheep for further
fattening, not for immediate slaughter). Grants are at the rate of 50 per cent of
the cost of work done. The total amount available for grant in the United Kingdom
is £25 million and this can be increased by £2 million if necessary.
Silo Grants
Grants amounting to about half the cost are available under the Agriculture
(Silo Subsidy) Act, 1956, for constructing and improving silos. About 3-4 million
tons of silage was produced in the United Kingdom in 1956.
Grants for Crofters
Special schemes of assistance for developing agricultural production on crofts
were announced in July 1956. These are the Crofters Agricultural Grants (Scotland)
Scheme, 1956, and the Crofters Livestock Purchase Loans (Scotland) Scheme,
1956, both of which are administered by the Crofters Commission (see p. 159)-
Under the first scheme, grants ranging up to 85 per cent are available for a wide
range of agricultural operations and improvement to land equipment. The second
enables loans of from £100 to £500 at an initial interest of 6J per cent to be given,
for the purchase of livestock, to incoming tenants of crofts or to crofters who have
enlarged their crofts or their shares in sheep stocks held in common. Other schemes
operated by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland provide grants and loans
to crofters for erecting and improving houses and farm buildings, and loans to
incoming tenants to enable them to take over their crofts.
Premiums for Cattle Farmers
Premiums are paid to producers of tuberculin tested (TT) milk (see pp. 163 and
167) and in respect of attested herds. Subsidies are given on calves to be reared for
beef and on hill cows.
Marginal Production Schemes
To help farmers in England and Wales to undertake work such as liming, manur¬
ing, re-seeding, repairing farm roads and reclaiming derelict land, marginal produc¬
tion schemes have been implemented under the Agriculture Act, 1947* Under a new
INDUSTRY
i65
scheme effective from 1st August, 1956, farmers who regularly have no margin of
profit to plough back in improvements because their farms are handicapped by
poor soil, remoteness or other factors beyond their control, may be given assistance
up to a total of 85 per cent (including other grants and subsidies) of the cost. Other
farmers may be assisted up to 50 per cent of the net cost (i.e. cost less other grants
and subsidies) if the work calls for an investment too heavy to show a return in a
reasonable time after charging interest and capital repayments over a period.
Farm Improvement Scheme
The Agriculture Act, 1957, provides for a farm improvement scheme, under
which, grants, up to a maximum of £50 million for farm improvements and
amalgamations, are available for ten years. There is also provision for extending
this period to twelve years and the amount to £55 million, if Parliament approves.
The rate of grant is 33^ per cent, and the grants cover the provision or improve¬
ment of permanent fixed equipment on farms and long-term improvements to
agricultural land.
Loan Facilities
Short-term finance for farmers and landlords has usually been provided by the
commercial banks and long-term finance by the raising of mortgages.
In England and Wales, long-term finance for agricultural properties is provided
by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (see also p. 313), established under the
provisions of the Agricultural Credits Acts, 1928 and 1932, principally for the
purposes of making loans on first mortgages of agricultural or farming estates,
properties or lands in Great Britain and of making loans in accordance with the
Improvement of Lands Acts, 1864 and 1899, for effecting or paying for certain
improvements to agricultural lands and buildings. The Corporation’s funds are
derived mainly from the proceeds of various issues of debenture stocks which are
subscribed by the public and are repaid by the operation of sinking funds. The
Corporation’s reserves include a Guarantee Fund, for which it may raise money
under the Agricultural Credits Act, 1928, the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act, 1944, and the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Act, 1956, in the form of
interest-free loans from the Government up to a total of £3 -25 million. In Scotland,
loans on favourable terms for agricultural purposes on the security of agricultural
land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation
Limited (see also p. 313), a limited company set up in accordance with the pro¬
visions of the Agricultural Credits (Scotland) Act, 1929. Both the Corporations
at present receive grants from the Treasury towards any deficit in their respective
annual Profit and Loss Accounts.
Landowners in England and Wales may also obtain loans for the purpose of
carrying out certain improvements to agricultural land and buildings from the
Lands Improvement Company, in accordance with the Improvement of Lands Acts,
1864 and 1899. The amount of the loan is charged on the land improved, in the
form of a terminable rent-charge payable half-yearly for a period not exceeding
40 years. This type of improvement loan, which may also be obtained from the
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, requires the sanction of the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food, but the Ministry does not itself provide the necessary
funds.
In Northern Ireland, loans are available to farmers for a wide range of purposes
from the Agricultural Loans Fund set up under the Development Loans Act
(Northern Ireland), 1945, and administered by the Northern Ireland Ministry of
j56 Britain: an official handbook
Agriculture. The moneys required to finance the Fund are provided out of the
Consolidated Fund subject to a statutory limit of £2 million.
The bulk of the loans issued are for short-term periods up to five years for such
items as agricultural machinery but, in the case of buildings, the period may be
extended to thirty years. No loans are advanced for land purchased. Interest is
charged at rates comparable with those fixed by the Agricultural Mortgage Corpora¬
tion, and any deficiency in the income on the Fund arising in any financial year is
met out of moneys provided by the Northern Ireland Parliament.
REGULATION AND CONTROL
While the Government provides every incentive to the farmer to farm efficiently,
it also tries to ensure high standards of farming by various schemes of regulation
and control.
Statutory Marketing Arrangements
Statutory regulations for the control of agricultural marketing are contained in
many Marketing Ordinances. Such regulations are designed to improve marketing
methods, to ensure that the producer of the best quality produce gets the best
return for his efforts, and to protect the consumer. Regulations can usually be
enforced only after the majority of the producers have indicated their approval.
Control is exercised in some cases through statutory marketing boards and
sometimes by other arrangements.
Marketing Boards under the Agricultural Marketing Acts, 1931 to 1949
Marketing boards are producers’ organizations with compulsory powers to
regulate the marketing of particular agricultural products by producers. The
schemes under which they are constituted and operated must be approved by
Parliament and confirmed by poll of the producers concerned. A marketing board
must normally consist of from eight to twenty-four members; not fewer than two
and not more than one-fifth of the total number must be appointed by the Minister
or Ministers concerned. _ . , • ,1
In general, the Government has declared that it will consider sympathetically
proposals for producer marketing boards, although each commodity is considered
separately on its merits. In appropriate cases the Government is also prepared to
allow the price guarantees to be operated through marketing boards.
Wool is marketed through the British Wool Marketing Board and marketing
powers were restored to the Milk Marketing Boards on xst April, 1954> although
for as long as there remains an element of consumer subsidy the Government will
continue to be responsible for approved prices and distributive margins for milk.
A Potato Marketing Scheme for Great Britain came into force in May 1955- It
re-enacts and revises the pre-war scheme and has the same objectives the stabili¬
zation of the market and the improvement and quality of marketing. The Hops
Marketing Board is responsible for the marketing of all hops, while the Tomato
and Cucumber Marketing Board has only limited regulatory powers. The Pigs and
Bacon Marketing Schemes, which have been suspended under Defence Regula¬
tions since the outbreak of the second world war, will be revoked and replaced by
a new Pig Industry Development Authority which is soon to be set up (see p. 168).
The British Egg Marketing Scheme, promoted by the National Farmers’ Unions,
was approved by Parliament in December 1956, and confirmed by a poll of pro¬
ducers in April 1957. The scheme covers all producers with more than 50 head of
live poultry over the age of six months. Registered producers are obliged to sell
their eggs to the British Egg Marketing Board through packing stations where
INDUSTRY
167
they are graded, tested and stamped, but producers who wish to sell their eggs
direct to consumers or retailers are entitled to a licence authorizing them to do so,
subject to certain limited conditions which the Board may impose. Only eggs sold
to the Board qualify for the price guaranteed under the Agriculture Act, 1947-
In Northern Ireland, schemes for the marketing of two products, pigs and milk,
are at present in operation.
Consumers’ Committees to represent the consumers’ interests in regard to the
operation of marketing schemes were reconstituted in December 1953. They had
been set up in 1931 but did not meet during the war and immediate post-war years.
Committees of Investigation, to consider reports of the Consumers’ Committees
and complaints from persons other than consumers affected by the operation of
marketing schemes, were reconstituted in April 1950.
Livestock Regulation
In order to ensure sound breeding, bulls have to be licensed. Artificial insemina¬
tion (AI) centres, which are officially licensed, cover the whole of England and
Wales. One calf in every two born in England and Wales is the result of AI. Licensed
centres are also operating in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, AI is carried out at
centres under the control of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture.
Boars also have to be licensed. A national pig recording scheme was introduced
in England and Wales in 1954, and five boar progeny testing stations are being
opened in Great Britain.
To raise the standard of poultry stock in England and Wales there is a Poultry
Stock Improvement Plan under which breeding stations and hatcheries are accre¬
dited and approved. There are three official poultry progeny testing stations in
England and Wales and a further station is being set up in Scotland which has its
own accreditation scheme for poultry breeders and hatcheries. A similar scheme is
operated in Northern Ireland.
Regulation of Milk Distribution
Milk distributors in Great Britain must be registered, and regulations lay down
conditions under which milk is produced, handled, treated, stored and distributed.
Subject to licence, milk may be sold under special designations Pasteurized ,
‘Sterilized’, ‘Tuberculin Tested’ (TT) and also, in Scotland only, ‘Certified’.
In areas specified by Orders it is obligatory to retail only specially designated
milk, and milk which is not sold as Tuberculin Tested (or as Certified, in Scotland)
must be heat-treated. In Britain, 90 per cent of the population now drink tuber¬
culin tested, pasteurized or sterilized milk.
In Northern Ireland, milk has been paid for on a quality basis since 1934. The
whole of Northern Ireland is now a ‘safe milk’ area.
Control of Animal Diseases
Under a plan introduced in October 195° f°r the eradication of bovine tuber¬
culosis on an area basis, many areas have already been cleared; it is expected that
within five years Britain will be free from bovine tuberculosis. At end-1956
there were 170,000 attested (clean) herds (nearly 7 million cattle) in Great Britain.
Northern Ireland has had an Attested Herds Scheme in operation since 1949-
The Diseases of Animals Act, 1950, gives the Government wide powers for the
control of diseases. This control may take the form of regulation of internal move¬
ments of stock, or of compulsory slaughter of animals and poultry affected by
certain notifiable diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease and fowl pest). Compensa¬
tion is generally payable for stock slaughtered. 1 he Act, and Orders made under
M
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
168
it, also restrict the import of certain types of livestock, animal products, and veter¬
inary therapeutic substances. Research into animal diseases is carried on at several
centres, including one at Pirbright, Surrey, which has the world’s largest collection
of foot-and-mouth disease virus.
Development of the Pig Industry
In November 1956, the Government announced its intention to set up a Pig
Industry Development Authority which would carry out a programme of improve¬
ments in pig production, processing and distribution. Its powers would include
operation of a National Pig Recording Scheme, supervision of progeny testing,
introduction of an Accredited Herds Scheme, development of a national artificial
insemination service for pigs, financing of research and development work, im¬
provement of market intelligence, and the establishment of a British Bacon Mark.
To finance its activities, which are expected to cost up to £500,000 annually in
the early years, the Authority would be empowered to impose a levy on every
pig slaughtered. The proposals would apply to Great Britain only and not to
Northern Ireland where the Ministry of Agriculture (Northern Ireland) in con¬
sultation with the Pig Advisory Committee—a statutory body—is responsible for
functions similar to those proposed for the Pig Industry Development Authority
in Great Britain. These proposals were given statutory form in the Agriculture
Act, 1957.
The Agricultural Land Commission
The Agricultural Land Commission was set up under the Agriculture Act, 1947-
Its functions are to manage and to farm lands vested in the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, or land for which he has become responsible, and to advise and
assist the Minister in matters relating to the management of agricultural land. The
Commission’s functions in Wales are delegated to the Welsh Agricultural Land Sub-
Commission. At 31st March, 1956,216,254 acres were under the control of the Com¬
mission and almost all of this land was let to private farmers. Nearly half of the
land was agricultural land intermixed with other land used by the Forestry Com¬
mission. About one-sixth consisted of disused airfields and other land formerly
held by various Government Departments; another sixth comprised an estate
accepted by the Government in lieu of death duties; and the remainder was mostly
land acquired by the Minister to ensure its full and efficient use for agriculture. Early
in 1954 the Minister decided, after consultation with the Commission, to sell land
managed by it wherever that could suitably be done.
In Scotland, the management of lands vested in the Secretary of State and the
duty of advising him on management matters are carried out by the Department
of Agriculture.
AGRICULTURAL ADVISORY SERVICES
There are a number of agricultural advisory services which operate under
Government auspices.
The National Agricultural Advisory Service
Free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural matters is available to
every farmer and grower in England and Wales through the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture’s National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS).
Every county has a County Agricultural Officer in charge of advisory work and
is divided into districts in each of which there is a District Advisory Officer who
acts as a general adviser to farmers. The District Officer can call on an extensive
system of specialist advisers. Advisers in livestock husbandry, milk production,
INDUSTRY
169
farm machinery, poultry husbandry, and horticulture are available in each county;
at the 12 provincial centres and sub-centres there are senior advisers in these
subjects and in crop and grassland husbandry, besides specialists in animal nutri¬
tion, bacteriology, soil chemistry, plant diseases, and plant pests. These centres
are equipped with laboratories for the analysis of soils and feedingstuffs, and for
the diagnosis of crop pests and diseases. The advisers work in close consultation
with the Ministry’s Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire.
In Scotland, the advisory services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on
the three agricultural colleges. Northern Ireland has its own separate advisory
service which is closely linked with the research and experimental divisions (see
P- ^o)- T • , 1
Facilities are provided at the NAAS Experimental Farms and Horticultural
Stations in England and Wales and at Agricultural College Centres in Scotland
for field-scale extensions of research work and investigations of local problems.
Experiments are also carried out at provincial advisory centres and on commercial
farms.
Agricultural Improvement Councils
The Agricultural Improvement Council (AIC) for England and Wales and the
Scottish Agricultural Improvement Council advise the Agricultural Departments on
the application of the results of scientific investigation to farming practice and on
problems requiring investigation. The AIC is also concerned with the problems
of estate management including buildings and fixed equipment.
The Agricultural Land Service
The main functions of this service are:
(1) to advise owners of agricultural land, whether landlords or owner-
occupiers, on estate management matters, including farm buildings and
other fixed equipment;
(2) to provide professional advice and services to the Minister, the Agricul¬
tural Land Commission and County Agricultural Executive Committees
on all matters relating to agricultural land, including: the purchase and
sale of land by the Minister; the management of land owned by or in the
possession of the Minister; the exercise of the Minister’s powers for
securing good estate management and good husbandry and of his functions
under the Agricultural Ploldings Act, i94^> the provision of grant-aid
under the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts and of marginal pro¬
duction assistance; and the provision and management of smallholdings
and allotments by local authorities; and
(3) to advise the Minister and local planning authorities on the agricultural
aspects of planning and the release of agricultural land for other develop¬
ment including afforestation.
In Scotland, similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department of
Agriculture.
Veterinary Services
There is a comprehensive State Veterinary Service which, in Great Britain, is
administered by the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and in
Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. It consists of
a field staff, research workers, and an investigation service which acts as a link
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
170
between the field staff, veterinary surgeons in private practice and the research
laboratories. In Scotland the investigation service is linked with agricultural teach¬
ing institutions and is not part of the Government service.
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Agricultural research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agricultural
Research Council (for the functions of the Council see pp. 413-14; for lists of the
research institutes under its direct and indirect control see Appendix II, pp. 461-2).
The exchange of information on research in Commonwealth and other countries
takes place through the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux
and Institutes (ten Bureaux and two Institutes in the United Kingdom and one
Institute in Canada, see p. 421).
In England and Wales, research and advice are combined in the Provincial
Agricultural Economics Service, attached to the universities and organized in ten
economic advisory centres. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the staff
of the three Agricultural Colleges, and the Department of Agriculture has a Farm
Economics Branch.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture, which also has its Farm Eco¬
nomics Branch, has, in addition, its own research divisions investigating problems
of animal and crop production. The research divisions work in close touch with
the Ministry’s county advisory staffs, and also provide technical advisory services
for the farmer. A very close link has been forged between the Queen’s University
of Belfast and the research divisions, since certain officers of the latter are pro¬
fessors and lecturers in the University Faculty of Agriculture. Control is also
exercised by the Plant Disease Division in the disinfection of all flax seed sown
in Northern Ireland. A well-equipped Dairy Bacteriology Division keeps a watch¬
ful eye on the maintenance of the hygienic standards laid down for the production
and handling of milk. At Hillsborough, in County Down, the Northern Ireland
Agricultural Research Institute owns and operates a farm of some 500 acres. The
Institute is endowed from public funds, and the officers of the Ministry’s Research
Division are afforded facilities for carrying out their field experiments. Thus there
is a close integration of research, education and advisory work in these research
divisions.
Industrial concerns manufacturing such products as weed-killers, insecticides
and fertilizers undertake research on a considerable scale and have been responsible
for developing new and improved products in their particular spheres.
Eight universities in England and Wales (Cambridge, Durham, Feeds, Fondon,
Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, and the University of Wales), and three in Scotland
(Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen) provide degree courses in agriculture, which
are of particular value for intending research workers, advisory officers, teachers
and other specialists. The University of Bristol offers postgraduate diploma courses.
In Northern Ireland, a degree course is provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Two-year diploma courses are given at five Agricultural Colleges and at two of
the Farm Institutes in England and Wales; three Agricultural Colleges in Scotland
give two-year to three-year diploma courses. These are intended mainly for farmers
and farm managers, and are a preparation for the national diplomas in agriculture,
dairying, horticulture, poultry husbandry and agricultural engineering. In Northern
Ireland, there are three Agricultural Colleges. The Ministry of Agriculture main¬
tains a Horticultural Centre at Foughgall, County Armagh, at which problems of
special interest to Northern Ireland are investigated.
There are 36 Agricultural and Horticultural Institutes in England and Wales
run by local education authorities. They provide courses in general agriculture,
INDUSTRY
171
dairying, poultry, horticulture and poultry husbandry. Courses are usually for one
year of about 36 working weeks. The courses are designed for those wishing to
become skilled workers in the industry. Local education authorities also provide
a wide range of short courses and classes for farmers, farmworkers, horticulturists
and domestic producers.
An important means of voluntary informal education in agriculture is provided
by Young Farmers' Clubs, which flourish in villages and towns throughout the
United Kingdom. There are over 1,800 clubs in Britain with nearly 82,000
members, mostly under the age of 25. Each club is self-governing but has the
support of an advisory committee of farmers and other adults. Clubs are combined
in county federations and in National Federations for England and Wales (founded
in 1932), Scotland (in 1937), and Northern Ireland (in 1929).
Government assistance is given to develop rural crafts and industries. The
Development Commission—a non-departmental organization, consisting of eight
Commissioners appointed by the Crown—was set up under the Development and
Road Improvement Fund Acts of 1909 and 1910 to advise the Treasury on advances
from the Development Fund. The purposes of this Fund are now confined to the
development of rural industries and amenities, the construction and improvement
of fishery harbours and the development and improvement of fisheries. The main
agencies helping the Commissioners to carry out this work in regard to rural
industries are, in England and Wales, the voluntary Rural Community Councils
with their Rural Industries Committees, the Government-financed Rural Industries
Bureau founded in 1921, and Rural Industries Loan Fund Ltd., started in 1940.
On the recommendation of the Rural Community Councils, the Rural Industries
Bureau provides technical advice and instruction to assist craftsmen, who may
be granted loans from the Loan Fund to help them to increase their efficiency. In
Scotland, the body corresponding to the Rural Industries Bureau is the Scottish
Country Industries Development Trust, founded in 1935, which, in the absence of
Rural Community Councils in Scotland, exercises more direct control over rural
development.
Since the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, schemes in Northern Ireland are
no longer eligible for grants from the Development Fund.
A Museum of English Rural Life was established by the University of Reading
in 1951 as a national centre for the study of material connected with the history
of the countryside. It was opened to the public in April 1955.
A large number of Agricultural Shows held annually throughout Britain focus
attention on modern farming methods and equipment. The chief ones are the
Royal Show, held since 1839 by the Royal Agricultural Society of England;
the Bath and West Show, held since 1780 by the Bath and West and Southern
Counties Agricultural Society; the Royal Highland Show, held since 1822 by the
Royal Highland and Agricultural Society; the Royal Ulster Show, held by the
Royal Ulster Agricultural Society; and the Royal Welsh Show, held by the Royal
Welsh Agricultural Society. The Smithfield Show, held annually in London, which
was originally concerned only with livestock, has now become, in addition, the
largest agricultural machinery exhibition in Britain.
FISHERIES
Britain’s fishing fleet can be divided into distant water, middle and near water,
and inshore vessels. These groups are determined by the size of the vessels, the
length of voyage and the grounds fished.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
172
For example, distant water vessels are over 140 ft. and up to 185 ft. in length,
and make voyages of 17 to 23 days to grounds in the Arctic Circle. The near water
vessels, which are those under 130 ft., work nearer home with voyages of 8 to 10
days; and the middle water vessels, of 130 ft. to 140 ft. in length, undertake voyages
of about two weeks. Included in this group also are vessels engaged in drift net
fishing which usually make daily voyages. The inshore group are mainly vessels
of under 70 ft. which are seldom at sea longer than 2 days and more usually make
daily landings, often fishing within sight of land.
In the United Kingdom as a whole at the end of 1956, 25,000 fishermen were
regularly employed, and 3,000 occasionally employed; of these, Scotland accounted
for 11,700 and 1,100 respectively. The landed weight of British-caught wet fish
in 1956 amounted to 18,000 tons a week; consumption of fresh, frozen and cured
fish in the United Kingdom averaged 16,800 tons landed weight a week.
In Northern Ireland there were 391 regular fishermen and the landed weight
of British-caught fish was 137 tons a week. Northern Ireland consumes about one-
third of its own catches and exports the rest to Great Britain and to the Republic
of Ireland.
Fishing Ports
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleetwood,
Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft
for herring; in Scotland, the chief centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Leith, the
Moray Firth ports, Shetland, the west coast and the Clyde; and for herring they
are Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Aberdeen, Inverness, and Stornoway, as well as
Shetland, the west coast and the Clyde; those in Northern Ireland are Ardglass,
Portavogie and Kilkeel.
Methods of Fishing and Fishing Grounds
The chief means of catching demersal fish, that is to say, those species which
live on or near the sea bed (e.g., cod, haddock, plaice and sole), are by trawling,
seining and lining. Trawling is carried on in the distant, near and middle waters
for demersal fish throughout the year. The distant waters are those off Iceland,
Greenland, the north coast of Norway and in the Barents Sea: the middle water
grounds lie around the Faroe Islands, and the near water grounds are those in the
North Sea, the Irish Sea and in coastal areas around Britain. Distant water vessels,
which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood, numbered 255 at the
end of 1956. Near water trawlers totalled 514, and the middle water vessels 46.
Demersal fish are also taken by seine net, the principal species being haddock,
cod, whiting and plaice. An increasing number of English, Scottish and Northern
Ireland vessels depend on seining for a living, the main areas of operation being in
the North Sea and the Irish Sea. The numbers of Scottish and Northern Ireland
vessels engaged in this fishing were over 700, and those operating from English
ports numbered 170. Long lining on grounds too rough for trawling is carried on
by a limited number of vessels, mainly Scottish. Lining still provides employment
for a large number of inshore fishermen in autumn, winter and early spring; cod,
whiting and haddock are caught.
Pelagic fish, which live in the intermediate water levels or near the surface,
include herrings, pilchards, mackerel and sprats. Drift nets are mainly used for
taking these species but sprats may also be taken in certain localities by inshore
trawling vessels. All the pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is a summer fishery
for herrings based on the Shetlands and east coast ports of Scotland, and an autumn
INDUSTRY
173
fishery off East Anglia based on Lowestoft and Yarmouth. Other seasonal herring
fisheries also take place off the west coast of Scotland and Southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and methods
of capture; trawling, seining and drift net fishing are employed but, in addition,
shell fishing is extensive for shrimps, crabs, lobsters, prawns, mussels, cockles,
oysters, and ‘Norway lobsters’ or nephrops (off Scotland).
Landings
In the year ended 31st December, 1956, landings of fish, both demersal and
pelagic, by British fishing vessels totalled 933,°°° tons (781,000 tons of demersal
fish and 152,000 tons of pelagic) valued at about £46‘6 million. Landings at British
ports by foreign vessels totalled about 85,000 tons of fresh and frozen fish (includ¬
ing 39,000 tons brought direct from the fishing grounds) to a value of about £7
million. British landings of shellfish yielded £i‘S8 million. Cod accounted for
nearly 40 per cent of the total value of wet fish landed by British vessels; haddock
(17 per cent) and plaice (9 per cent) were the other most important sources of
earnings to the industry.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for animal
food and to a much lesser degree for fertilizers. Home production of white fish
meal in 1956 rose by 1,000 tons to 78,000 tons; a large percentage of the fish meal
is obtained from offal and most of the remainder from unsold catches. Imports
of fish meal of all kinds in 1956 totalled 108,000 tons. The preparation of vitamin
oils from fish livers is also a source of additional earnings. The extraction of the
oil takes place at sea as soon as the fish are caught.
Sea Fish Processing
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-freezing
for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and development. For
example, the production of quick-frozen fish more than doubled between 1953 and
1955. With the increase in quick-freezing, new export outlets have opened up for
white fish and fish products; these accounted for £2-8 million of the total British
exports of fish, valued at £5 8 million in 1956. Markets abroad for quick-frozen
fish, mainly in Europe and the Commonwealth, and for salted cod, mainly in Latin
America and the West Indies, have continued to expand, but exports of herrings,
for which Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have been large customers, have
declined.
Distribution System
The principal wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate Market in
London, which handles about 4°° tons a day, but other large cities also have central
fish markets. The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers, located
at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers; the port whole¬
salers prepare the fish for onward shipment. Sixty special express fish trains trans¬
port the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, but increasing use is being
made of road transport. Retail sales are handled by 17,0°° fishmongers and nearly
18,000 fish friers, the latter use more than a third of the landings of white fish.
Freshwater Fisheries
The principal commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or draught
nets in rivers and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used for catching
salmon in the sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries. In England and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
174
Wales, the value of the salmon catch is approximately £250,000 a year, in Scotland
it amounts to about £1 million, and in Northern Ireland to some £200,000. In
Northern Ireland, eels worth £80,000 a year are captured by long lines and by eel
nets placed in river weirs.
Fishing for sport by rod and line in rivers, lakes, streams and canals is wide¬
spread. Salmon, grilse and sea-trout are the most important species, and the fishing
rights command high rentals. There are also extensive fishings for brown trout.
Other freshwater fish taken, particularly in England, include roach, rudd, perch and
dace. Fishing for freshwater fish other than salmon and trout is of minor importance;
figures of catches are not available.
Promotion and Regulation of the Industry
Laws in Britain relating to fisheries and fish are principally directed to the follow¬
ing purposes: (1) protection of supply by measures against over-fishing, e.g., the
Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, the Sea-Fishing Industry Act, 1933, and the
Sea Fish Industry Act, 1938; (2) promotion of the prosperity of the industry, e.g.,
the Herring Industry Acts, 1935 to 1953, the White Fish Industry Acts, 1951 and
1953, and the Fisheries Act, 1955 ; (3) protection of the quality of the product, e.g.,
the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. The Government Departments mainly responsible
for the administration of laws in the first two categories and for the general sponsor¬
ship of fisheries are the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish
Home Department, and the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland; the
Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland are concerned with
questions of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant Shipping
Acts, which are administered by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Home Department, the White Fish Authority, the
Herring Industry Board, the Development Commissioners (see p. 171) and, on
food investigation, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 412).
In July 1957 it was announced that a Committee of Inquiry into the state of the
fishing industry was to be appointed.
The Herring Industry Board
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of 1935
to reorganize, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent amending
Acts have also been passed. The Board consists of a chairman and two other mem¬
bers, all part time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland
and the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Board, which is financed
partly by Government grants and loans and partly by levies and licence fees, is
advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of
the catching and shore sections of the industry. The functions of the Board include
the promotion of sales of herring, both at home and abroad, and the provision of
grants and loans for the purchasing of new boats, nets and gear, and the recondi¬
tioning of existing boats. The Board is particularly active in developing new and
wider markets for herring, and applying the benefits of technical progress to the
industry, including the adoption of new fishing methods, and the construction of
new processing plants for quick-freezing and kippering. The Board buys all herring
not sold for other purposes for reduction to oil and meal, and, with the aid of
Government grants, has built a number of processing factories for this purpose.
A Government subsidy has been paid to herring fishermen since May 1957.
INDUSTRY
175
The White Fish Authority
The White Fish Authority was set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951,
to reorganize, develop and regulate the white fish industry. It is composed of five
independent members, appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the
Home Department, and works in consultation with the industry and consumers
through the White Fish Industry Advisory Council. The Authority is financed partly
by Government grants and loans and partly by a levy on first-hand sales and by
registration fees. The Authority has powers similar to those of the Herring Board.
In the year ended 31st March, 1956, it expended nearly £100,000 on publicity
campaigns to increase the consumption of fish. It also makes loans and grants for
the purchase of new vessels and engines, and loans for the reconditioning of old
vessels, as part of a long-term programme for the modernization of the fishing
fleet. Up to 31st March, 1957, nearly £9-1 million in loans and nearly £3-9 million
in grants were approved for this purpose by the Authority.
Since 1950 a subsidy from public funds has been paid to near and middle water
vessels and to inshore vessels engaged in the white fish industry in the United
Kingdom. In 1956-57, £2-69 million was made available; a large proportion of
this sum was used to assist steam vessels.
Whaling
Whaling is mainly conducted by expeditions, each consisting of a large floating
factory ship accompanied by its attendant whale catchers and tankers, which
annually cover large areas of the Antarctic Ocean. It is regulated by the Inter¬
national Whaling Commission, set up under the International Whaling Convention
of 1946, which controls the dates of the season and sets a limit on the catch of
whales. The offices of the Commission are in London.
The United Kingdom is the third most important country (after Norway and
Japan) engaged in whaling, sending three expeditions to the Antarctic each year.
In addition, whaling is also undertaken from a land station on South Georgia, a
British island in the South Atlantic. The volume of the whale oil (the most im¬
portant product) obtained by the British expeditions in the i955—56 season amounted
to about 410,000 barrels. The value of the products of British whaling expeditions
landed in the United Kingdom totalled £6 million in 1955 and £6-6 million in
1956.
FORESTRY
The total woodland area of Great Britain is about 3^ million acres, or between
6 and 7 per cent of the total land area. Timber and its products are of vital impor¬
tance to the economy of the country, and large quantities of industrial timber (i.e.
wood other than that used for domestic fuel) are needed to meet all demands; but,
except for the period of the second world war when, of necessity, much over¬
felling took place, the home timber industry has not been in a position to make
more than a small contribution to the nation’s timber requirements. The Govern¬
ment is, however, devoting continuous effort through the Forestry Commission
to the long-term task of increasing the country’s timber resources. Home-produced
timber represented 13 per cent of total consumption in 195° (the latest year for
which figures are available) as compared w'ith 4 per cent in the years 1934—38 and
7 per cent in 1914.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Forest Areas
The last census of woodlands (1947-49) shows that 54 per cent of the total wood¬
land area of Great Britain lies in England, 37 per cent in Scotland, and 9 per cent
in Wales. The greatest density of woodland in Great Britain is in the north and
east of Scotland—for example, Moray has 21-6 per cent of its land area under
woodland and Nairn has 19-1 per cent. Another region of high density lies in the
south-east of England—Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Kent and Berkshire. Mon¬
mouthshire, on the Welsh border, has 10-7 per cent of its land area under woodland.
Types of Woodland
The classification of woodland areas is shown in Table 22.

Of the broadleaved species the commonest tree is the oak (24 per cent of all
species); with beech, ash, birch, sycamore and elm following in that order. Of the
coniferous species Scots pine is the most common (20 per cent of all species), but
Norway and Sitka spruces are plentiful, particularly in Wales.
Volume of Timber
Practically the whole volume of timber over 3 inches in diameter comes from the
High Forest and Coppice with Standards types. On this basis the census indicated
that in 1949 the timber volume of Great Britain’s woodlands amounted to some
INDUSTRY
177
2,650 million cubic feet, estimated to be made up of approximately 1,550 million
cubic feet of hardwood and 1,100 million cubic feet of softwood. The total annual
growth of timber was estimated at approximately 97 million cubic feet.
Ownership of Woodlands
The 1947-49 Census showed that 82 per cent of all woodlands in Great Britain
was owned by private individuals or by limited companies, trusts, corporations,
local authorities or Government Departments other than the Forestry Commission.
The Forestry Commission managed the remaining 18 per cent.
Forest Policy
For centuries timber was for the most part used locally and mainly for rural
purposes, and the State showed little interest in the promotion of forestry as an
industry. Following the Industrial Revolution, cheap and easily workable timber
began to be required in ever-increasing amounts for a variety of new industrial
uses. Home woodlands contained neither the types nor the quantities of timber
to meet this demand and the importation of timber, principally of softwoods (timber
derived from coniferous tree species), expanded greatly. The management of
British woodlands made a slow response to the changing pattern of demand, and
by 1914 the trade in imported timber had grown, and the contribution from home
woodlands shrunk, to a point where no more than 7 per cent of the country’s total
requirements were being met from home sources.
The sudden demands of the first world war, however, brought about a realiza¬
tion of the need for a national forest policy. The Forestry Commission (see below)
was established in 1919 to give effect to such a policy, but, although some progress
was made in the next 20 years the devastation of the country’s woodlands caused
by extensive felling during the second world war showed clearly that larger scale
measures were needed.
In 1943, the Forestry Commissioners recommended, in their Report on Post-
War Forest Policy, that from the point of view of security the nation should aim
at having at least 5 million acres of productive forest, of which 2 million acres
would be secured from the rehabilitation of existing woodlands and 3 million acres
obtained by the afforestation of bare land. The Government accepted this as a
programme to be achieved by the end of the century, by the State and private
owners of woodlands working together in partnership; although the afforestation
of bare land would fall mainly on the State. While it provided for the conservation
of existing stocks of standing timber through statutory controls on felling, the
programme also called for a marketing policy that would maintain a healthy and
efficient home timber trade. The acreage of woodland proposed would, it was
estimated, produce ultimately a volume of timber equivalent to about one-third
of the country’s needs. In their Report, the Forestry Commissioners foreshadowed
the emergence of forestry as one of the nation’s major industries.
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Act, 1919, as a
national forest authority; it has the general duty of promoting the interests of
forestry, the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber
in the United Kingdom. From 1922, however, the Forestry Commission’s authority
related only to Great Britain, as the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture
became the forest authority for Northern Ireland (see p. 181). The Commission
consists of a chairman and not more than nine commissioners who are appointed
by the Crown. The Forestry Act, 1945, requires the Commissioners, in exercising
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
178
their functions under the Forestry Acts, 1919-45, to comply with such directions
as may be given to them by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The Ministers act jointly on matters of general
policy, but individually in matters affecting England and Wales only, or Scotland
only. The Forestry Act, 1951, placed on the Forestry Commissioners responsibility
for the maintenance of an adequate reserve of growing trees in Great Britain and
gave them powers to regulate the felling of trees by the issue of licences. The Com¬
mission, besides conducting its own forest operations, represent the interests of
British forestry at inter-governmental meetings, gives encouragement to private
forestry and performs a wide range of general forestry duties such as research and
education and the publication of technical and other literature on forestry. In the
administration of its duties in relation to private forestry there is continual contact
between the Commission’s staff and private land-owners, and the staff gives advice,
free of charge, on silvicultural and management problems; substantial grants for
planting and other forestry activities are paid to woodland owners (see below).
The Commission has also played an important part in the establishment of several
new timber-using industries.
During the years 1919-5 61 the Forestry Commission acquired land through the
Forestry Fund (see below), under the Forestry (Transfer of Woods) Act, 1923, and
by gifts which, after taking account of disposals, totalled 2,176,600 acres. This total
comprises 1,377,000 acres classified as ‘forest land’, of which 1 million acres had
been planted by 1956 and the rest would be planted in due course, and 799,600
acres of ‘ other land ’ which includes forest nurseries, rough grazing, agricultural
land and land unsuitable for planting, such as the tops of mountains. The total
number of Commission forests in Great Britain at 30th September, 1956, was 510,
of which 218 were in England, 208 in Scotland and 84 in Wales. The peak year for
planting was 1954, when the area planted was 70,400 acres. In 1955, the area planted
fell to 67,900 acres, and in 1956 it fell again, to 62,400 acres, owing to the di fficulty
of acquiring sufficient plantable land.
Finance
The Forestry Fund was established by the Forestry Act, I9I9> from it is paid
all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid their receipts
from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with the amounts voted
annually by Parliament. From 1920 to 1956, parliamentary grants totalled
£79,260,800 and receipts from other sources £25,932,518. Payments totalled
£105,065,566. Actual expenditure during the year ended 30th September, 1956,
totalled £9,181,000 of which £743,000 represented various grants to private
forestry.
Private Forestry
The total area of privately owned woods (excluding woods of less than 5 acres)
is about 3 million acres (2-8 million acres at the 1947 census) and contains most
of the mature and semi-mature timber in Great Britain. The size of woodlands
in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several thousand acres, and a
high proportion of the total woodland area privately owned belongs to small
owners (i.e. owners of woods of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands by
the introduction, under the Forestry Act, 1947. of the Dedication of Woodlands
Scheme. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently to
1 To the end of the Forest Year 1956 (30th September).
INDUSTRY
179
timber production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan agreed
with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of financial and technical
assistance. By September 1956, the total area dedicated was 445,336 acres. In
addition, there are the woodlands covered by the Approved Woodlands Scheme in
which a planting grant, but no maintenance grant, is made; and these bring the
total area managed under an agreed plan to over 662,000 acres. This does not take
into account other estates that are already working to a plan but have not been put
forward for inclusion in either scheme.
The Forestry Commissioners have been much in favour of the development of
co-operative forestry schemes and have made loans available. The oldest and
largest society is the Co-operative Forestry Society (Scotland) Ltd., with a total
of 250,000 acres of woodlands owned by its members; the north of England is
served by the Northern Forestry Products, Ltd., covering some 100,000 acres; in
the south-west the South Western Woodlands Association, Ltd. covers about
50,000 acres; and smaller societies exist in Herefordshire, Buckinghamshire and
Wales. Many of the woodland owners of Great Britain are members of national
landowners’ organizations and of the National Farmers’ Union. The professional
land agents’ associations share with them an active concern in private forestry as
many of their members are associated with the management of woodlands. The
technical and professional aspect of forestry is represented by the Royal Forestry
Society of England and Wales, the Royal Scottish Forestry Society and the
Society of Foresters of Great Britain. Until 1948 there was no means of co-or¬
dinating the efforts of these and other bodies, but in that year the United King¬
dom Forestry Committee was formed bringing together representatives of the
Country Landowners’ Association, the Scottish Landowners’ Federation and the
two Royal Forestry Societies, with additional members possessing experience of
land agency, forest economics and timber trade. This committee has been accepted
in forestry negotiations as the body which represents the collective interests of
owners of private woodlands.
The total area estimated to have been planted annually by private owners has
risen from 9,000 acres in 1947 to 27,100 acres in 1956; this compares with a pre¬
war average of 6,000 to 7t°oo acres. The problems restricting planting by private
owners are shortages of labour, skilled staff and finance.
Consultative Machinery
The Forestry Act, 1945, established for each country (England, Scotland and
Wales) a National Committee, composed partly of Forestry Commissioners and
partly of persons outside the Commission. These Committees, working directly
under the authority of the Commissioners, supervise certain aspects of the Com¬
mission’s work, including particularly the acquisition and management of land and
the promotion of private forestry; in the latter task they are required to maintain
direct contact with the Regional Advisory Committees which have been set up
in each of the Commission’s Conservancies with the purpose of providing a link
with all those in the Conservancy who are interested in forestry. On all proposals
for acquisition of land, the Commission consults the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Department of Agriculture for Scotland. Other consultative bodies have been
set up to provide for consultation on the marketing of home grown timber.
Marketing of Home Grown Timber
The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee, set up by the Forestry Com¬
missioners in 1939, consists of representatives of the Commission, the Board of
Trade and associations of landowners and timber merchants; it meets quarterly to
i8o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
discuss various matters affecting the marketing of home grown timber. In 1949.
the Commissioners set up the Advisory Committee on Utilization of Home Grown
Timber to advise landowners and to undertake research into problems connected
with the marketing of timber from the Commission’s own forests. Among the
members of this Committee are representatives of the Forest Products Research
Laboratory (see below), the Rural Industries Bureau (see p. 171) and the Timber
Development Association.
In May 1954, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of
State for Scotland appointed a Committee on Marketing of Woodland Produce to
consider what measures might be taken in order to improve the arrangements for
marketing produce from privately owned woodlands. The Committee’s two main
recommendations, contained in its Report published in December 1956, were the
establishment of an effective association of private woodlands owners, and of a
central consultative body representing all the main interests in the timber industry.
Forestry Education and Research
The Commission maintains five Forester Training Schools: in England, at
Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and at Northerwood House in
the New Forest, Hampshire; in Wales, at Bettws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and
in Scotland at Benmore, Argyllshire, and Faskally, near Pitlochry in Perthshire.
Northerwood House is also the Commission’s educational centre, and is used for
practical courses for university students, landowners and agents, planning officers,
school teachers and others connected with forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a proportion of
suitable graduates being recruited by the Commission as forest officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, Farnham,
Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this station and in
experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted to £265,000 in 1956*
The Commission takes an active part in the work of the International Union of
Forest Research Organizations whose twelfth congress was held at Oxford in July
1956. It makes grants for special forestry research work to various institutions and
to university departments, including the Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford,
which is also financed by the University, the Colonial Office, and Colonial Govern¬
ments. Research into the possible uses of home grown timber is carried out by
the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, which is one of
the establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (see
p. 412), and by other grant-aided research associations.
National Forest Parks
The Forestry Commission has opened to the public eight National Forest Parks
(see map,p. 395): Argyll, Glen Trool, Glen More, and Loch Ard (renamed the Queen
Elizabeth Forest Park to commemorate the Coronation) in Scotland; Hardknott
and Forest of Dean in England; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park
(adjoining the Northumberland National Park to the westward), which was
declared in September 1955 and includes forests on the borders of Northumberland
and Cumberland in England and of Roxburghshire in Scotland. The total area of
the eight parks is nearly half a million acres; the Border Forest Park covers about
100,000 acres. The forest parks include planted areas and unplantable moorland
and mountains. Camping facilities are provided in most of the parks, the number of
overnight stays at the camping grounds was over 90,000 in 1956; in the same year,
83,000 people camped overnight in the New Forest, Hampshire, an ancient Royal
forest but not a designated forest park.

Forestry in Northern Ireland
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new Ministry
of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar powers and duties
to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the Forestry Act, 1919. At that
time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres for afforestation of which 700 acres
had been planted by the Forestry Commission.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace since
the end of the second world war. By 31st March, 1957, some 80,000 acres had been
acquired, of which over 43,000 acres had been planted. The present afforestation
programme provides for the creation by the end of the century of an area of 150,000
acres of productive State forest with a sustained yield roughly equal to the present
yearly consumption of timber in Northern Ireland during the second world war,
i.e. some 30,000 Standards. To fulfil this programme, a minimum annual planting
rate of 2,500 acres has been set.
State forest policy is implemented under the Forestry Act (Northern Ireland),
1953, which has replaced earlier legislation. This Act provides the Ministry with
powers to acquire and manage land, and to provide financial and technical assistance
for private planting, and it introduces measures for the protection of all woodlands,
whether owned by the State or privately owned, against destruction by over¬
cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and receipts
from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1922 to 1956 expenditure
totalled £3,439,000 and receipts, other than parliamentary grants, were £1,231,000.
Output and employment are growing steadily. The area of exploitable private
woodlands is at present some 20,000 acres, and private planting, which is gaining
impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply, at a low cost, of young trees from
the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the establishment of new
plantations, and by free technical advice.
Northern Ireland Forest Park
In May 1955, Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle,
County Down, was opened to the public. Situated at the foot of the Moume
Mountains it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum comprising
a wide variety of native and exotic trees, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland
scenery. Caravan facilities and a camping site for youth organizations are available.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy in Britain are coal, petroleum and, to a
small extent, water power; secondary sources, produced from these, are electricity
and coal gas.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies 86 per cent of Britain’s energy and it
must continue to be the main source for many years to come. But it is unlikely that
production of coal can be increased sufficiently, even by the very large investments
planned, to satisfy increasing demands for energy, which may well double within
the next twenty years. For supplies of crude petroleum Britain is almost entirely
dependent on overseas imports; water power resources are limited. For these
reasons, Britain is investing large sums in the development of nuclear power as
an alternative source of energy. But the new source will not start bearing much of
the burden for at least ten years, after which time its use should increase rapidly.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of the petroleum industry and
coal distribution, are mainly under public ownership.
i82
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government’s fuel and power policy has two principal objectives. The first
is to ensure that power supplies are adequate to meet the rapidly growing demands
of industry and of the domestic consumer in a country with an expanding national
income. The second is to make the maximum possible use of indigenous resources
and so lighten the load on the balance of payments.
The Government also aims to reduce air pollution. The Clean Air Act, 1956,
makes it an offence to emit dark smoke or to fail to provide industrial premises with
equipment to arrest grit and dirt, and empowers local authorities, subject to the
approval of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, to declare ‘ smoke
control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute an
offence; provision is made for the payment of grants by local authorities and the
Exchequer towards the costs incurred by owners and occupiers of houses in these
areas in making necessary changes to appliances. A Clean Air Council, to review
progress and to advise the Minister, was set up in May 1957-
COAL
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organized coalmining
industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years longer than in
any other European country. British coal exports dominated the world coal market
until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry was producing
287 million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and employing 1,107,000 workers.
The very fact that the British coalmining industry was developed so early has
meant that many of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has
to be mined from deeper and thinner seams and productivity can be maintained
only by increasing efficiency.
The industry declined during the first world war owing to a shortage of man¬
power and to the shortage of plant and materials necessary for undertaking any
mechanical improvement. Moreover, alternative sources of energy and lower prices
in continental countries led to a later decline in exports, which had fallen to 67
million tons in 1925.
Attempts at securing economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey
Commission of 1919* Id 193®) ^ Coal IVIines Act established commissioners to
bring about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of 1938
transferred ownership of the mineral coal to the State and made it the statutory
responsibility of a Coal Commission to accelerate the integration of the industry
by still further reducing the number of separate undertakings. At the outbreak of
the second world war in 1939, however, this process was not far advanced.
Organization under Public Ownership
In 1942, the Government assumed full control of the industry’s operations,
though the colliery undertakings continued to own the coal mines. In May 1946,
the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act received the Royal Assent. On 1st January,
1947, the assets of the industry were vested in the National Coal Board, which
was appointed by the then Minister of Fuel and Power and became responsible
for the industry’s management. Under the Act, the Board consisted of a chairman
and eight other members, but this provision was amended by the Coal Industry
Act, 1949, and the Board now consists of a chairman and not fewer than eight or
more than 11 other members; the number of full-time members must not exceed
eight and there must be one, and may be two, deputy chairmen.
The Board’s main duties are:
(1) to work and get the coal in Great Britain to the exclusion of any other
person;
INDUSTRY
183
(2) to secure the efficient development of the coalmining industry; and
(3) to make supplies of coal available of such qualities and sizes and in such
quantities and at such prices as may seem to it best calculated to further
the public interest.
The Board is also charged with securing the safety, health and welfare of its
employees and the benefit of their practical knowledge and experience. The Board’s
policies must also be directed to ensure that its revenues shall be not less than its
outgoings properly chargeable to revenue account and taking one year with another.
There are minor exceptions to the Board’s exclusive monopoly to work coal in
Britain: for example, it may license private enterprise to work small mines in which
the number of underground workers does not greatly exceed 30. Production on
opencast sites, which had been the responsibility of the Ministry of Fuel and
Power (as it was then called), was transferred to the Board on 1st April, 1952.
The Board is responsible for its own regional organization. The collieries, num¬
bering about 900, are grouped into 50 Areas which are the basic units for com¬
mercial management. The size of the Areas varies according to geological,
geographical and other technical considerations. The Areas are grouped into nine
Divisions which roughly correspond to the main coal-bearing regions (see p. 184).
A Divisional Board for each Division supervises and co-ordinates the work of the
Areas within the Division (except in the small South Eastern Division, which is
administered by a General Manager), formulates divisional policy, and is answer-
able to the National Coal Board, which is responsible for questions of national
policy, finance and the co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The day-
to-day work of running the collieries is under the direction of colliery managers.
Two Coal Consumers’ Councils were set up under the 1946 Act: the Industrial
Coal Consumers’ Council, members of which represent consumers, merchants and
suppliers of coal, coke and manufactured fuel for industrial and other purposes,
involving supply in bulk; and the Domestic Coal Consumers’ Council, members of
which represent similar groups concerned with coal for domestic use. The most
important function of the Councils, which are responsible to the Minister of Power,
is the general consideration of the commercial arrangements and activities of the
National Coal Board, to ensure that the monopoly in the industry set up by the
1946 Act shall have the maximum practical regard for consumers’ interests.
The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act requires the National Coal Board to
publish an annual report and statement of accounts which are laid before Parliament.
At the end of 1947 (its first year), the National Coal Board showed a deficit of
£23 ‘3 million, after paying compensation to the former mine-owners and interest
on borrowed capital. In the years 1948, 1949 and 1950 there were surpluses of £1 7
million, £9 5 million and £8 3 million respectively. There were deficits of jCi'8
million and £8-2 million in 1951 and 1952, a surplus of £0-4 million in 1953,
deficits of £3-6 million in 1954 and £19 6 million in 1955, and a surplus of £12-8
million in 1956.
The National Coal Board raises capital by long-term borrowing direct from the
Exchequer, instead of through the issue of stock. There is a statutory limit of £650
million at present on such borrowing and special authorization is needed for borrow¬
ing, in any one year, more than £75 million in excess of the highest level of
aggregate advances in the preceding year.
Production
It has been estimated that Britain has workable reserves of coal of 43,000 million
tons, more than enough at current rates of consumption to last for 200 years. But
N
184
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
certain types such as high quality coking coal will be exhausted long before then
unless they are eked out by blending with other types of coal.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottingham¬
shire field which produces about 40 per cent of the total output, (2) the Durham
and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and (4) the Scottish field.
Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lancashire and the West Midlands
(Staffordshire and Warwickshire). There are no coal-bearing areas in Northern
Ireland.
Ill the years since nationalization the National Coal Board has been able to
secure quick increases in production and productivity by reorganization, by a
wider application of improved working methods and by increased mechanization
of cutting and conveying. As a result, deepmined production increased from 187 2
million tons in 1947 to 214 million tons in 1954 despite a fall of 4,000 in average
manpower. In 1956, 210 million tons was produced from deep mines, which, with
12 million tons from opencast workings, gave a total of 222 million tons. Produc¬
tivity of all workers increased between 1947 and 1956 from 1074 to 1-232 tons
per manshift.
Future progress depends on bringing new mines into production, the develop¬
ment of machines for power-loading the coal at the face on to the face conveyor
belt (see p. 186), and on the reorganization of the haulage systems by carrying out
major reconstructions. The National Coal Board has launched a large programme
of major reconstruction and new sinkings (see p. 186).
Since the war the coal industry has suffered from a shortage of manpower. In
1956 manpower averaged 703>400> about 9>ooo fewer than the industry needs.
Marketing
The principal marketing officials of the Board are also officers of the Minister of
Power’s Coal Supplies Organization, whose function is to apportion the coal to
consumers according to the Minister’s determination of the national interest.
The Board, as sole producer, is bound to make the first sale of coal. It has, how¬
ever, no monopoly of distribution, though it does act as a wholesaler and, in the
colliery areas, makes direct sales to consumers. Retail distribution is for the most
part carried on by private firms, but the price structure is controlled by the Ministry
of Power.
Consumption and Exports
Although the level of coal production has risen appreciably since 1946, inland
consumption has risen even faster—mainly because of the expansion of industrial
output. In consequence, the proportion of output which is exported has greatly
declined, compared with pre-war, in spite of a virtually unlimited demand for
exports of British coal. Exports (excluding bunkers) rose from 4-5 million tons in
1946 to 13-9 million tons in 1949- In 1955 and 1956, exports were deliberately cut
to 12-0 million tons and to 8-4 million tons respectively.
The greater part of exports of British coal is sent to Europe, and especially to
Denmark, Sweden, Germany, the Irish Republic and Italy. Nearly all Britain’s
coal exports since the war have been covered by trade agreements, and the National
Coal Board has sought to honour its old customers even when that has meant
importing coal at great expense from Europe and the United States and selling
at a loss at the prevailing internal prices. Imports in 1955 amounted to 11 '4 million
tons, in spite of the reduction in exports, but in 1956 were reduced to 5'2 million
tons.
INDUSTRY
i85
Labour Relations
Negotiations on wages and conditions of service are conducted through a Joint
National Negotiating Committee, consisting of 16 members appointed by the
National Coal Board and not more than 16 members of the National Union of
Mineworkers. Disputed issues are referred to a National Reference Tribunal con¬
sisting of three permanent independent members and four assessors without voting
rights, two representing labour and two management. There are also District Joint
Negotiating Committees, which deal with the application of national agreements,
settle any difficulties and differences that may arise at district level and refer
unresolved differences to the national committee.
The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act requires the Board to enter into joint
consultation with its employees to discuss such matters as production, safety, health
and welfare. At almost every colliery there is a Consultative Committee in which
the workmen’s representatives are elected by secret ballot. The colliery manager is
chairman, and he nominates three colliery officials to be members of the committee.
There are also Consultative Councils at the area, divisional and national levels on
which the Board and the four staff organizations in the industry—the National
Association of Colliery Managers, the British Association of Colliery Management,
the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shot-firers, and the
National Union of Mineworkers—are represented.
Safety, Health and Welfare
The safety, health and welfare of miners are safeguarded by comprehensive
legislation, which was consolidated and brought up to date by the Mines and
Quarries Act, 1954 (see p. 289). Responsibility for the enforcement of safety regu¬
lations lies with the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate of the Ministry of Power.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organization and, in accordance with
the Nationalisation Act, follows a policy directed towards securing the safety,
health and welfare of its employees; examples of voluntary action by the Board
to reduce risks are the installation of fire-resistant conveyor belts, the replacement
of light alloy supports (which had been found to be liable to produce dangerous
sparks) and the widespread introduction of courses for training for various classes
of officials and workmen. The Board has also continued to strengthen the medical
services which existed before nationalization. Chief Divisional and Area Medical
Officers have been appointed and Assistant Medical Officers are being appointed
in areas with a labour force of more than 15,000 men. Medical centres are being
set up at the pit head.
The Board is responsible for its employees’ welfare at their work-places, for
example, by the provision of pit-head baths and canteens, while the social welfare
of coalminers and their families has, since 1952, been the responsibility of the
Coal Industry Social Welfare Organization, which is controlled by the Board and
the miners’ trade unions.
Research into problems of safety and health is carried out also at the Ministry
of Power’s Safety in Mines Research Establishment, which maintains a close liaison
with the Mines Inspectorate and the National Coal Board’s research organization.
Development and Research
Contraction and curtailment of development in the industry since the peak year,
1913, had led to a position in which less than one-third of current output was
coming from pits started in the twentieth century. Large-scale development was
therefore essential.
i86
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1950, the National Coal Board announced its long-term plan of development
for the industry, involving the reorganization and increased mechanization of exist¬
ing mines and the sinking of new ones. The plan envisaged a capital investment of
£635 million at 1949 prices between 1950 and 1965) when it was estimated that
the annual output of coal would have risen to about 240 million tons. The plan
was not a rigid blueprint, room being left for modifications in the light of changing
circumstances and new knowledge. Actual capital expenditure in the years 1950-56
was £483 million at current prices. Under a revised plan issued in May 1956, the
Board provides for an output of 228 million tons in i960 and 240 million tons in
1965. An annual output of 250 million tons is not thought possible before 197°-
Opencast production is expected to continue at a rate of about 10 million tons a
year. The capital cost of achieving these output figures, and of providing the money
for major schemes to be completed after 1965, is estimated at £860 million for
collieries and their associated activities. In addition, the Board proposes to spend
£140 million on ancillary activities. A total of £590 million will be spent between
1956 and i960 and £410 million in 1961-65. Manpower requirements are estimated
at 682,000 with an output-per-man-year of 319 tons in i960, and 672,000 with an
output-per-man-year of 342 tons in 1965. when four-fifths of Britain s coal output
will be coming from virtually new mines.
The mechanical cutting and conveying of coal are now the general practice: in
1956, 87 per cent of total deepmined output was mechanically cut and 93 per cent
was mechanically conveyed. The loading of coal at the working face offers, at
present, the next most important possibility for increased coalface mechanization.
In 1956, 36 4 million tons were power loaded, compared with 13 million tons in
1953 and 5 million tons in 1947.
In 1947, the National Coal Board took over, with other assets, the Coal burvey,
a national organization for surveying coal resources within Britain, and 70 labora¬
tories in the various coalfields, which it has since extended and modernized.
In 1948, the Board established a central research organization at Stoke Orchard,
near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to provide facilities for fundamental research
in the coalmining industry, as distinct from the day-to-day scientific control
exercised by the divisional and area scientific organization. This is now known
as the Coal Research Establishment. A second central research organization for
the investigation of underground problems, known as the Mining Research Estab¬
lishment, was formed in 1952 by the Board at Isleworth, Middlesex, and a Central
Engineering Establishment is now operating near Bretby in Derbyshire for develop¬
ing new machines and testing equipment.
The Board also subscribes to a number of autonomous research associations in
receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR,
see p. 412), including the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, the British
Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar Research Association. In addition,
much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establish¬
ment of the Ministry of Power and the Fuel Research Station of DSIR, is closely
related to the Board’s problems. . .
From 1 st July, 1956, the National Coal Board and the Central Electricity
Authority have accepted responsibility for the planning and construction of a
pilot plant for the underground gasification of coal. This is a process for converting
coal in the ground into gas for use in generating electricity and it has reached the
stage of being demonstrated on a small scale after 6 years of work by the Ministry
of Power in co-operation with the National Coal Board. Exploitation of the process
on a commercial scale is being undertaken. The National Coal Board has set up
an Underground Gasification Executive to carry out its part in the project.

PETROLEUM
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young, a
Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from natural
mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish shale deposits,
yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858.
Indigenous Production
Sources of crude oil within Britain (including shale oil) supply altogether less
than one per cent of total United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being
imported from overseas.
Current output of shale oil is drawn from 7 shale mines and one opencast quarry,
retorted in four crude oil works, and the crude products are refined in a central
refinery at Pumpherston, near Edinburgh. Output of shale reached a peak of 3 -4
million tons in 1913, but the cost of the processes and other economic difficulties
led to a reduction of output. This amounted to over one million tons in 1956,
yielding some 79,000 tons of crude shale oil. From the latter, some 63,000 tons
of refined products were obtained. In 1956, some 84,000 tons of motor and avia¬
tion spirit were obtained from coal by hydrogenation, and 314,500 tons of refined
benzole from coke ovens and gas works. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so
far led to the establishment of two oilfields in Nottinghamshire (small amounts of
oil were found in further borings at Plungar in Leicestershire in 1953), and one
in Lancashire. Production of crude oil in 1956 was 66,000 tons.
International Trade
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the Middle
East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today they produce one-third of all oil entering into international trade, with
a tanker fleet (part owned by them and part on charter) amounting to nearly one-
third of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United Kingdom registered tanker tonnage
is nearly one-fifth of the world’s total.)
Consumption
Consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom has risen from
almost one million tons in 1900 (mostly kerosene for lamps, and lubricants) to over
25 million tons in 1956 (predominantly gas, diesel and fuel oils and motor spirit).
Refineries
Up to 1939, three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum pro¬
ducts was refined overseas, in accordance with the view, commonly held in the
world oil industry at that time, that it was more economical to refine at the source
of production. Since the second world war, however, the industry has come to
favour the siting of refineries in the consuming areas. In this it has had Govern¬
ment support, both because of the need to save foreign exchange and because of
the extra employment and other advantages to the economy resulting from the
new development. The expansion programme in the United Kingdom carried out
by the major oil companies was a substantial one, costing over the years 1947 to
J954 very nearly £200 million.
At the end of May 1957, refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted to
almost 31 million tons a year. Plans for a second major phase of expansion to bring
this up to at least 39 million tons by 1958 have been announced by some of the
leading companies. Actual production of refined products rose from about 5 million
i88
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
tons in 1948-49 to 28-7 million tons in 1956. Exports of refined products became
possible, and their value reached £84 million in 1954 and £99 million in I9S6.
Imports of refined products were valued at £87 million in 1954 and £I26 million
in 1956, compared with £141 million in 1951.
Research
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities on a
substantial scale. Some work on the production of oil products from coal is done
at the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
Public supply of electricity was first provided at Godaiming, Surrey, in 1881,
though there were earlier demonstrations of its use to consumers, such as the former
Metropolitan Board of Works, in the lighting of the Thames Embankment. From
the earliest days a measure of public control has been a feature of the industry,
and the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 authorized the Board of Trade to grant
licences for the establishment of electricity undertakings by local authorities or by
companies (which the local authorities might compulsorily purchase after a given
period of time) to supply consumers in given areas. By the turn of the century,
technical developments, including the introduction of the electric motor as a source
of motive power, had led to a large increase in the scale of distribution of elec¬
tricity, and a variety of independent supply systems had grown up all over the
country.
It was not until after the first world war that steps were taken to reorganize the
industry on a national scale in order to realize the benefits of concentration, integra¬
tion and standardization in electricity supply. In I9I9> the Electricity Commis¬
sioners were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganization through
voluntary agreement. Then, in 1926, the Central Electricity Board was established
to co-ordinate more efficiently the generation of electricity. Its main duties were to
concentrate the output of electricity in certain stations, selected for their efficiency
and low operating costs, and to connect these selected stations with one another
and with local distribution undertakings by means of a national system of mam
transmission lines, known as the Grid. Thenceforward, steady progress was made in
putting this plan into effect and, by March 1948, *43 selected stations, out of some
300, were supplying 95 per cent of the electricity generated for public supply.
Organization under Public Ownership
With the exception of a few small non-statutory undertakings accounting for less
than one per cent of the electricity consumption, the public supply of electricity
in Great Britain is now exclusively in the hands of public corporations: in England
and Wales, the Central Electricity Authority is responsible for generation, and 12
Area Boards for distribution; in Scotland, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric
Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board are each responsible for genera¬
tion and distribution in their respective areas. In Northern Ireland, electricity is
supplied by two municipal undertakings and one public board (see p. 190)-
Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the British
Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards, took over in April 1948 the
assets of former municipal and private electricity supply undertakings throughout
Great Britain, except in the area already served by the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board (see p. 190). Under the Electricity Reorganization (Scotland) Act of
INDUSTRY
189
1954, the Authority’s functions in Scotland were taken over in April 1955 by the
South of Scotland Electricity Board (see p. 190) and the name of the Authority was
changed from British Electricity Authority to Central Electricity Authority.
Over 200,000 people are employed in the electricity supply industry.
England and Wales
The Central Electricity Authority is appointed by the Minister of Power and is
responsible to him for the general policy of the whole electricity supply industry in
England and Wales. Its main function is to develop and maintain an efficient co¬
ordinated and economical system of electricity supply, and it is responsible for the
generation and bulk supply of electricity to the Area Boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for the distri¬
bution of electricity in England and Wales. Each consists of a full-time chairman
and deputy chairman and four to six part-time members, appointed, as are the
members of the Central Authority, by the Minister of Power.
Area Consultative Councils have been set up in the area of each Area Board to
represent the interests of consumers. They each consist of between 20 and 30
members, of whom between 50 and 60 per cent are nominated by local authority
associations. The chairman of each Area Consultative Council is an ex officio mem¬
ber of the corresponding Area Board. There are also Consultative Councils for each
of the districts of the two Scottish Electricity Boards and the chairman of each is a
member of the respective Board.
Finance. The Central Authority and Area Boards, taken together, have made a
consolidated net surplus on their operations in each of the years since they were
established. Up to and including the financial year 1955-56, these surpluses
amounted in the aggregate to over £70 million.
Labour Relations. Under the Electricity Act, 1947, the Central Authority is
required to devise a satisfactory procedure for collective bargaining and joint con¬
sultation with its employees. In each of the three main groups of workers (admini¬
strative, technical, and manual), there is a separate National Joint Industrial
Council or Board, which negotiates terms and conditions of employment. A National
Joint Advisory Council, drawn from management and employees, has been set up
to discuss the health, welfare and safety of all groups of employees. There are also
separate district councils and local works and advisory committees forming part of
the negotiating and conciliatory machinery.
Proposals for Reorganization. In November 1956, the Government published a
White Paper {Cmnd. 27), putting forward proposals, based on the report of the Com¬
mittee of Inquiry into the Electricity Supply Industry (Cmd. 9672), for the reorgani¬
zation of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales. These proposals
have been embodied in the Electricity Act, 1957, and will take effect on 1st April,
1958. The Central Electricity Authority will then be replaced by an Electricity
Council, which will advise the Minister of Power on questions affecting the elec¬
tricity supply industry and promote and assist the maintenance and development,
by a new Central Electricity Generating Board and by Area Boards, of ‘ an efficient
co-ordinated and economical system of electricity supply’. The responsibility for
generating and supplying electricity in bulk will be placed on the Generating
Board. Appointments to the Council and Board were announced in August 1957.
Greater autonomy for Area Boards is proposed. The Generating Board and each
Area Board will be required by law to balance their accounts individually, in order
to encourage financial responsibility and a critical attitude towards costs. The
I9o Britain: an official handbook
industry’s central reserve fund will be wound up and distributed to the Area
Boards, each of which will maintain its own reserve fund.
The most important functions of the Minister, under the new arrangements,
are- to appoint the chairman and deputy chairman of the Electricity Council
and the members of the Generating Board (the other members of the Council
being the chairmen of the Area Boards and one other member representing the
Generating Board); to approve each Area Board’s capital development plans and
the industry’s research programme; and to approve, in consultation with the
Treasury, the Board’s borrowing requirements, having regard to the development
programmes submitted by the industry. The Minister also has power to issue
general directions to the Council and the Boards if he considers this necessary m
the national interest. It is also proposed to strengthen the Consultative Councils.
Scotland
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was set up in 1943 as a non-profit-
making body to develop the water power resources of the Highlands and Islands
and to distribute electricity in the more sparsely populated parts of Scotland not
covered by existing undertakings. It is a non-functional board, consisting of a
chairman, deputy chairman and not fewer than three nor more than seven other
members, who are all part-time members without departmental responsibilities,
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Act of 1947 made the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board solely respon¬
sible to the Secretary of State for Scotland for all generation and distribution in its
area. This area was extended under the Act to include that part of Scotland north
and west of a line running roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to New¬
burgh on the Firth of Tay. In the rest of Scotland, the Central Authority, then
known as the British Electricity Authority, together with the South-East and South-
West Scotland Electricity Boards, was responsible to the then Minister of Fuel and
Power in all electricity matters. . . „ , , , ^ .
On 1 st April, 1955, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the Central Authority’s functions in
Scotland, and also the functions of the two Scottish Area Boards which were dis¬
solved. The Board consists of a chairman, deputy chairman, two full-time and five
part-time members. Under the Electricity Reorganization (Scotland) Act, 1954, the
then Minister of Fuel and Power retained only three functions in regard to elec¬
tricity in Scotland, namely, to act jointly with the Secretary of State in regard to
staff pensions and safety measures, and to remain solely responsible for the
certification of meters.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the bulk of electricity is acquired by the Northern Ireland
Joint Electricity Committee set up by statute in 1948, for sale to statutory distribu¬
tion undertakings. Of these, the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland distributes
electricity throughout the country with the exception of the cities of Belfast and
Londonderry, where it is carried out by municipal undertakings.
Generation
Almost the whole of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam generat¬
ing stations. Abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water transport
for moving it, in contrast with the remote and scattered location of relatively sma
water power resources, led to this preponderant development of electricity supplies
from thermal generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any
scale is comparatively recent.
INDUSTRY
191
The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943 marked
the beginning of a new era of intensive water power development in the Highlands
of Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the Board in 1944. showing the
water power resources which it proposed to examine, listed 102 hydro-electric
projects with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million units of electricity.
The ultimate output of Highland hydro-electric power is expected to be
substantially higher and eventually may exceed 10,000 million units. In 1956,
1,282 million units were generated from water power compared with 322 million
in 1949-
In 1956, 85,326 million units (one unit =one kilowatt-hour), or slightly more than
98 per cent of the public supply in Great Britain, was generated at steam stations,
1,667 million units, or nearly 1 -9 per cent, from water power, and 168 million units
ky other means, e.g., diesel and waste heat and refuse destruction. The high rate
of expansion of output, which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest
years, has been continued since the war. Total production in 1956 was eight times
what it was in 1930 and has increased in nearly every year and especially since
9The installed generating capacity of the electricity authorities (including the
North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board) in Great Britain at the end of 1956
totalled 24,615 megawatts (maximum continuous rating) compared with 12,546
megawatts at the end of 1948. The Central Electricity Authority is planning a
large-scale programme of capital investment for the regions it controls, which
makes provision for an increase, between the years 1957 anc^ i96i> of 9>400 mega¬
watts (sent out).
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where the total generating capacity of
391 megawatts is in coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 95^ million kilowatt-
hours in 1956, when the maximum load sustained was 335 megawatts. Further
plant installations, with a generating capacity of 60 megawatts, are due to be
completed in i957-58.
The Central Electricity Authority is the largest consumer of primary fuel in
Britain and in the year ended 3Ist March, 1957. it used just over 42 7 million tons,
consisting mainly of coal. Average thermal efficiency of steam stations (i.e. the ratio
of power output to the coal consumed) rose from 20-9i per cent in i947—4^ to
24 93 per cent in 1956-57 as new plant was brought into use. Twenty stations
containing much of the newest plant had an average efficiency of 29 14 Per cent
in that year.
To meet increasing demands for electricity and to save coal, generation from
alternative fuels is being actively promoted. The chief alternatives are expected to
be oil, to a small extent peat, and nuclear energy. As regards oil, dual firing appa¬
ratus able to use either coal or oil has been fitted to a new power station at March-
wood, on Southampton water, and similar apparatus is to be installed in other
power stations similarly situated on river estuaries and thus able to be fed con¬
veniently from nearby oil refineries. The use of peat has been advocated in Scot¬
land, as in Northern Ireland, as a source of power and as a means of making land
available for agriculture. In July 1953, the Government announced that it had
accepted a recommendation of the Scottish Peat Committee, appointed in 1949
advise on the development of Scottish peat deposits, that an experimental peat¬
burning station for generating electricity should be established in Caithness. A pilot
project covering some 300 acres at Altnabreac, Caithness, has been started. A peat¬
burning gas turbine, developed by a Scottish firm with assistance from the Develop¬
ment Fund (see p. 171) is coming into operation in 1957- As the peat is cleared
from the bog, the land is made available for farming.
192 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Nuclear Power Stations
Nuclear power stations are being built both for the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority (UKAEA, see pp. 414-16) and for the Electricity Authorities.
As an extension of its experimental work and to produce plutonium, the UKAEA
has built and is building a number of reactors which also produce electricity on a
reasonably large scale. Most notable of these is the Calder Hall nuclear energy
establishment in Cumberland which, since 17th October, 1956, when it was offi¬
cially opened by the Queen, has been the first large-scale nuclear power station in
the world to supply electricity to a national electricity network. Calder Hall A,
consisting of two reactors, has an installed capacity of 92 megawatts (MW); Calder
Hall B, due for completion in 1958, will double the installed capacity. Four more
similar reactors are being built at Chapel Cross, near Annan in Dumfriesshire,
Scotland. A further establishment at Dounreay, Caithness, Scotland, started in 1954
and now nearly completed, houses breeder reactors which will produce electricity.
A provisional programme of commercial nuclear power stations for the Elec¬
tricity Authorities was published by the Government in a White Paper (Cmd. 9389)
in February 1955. This envisaged spending £300 million on building 12 nuclear
power stations, together with the necessary ancillary services, uranium and proto¬
type development in the ten years 1955-65. Between 1,500 and 2,000 megawatts
of electricity would be produced by this means by 1965, saving 5-6 million tons
of coal a year.
Since the publication of the 1955 programme, two factors have led to a re¬
assessment of the targets provisionally set: rapid technological advance, which has
already made possible stations of more than four times the installed capacity of
Calder Hall; and the increase in imports of fuel, chiefly oil, to meet growing energy
requirements which has accentuated the burden on the balance of payments.
Accordingly, on 5th March, 1957, the Government announced a revised pro¬
gramme of nuclear power, under which nuclear energy would be providing 5,000-
6,000 megawatts of electricity by 1965, instead of 1,500-2,000 megawatts as
originally planned, the equivalent of 18 million tons of coal (or ten million tons of
oil) a year used in conventional stations for a similar output. During the decade
ending in the year 1965-66 the total capital investment by the Electricity Authori¬
ties to fulfil the combined nuclear and conventional power station programme
(including ancillary transmission facilities) might be of the order of £3,350 million.
This would compare with an estimate of £2,600 million during the decade for
purely conventional stations; of the difference of £750 million, some £200 million
might be accounted for by the procurement of the initial charges of uranium.
By mid-September 1957, work on two stations—at Bradwell in Essex (300 MW
installed capacity) and at Berkeley in Gloucestershire (275 MW)—was well
advanced. At Hunterston, in Ayrshire, Scotland, work had begun on a site for a
third station (see photograph facing p. 199); a contract had been placed for the
building, at Hinkley Point, Somerset, of a fourth station (500 MW); and sites in
North Wales for two further stations were being considered. The Northern Ireland
Electricity Board had decided to build a station of 150 MW, for which sites were
being examined.
Transmission and Distribution
Main electricity transmission lines—the Grid—cover most of the country. Those
of the Central Authority totalled at 31st March, 1957, 5,5°° route miles (8,602
circuit miles), of which 415 miles were operated at 275,000 volts, 4,635 miles were
operated at 132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts and below. The reduc¬
tion over the previous year was due to the transfer of a section to the South of

Scotland Electricity Board. In the North of Scotland district there were 1,480
circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of 1956, all operated at 132,000
volts. Control of energy movements on the Grid in England and Wales is managed
through the eight operational areas, set up by the Authority for that purpose and
distinct from the divisions in which the generating side of the industry is organized;
each area has a central control station and the operations are co-ordinated by a
control station in London. The Grid in Scotland is operated from the North of
Scotland control centre at Tummel Bridge and the South of Scotland control centre
at Glasgow.
The new Supergrid of main transmission lines at 275,000 volts will assist in
meeting the growing demand for electricity during the next 20 years with the
greatest economy and will make the British electricity supply the most closely
integrated power network in the world. The first stage was completed in 1954-
In September 1956, a joint committee of the Central Electricity Authority and
Electricite de France recommended the adoption of a scheme for interchange of
energy by direct current by means of a single cable capable of transmitting between
120,000 and 150,000 kilowatts at 200,000 volts, and the scheme is being under¬
taken. It was hoped to begin work on the project in 1957 and to complete it by
i960 at a cost of about £4 million. The object of the scheme is to take advantage
of the differences in the incidence of peak periods in the two countries.
The Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers electricity acquired mainly
from the Authority, but in part from other sources, e.g., collieries. There were 14-5
million consumers in December 1956, an increase of about 5 million on those
supplied in December 1939. Industrial users are the group of consumers with the
highest consumption, and demand from this sector is increasing rapidly. The
principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking, and for space and
water heating, but the demand for numerous other domestic purposes is increasing.
The development of electricity supplies for rural areas has been facilitated by
the change in the structure of the industry under the 1947 Act. During the year
ended 31st March, 1957, supplies were provided for a further 13,135 farms which
raised the number of farms provided with electricity to over 188,000 out of a total
of 272,000 farms.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with the
distribution of electricity to consumers in the North of Scotland. At the end of
1956, there were 351,524 consumers of electricity in the Board’s district and 55’5
per cent of the farms and 55-4 of crofts (see p. 153) in the district had a supply of
electricity.
Development and Research
The comprehensive capital development plan to bridge the gap between ever-
increasing demand and supply is limited by shortages of equipment and finance.
The borrowing powers of the Central Electricity Authority and Area Electricity
Boards were originally limited to a maximum of £7°° million, but in 1954 were
extended to £1,400 million. Capital expenditure during 1956 by the Authority
and Area Boards was about £209 million and approved expenditure for 1957
amounted to £233 million. The original investment plans of the Authority have
been considerably modified by the programme of nuclear power development,
outlined on p. 192, inasmuch as it is conceivable that, from the middle of the
1960s, most new plant will consist of nuclear-powered stations.
Borrowing by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is limited by the
Electricity Act, 1947, as amended by the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland)
Act, 1952, to a maximum of £200 million. Borrowing by the South of Scotland
INDUSTRY
195
Electricity Board is limited by the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act, 1954*
to a maximum of £75 million.
The Central Electricity Authority undertakes research on its own account and
helps to finance research through its membership of the British Electrical and Allied
Industries Research Association, an organization to which manufacturing firms
and large consumers of electricity also belong and which was established before
the supply industry passed into public ownership. This Association is one of the
autonomous research associations in receipt of grants from the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (see Appendix II, pp. 458-9). The Central Elec¬
tricity Authority also has an Electrical Supply Research Council including inde¬
pendent experts to advise it and the Area Boards, and can consult the Minister of
Power’s Scientific Advisory Council on problems affecting the supply and use of
electricity. Direct research on a laboratory scale takes place at the Central Electri¬
city Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, extensions to which were opened by the
Authority in July 1950. Examples of research include gas turbine generation and
experiments in the use of wind power for generation.
As part of its programme of power station construction for 1962, the Central
Electricity Authority plans to install a turbo-generator of 550,000 kilowatt capacity
much larger than any now in operation, or, as far as is known, than any at present
projected anywhere in the world. The decision to build a machine of this large
capacity is the latest step in a programme aimed at reducing cost of generation by
increasing the size of generating sets and boilers. Work is in progress on even more
advanced machines for subsequent programmes.
GAS SUPPLY
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke
Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In the early years
of the industry, gas was used almost exclusively for lighting and was provided by
a growing number of company and municipal undertakings. Then, after the middle
of the century and the invention of the Bunsen burner in 1855* §as was used in¬
creasingly as a source of heat for many purposes, such as domestic cooking and
space and water heating, in addition to a number of industrial uses. After 1880,
however, gas for lighting purposes was subjected to increasing competition from
the new electricity supply industry; but the invention of the Welsbach incandes¬
cent mantle in 1887, which raised the efficiency of gas lighting very considerably,
enabled the industry to hold its own while the supply of gas for purposes other
than lighting increased. . .
The gas industry in its present form developed in the rnain during the period
between the wars when increasing competition from electricity had to be met and
when changes in social habits and outlook were taking place. The industry under¬
took a large-scale programme of modernization of production and distribution and
launched widespread sales promotion campaigns especially for the numerous uses
of gas in the home. By 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating
instead of a supplier of lighting.
Organization under Public Ownership
Under the Gas Act, 1948, the gas industry was brought under public ownership
and control on 1st May, 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269
belonged to local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. Together they
cover the whole of Great Britain and are charged with a statutory duty to develop
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
196
and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply to
domestic, industrial and other consumers. The national body is the Gas Council,
which is appointed by the Minister of Power and is responsible inter alia for advising
him on questions affecting the gas industry. It is a co-ordinating council, not a
trading body. It consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman and the
twelve chairmen of the Area Boards.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies of the other
publicly owned corporations, are charged inter alia with the responsibility of manu¬
facturing and distributing gas to consumers. Thus, their powers differ from those
of the Electricity Area Boards, which are limited to the distribution and sale of
current, while the central executive body—the Central Electricity Authority is
charged with the duties of generation and transmission. Each of the Area Gas
Boards which, like the Gas Council, are appointed by the Minister of Power, con¬
sists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman, in some cases one, and in one
case two, full-time members, and always five or six part-time members including
the chairman of the Area Consultative Council. There is no common pattern of
organization; each Board is fully independent and has devised its own subordinate
structure.
A link between the industry and the consuming public was established under
the nationalization scheme by the creation of a Consultative Council in each board
area. These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and not more than 30 members,
of whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen from panels of persons nominated
by the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland, the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a number
of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
As has been said, the Gas Council is not a trading body, but the operations of
the Area Boards have resulted in the seven years up to 31st March, 1956, in an
aggregate disposable surplus of over £13'5 million.
Labour Relations
Under the Gas Act, 1948, the Gas Council is responsible for arranging satisfac¬
tory procedures of collective bargaining and a system of joint consultation with its
employees. There are separate Joint Industrial Councils at the national level for
manual workers and salaried staffs, and subordinated regional councils and local
committees. At national and regional levels the councils combine negotiating and
consultative functions, but there are in some cases separate Consultative Commit¬
tees at the local level.
Production
In 1956, in Great Britain, 27-7 million tons of coal were carbonized by gas under¬
takings and 29-5 million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas industry.
About one-quarter of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas undertak¬
ings for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or
at collieries or steelworks.
In 1921, 250,300 million cubic feet of gas was manufactured by authorized gas
undertakings or acquired from coke ovens, and the number of consumers was 7'6
million. By 1955, gas manufactured and acquired from coke ovens for distribution
had risen to 2,912 million therms and the number of consumers had risen to
about 12-8 million, an increase of 140 per cent in the volume of gas available and
of about 67 per cent in the number of consumers.
INDUSTRY
197
In 1956, the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was 7,625 million
cubic feet, most of it for household use.
The total number of persons employed in the gas industry in March 1956 was
141,918.
Consumption
Half of all gas produced is sold for household use and the remainder for industry,
commerce and public services.
Domestic Use. While an accurate statistical analysis of the domestic load is not
possible, evidence given before the Ridley Committee (on Fuel and Power Policy),
appointed by the then Minister of Fuel and Power in 1951, suggested that about
70 per cent of the domestic load was used for cooking, the remaining 30 per cent
being spread over space heating, water heating and other installations. Most homes
in Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to
difficulties in storage and transmission, gas is not economic. These difficulties have
been overcome to some extent by the use of local high-pressure storage tanks but
this development is unlikely to grow, owing to the steady extension of rural elec¬
tricity supplies. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural areas.
Industrial and Commercial Use. Gas is used extensively in industries which re¬
quire a simple control of temperature to a fine degree of accuracy. Among such
industries are pottery and certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel
products. Industrial use of gas increased greatly during the second world war
and reached 103,000 million cubic feet in 1943. By 1956 industrial consumption is
estimated to have reached 759 million therms.
By-products
With the rapid increase in the volume of gas produced, the problems of the dis¬
posal of substances which were regarded originally as the ‘ waste ’ products of the
carbonization of coal (notably tar, benzole, sulphur and ammonia) became in¬
creasingly important.
Production of coke at gas works in 1956 was 12-7 million tons, and at coke ovens
ig’S million tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce over 2-9 million
tons of crude coal tar and about no million gallons of crude benzole a year. These
products, together with those of the sulphur and ammonia type, provide a source
for the manufacture of a long and ever-growing list of essential derivatives which
include dyestuffs (of which Britain now produces most of its own requirements),
fertilizers, plastics, germicides (the sulphonamides and sulphanilamides), insecti¬
cides, refrigerants, perfumes, and synthetic yams.
With further research and development, more especially in the field of organic
chemistry, the production of coal carbonization derivatives is becoming of increasing
importance to the economy of the industry.
Development and Research
The chief objects of capital expenditure in the years immediately after the war
were to overtake arrears of plant renewal. Plans for further expansion were approved
by the then Minister of Fuel and Power in 1954 and are outlined in the Gas
Council’s publication Fuel for the Nation.
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. Borrowings to a total of £235 million had been
authorized up to 30th June, 1954. The Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers)
Act, 1954, extended these borrowing powers to £450 million.
!q8 Britain: an official handbook
Capital expenditure in the year ended 31st March, 1956, was £61 million, com¬
pared with £46 million in 1952-53 and £36 million in 1950-51.
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable inte¬
gration by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas (through gas grids
and long-distance mains), enabling production to be concentrated in the most effi¬
cient units. Progress is also being made in interconnections for the reception of gas
from coke ovens, notably in Wales, Durham and Yorkshire.
Supplies of suitable coal to meet a steadily increasing gas consumption are
becoming more difficult to obtain. Investigations into alternative sources of gas
are being actively undertaken by the Gas Council. Gases from oil refineries (butane
or propane) are used in several installations in smaller towns remote from large
gas works or the grid systems. Progress has also been made with the possible use
of methane, drained from coal mines. In agreement with the National Coal Board,
Area Gas Boards have agreed to schemes for using methane from Point of Ayr
Colliery in North Wales and from Haig Pit at Whitehaven, in Cumberland.
Eight oil gasification plants are at present in operation and 20 additional plants
are on order. These plants will be capable of producing 82 million cubic feet of gas
per day and of saving 850,000 tons of carbonizing coal a year. The South Eastern
Gas Board and the British Petroleum Company are jointly building a plant to con¬
vert petroleum products from the company’s Kent oil refinery to gas of accept¬
able quality. It is expected that the initial installation, which will convert some
50,000 tons of petroleum products a year to gas and will have a daily output ot 18
million cubic feet of gas, should be completed by the summer of 1958-
The Gas Council is investing £1 million in a five-year survey for natural gas
within Britain. . ,
The research organization established by the Gas Council consists of a research
committee, which advises the Council on policy and sees that it is carried out; and
two research stations, one in London and one at Solihull, near Birmingham. Re¬
search is also carried out on behalf of the Gas Council at Leeds University and by
the British Ceramic Research Association (an autonomous research association
grant-aided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research). Furt er,
the Council and Area Boards support a number of research associations, the work
of which has a bearing on the gas industry. These include the Coal Tar Research
Association, the British Coal Utilisation Research Association and the National
Benzole Association. The underlying aim of the Council’s research programme is
to ‘make the most economic use of the natural resources available to the nation,
whether by improvements in existing processes of gas manufacture, by seeking new
processes or new sources of supply of gas and by the extraction and use of other
products of gasmaking’.
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The Government has for a number of years sought to promote efficiency in the
use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, and has been assisted by
various bodies representative of producers and consumers. _ .
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National Coal
Board, coal distributors and coal appliance manufacturers. It was formed in 1932
to give information and advice on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice
of installation and operation of solid fuel appliances, to domestic consumers and to
retailers of appliances. During the second world war, the reduction in coal produc¬
tion and the demands of war industry made economy imperative. When the Minis¬
try of Fuel and Power was formed in 1942, an industrial fuel advisory service with

regional branches was incorporated within it.^. In 1943 the Women’s Advisory
Council on Solid Fuel, consisting mainly of representatives of appliance manufac¬
turers, women’s organizations and others interested in the housewife’s point of
view on domestic fuel arrangements, was formed to advise women on the use of
solid fuel for heating and cooking.
Further measures have been taken during the last few years. Under a scheme
introduced in 1952, loans on favourable terms are available from the Exchequer to
industrialists for financing approved fuel-saving schemes. At present these loans
are interest-free for the first two years, repayment may be spread over a maximum
period of twenty years and no security is required. In October 1953, a non-profit-
making company, known as the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service, and
sponsored by the British Productivity Council (see p. 147), was formed to promote
fuel-saving in industry. This company, which largely replaced the industrial fuel
advisory service of the then Ministry of Fuel and Power, came into operation on
1st May, 1954. It provides advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a
variety of forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and power surveys and
regular visits on a contract basis. A survey of the generation and use of steam
carried out by the Ministry has been employed to show the possibilities in the
increased uses of back-pressure steam in the generation of electricity. The elec¬
tricity and gas industries, the largest consumers of primary fuel, are succeeding
each year in obtaining more energy from each ton of coal they use, by increasing
the thermal efficiency of their plants. The campaign for fuel efficiency is closely
linked with the campaign for the reduction of smoke (see p. 182).
WATER SUPPLY
Britain has a sufficient rainfall to ensure enough water to supply all its domestic
and industrial requirements. Water problems are mainly concerned with abstrac¬
tion, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface
sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds
and river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits
and boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings of different
kinds. Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests with the Minister of
Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with the Secretary of State
for Scotland in Scotland and with the Minister of Health and Local Government
in Northern Ireland.
Development of Water Supply in England and Wales
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service and then only after long and bitter controversy. It
was largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues, who demon¬
strated the dangers arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation, that the
Public Health Act, 1848, became law in England and Wales and laid the basis for
a long series of statutes dealing with public health.
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of separate large
water undertakings were set up to provide adequate supplies of pure water to the
expanding urban population, and the water supply system developed rapidly,
although in piecemeal fashion and with some overlapping and waste.
To meet the need for co-ordination and long-term planning, the Minister was
assisted from 1923 onwards by an Advisory Committee on Water, and Regional
Advisory Water Committees were established for important areas having common
water problems,
o

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Organization of Water Supply in England and Wales
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water supplies
are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this either by operating
a water undertaking themselves or by ensuring that other bodies are providing an
adequate supply. The householder receives his domestic water supply at a com¬
paratively small charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of
a water rate levied, like other rates (see p. 71), on the value of his house.
By the Water Act, 1945, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has
powers to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in England
and Wales. The same Act provided for a Central Advisory Water Committee to
advise the Government on general questions relating to water and dealt with the
local organization of water supplies and the powers and duties of local authorities
and water undertakers. Local authorities were required to secure piped wholesome
water in every part of their districts where there were houses or schools, unless it
was impracticable to do so at reasonable cost.
In the years between the passing of the Water Act and 1956* nearly 200 smaller
water authorities in England and Wales were absorbed by larger authorities or by
the creation of joint boards. The principal object of such amalgamation is the con¬
stitution of more efficient units in the water supply industry.
In March 1956 there were, in England and Wales, 888 local authority water
undertakings, 58 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards) and 13 joint
water committees, 91 statutory water companies, 24 non-statutory water com¬
panies, and 4 private proprietors with statutory powers. A considerable number of
private proprietors without statutory powers also provide small supplies. Water
undertakings vary greatly in size; of the statutory undertakings, some 2| per cent
supply about half the population.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which has probably the largest single water
undertaking in the world, supplies about 335 million gallons daily to about 6£
million people in the London area. The Board was established in i9°3> and in the
following year took over the undertakings of eight water companies which were
supplying the London area. It now consists of 88 part-time members who are the
elected representatives of the various local authorities within the Board’s area of
operations, together with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Con¬
servancies. The chairman and vice-chairman are chosen by members of the Board.
Present Supplies in England and Wales
Today, piped water supplies reach some 97 per cent of the total population of
England knd Wales. More than 90 per cent of households in rural areas have piped
water supplies or are within easy reach of water mains.
About £20 million a year is spent on capital development, financed mainly by
loans, the interest on which, together with running costs, is paidby the water under¬
takings from annual income. This income is derived from local water rates levied
on domestic consumers and from charges for supplies as recorded by meter in the
case of most industrial users. In addition to supplies from water undertakings, large
quantities of water are taken by industry from rivers or underground sources.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934, and under the Rural Water Supplies
and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955. By March 1956, schemes costing £67 million
had been completed or were in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, and in so far as such growth involves covering the ground with imper¬
vious material, so that water which previously would have percolated through to
INDUSTRY
201
underground natural reservoirs is now carried off in drains and rivers, some
diminution in water supplies may result. On the other hand, improved methods of
purification in recent years have resulted in greater use being made of water drawn
from the lower reaches of rivers.
The Ministry has completed some 32 surveys of existing water requirements and
of supplies covering most of England and Wales; these provide a basis for planning
possible future developments.
Water Supply in Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local authorities,
either separately or in combination with each other; they supply over 95 per cent
of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that
in England and Wales save that less reliance needs to be placed on underground
sources. Scotland has separate legislation. The Water (Scotland) Acts, 1946 and
1949, among other provisions, impose a general duty on the Secretary of State
to promote the conservation of water resources in Scotland; require local authori¬
ties to provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their districts, where
this can be done at reasonable cost; and provide for a uniform system of rating
for water throughout the country. The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts,
1944 to 1955, make available to Scottish local authorities grant assistance up to
a maximum of £30 million towards the cost of water supplies and sewerage schemes
in rural areas. By December 1956, schemes for rural areas costing £9 5 million had
been completed with the aid of such grants, and schemes worth £12-1 million were
in progress.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of fairly uniform soft water. The Water
Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, in addition to making provi¬
sion for the payment of government grant to all water supply authorities, places
upon them statutory obligations with regard to the supply of water to houses and
schools. Since 1945, a piped water supply has been, or is being, provided for every
town, and in rural areas piped water supplies are being extended.
River Management
The 32 River Boards set up under the River Boards Act, 1948, carry out the
functions and co-ordinate the various aspects of river management in England and
Wales previously performed by a large number of separate authorities.
Each River Board covers a River Board Area. The River Board Areas together
comprise the whole of England and Wales, except the Thames and Lee Catchment
Areas (which are under the jurisdiction of the Thames and Lee Conservancy
Boards1 respectively), the administrative County of London, and areas adjoining
that county not included in any catchment area.
River Boards are composite bodies representing local government, agricultural
and fishery interests, and most of their expenses are apportioned among the councils
of the counties or county boroughs concerned, in proportion to the rateable values
of property in the River Board Area.
River management in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not been concentrated
to the same extent.
It is an ofiFence for any person to permit any polluting matter, solid or liquid,
to enter a river. The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, iqSL revised and
1 The Thames and Lee Conservancy Boards are similar in constitution and powers to
the River Boards; because London draws most of its water supplies from these two rivers,
however, they have long been regulated under powers granted by Acts of Parliament of
purely local application.
202
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
strengthened previous legislation for the prevention of river pollution in England
and Wales. Enforcement of the Act is vested in the River Boards, the Thames and
Lee Conservators, and, in London and adjacent areas, in the councils of the metro¬
politan boroughs, counties, and county boroughs concerned. There is a similar Act
for Scotland under which eight river purification boards have been set up to pro¬
mote the cleanliness of the rivers in their areas.
Measurement of Water Resources
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface water
resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain, published
annually by H.M. Stationery Office. This publication contains particulars of the
run-off and related rainfall from a large number of rivers, streams and reservoired
areas. The Surface Water Survey Centre of the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government is responsible for the promotion of gauging, the collection of hydro-
logical information, and the publication of the Year Book. The field work of sur¬
face water measurement is carried out by river boards, water undertakings and
other bodies. General information as to rainfall, published annually in British
Rainfall, is the responsibility of the Meteorological Office (see p. 45), while the
subject of ground water comes under the Geological Survey and Museum (see
p. 419). In special cases the Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 4I2) carries out research into problems
of the design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of
surface water. A close liaison is maintained between these organizations.
Water Pollution Research
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research is engaged in investigating problems connected with the treat¬
ment of water for domestic and industrial supply, the treatment and disposal of
sewage and industrial waste waters, and the effects and prevention of pollution of
surface waters and underground water. The Laboratory maintains close contact
with other interested Government Departments, with municipal and other public
authorities, and with industry. Research is carried out with general supervision
and advice from the Water Pollution Research Board of the Department of Scien¬
tific and Industrial Research. The Board was set up in 1927 and its members are
appointed by the Lord President of the Council.
BUILDING AND CONTRACTING
The building and contracting industry is concerned primarily with the construc¬
tion and repair of houses, hospitals, schools, shops and factories, and with civil
engineering works such as bridges, docks, harbours, railways, airports and irriga¬
tion systems. In all, the industry employs some 1,400,000 persons (including 50,000
women) and provides about 6 per cent of the gross domestic output of goods and
services. It also makes an important contribution to overseas development.
Structure
Over four-fifths of the industry is in the hands of private firms. The typical firm
is small or medium-sized. Over 30 per cent of the firms in the industry are one-
man businesses engaged in such trades as house painting or plumbing, and nearly
60 per cent employ fewer than nineteen persons. At the other end of the scale there
are fewer than a dozen firms of building and civil engineering contractors, each
employing more than 5,000 persons on its permanent staff. Some of these are
INDUSTRY
203
integrated concerns owning quarries as well as workshops, extensive stocks of
mechanical plant, and the standard stores and tackle of builders’ yards: they also
undertake large-scale constructional contracts overseas.
Value of Output
The value of the annual output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily
since 1945, and in 1956 the total for Great Britain was £2,070 million. Of this
total, £343 million represented building work carried out by the staffs employed
directly by the public authorities (including Government Departments, local
authorities and certain public utilities), while the balance of £1,727 million repre¬
sented the output of private firms (new work, £1,330 million, and other work,
£397 million).
Housing Construction
In the post-war period most new houses (see pp. 386-7) in Britain have been built
by private firms working under contract to local authorities, but the proportion
built by private firms for private owners has increased appreciably since 1951.
About 15 per cent of local authorities employ direct labour in housing construc¬
tion, while about 64 per cent use their own labour for repair and maintenance. In
1956, the value of new housing put up in Great Britain by private firms was £567
million, of which £243 million was for private owners and £324 million for public
authorities.
Between 1945 and 1956, over 2,600,000 new permanent houses and other dwel¬
lings and some 160,000 temporary houses were built in the United Kingdom.
Prefabricated Buildings
Prefabrication is generally taken to mean factory production of most or many
of the component parts of buildings for transport to, and rapid erection on, a site.
Techniques of prefabrication have been developed in Britain over a period of at
least 150 years. A notable early example was the Crystal Palace, originally erected
in Hyde Park, London, from component parts made in Birmingham, for the Great
Exhibition of 1851.
Considerable advances in technology were made during the second world war
when greater use was made of lightweight materials, including aluminium alloys,
light strip steel and asbestos cement panels. In the earlier post-war years, prefabri¬
cation techniques were used extensively in the construction of temporary houses,
156,000 of which were provided up to 1949 by the Ministry of Works for erection
on sites made available by local authorities. These new techniques are also used
in the construction of permanent houses, and are being developed and applied in
the building of schools, hospitals, offices and shops.
The industry has made useful contributions to the post-war need for houses and
other forms of accommodation overseas. In 1956, exports of prefabricated buildings
were valued at £4 3 million.
Civil Engineering and Industrial Building
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale modern
industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment to carry out
major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent figures in the
early development of civil engineering included: James Brindley (1716-1772),
builder of canals; John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), pioneer in road construc¬
tion; Thomas Telford (1757-1834), builder of roads, docks and bridges; and George
Stephenson (1781-1848), Robert Stephenson (1803-1859), Joseph Locke (1805-
204 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
i860), Isambard Kingdom Brunei (1806-1859) and Thomas Brassey (1805-1870),
builders of railways.
Within the United Kingdom the industry has been occupied since the war with
large-scale reconstruction and development schemes. These have included work
on the repair, modernization and electrification of railways, road and dock develop¬
ment schemes, airports, sea defence works, thermo-electric and hydro-electric
power stations, improved water supplies, and drainage and sewerage systems. The
industry is engaged on a substantial scale on the construction of nuclear-based
power stations.
At the beginning of 1957, the civil engineering programme of work under way
within the United Kingdom included: £140 million on work for the National Coal
Board (see p. 182); £300 million for the British Transport Commission (see pp. 238-
40) for railways; and over £50 million for the Central Electricity Authority (see
p. 189); work estimated at £10 million on the Forth Bridge; £5 million on the
Whiteinch Tunnel, under the river Clyde at Glasgow; £10 million on the Dartford
Tunnel, under the Thames, linking Kent and Essex; £20 million on steelworks;
£5 million on docks and harbours; £10 million on hydro-electric works; and £10
million on oil refineries.
In Great Britain since the war, more than 14,000 industrial buildings of over
5,000 sq. ft. (with a total area of over 300 million sq. ft.) and many smaller factories
have been erected.
Overseas Constructional Work
Constructional work carried out overseas by British firms has included railways
in most parts of the world; large-scale irrigation works in India, Pakistan, Egypt
and Greece; and canals, roads, docks, harbours, power stations, airfields, hydro¬
electric schemes and industrial and housing estates in several countries.
Examples of more recent contracts include: hydro-electric schemes at Owen
Falls (Uganda), and Hirfanli (Turkey); major harbour works at Takoradi and
Tema (Ghana), and Aden; a new port at Salaverry (Peru); dry docks at Karachi
(Pakistan); houses, airfields, roads and bridges in Iraq; modernization of the trunk
road system in Iran; 14-storey blocks of flats in Toronto (Canada) and large-scale
industrial estate development in Annacis Island (Canada); a new engineering
college in Rangoon (Burma); the Auckland Harbour bridge (Australia); and the
Adomi bridge across the River Volta (Ghana).
It has been estimated that the value of work done during the year ended March
1957 by some 60 principal British building and civil engineering firms, operating
in more than 50 countries, was £94 million, compared with £87 million in the pre¬
vious year; and the value of contracts obtained rose from £71 million in
1954-55 to £92 million in 1956-57- Most of the work done was in the sterling
area, but the share of work done in the dollar area rose from less than 5 per cent
in 1954-55 to over 20 per cent in 1956-57-
Research and Development
Research into various aspects of civil engineering is undertaken by the Ministry
of Works, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), the
Admiralty, various universities and technical colleges, and by individual firms and
trade associations.
The civil engineering research work of DSIR is carried out through several re¬
search laboratories, including the National Physical Uaboratory, the Building Re
search Station, the Road Research Laboratory, the Forest Products Research
INDUSTRY 205
Laboratory, the Geological Survey and Museum, the Water Pollution Research
Laboratory, the Fire Research Station and the Hydraulics Research Station.
One notable example of this work is the research conducted during the past
twenty years on concrete manufacture by the Building Research Station and the
Road Research Laboratory in conjunction with United Kingdom universities and
the Cement and Concrete Association. Another is the research carried out at the
National Physical Laboratory into the effect of wind-pressure on bridges. This
work has been in progress since 1946, with the aid of wind-tunnels for the scale
models, and led to the discovery of two types of aerodynamic instability—an up
and down motion of the whole platform and oscillations of a twisting character.
Methods were evolved to modify or eliminate this instability. At the Imperial
College of Science and Technology, London, important research has been carried
out to discover the manner in which waves exert shock pressure on walls—a matter
of considerable importance to civil engineers, especially for maritime structures.
The principal professional body in the civil engineering industry is the Institution
of Civil Engineers, incorporated in 1828 by Royal Charter.
Some major advances in technology and materials have been made in recent
years, for example, in the mechanization of earth excavating and site clearance, the
development of mobile hoists, improvements in road-making techniques, new
methods of welding, the introduction of unit construction processes for bridge
building, and progress in concrete mixing and prefabrication.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
The United Kingdom’s manufacturing industries provide an exceedingly wide
range of products many of which play a major role in world trade. In terms of net
output and exports the most important groups of industries are those concerned
with the manufacture of metals and metal products, though the textile and chemical
industries are also of considerable significance. Some impression of the relative
importance of the different groups in terms of net output is given in Table 23,
which is based on the provisional results of the Census of Production for 1955.
An important feature in the expansion of United Kingdom exports since the
second world war has been the development of new types of commodities to

meet changing needs. In some cases, the industries concerned are based on inven¬
tions or discoveries made during or after the war; in others, the basic research had
been done before the war, but production on a commercial scale was not under¬
taken until later. Gas turbine aircraft, radar and man-made fibres are outstanding
examples of the products of these new industries.
METAL MANUFACTURE
The metal manufacturing industries employed 583,000 persons at the end of
1956. Nearly four-fifths of these were engaged in the production of iron and steel.
Iron and Steel
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and was responsible for the technical development
which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in the second half of the nineteenth
century. Today, Britain is one of the world’s four largest producers of steel and is
renowned for the quality of its special and alloy steels. In 1956, direct exports of
iron and steel amounted to 2'8 million tons valued at £i73 million, in addition to
indirect exports through the sales of the steel-consuming industries; exports of the
shipbuilding and vehicle industries, which are major consumers of steel, amounted
to about £402 million in 1954 and rose to £511 million in 1956.
Since 1945 considerable modernization and development has been undertaken.
Production of crude steel, which in 1946 totalled 12-69 million tons, rose to 20-66
million tons in 1956 and is expected to reach nearly 22 million tons in 1957- It is
planned to raise productive capacity to 28 million tons by 1962, of which 5 million
tons are expected to be required for exports. Expansion and modernization of the
industry, ranging from iron ore to finishing capacity, over the five year period to
1962, is estimated to cost £600 million.
About 465,600 people were employed at the end of 1956 in those industries
classified as iron and steel manufacture. Of these, 232,800 were engaged in iron and
steel smelting and rolling, and 121,800 in iron foundries. ,
South Wales and the north-east coast of England are the United Kingdom s
two largest steel-producing areas, together responsible for an annual production of
nearly 9 million tons. South Wales is engaged mainly in the production of flat
products, and is especially noted for tinplate. In the north-east coast area of England,
production is concentrated on heavy sections and rails, and plates for the ship¬
building industry. Scotland, with an annual production of 2^ million tons, finds
its chief internal markets in the shipbuilding and engineering industries of the
Clyde valley. Sheffield is known throughout the world for its special and alloy steels.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public supervision
since 1932, when a Government-appointed body, the Import Duties Advisory Com¬
mittee, gave special attention to the reorganization of the industry. During the
second world war the industry came under the direction of the Iron and Steel
Control of the Ministry of Supply and, from 1946 to 1949, was supervised by an
Iron and Steel Board responsible to the Minister of Supply. On 15 th February,
1951, the greater part of the industry came into public ownership by virtue of
the Iron and Steel Act, 1949. On that day the securities of about eighty iron and
steel producing companies (together with the control of their subsidiaries) were
transferred to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain established under
the Act, although the companies retained their separate identities and managements.
The 1949 Act was repealed by the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, which established
an Iron and Steel Holding and Realization Agency with the duty of returning the
companies to private ownership. By September 195^, there remained 28 companies

in which the Agency had direct holdings representing, in terms of steel production,
about one-quarter of the total production in the United Kingdom.
The 1953 Act also provided for the establishment of the Iron and Steel Board
to exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry with a view to
promoting the efficient, economic and adequate supply under competitive condi¬
tions of iron and steel products. The Board is responsible to the Minister of Power
and includes, in addition to the chairman and two other full-time members, a
number of part-time members drawn from steel producers, steel consumers and
trade unions.
Under an Agreement of 21st December, 1954, a Council of Association between
the United Kingdom Government and the European Coal and Steel Community
was established. It provides a means of permanent consultation on matters relating
to coal and steel of common interest to the two parties. One of the three com¬
mittees set up to assist the Council to carry out its tasks is concerned with problems
affecting the steel industry.
Non-ferrous Metals
Non-ferrous metals industries in Great Britain employ about 118,000 persons
and contribute about £135 million to the net national output.
Nowadays the mining in Britain of non-ferrous ores is confined to the working
of lead, zinc, tin and tungsten ores on a small scale. However, the United Kingdom
is a large consumer of non-ferrous metals, being second only to the United States
in its consumption of aluminium, copper, lead, tin and zinc. The industry consists
of factories for smelting and casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and draw¬
ing of these metals and also nickel and magnesium. The techniques of powder
metallurgy and pressure diecasting are also employed where appropriate. Some of
the non-ferrous metals such as nickel, molybdenum and tungsten are largely used
in steel alloys. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties have emerged
with the growth of new industries having their own particular requirements, as,
for example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium), jet aircraft
(columbium, magnesium, titanium, niobium) and electronic apparatus (selenium,
tungsten, germanium).
In 1956, direct exports of non-ferrous base metals (including semi-fabricated
products) were valued at £103 million, of which copper and its alloys accounted
for £61 million and aluminium and its alloys for £19 million. In addition, there
was a further substantial export of non-ferrous metals in many fabricated forms.
SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING
Britain has for centuries been one of the most important shipbuilding countries.
Modern shipbuilding dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, when the
iron and steam-driven vessel replaced the earlier sailing ship. Britain led the way
in the substitution of steel for iron and in the development of the steam turbine.
Between 1890 and 1913 Britain produced more than half the world’s new tonnage,
and in 1920 launched over two million tons, still the peace-time record for the
industry. The problem of surplus capacity and periodic heavy unemployment
appeared in all shipbuilding countries during the inter-war years. During the
second world war the industry was fully occupied in building and repairing war¬
ships and merchant ships of all kinds, and a high level of activity in the building
and repair of merchant ships has been maintained since 1945*
Shipbuilding is mainly an assembly trade, and Britain’s economy is well equipped
to meet this demand, with a highly developed iron and steel industry to provide
plates and sections, a modern marine engineering industry, and a widely diversified
208
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pattern of general industry to supply the numerous components that go to the
making of a ship.
Well over three-quarters of the tonnage of ships built in the United Kingdom
comes from four areas:
1. On the River Clyde in Scotland (where the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth
were built in the inter-war years).
2. On the north-east coast of England—along the lower reaches of the Rivers
Tyne, Wear and Tees, and at West Hartlepool, and Blyth.
3. On the north-west coast of England—on the River Mersey and at Barrow-
in-Furness.
4. At Belfast, in Northern Ireland, where the largest individual shipyard is
situated. A 45,000-ton luxury liner of revolutionary design, the largest
passenger vessel to be built in Britain since the Queen Elizabeth, is under
construction at these yards for the P. and O. Company.
In each of these areas there is capacity for building warships and all types of
merchant ships from large passenger liners and tankers to small sea-going ships
such as coasters and cross-Channel steamers. Ships are also built in the Southamp¬
ton area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the Rivers Forth and Tay,
in Scotland, while numerous places along the coast build fishing vessels, yachts,
harbour craft and barges. Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the great
ports and there are extensive repair facilities in all the shipbuilding areas.
There are many firms engaged in shipbuilding, although nearly half the output
of new ships is concentrated in the hands of about a dozen.
In the years 1946 to 1948 British shipyards launched half the world’s total new
tonnage. Since then, with the recovery of the shipbuilding industries in Japan and
Germany and the rebuilding of shipyards in some European countries after their
destruction in the war, the British shipyards have built a rather smaller proportion
of world tonnage, though total output from the shipyards has been fully maintained.
At the end of 1956 there were about 222,000 employees in the shipbuilding and
repairing industries, including those employed in naval dockyards. In addition,
there were 72,000 employed in marine engineering. In 1956, the total tonnage
launched from United Kingdom shipyards amounted to 1 *34 million gross tons,
representing about 21 per cent of world launchings; 328 ships, with an aggregate
tonnage of 2-14 million gross tons, were under construction; and at the end of
1956, orders were on hand for a further 265 ships of 2'26 million gross tons. Oil
tankers accounted for half the tonnage on order. The value of exports of ships and
boats in 1956 increased by £40 million to £94 million.
Over the past fifteen years traditional methods of shipbuilding have undergone
radical changes, primarily due to advances in welding technique. These have led
to the production of ships in large units, 50 to 60 tons in weight, prefabricated
under cover and rapidly assembled for launching.
The British Shipbuilding Research Association (BSRA) and the Parsons and
Marine Engineering Turbine Research and Development Association (Pametrada)
are developing gas turbines and improving the efficiency of diesel and steam units.
The Admiralty, the BSRA, the Atomic Energy Authority and private firms are
working on plans for the use of nuclear reactors for propulsion of merchant ships,
including large tankers.

machinery and accessories, ordnance and small arms, constructional engineering
goods, office machinery, cranes and conveyors. The total number of persons
employed in mechanical engineering at the end of 1956 was about 1,121,000 and the
value of exports in 1956 was about £500 million.
Agricultural Machinery
The agricultural machinery industry now employs about 50,000 people and has
an annual output valued at over £100 million. In 1956, its production included
139,000 tractors, 22,300 mouldboard ploughs, 6,300 disc harrows, 20,000 mowers,
5,400 combine harvesters, and 10,000 milking machines. Britain, where produc¬
tion dates virtually from 1933 when the English Ford Company produced 2,788
tractors, now has the largest annual output of tractors in Europe and the second
largest in the world, exports the greatest proportion of its output and is the second
largest exporter in the world. Exports of agricultural and track-laying tractors
(including spare parts) in 1956 were valued at £53-8 million compared with £5-2
million in 1947. Exports of other agricultural machinery were valued at £15'8
million in 1956 compared with £4'5 million in 1947- About one-third of these
exports are consigned to Commonwealth countries.
Boilers and Boilerhouse Plant
Boilers and boilerhouse plant manufactured in the United Kingdom have many
industrial, commercial and domestic applications. Water tube boilers of advanced
design and large steam-raising capacity are produced by the industry for home
power stations and for export. The industry is closely concerned with the develop¬
ment of equipment for nuclear power stations and, in association with electrical
machinery manufacturers, is in a position to manufacture and export all the com¬
ponent parts of nuclear power stations.
Shell boilers are used for steam raising and heating purposes in factories and in
commercial and domestic buildings. Production of these boilers during 1956 was
valued at £10 million, of which nearly £2 million worth was exported.
The total number of persons employed in the manufacture of boilers and boiler-
house plant at the end of 1956 was 32,300. The value of the industry s exports in
1956 was £i7-5 million, including £8 4 million for water tube boilers.
Items of steam-raising plant accessories produced include: plain and corrugated
boiler furnaces, forced draught boiler furnaces and grates, stokers, fuel economizers
and fireheaters, superheaters and desuperheaters, pulverizers, coal and ash hand¬
ling plant, soot blower equipment, steam pipework, and feed water heaters. The
annual value of production of these products is about £20 million, of which about
15 per cent is exported.
(
Machine Tools
The efficiency of a nation’s major manufacturing industries, and the consequent
prosperity of the nation, depends to a large extent on the vitality of its machine tool
industry. Britain was an early pioneer in the machine tool field, producing some of
the first basic types of machines in the late eighteenth century, and this pioneering
spirit still prevails today. In the development by a number of leading United King¬
dom manufacturers of ‘transfer lines’, and in the current research into the use of
electronic control in the machine tool field, Britain is already looking forward to
the not too distant future when the completely automatic factory may become, not
merely a possibility, but a fact. In more conventional designs, also, United King¬
dom manufacturers are constantly seeking improvements, and there are big
210
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
outstanding orders for both home and export, particularly in the range of borers,
grinders, lathes and presses.
The machine tool industry consists largely of small independent firms with a
high proportion of private companies; it employs about 50,000 workers. The
industry is centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to a
lesser extent near London and Glasgow. The Machine Tool Trades Association
of Great Britain is the representative body of most of the machine tool manufac¬
turers and importers and is responsible for the International Machine Tool Exhibi¬
tions held in Britain every four years. A highly successful exhibition was held in
London in June-July 1956, and the next exhibition will take place in i960.
The value of production of metal-working machine tools has risen from £6
million in 1935 to £85 million in 1956. Exports in 1956 amounted to a value of
£21 million, while orders on hand at the end of 1956 totalled £100 million, of
which £23 million worth was for export. Production of woodworking machine
tools in 1956 was valued at nearly £5 million, of which about £2 million worth
was exported.
Steelworks Plant
Britain occupies a prominent position among the steel-producing countries of
the world and, therefore, needs a flourishing industry to manufacture plant for the
steel industry. About 40 firms produce equipment for manufacturing steel at all
stages. In 1945, six of these firms, capable of supplying the entire range of steel¬
making plant, formed a company under the name of the Metallurgical Equipment
Export Company Limited (MEECO), to co-ordinate their export activities and to
make it easier for foreign companies to buy steelworks plant from the United King¬
dom. Since its formation the group has co-operated to carry out a number of large
contracts for equipping steelworks in Sweden, Norway, Spain and France, and in
April 1956 the Indian Steelworks Construction Company (ISCON), a group con¬
sisting of members of MEECO and other manufacturers, obtained a contract with
the Indian Government for the erection of a complete steelworks at Durgapur, in
West Bengal.
Production of steelworks plant in 1956 amounted to a value of £9'4 million, of
which £2 million worth was exported. Orders in hand at the end of 1956 amounted
to £17-2 million, of which £4-3 million worth was for export.
Textile Machinery
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry which developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. The industry
now gives employment to about 65,000 people and comprises between 450 and
500 firms, situated largely in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee,
Leicester and Nottingham, making every kind of machine and accessory for the
manufacture of yarns and fabric from all types of natural and man-made fibres.
The industry enjoys a world-wide reputation, not only for the high quality of its
products but also because it can offer a complete and modern range of equipment
consisting of: spinning machinery, including machinery for all the preparatory
processes; winding machinery and machinery for other processes prior to weaving;
weaving machinery; knitting, hosiery and lace machinery; printing, dyeing and
other finishing machinery; bast and leaf fibre machinery, of which the United
Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier; and all types of mill stores
and textile machinery accessories. In 1956, exports were valued at £45 million, or
about half of total production.
INDUSTRY
211
To maintain its place in the forefront of world suppliers of textile machinery,
the research and design departments of the industry are continuously engaged in
research into new and improved methods of textile processing, and in the develop¬
ment of machines to speed up production and to improve the quality of an ever
increasing variety of yarns and fabrics.
Contractors’ Plant
• Production of contractors’ plant in the United Kingdom before the war was
mainly concerned with small excavators, concrete mixing machinery and road sur¬
facing plant, including road rollers. But now many new machines, especially for
earth-moving, are in production. Examples are industrial crawler tractors, motor
graders, scrapers, trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, rippers and rooters.
Whereas output in 1935 was valued at only £2 million, in 1956 it reached nearly
£76 million, of which about £39 million worth was exported. Increased exports
have been mainly in the form of earth-moving machinery (other than excavators),
road rollers, and crushing and screening plant.
Refrigeration Machinery
The United Kingdom industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances
extending from refrigerators of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial
use, to refrigeration equipment for industrial purposes such as cold storage of
food; manufacture of chemicals and other products; ice-making plant and refrigera¬
tion plant for ships. Production of commercial and industrial refrigeration
machinery was well established before the second world war, but the present
large production of domestic refrigeration products has been built up since the end
of the war.
The value of the annual production of refrigeration machinery in 1956 reached
£30 million compared with £24 million in 1953. Exports totalled £13 million, or
more than 40 per cent of output.
Office Machinery
The office machinery industry is now second in size only to that of the United
States, and since 1945 has expanded at a remarkable rate. In 1956, the value of
production of office machinery was £45 million, of which nearly £18 million was
exported, including more than £3 million to dollar markets. The industry, in
association with the electronics industry, is developing the manufacture of elec¬
tronic computers and electric typewriters on a considerable scale.
Petroleum Equipment
Before the second world war, the production of specialized equipment for the
oil industry was on a small scale, but the rapid expansion in oil production and
refinery throughout the world has given rise to a substantial export business in
British fittings and plant. In 1956, British firms received orders for oil equipment
and materials (excluding tankers) to the value of about £154 million, more than
double the 1953 total, and including tubes, pipe-fittings and valves (£35 -7 million),
specialized drilling and production equipment (£15 '2 million), tools and machinery
(£101 million) and tankage (£8 7 million). Apart from the United States, Britain
is the world’s chief supplier of equipment for the petroleum industry.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The United Kingdom electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufac¬
ture, installation and operation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, ranging
212
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from giant generators to domestic appliances and the smallest components of radio
sets. It has produced all the equipment for the United Kingdom’s great post-war
power station programme and is an important supplier of equipment designed to
increase the productivity and efficiency of United Kingdom industry as a whole. At
the same time it exports large quantities of power station equipment and other elec¬
trical machinery and appliances to many parts of the world. In terms of monetary
value it is one of the two largest exporters of electrical goods in the world. The
value of exports rose from £192 million in 1955 to £217 million in i95^> an increase
of 13 per cent.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of more than 600,000, including
200,000 in the manufacture of electrical machinery, 134,000 in the production of
radios and associated goods and 49,000 in wireless valves and electric lamps.
Nuclear Energy
A separate industry is fast arising to supply the requirements of nuclear energy
development. In the main it is being formed out of sections of the electrical and
civil engineering industries, together with the scientific instrument industry and
the chemicals industry. Five major groups of firms have been formed for the supply
of complete nuclear power stations both at home and overseas, and two groups,
each consisting of United States and United Kingdom firms, are also ready to
execute export orders for nuclear reactors and power stations, including small
‘package’ type stations to serve small communities. There are two projects for
producing the sort of graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors. An organiza¬
tion, known as the Nuclear Energy Trade Associations Conference (NETAC), was
formed towards the end of 1956 to establish a permanent means of liaison between
United Kingdom firms engaged in the nuclear energy industry. NETAC includes
trade associations representing the chemical plant, electrical, scientific instrument,
water tube manufacturing and engineering industries.
Electronic Equipment
One of the newest and most vigorous branches of electrical engineering is the
manufacture of electronic equipment, including sound radio and television re¬
ceiving sets, underwater television apparatus, navigational aids, and electronic
computers. Much of the pioneer work in this industry, e.g., the invention of radar
and the initiation of the first public television transmission, was undertaken by
British scientists and engineers. About 200,000 people are now employed in the
electronic equipment industry, and the value of annual output more than doubled
between 1954 and 1956, in which year it was estimated to have totalled £200
million. Exports have shown a similar rapid expansion and were valued at more
than £40 million in 1956.
Electric Wires and Cables
This industry is concerned with the manufacture of cables and wires, including
submarine cables, for the distribution of electric power and for the telephone and
telegraph network.
At the end of 1956 employment in the industry totalled 65,000. The value of
insulated wire and cable manufactured in the United Kingdom rose from £95
million in 1954 to £129 million in 1956, and the value of exports over the same
period increased by nearly 50 per cent to more than £35 million.
Domestic Electrical Equipment
There are some 200 firms in the United Kingdom manufacturing a wide range
of electrical appliances for use in the home, including such products as washing
INDUSTRY 2X3
machines, vacuum cleaners, toasters, and irons. The annual output is valued at
approximately £58 million of which about £13 million is exported.
VEHICLES
Of the metal-using industries the vehicles group makes the largest contribution to
the export trade (about £418 million in 1956). At the end of 1956 it employed
1,174,000 people, including 296,000 in the manufacture of motor vehicles and
cycles, 265,000 in the manufacture and repair of aircraft, 162,000 in the manufac¬
ture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles and aircraft and 160,000 in the
manufacture and repair of locomotives, railway carriages and wagons.
Motor Vehicles
In size and value the vehicles industries are headed by the motor vehicles indus¬
try, which comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles other than
tractors. The industry is located mainly in the Midlands, and in the London area,
but is represented in most regions; it consists of a relatively small number of
assembly firms—headed by the ‘Big Five’ (British Motor Corporation, Ford,
Rootes, Standard and Vauxhall)—backed by a large number of component manu¬
facturers. The ‘ Big Five ’ are responsible for about 90 per cent of the output of
complete vehicles; the balance of the industry’s production is almost entirely
specialist cars and heavy commercial vehicles.
The industry has expanded considerably since the second world war, reaching
the record output of 898,000 cars and 341,000 commercial vehicles in 1955. Pro¬
duction declined in 1956 to 708,000 cars and 297,000 commercial vehicles, but
recovered strongly in 1957. The value of the industry’s exports (including parts)
has also increased greatly, and in 1956 reached nearly £300 million; these exports
included 318,000 passenger cars and 145,000 commercial vehicles.
Research is carried out at Lindley, Warwickshire, by the Motor Industry Re¬
search Association, an autonomous body founded in 1946 and partly financed by
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), but mainly by the
industry itself. Individual firms also have their own research facilities, and some
work in this field is done by DSIR’s Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory
at East Kilbride, Scotland. The development of disc brakes and the application of
gas turbines to motor vehicle propulsion are among the technical matters engaging
the industry’s attention at the present time. On the production side, some of the
new assembly plants in Britain, electronically controlled and using the minimum
of labour, may stand comparison with similar plants anywhere in the world for
efficiency and reliability.
The principal trade association in the industry is the Society of Motor Manufac¬
turers and Traders (SMMT), founded in 1902, which holds in London a Motor
Exhibition annually and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years.
Motor Cycles and Pedal Cycles
In 1956, the United Kingdom’s output of motor cycles (including motorized
bicycles and scooters) totalled 125,000 of which 44 per cent was for shipment over¬
seas. The total value of United Kingdom production, including parts and acces¬
sories, was about £20 million. Exports totalled almost £10 million in value. In the
record year of 1954, the industry produced 180,000 motor cycles, of which about
70,000 were for export.
Output of pedal cycles in 1956 totalled 2,870,000, of which two-thirds were
exported; in the record year of 1955 the industry produced 3,600,000 cycles. The
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
214
value of exports of pedal cycles, parts and accessories in 1956 exceeded £26 million;
the United States and Nigeria were the largest overseas markets.
The Association of the industry, the British Cycle and Motor Cycle Manufacturers
and Trades Union, holds an annual exhibition in London, usually in the autumn.
Aircraft
The development of the aircraft industry has been strongly influenced by defence
requirements, and during the period of peak war-time activity it employed nearly
2 million people as compared with an average of 35,000 in the immediate pre-war
years. Following the adjustments to peace-time conditions, the industry has under¬
gone a further period of marked expansion, with the numbers employed in¬
creasing from 162,000 in June I951 to 265,000 at the end of 1956. The increase has
reflected greater demand for both military and civil aircraft, the latter not only for
passenger travel but also specialized purposes such as crop spraying, survey work
and freight traffic; productive capacity for airliners is also being greatly expanded.
Research and development is being conducted on a considerable scale, including
work on guided missiles and associated problems.
Britain’s achievements in developing aviation and the aircraft industry have been,
and are, of outstanding quality. The science of aerodynamics was founded by
Sir George Cayley in the early nineteenth century; Sir Frank Whittle developed
the gas-turbine engine aircraft, and its first applications to scheduled airline service
were the turbo-jet Comet and the turbo-prop Viscount, the latter the most successful
post-war civil aircraft now in service all over the world. The larger Britannia has
started scheduled service and has also been ordered by United States and Canadian
airlines; it is the fastest cruising civil transport aeroplane, and at the same time
the most economical in operating costs as yet in service. Substantial orders have
also been placed for two other British gas-turbine airliners, the Vanguard and the
Comet IV. It is estimated that nearly half the world orders for gas-turbine aircraft
are held by United Kingdom firms.
The rate of increase of exports of the British aircraft industry is higher than that
of any other industrial group. Their value rose from £66 million in 1955 to £io4'5
million in 1956, including £72 million for aircraft and parts, and £28 million for
aero-engines. In 1956, the largest markets for aircraft were the United States of
America (£17 million), Australia (£11 million) and Sweden (£8 million).
The representative body of the United Kingdom aircraft industry is the Society
of British Aircraft Constructors, founded in 1916. Its annual exhibition and flying
display at Farnborough is one of the most important events of its kind.
Besides extensive research work by the industry, fundamental research on prob¬
lems of aerodynamics, structures and engines is carried out by the Ministry of
Supply, largely at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine
Establishment, both at Farnborough. This work is done in collaboration with the
industry and results are made known to manufacturers, who are in close touch
with the Ministry’s establishments. In addition, the National Physical Laboratory
undertakes research on aerodynamics.
Some recent British technical achievements include the by-pass type of engine,
the delta wing, the jet flap (for assisting landing and take-off within a small space),
and the first experimental machines to be capable of vertical take-off from a normal
horizontal position and of supersonic speed in level flight when climbing. In
January 1957, the Ministry of Supply, in conjunction with the aircraft industry
and the national airline corporations, announced plans for a research project for
developing a supersonic airliner; and in May i957> BO AC placed an order for a
new fast turbo-jet, the Vickers VC 10, for delivery beginning in 1963.

215
Railway Vehicles
Britain was the first country to develop the locomotive railway and British
engineers pioneered railway development in most parts of the world.
Locomotive production in Britain has come to be divided into two separate
sections: one of these comprises the locomotive works of British Railways, and is
engaged in building and repairing locomotives and rolling-stock for their use; the
other consists of private firms providing locomotives of all types for export, and
steam, diesel main line, diesel shunting and industrial types for home use. At the
end of 1956 about 76,000 persons were employed in locomotive manufacture and
84,000 in the manufacture and repair of railway carriages and wagons.
Production in 1956 included 218 steam locomotives, of which 65 wrere for export,
and 937 diesel and diesel-electric locomotives, of which 537 were exported. Output
of coaching vehicles (including rail motor vehicles) in the same year amounted to
2,335, and output of wagons to 70,500. The value of the industry’s exports in 1956
rose by £5 million to £45 million, of which £17 million was accounted for by
811 complete locomotives and £7-5 million by carriages and trucks.
MISCELLANEOUS METAL PRODUCTS
At the end of 1956 the number of persons employed in the industries covered by
this heading was as follows:
Thousands
Tools and cutlery . . . . . . . . . . . . 43-0
Bolts, nuts, screws, rivets, nails, etc. . . . . . . 43-7

Other metal industries . . . . . . . . . . 233-6
Total .. .. 510-0
Some of these industries are of considerable importance in the export trade. For
example, in 1956 the United Kingdom exported £22-7 million worth of implements
and tools (excluding machine tools).
Cutlery
At one time the production of cutlery was spread fairly widely throughout
England, but gradually it centred in the river valleys around Sheffield. When steam
replaced water as the motive power, the industry began to move in towards the
centre of Sheffield. The production units were very small and the industry was built
up on the high degree of skill of its craftsmen. The introduction of modern
machinery has largely replaced hand forging, and mass production methods are
now used by some firms in producing the cheaper range of products. The highest
quality wares, however, are still produced by the skilled craftsmen. Although in
recent years there has been some increase in the size of the production units, they
remain mainly small, and, of the 400 firms manufacturing cutlery, some 200 still
employ fewer than ten persons.
The annual output of the industry is now valued at about £10 million, of which
£4 million represents exports, mainly to Australia, Canada, the United States, and
South Africa.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Hollow-Ware
This industry is mainly located in the Midlands, although some production is
also carried out in Lancashire, Yorkshire, South Wales and London. Hollow-ware
production covers a wide range of goods and these are roughly divided into six
classes: wrought steel (including galvanized, enamelled and tinned), aluminium,
tin and terne plate, cast iron, copper and other metals. There is, however, an
increasing development in the comparatively recent production of plastic hollow-
ware. There are some 300 firms, of varying size, which are known to be manu¬
facturing domestic hollow-ware, e.g., saucepans and similar kitchen utensils.
The annual production is valued at about £2° million, of which about one-
quarter represents exports, mainly to Commonwealth countries. Aluminium manu-
factures comprise the largest single group, both in the value of total production i
and in exports.
Hand Tools
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest industries of the United
Kingdom. From the time when prehistoric man first learned how to fashion tools
from iron, hand tools of an ever-increasing diversity and precision have been made
in Britain, and today over 400 different types—in many thousands of sizes and
patterns—are made in British factories.
Production of hand tools falls broadly into the following groups: agricultural
and other heavy edge tools (including scythes and sickles); engineers’ and mechanics’
tools (including jacks and spanners); light edge tools (builders’ and joiners’ tools);
files and rasps; saws (hand, tenon and cross cut); and pliers, pincers and nippers.
There are about 400 firms, employing more than 18,000 operatives, in the
industry. Approximately 65 per cent of the total production comes from the
Sheffield area, 30 per cent comes from Birmingham, and most of the remainder
from London and Lancashire.
The industry has expanded considerably since before the second world war,
and in 1956 exports were valued at nearly £23 million, of which £13 million wTorth
was exported to Commonwealth countries.
CHEMICALS
It is difficult to define the chemical industry since, with the increasing dependence
of industry generally on synthetic raw materials, its scope is continually widening.
But on the broadest definition the industry includes the manufacture of such
products as acids, alcohols, alkalis, industrial gases, explosives, fertilizers, dyestuffs,
soaps and detergents, plastics materials, paints and pharmaceuticals. Manufacturing
these and other products, the chemical and allied trades employ about half a
million people and contribute about 7i Per cent of the total output of all manu¬
facturing industry. Exports of chemicals are also substantial and have increased by
more than 20 per cent since i954> amounting in 1956 a value °f £24S rnillion, or
nearly 8 per cent of total United Kingdom exports.
British pioneers made great contributions to the science of chemistry, as the
names of Robert Boyle, Joseph Priestley, Michael Faraday and John Dalton testify.
Contemporary British chemists who maintain the tradition include Sir Robert j
Robinson (who has done outstanding work on vitamins and hormones), Dr. A. J. P.
Martin and Dr. R. M. Synge (who were awarded the Nobel prize in 1952 for their
work in developing chromatography, a method of separating chemical substances)
and Professor Sir Cyril Hinshelwood (a joint-winner of the Nobel prize in 1956
for his work in the field of chemical kinetics, which has had practical applications
in the development of plastics).
INDUSTRY
217
Matching progress in science and the increasing demands of other industries, the
British chemical industry has expanded considerably during the present century.
More particularly, recent years have seen a rapid growth which has brought the
industry s volume of production up to more than two and a half times its pre-war
level. This post-war expansion has been most marked in two fields—production of
plastics materials generally, and the large-scale manufacture of a wide range of
organic chemicals from petroleum. In the latter field, over £45 million has already
been invested in seven major petroleum chemicals plants, and plans for a further
considerable expansion are in hand.
Heavy Chemicals and Dyestuffs
The heavy chemicals sector covers a wide range of acids, alkalis, alcohols, gases
and other basic chemical substances, many of which are fundamental to other
branches of the chemical industry as well as to other industries. One of the main
products, sulphuric acid, is now manufactured to an increasing extent from
indigenous deposits of anhydrite (calcium sulphate) instead of from imported
sulphur or pyrites. Since the war there has also been a greatly expanded produc¬
tion of raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic detergents, while trichlor-
ethylene has been in big demand in the engineering trades for mechanical
degreasing plants. The dyestuffs industry also continues to add to the already vast
and comprehensive range of its products, many of them developed from pioneer
British discoveries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Exports of synthetic
organic dyestuffs and pigments in 1956 totalled £10-3 million.
Plastics
The first plastic, celluloid, originally known as ‘Parkesine’, was first produced
in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes. Modern plastics originating in Britain
include Perspex’, polythene and ‘silicones’. (Silicones, which were discovered by
Professor Kipping at Nottingham, were developed in the United States and are
now being made in Britain.) Since 1939, there has been a very large increase in
the overall production of plastics materials, although expansion during the last
few years has been concentrated on polythene (used in cable coverings, packaging—
notably for foodstuffs—and domestic mouldings), polystyrene (a cheap non-
inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and, more recently, in durable
consumer goods), and polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC, and made into industrial
conveyor belting as well as a variety of other consumer goods such as raincoats and
curtains).
In the five years from 1951 to 1956, net sales of plastics materials have expanded
from 195,000 tons to 338,000 tons, the increase being most marked in the case of
thermoplastic materials, which rose by 110,000 tons to 176,000 tons. Exports have
also grown rapidly, and 93,000 tons, valued at £26-1 million, were exported in
i956; an increase in value of 15 per cent over the previous year.
Fertilizers
The production of fertilizers owes much to the pioneer work of the British
scientists, Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert, and the research now carried on
in the United Kingdom at Rothamsted and at the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen,
is of world-wide importance. Output of the industry in 1955-56 included 311,000
tons of nitrogenous fertilizers (in terms of nitrogen content), of which about 8 per
cent was exported, and 358,000 tons of phosphatic fertilizers (in terms of phosphate
content).

Pesticides
Important British discoveries in the last fifteen years have led to major develop¬
ments in the production of selective weed-killers such as methyl chloro phenoxy
acetic acid (MCPA), and of insectides based on benzine hexachloride (BHC).
Overseas markets take the major proportion of United Kingdom production of
these and other well-known pesticides such as DDT, systemic insecticides and
copper sulphate, exports of which amounted in all to some £10 million in 1956.
New products for plant protection are being steadily developed, for example,
tetram (an acaricide), aldrin (an insecticide) and new forms of synthetic hormones
with maximum growth-retarding properties.
Pharmaceuticals and Perfumery
About three-quarters of the pharmaceutical products sold today have been
introduced in the past twenty years. These products include sulphonamides, anti¬
biotics (e.g., penicillin), hormones, anti-malarial drugs (e.g., paludrine), liver
extracts, anti-histamines and anti-tubercular drugs. About £2 million a year is
spent on research. Total exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations
and druggists’ wares were valued at £38 6 million in 1956, while exports of per¬
fumery and toilet preparations, including soaps and detergents, were £26-8 million
in value.
Paints
About 42,500 people are employed in the paint industry, which comprises some
650 firms. Nearly half the total production is accounted for by fewer than 40 firms,
each employing more than 200 persons.
In recent years the application of improved techniques has resulted in rapid
development, in particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic resins and
various types of titanium dioxide pigment. The value of direct exports of pigments
and paints rose by nearly one-third between 1954 and r956 to a total of £23 5
million, of which 10 per cent represented shipments to Canada. The industry s
indirect contribution to exports in the form of supplying surface coatings for
finished goods is also very considerable.
Isotopes and Radioactive Materials
Isotopes and radioactive materials, used in medicine, agriculture and industry,
are a by-product of nuclear reactors, and in the United Kingdom they are produced
at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and dispatched ft-01)1
there and from the Radiochemical Centre at Amersham (see p. 415)- Britain is
the world’s largest exporter of these substances. In the year ended 31st March
1957, sales of isotopes increased by 12 per cent to a total value of £541,000. Half of
these sales were overseas, shipments being made to 52 countries.
TEXTILES AND CLOTHING
The value of exports in the textiles and clothing group as a whole, including
manufactures of wool, cotton, linen, jute, silk, rayon and man-made fibres, lace,
hosiery, woven apparel and carpets, amounted in 1956 to about £33* ^
slightly more than 10 per cent of total United Kingdom exports. Over million
people were employed in these industries in December 1956, including about
250,000 in the cotton textile industry, 208,000 in the wool textile industry, 91,000
in rayon and nylon production and weaving and silk, 89,000 in textile finishing,
etc., 126,000 in hosiery and other knitted goods, about 165,000 in other textiles,
and 490,000 in clothing (excluding footwear).
INDUSTRY
2IQ
Cotton
Spinning and weaving of cotton for the making of fustian with a cotton weft and
linen warp began to assume importance in the United Kingdom in the sixteenth
century; but it was the invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second
half of the eighteenth century that led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief consumer
goods industry and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth
century.
In the twentieth century increasing foreign competition and the tendency of
many countries, notably India, to set up their own textile industry cut progressively
into British markets. During the second world war, numbers of mills were closed
and, though many were brought back into production in the early post-war years,
the industry has recently again been declining in size, and the labour force has
dropped to about 60 per cent of the 1937 level. It remains, however, one of Britain’s
largest consumer goods industries, and plays an important part in the export trade.
Since the war a vigorous drive for quality and efficiency has been pressed forward
by the industry with support and assistance from the Government. Important in
this drive are the Cotton Board, a statutory body with the constitution and powers
of a Development Council, and the British Cotton Industry Research Association
(Shirley Institute), founded in 1919 for promoting scientific and technical research
in connection with cotton and its utilization. The industry now uses a considerable
and increasing amount of man-made fibres as well as cotton, and its dependence
on imported raw material has thus been reduced.
Most of the industry is located in south and east Lancashire, Manchester occu¬
pying a special position as its commercial centre.
There were about 146,000 persons employed in the spinning and doubling section
of the industry in December 1956, and 103,000 in weaving. About two-thirds of the
workers in the industry are women.
Production rose steadily from 1945 until the end of 1951, when the industry
began to feel the effects of the world textile recession of 1951-52. This was followed
by a partial recovery up to the beginning of 1955, when the trend turned down¬
wards again. Production in 1956 was about 40 per cent below the 1937 level, and
consumption of raw cotton totalled some 75,000 tons as against about 147,000 in
1937.
In 1956, exports of cotton yarn and woven fabrics were valued at £89 million,
or under 3 per cent of total United Kingdom exports.
Wool
The wool textile industry is the most ancient of Britain’s staple industries and has
been an important source of wealth since medieval times. There are two main
branches—woollen and worsted. While about 85 per cent of woollens and 95 per
cent of worsteds are made in Yorkshire, Scotland and the West of England have
retained their importance as specialized producers of high quality woollen cloth.
The woollen side of the industry is normally organized on a vertical basis,
with each firm undertaking the full process of manufacture from raw material to
finished product, but for a variety of reasons the worsted industry is organized
horizontally—combing, spinning and weaving being done by separate firms. Small
firms, employing fewer than 300 workers, predominate in the industry. Output
reached a post-war peak at the end of 1950, but this was followed by the recession
of 1951-52, which reached the lowest point in the middle of 1952. Production has
subsequently recovered, although not yet to the high level of 1950.
The number of persons employed in the industry in December 1956 numbered
205,000, of whom about 160,000 were directly engaged in production.
220
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The wool industry remains one of Britain’s leading export industries, with
between one-quarter and one-third of its total output shipped abroad; the total
value of exports of wool tops, woollen and worsted yams and woven fabrics in 1956
was about £127 million, of which over £31 million represented exports to the
United States and Canada. In addition, there were considerable exports of wool in
other forms, including carpets and clothing.
Research is carried on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association,
which is financed partly by a statutory levy on the industry and partly by a grant
from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
Other Textiles
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is believed
that the art of linen weaving was already being practised during the seventh cen¬
tury. Today it is an industry of small firms, chiefly in Northern Ireland (the greatest
linen manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in Scotland.
The principal raw material of the industry is flax, which is mainly imported (the
chief supplier is Belgium), but considerable quantities of man-made fibres and
cotton are also used, and a certain amount of soft hemp and jute, particularly in
Scotland. Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on the
lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely, but not exclusively,
of coarse linens and canvas. Technical problems are investigated by the Research
Institute of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in i9I9- Exports of
linen fabrics in 1956 were valued at over £11 million, the United States being the
chief market.
Jute, most of which comes from India and Pakistan, is the raw material for a
considerable industry centred in Dundee. Jute cloth is used for sacks and bags,
tarpaulins and backing for linoleum; yarns are sold for carpet backing and for
twine and cordage.
Silk exports were valued at about £1 million in 1956. Raw silk is supplied mainly
from Japan and Italy.
Rayon is produced from cellulose, either in the form of woodpulp or cotton
Enters. Its early development took place to a large extent in Britain. Production is
spread throughout the Midlands and Lancashire, with outposts in other areas.
There are eight companies engaged in the production of rayon, four producing only
viscose, three producing only acetate, and one both viscose and acetate. Technical
problems are studied at the research station of the British Rayon Research Associa¬
tion at Wythenshawe, Manchester.
Nylon is produced from a combination of chemical substances, most of which are
obtained from indigenous raw materials. It was introduced in the United States in
1938 and came into use in Britain in the second world war for parachutes. It is now
in large-scale production in Britain for general textile and industrial purposes.
Annual capacity amounts to about 30 million pounds.
‘ Terylene’ polyester fibre, a product of research in the laboratories of the Calico
Printers’ Association, Manchester, is made on a large scale at Wilton, Yorkshire,
by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. Annual productive capacity is being in¬
creased from 22 to 30 million pounds weight, and it is planned to construct a new
plant, also at Wilton, which will enable annual production to reach 50 million
pounds. A plant for the manufacture of ‘ Terylene' has been set up in Canada, and
the British patent holders have licensed its manufacture in other countries, includ¬
ing France, the German Federal Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan.
INDUSTRY
221
‘Fibrolane’ is a British-made protein fibre with wool-like properties, which is
also available on a commercial scale; it is derived from casein. Other man-made
fibres at present produced in Britain include 1 Courlene’ (a polythene fibre), and
'Alginate' (derived from seaweed).
‘ Courtelle ’, an acrylic fibre, is in pilot plant production. A plant to manufacture
another acrylic fibre 'Acrilan' is expected to begin production at Coleraine in
Northern Ireland early in 1959.
Since the advent of rayon in its various forms and, more recently, of the new
man-made fibres, British textile manufacturers have been developing a number of
ways of blending these with natural fibres and with each other. By this means they
can produce economically fabrics and garments with attractive and useful new com¬
binations of texture, colour, and finish, and with moisture-absorbent, hard-wearing
and crease-resisting properties.
FOOD, DRINK AND TOBACCO
At the end of 1956 the number of persons employed in this broad group of
industries was as follows:
Grain milling . .
Bread and flour confectionery
Biscuits
Meat and meat products
Milk products
Sugar and glucose
Cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery
Preserving of fruit and vegetables

From the export point of view the most important products of these industries
are: whisky (exports of which were valued at £48 million in 1956); refined sugar
(£27 million); tobacco and tobacco manufactures (£24 million); and chocolate,
chocolate preparations and sugar confectionery (£i8J million).
Bread and Flour Confectionery
The average weekly consumption of bread per head of population in Great
Britain is just over 3J pounds. In England and Wales particularly, the small
family’ type of baker, producing bread by hand or by semi-mechanical methods,
is still very prevalent, but there is an increasing trend towards large-scale produc¬
tion in fully mechanized bakeries. In the smaller bakeries, flour confectionery is
usually allied to bread production but there are many large specialist manufac¬
turers, particularly of slab cake. Exports of flour confectionery in 1956 amounted
to 950 tons, having a total value of £264,000. Exports of biscuits in the same year
were 20,000 tons valued at £5 -44 million.

BRITAIN*. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small number
of very large manufacturers and many hundreds of medium-sized and smaller
manufacturers. The industry’s products are highly competitive and several are
heavily advertised. Over 95 per cent of the production of chocolate and sugar con¬
fectionery is in the hands of about 300 firms, while the more specialist products—
cocoa powder, cocoa butter and chocolate covering—are manufactured by about
30 firms.
The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk,
nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery for home and export
sale totalled about 680,000 tons in 1956, compared with about 655,000 tons in 1955.
There are virtually no restrictions on imports of chocolate and confectionery, but
these totalled less than 10,000 tons in 1956. Consumption of chocolate and confec¬
tionery in the United Kingdom is far higher than in any other country in the world,
being equivalent to over 8J oz. per head per week in 1956, compared with 7 oz. per
head before the war. In 1955, the total value of exports of chocolate, sugar confec¬
tionery and cocoa products reached a record level of over £19 million, of which
£7-8 million went to the dollar markets. In 1956, exports of chocolate and sugar
confectionery rose further, but there was a fall in exports of other cocoa products
leaving a total value of £i8J million (£7-2 million to the dollar markets). Manufac¬
turers’ total turnover is well over £200 million.
Whisky
Scotch whisky, which was first distilled at least as long ago as the fifteenth cen¬
tury, is now of world-wide popularity. Modern whiskies are blends of twenty or
more different kinds, some made from malted barley, some from other grains.
Whisky is one of the United Kingdom’s largest individual dollar earners; more than
half the annual exports are shipped to the United States. Other valuable markets
are Canada and other Commonwealth countries, and Venezuela.
Brewing and Malting
Brewing. There are some 426 separate breweries located throughout the United
Kingdom, of which the main centres are London, south Lancashire, Burton-on-
Trent (Staffordshire), Birmingham, and Edinburgh. In the main, brewers distribute
their beer for consumption within 30 miles of the brewery, but some of the largest
brewers send their beer all over the country. M^uch of the beer is consumed in
draught but in recent years the demand for bottled beer has increased and is now
probably as much as one-third of total consumption. Bottling is carried out by
both brewers and independent bottling establishments. The industry s raw materials
are malt (chiefly made from home-grown barley), sugar and hops. Consumption
has declined appreciably from the exceptional levels of the immediate post-war
years; the drop has, however, been halted since 1951- In the year ended 31st March,
1956, duty of £258-5 million was paid on 25-3 million bulk barrels. Since the war
the industry has maintained a sizable export trade, which in 1956 was valued at
£2 7 million.
Malting. There are in the United Kingdom several hundred malting units. Some
of these are operated by brewers who make part of their own malt. The remainder
are operated by maltsters who produce chiefly for the brewing industry but also
supply the distilling industry and some food industries, such as bakery, vinegar¬
making and malt extracts. There is also a limited production for use in the textile
industry. These units are mainly situated east of a line drawn from Edinburgh
through Burton-on-Trent (Staffordshire), to Lyme Regis (Dorset), that is, in the
INDUSTRY
223
chief barley-growing areas. Of the total malting capacity, 60 per cent is in the eastern
half of England, 13 per cent in Staffordshire (nearly all at Burton-on-Trent and
in the neighbourhood), 12 per cent in Scotland (mainly Edinburgh) and 15 per
cent in the remainder of the United Kingdom.
Malting usually takes place in the cooler months following the harvest but with
the aid of air-conditioning plant some units can operate throughout the year. Grain
is the only raw material used by the industry and while there are no restrictions on
imported grain, maltsters chiefly use home-grown barley, especially grown for the
purpose. Exports of malt in 1956 were valued at £1*4 million.
Tobacco
In recent years, over £800 million annually has been spent in Britain on cigarettes
and other tobacco goods (of which over two-thirds was tax revenue). The tobacco
manufacturing industry meets virtually the whole of this home demand and, in
addition, exports worth over £23-6 million were shipped in 1956 to a large number
of overseas markets. The tobacco industry is concentrated in Nottingham, Bristol
and London. The industry uses nearly 300 million lb. weight annually of raw
tobacco, all of which is imported. The main sources are the United States, Rhodesia,
India and Canada, in that order.
Most of this tobacco goes to make cigarettes and pipe tobaccos. There is, in
addition, production of cigars and snuff; cigars, chiefly Cuban and Jamaican, are
also imported.

Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Brickmaking
Introduced by the Romans, brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, and
something like 2,000 different varieties of building bricks are produced in the United
Kingdom today. These are made in over 1,000 active works which range from small
seasonal yards using traditional hand methods to highly mechanized plants, some
of which are among the largest and most efficient of their kind in the world. The
224
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industry has made a vigorous recovery from the reduced activity enforced on it
during the war years, and its total output now exceeds 7,000 million bricks a year.
Refractories
Refractories occupy a key position among the basic industries of Britain, for
without the materials of furnace construction few, if any, high temperature pro¬
cesses, as carried out at present, would be possible, and the development of the
metallurgical, glass, ceramic and fuel industries would have been hampered. Recent
developments in the fields of atomic energy and jet propulsion are also creating a
demand for new and improved refractory ceramics.
Refractories are essential in the operation of blast furnaces, steel furnaces and
other metallic furnaces; in the refining and manufacture of copper, zinc, aluminium
and other non-ferrous metals; in coke ovens; in the production of electricity; in the
construction of locomotive fireboxes and ships’ boilers; in the production of glass
and cement; in the building of kilns for all the ceramic industries; and in many
chemical processes. Of the chief raw materials required for the production of refrac¬
tories, fireclay, silica and dolomite are indigenous, while magnesite is obtained partly
from imports and partly from production of sea-water magnesia. Chrome ore, which
is used in about the same quantities as magnesite, is entirely imported, as are
kyanite and bauxite which are used in much smaller quantities.
The chief centres of the industry are in the Midlands, west Yorkshire, north¬
east England, Scotland, and Wales, but there are also undertakings in other parts
of the United Kingdom. The principal trade association is the National Federation
of Clay Industries, founded in 1928.
Production has averaged about 2 million tons a year since 1948, mainly for home
consumption. Exports of refractories and construction materials in 1956 were
valued at about £3-6 million.
Pottery
The pottery industry is one of the oldest craft industries in Great Britain; the
making of domestic pottery dates back to before the Roman occupation. The chief
raw materials, china clay, ball clay and china stone, are to be found mainly in
Devon and Cornwall where known deposits of high quality are expected to last for
at least 100 years.
The Stoke-on-Trent area in Staffordshire, comprising the six towns of Stoke,
Burslem, Tunstall, Hanley, Fenton and Longton, is the centre of the industry and
contributes between 75 and 80 per cent of total production. Important factories are
also to be found in Worcester, Derby, Bristol and Poole.
Before the second world war about one-third of the production of domestic
pottery was sold overseas. Of the £28 million worth of pottery produced in 1956,
£13 million worth was for export. Bone china accounts for about one-fifth and
earthenware for three-quarters of exports. About three-quarters of bone china
exports go to Canada and the United States, and the largest markets for decorated
earthenware are Canada, Australia and the United States.
The modern industry benefits from a tradition of good design and craftsmanship,
made world-famous by a long line of great British potters, which is the basis of the
large overseas and domestic demand for its products. Among the famous makes of
British pottery are: Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton,
Royal Crown Derby and Coalport.
Sanitary Drain Ware
Other branches of the clay industries produce sanitary ware and stoneware pipes.
Metals and plastics are now being increasingly used, but there is still a very large
INDUSTRY
225
production of sanitary ware in fireclay, earthenware and, to a lesser extent, vitreous
china. The products are of a high technical standard for which there are exacting
British Standard Specifications. Stoneware pipes, also, are made to exacting speci¬
fications for carrying away sewage and other corrosive drainage in sanitation
schemes. These pipes are made from clays rich in silica, highly vitrified and salt-
glazed. They are produced in several districts, mainly by extrusion presses which
have superseded the potter’s wheel. Exports of sanitary and drain ware in 1956
were valued at £4-6 million.
Glass
Britain has a large and efficient glass industry with a wide diversity of products.
The section of the industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in
their various forms is organized for quantity production, and the development of
modern methods has enabled the industry to cater for an increasing range of
requirements. Glass can now be supplied in sheets of great size and can be made
almost unbreakable. Its use for internal decoration and as a finish for internal and
external walls has greatly increased in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass
are produced for the motor industry. Exports of plate and sheet glass of all types
had a total value of £10-6 million in 1956.
The rapid technical progress of the industry has led to the production on a large
scale of tubular glass, optical glass and also glass insulators for use in electricity
transmission. The development of Fibreglass, for insulation and as a filament, is
considered to offer great scope for the glass industry. The advance of the industry
is shown by the increase in exports of all glassware from a negligible level in 1938
to £18 million in 1956.
Cement
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland Cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of continuous
technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity of the industry has
increased substantially since the war to meet the growing demands of the building
and civil engineering industries. Annual output, which reached 7 7 million tons in
1938, had risen to nearly 13 million tons by 1956, valued at more than £70 million.
Despite a high and rising level of home demand, the industry maintains its position
as the largest exporter of cement in the world wfith markets in over 40 countries.
In 1956 the value of these exports totalled £9-8 million.
Scientific and Industrial Instruments
Scientific instruments have been made commercially in Britain for over three
centuries, early products being chiefly navigational and optical instruments. The
last twenty years have brought a large-scale expansion of capacity in Britain to meet
the needs of the defence services during the war and, later, the expanding world
demand for all types of instruments (optical, mechanical, pneumatic, electrical,
electronic and nucleonic), for both pure and applied science. There has been a
growing demand for instruments in industrial science in relation to quality pro¬
duction and efficiency in manufacturing processes, such as in the metal, chemical,
textile and petroleum industries, and in the development of atomic energy.
Some 108,000 people, mostly highly skilled craftsmen, are now employed in the
industry. In 1956, a wide variety of instruments and apparatus—including photo¬
graphic, optical, cinematographic, and associated instruments and equipment, and
clocks and watches—to a value of approximately £38 million were exported directly,
226
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and, in addition, considerable quantities of instruments were exported as part of
plant and equipment.
Jewellery, Gold and Silver Ware
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware is an industry in which British
craftsmen are heirs to a great tradition. The quality of the metal in gold and silver
wares made or sold in the United Kingdom is guaranteed by a ‘hall-mark’. The
law requires that gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall¬
marked at one of the Assay Offices. These are in London, Birmingham, Chester,
Sheffield, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The importance of maintaining definite standards of fineness for wares of gold and
silver has always been recognized, and the Goldsmiths’ Company in London has
carried out the assay and hall-marking of such wares since 1327 when Edward III
gave the Company its first charter.
At the end of 1956, 29,000 persons were employed in the manufacture of
jewellery and plate and in the refining of precious metals.
Leather
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. Tanneries are situated in
most parts of Britain, but there are important concentrations in Lancashire, York¬
shire, the North Midlands and the London area. Many different types of leather
are produced, ranging from the heavy types produced for industrial uses, such as
machinery belting, to high quality decorative leather, used for high fashion foot¬
wear and fancy leather goods.
At the end of 1956, about 33,500 persons were employed in the leather tanning
and dressing industry, and 24,000 in the leather goods industries. In 1956, the
United Kingdom was the world’s leading leather exporter, with exports valued at
£13 million, of which almost £4^ million went to dollar markets. Research into
tanning processes and the improvement in the quality of finished products is carried
on by the Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association.
Leather Footwear
The British footwear industry is among the most important in the world, and
factories are located throughout the British Isles. Some areas, however, concen¬
trate on production of particular types, e.g., the Rossendale Valley region of Lanca¬
shire for slippers, Bristol for heavy industrial footwear for miners and agricultural
workers, Northampton for men’s and youths’ footwear, and Leicester for women’s
and girls’ shoes. The British Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association
enjoys a world-wide reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.
About 120,000 persons are employed in the manufacture of leather footwear, and
output of boots and shoes in 1956 totalled some 134 million pairs. Exports reached
a record level in 1956 exceeding £11 million in value.
Paper and Board
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until 1678,
but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year 1492.
Today, many different materials are used in the manufacture of paper and board,
the most important of which are woodpulp, esparto grass, straw, waste of hemp,
flax and jute, rags and waste paper; the consumption of these materials now totals
some 3 -75 million tons a year, of which about two-thirds comes from abroad. The
other third consists mainly of waste paper, three-quarters of which comes mainly
from domestic sources; annual consumption of this material, mostly in the produc¬
tion of board and the cheaper types of paper, exceeds one million tons.
INDUSTRY
227
Total production in 1956 of all types of paper and board (including newsprint)
amounted to 3*28 million tons—slightly less than the 1955 total, the highest ever
reached—compared with a pre-war figure of 2-6 million tons. Of this, newsprint
accounted for 643,000 tons as against 800,000 tons pre-war. Exports for the same
period amounted to 259,000 tons, valued at £27 million, including 136,000 tons
of newsprint, valued at over £8 million. The bulk of the export trade is to sterling
area countries, mainly Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and the Irish Republic.
During the second world war, many paper-making machines were lost through
enemy action, but the installation of new machinery and plant resulted in the rapid
recovery of the industry. Today, the industry comprises some 200 mills producing
almost every type of paper and board, including the world’s largest paper machine,
producing a web of newsprint 302 inches wide. There are also many firms engaged
in the conversion of paper and board for various purposes. In addition, the industry
has considerable interests abroad, with pulp and paper producing mills in the
United States, Canada and other parts of the Commonwealth, and in the Scandi¬
navian countries.
There has been a considerable amount of research on raw materials and their
economical use, new and more efficient methods of generating steam have been
introduced, and there is now a much wider use of technical knowledge at the various
mills. Already expansion schemes running into many millions of pounds sterling
have been announced with the result that within the next few years there will be
a large increase in production of paper and board, and especially of newsprint.
Printing
The main sections of the printing industry are concentrated in the larger towns,
notably London, although firms engaged in more general printing are also located
in smaller centres. The shortage of skilled workers has led firms to introduce the
latest developments in high-speed printing equipment, including electronic engrav¬
ing machines and advanced processes of photographic reproduction. The value of
the industry’s annual output exceeds £140 million.
Rubber
The United Kingdom rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world,
dating from 1819 when Hancock, the inventor of the first method of processing raw
rubber on a commercial scale, set up a factory in London. He afterwards colla¬
borated with Macintosh, the inventor of water-proof garments, and it was another
Scotsman, Dunlop, who in 1888 devised the pneumatic tyre as it is now used. At
the present day, tyres and tubes represent more than half the total output of the
industry. More recently British firms have pioneered cellular rubber and latex foam
products, and they also make a great variety of other rubber manufactures, such as
rubber footwear, belting, cables, hose and thread.
The industry is second in size only to that of the United States, employing some
113,000 workers and consuming 11 per cent of the world’s total consumption of
natural and synthetic rubber. There are some 800 firms located throughout the
country. In 1956, they exported £39'4 million worth of goods, trwo-thirds in the
form of tyres and tubes. This figure does not take into account the large indirect
exports on motor vehicles.
Although the industry is highly mechanized there is still room for craftsmanship,
as in the building of a tyre, where perfect quality depends on the skill of the indivi¬
dual. To maintain the technical superiority of the industry, advanced experimental
work is carried out at the Shrewsbury laboratories of the Research Association of
British Rubber Manufacturers.
VI. TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
SHIPPING
Nearly 20 per cent of the world’s shipping tonnage of 100 gross tons and over is
registered in the United Kingdom, which has the largest merchant marine in active
employment. A greater tonnage—26 million—is registered in the United States but
over half of this is in the Reserve Fleet. United Kingdom ships probably carry about
one quarter of the world’s international sea-borne traffic in passengers and goods,
and ply regularly on the routes linking the countries of the Commonwealth (see
back end-paper map) and also to most of the main ports throughout the world.
The amount of the United Kingdom’s own sea-borne trade carried in British ships
at the present time is not known exactly, but it seems likely that about 60 per cent
of its imports and 75 per cent of its exports, by value, are carried in British registered
ships. The United Kingdom balance of payments figures show that shipping pro¬
vides one of the biggest net contributions to the balance of payments; in the year
ended June 1956 it was £112 million. This figure does not, however, represent the
actual net overseas earnings of United Kingdom shipping since it excludes tanker
earnings and includes some of the disbursements of foreign ships in United King¬
dom ports and the payments for the use of foreign ships. The last examination,
made in i952> °f the total net overseas earnings by all types of United Kingdom
shipping gave a figure of £221 million.
THE MERCHANT FLEET
At 30th June, 1956, a total of 19-5 million gross tons of merchant shipping
(steam and motor vessels of 100 gross tons and over) was registered in the United
Kingdom. In 1939 the tonnage was 17-9 million and in 1930 was at its highest
level of 20-3 million.
Notable trends in the composition of the merchant fleet in recent years have been
the reduction of tramp tonnage, the growth of tanker tonnage, the increasing size
of tankers, and the commissioning of vessels specially built to carry ore, sugar and
other commodities in bulk. Including Admiralty and other tankers, the United
Kingdom accounts for over five million gross tons or nearly 20 per cent of the
world’s total tanker tonnage.
Propulsion
The amount of coal-fired tonnage has fallen in recent years to about one million
tons. Oil has taken the place of coal in steamships, while steam has continued to
give place to the diesel engine, about 40 per cent of all tonnage being diesel driven
in 1956. In recent years, experiments have been made in the use of gas turbines in
ships. In March 1952, the first crossing of the Atlantic using this form of propul¬
sion was made by the tanker Amis, which was due to put to sea again, in the latter
228
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
229
half of 1957, with new and improved gas turbines. The latest development is the
undertaking of research into the application of nuclear propulsion to merchant
ships, with Government sponsorship and with the co-operation of the shipowning,
shipbuilding and marine engineering industries; several large nuclear powered
tankers are being planned by groups of private firms.
Age Distribution
Of the total gross tonnage, some 23 per cent is under 5 years old, 20 per cent is
between 5 and 9 years old, 31 per cent is from 10 to 14 years, 11 per cent is from
15 to 19 years and 15 per cent is 20 years old and over. Taking the tanker fleet
separately, as much as 37 per cent is under 5 years old, 20 per cent is 5 to 9 years, 30
per cent is 10 to 14 years, and only 13 per cent is 15 years and over.
Size Distribution
The size distribution of ships is given in Table 24. There are four ships of
30,000 gross tons and over. These are the Queen Elizabeth (83,000 tons), the Queen
Mary (81,000 tons), the Mauretania (35,667 tons), and the Caronia (34,000 tons)
all operated by the Cunard Steamship Company on its transatlantic services.

Distribution by Use
In April 1957, there were over 18 million gross tons of merchant ships of 500 gross
tons and over trading in private ownership on the United Kingdom and Colonial
registers. Of this 8-5 million gross tons were employed as ocean-going liners (both
passenger and cargo), 2-9 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps, i-6 million
gross tons in short sea and coastal services1 and 5*2 million gross tons as tankers.
These figures2 do not include tonnage managed by shipowners on behalf of the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation or managed on behalf of Canadian owners
and registered in the United Kingdom; Admiralty tankers are also excluded.
1 It is not possible to give separate figures for shipping engaged solely in coastwise
traffic which serves the United Kingdom’s inland transport system.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SHIPPING ORGANIZATIONS
Excluding Government-owned tankers, cable ships, passenger ships used as
troopers and emigrant ships, and ships owned by the British Transport Commission
(see p. 242), the business of merchant shipping in peace time is in the hands of
private enterprise. The main organizations concerned with the activities, interests
and common problems of the industry are as follows:
The Corporation of Lloyd's
This body, which was founded in the seventeenth century, is a society of under¬
writers whose main business is marine insurance (see also pp. 315-6).
Lloyd's Register of Shipping
Lloyd’s Register is an organization, distinct from the Corporation, which surveys
and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
It will accept responsibility for surveying and giving technical advice on vessels of
all flags from the initial stages of building, at regular intervals during their service,
and after casualties. A satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an under¬
writer that he may accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between
the Register and the Corporation of Lloyd’s.
Shipowners' Organizations
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for the
most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool
Steamship Owners' Association. The General Council of British Shipping co-ordinates
the views of the shipping industry as a whole on all matters of major policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas. There are, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners' Association, the
London General Shipowners' Society, and the North of England Shipowners' Associa¬
tion. Others represent companies specializing in a particular trade or type of cargo.
Employers’ Organizations
The Shipping Federation and the Employers’ Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organizations concerned with labour relations and the regula¬
tion of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are responsible for the
administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, under which
shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 tons and above engage them through
the Merchant Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to offer
two-year Company Service contracts. The Shipping Federation is also responsible
for the day-to-day operation of the National Sea Training Schools set up for the
purpose of training ratings for the deck and catering departments and as firemen.
Seafarers' Organizations
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association; navi¬
gating officers, engineer officers, apprentices, cadets, pursers and ships’ surgeons by
the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers' Association; and radio officers by the Radio
Officers’ Union. Some uncertificated engineer officers are represented by the
Amalgamated Engineering Union. The interests of the deck, engine-room and
catering ratings are represented by the National Union of Seamen.
The National Maritime Board
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representatives
of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of wages and
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
231
conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except by special arrange¬
ment, National Maritime Board Agreements do not apply to vessels under 200
gross tons, or to certain other ships, including tugs and salvage vessels. Detailed
working of the Board is carried on by a number of ‘ panels ’ representing the various
interests of those forming the seafarers’ part of the Board.
Conferences
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a series
of ‘ conferences ’ designed to secure standardization and stability of rates, and to
maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle of a confer¬
ence is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or passenger fares
from each port of departure. Each conference meets from time to time to review
and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones. Some of the conferences may
be connected by rate agreements, or may have joined together to form wider
groupings.
The Baltic Exchange
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest shipping market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’ repre¬
sentatives meet here to arrange the chartering of ships, or space in ships, for the
carriage of all kinds of goods to and from all parts of the world. Other classes of
business transacted on the Baltic include the chartering of air transport (see p. 260)
and the purchase and sale of grain and oilseeds.
RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is the Government Department
responsible for most matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Mer¬
chant Shipping Act of 1894 and subsequent legislation it administers many regu¬
lations for marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-line (or
Plimsoll line) that ensures that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that standards
of safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision of adequate
life saving, fire fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, pro¬
fessional standards, health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the work which
these responsibilities entail is carried out by the Marine Survey and Mercantile
Marine Officers at the ports. There is also a Registrar-General of Shipping and
Seamen in whose office at Cardiff a complete record of all British ships and seamen
is kept. The Ministry is represented on the Merchant Navy Welfare Board (see
P- 234) and on the Merchant Navy Training Board (see p. 233). It fosters the
development and use of modern navigational aids. It is responsible for the admini¬
stration of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955, which prohibits British ships
registered in the United Kingdom from discharging persistent oil within a wide
zone of the sea around the United Kingdom and also continues the prohibition,
first imposed in 1922, of the discharge of oil of any description from any source
into United Kingdom territorial waters and harbours. Those parts of the Act
which deal with prohibited zones, other than those necessary for the protection of
the United Kingdom, will take effect when the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, comes into force. The United
Kingdom and five other countries have ratified the Convention but it requires to
be accepted by ten countries, including five with not less than 500,000 gross tons
of tanker tonnage each, before it can be brought into operation.
Q.
232
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Ministry is responsible for transporting by sea the men and materials of
the Armed Forces and looks after ships that it owns or has chartered. It is also
concerned with general shipping policy and the strategic implications of the Mer¬
chant Navy. The Ministry maintains close liaison with the shipping industry on
such matters and on problems relating to imports and exports and special
passenger requirements.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those provi¬
sions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the United King¬
dom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of the Commonwealth and
Colonial Governments.
Lighthouses, Pilotage and Rescue
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation administers the Coastguard Ser¬
vice. This is primarily a life-saving organization which keeps watch at danger points
around the coast for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by means of
rocket life-saving apparatus or by informing other authorities who may be in a
position to give help. There are 155 stations manned by the regular coastguard
force, which totals 536. In addition, there are 162 auxiliary stations where a watch
is kept in bad weather and 86 other stations where life-saving equipment is stored
although no watch is kept; these auxiliary stations are manned by the civilian
volunteers forming the Coast Life-Saving Corps. Members of the Corps, which
is about 7,000 strong, also operate the rocket life-saving apparatus. There is close
liaison between the Coastguard Service and the Royal National Lifeboat Institu¬
tion. The latter maintains lifeboats around the coast of the United Kingdom; it is
supported entirely by voluntary subscriptions, and depends largely for its operation
on voluntary workers. Lifeboats were launched 745 times in 1956, a record for any
peace-time year, and saved 533 lives.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first Royal
Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board of ten Elder
Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. It is also the chief
pilotage authority in the United Kingdom, having the management of all
matters relating to pilots and pilotage in the London area, the English Channel
and certain other coastal districts of the United Kingdom. Lighthouses in Scotland
and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the Commissioners of Northern
Lighthouses and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. The Ministry of Transport
and Civil Aviation also has certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses
and pilotage.
THE MERCHANT NAVY
Strength
The number of masters, officers and men serving in December 1956 in British
ships on articles of agreement opened or closed in the United Kingdom was about
152,000. In addition, there were about 49,000 seamen serving in United Kingdom
registered ships on articles opened or closed overseas.
Training
Nautical training in the United Kingdom has two distinct objectives, first to give
intending entrants into the Merchant Navy an introductory training before going
to sea—this is commonly known as ‘pre-sea training’—and secondly, to prepare
those who have already performed the requisite sea-service, qualifying them for
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 233
admission to the examinations, for the various statutory and other certificates
granted by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
The Merchant Navy Training Board has been set up to consider and make
recommendations concerning the training of the various classes of boys and men
who enter the different departments in the Merchant Navy. It rests with the ship¬
ping industry itself and the appropriate Government Departments, however, to
decide whether any particular recommendation should be adopted. The main func¬
tion of the Board is in promoting, encouraging and guiding the instruction and
studies at sea of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their examinations
for certificates of competency as second mate.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation holds examinations for, and issues
certificates of competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate
of foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first class
engineer and second class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board ships
in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Pre-sea training is not compulsory for those who go to sea as apprentices or
cadets but most shipping companies will, in practice, accept only those who have
undergone such a course. There are a number of residential and non-residential
training establishments (some of which are public schools) which provide courses
of varying length. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation allows a proportion
of the time spent in recognized establishments to count towards the period of sea
service which the apprentice or cadet is required to perform before becoming eligible
to take the examination for a second mate’s certificate. Navigating officers become
eligible for examinations for first mate’s and master’s certificates after further
periods of qualifying sea service.
Sea-going engineer officers usually receive their basic training in engineering by
serving a suitable apprenticeship of not less than four years in engineering work¬
shops ashore, although part of this period may be spent at approved courses in
mechanical engineering. An alternative scheme of training has, however, recently
been introduced under which shipping companies themselves select apprentices
for a special course of training consisting of a two-year diploma course in a techni¬
cal college, followed by eighteen months’ training at sea and finally twelve months’
training in an engineering workshop ashore. Sea-going engineer officers are first
employed as junior engineers: they become eligible to take examinations for second
and first class certificates of competency after performing periods of qualifying sea
service.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of proficiency in wireless tele¬
graphy issued by the Postmaster-General on the results of an open examination.
All boys who wish to join the Merchant Navy as deck or junior catering ratings
must undergo a course of pre-sea training. The majority receive their training at
the National Sea Training Schools but courses are also provided by certain private
organizations and by a number of local education authorities.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom registered
ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted by the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certi¬
ficate a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on
deck, have attained a certificate of proficiency as lifeboatman and have passed an
oral and practical qualifying examination. This qualifying examination for the
certificate may, however, be taken on reaching the age of 18 after twelve months’
service at sea as a deck rating, and those who pass may be issued with an efficient
deck hand certificate, which enables the holder to serve at sea in a similar capacity
to that of an A.B.
234
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for a
second mate’s certificate.
Conditions of Employment and Welfare
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board (see p. 230). Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both
officers and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take two-year
contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with the industry as a
whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the normal unemployment insurance
benefit when they are ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and
seamen’s unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Ministries
of Transport and Civil Aviation, Labour and National Service, Pensions and
National Insurance, and the Colonial Office, has been responsible since 1948 for
the control and co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant seamen in the
United Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
In the United Kingdom, the Board runs 15 Port Welfare Committees and has
regional seamen’s welfare officers in Glasgow, Liverpool and South Shields. It
manages directly a number of Merchant Navy houses and clubs, and many others
are run by voluntary societies. In overseas ports the voluntary societies run some
300 clubs for British merchant seamen.
PORTS
There are over 300 ports in the United Kingdom. The eleven largest are shown
in Table 25, which lists them in order of tonnage of shipping arriving and depart¬
ing and does not relate to the volume of cargo handled. Most ports, other than
those owned by the British Transport Commission, are represented on the Dock
and Harbour Authorities’ Association, formed in 1917 to represent the common
interests of port authorities in their relations with Government, shipowners and
traders.
The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of dock
estate, is the largest port in the Commonwealth, and with New York and Rotterdam
is one of the three largest ports in the world. Goods of every imaginable kind, from
meat to marble, from plywood to perfume, pass through the docks. Imports are
distributed all over the United Kingdom, though the port supplies, primarily,
Greater London and the Home Counties which have a population of some
million persons.
Liverpool—with Manchester, an inland city made into a port by the construction
of the Manchester Ship Canal—serves the industrial Midlands, Lancashire and
Yorkshire. Grain is prominent among the imports of Liverpool, which, including
Birkenhead on the opposite bank of the Mersey, is the second largest milling centre
in the world. Tobacco is another major import and is stored in what is probably the
world’s largest warehouse. Liverpool is also important for transatlantic passenger
traffic and short sea-route and coastwise trading. Manchester’s chief import is raw
cotton.
Southampton, largest of the Channel ports, is the chief port for ocean passenger
traffic. It owes its importance to its double tides and easy access from London.
A considerable volume of oil is now handled for the refinery at Fawley.

Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial North-East
and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest ship-repairing centre
in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of York¬
shire and the Midlands. Middlesbrough imports iron ore for, and exports iron and
steel from, the local iron and steel industries.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales. As
well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its immediate
neighbourhood, but its rapidly increasing importance derives largely from the oil
which it imports and exports for local refineries.
Bristol and Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the highly
industrialized city of Bristol itself, and have also a large coastal trade.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepdt centre for the industrial
area dependent on the Lanarkshire coalfields.
Grangemouth, also in Scotland, handles mainly crude oil for the local refinery,
and also imports timber and paper-making materials.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main Irish
Sea traffic.
Ownership
The ports, in some cases docks only, previously owned by the main-line railway
companies are now under national ownership and are administered by the British
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
236
Transport Commission (see pp. 238-40). The Commission owns some 30 percent of
Britain’s dock accommodation with a total of over half a million feet of quays. A few
of the Commission’s ports are docks developed by former canal undertakings, such
as the Aire and Calder Navigation which developed Goole. The rest are those
formerly owned by the railways. In some cases—e.g., at Southampton and Middles¬
brough—the railways owned the main docks in ports where the statutory authority
was a harbour board. In other cases—e.g., at Grangemouth, Garston and Grimsby—
the port was largely developed by the railway company which was itself the statu¬
tory harbour authority. Some railway-owned ports were, and still are, mainly used
for the railways’ cross-channel services: Folkestone, Harwich, Newhaven, Fish¬
guard, Holyhead, and Heysham are in this category. Among other ports owned by
the Commission are Hull, Swansea, Newport, and Cardiff. The shipping arrivals
and departures at the Commission’s docks, harbours and wharves in 1956 totalled
over 100 million net tons, and the total cargo handled was about 65 million tons.
At the end of 1956 there were 20,000 people employed there.
Other ports are controlled by a public trust on which are represented users of the
port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other bodies such
as Government Departments and local authorities. Examples are London (con¬
trolled by the Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour
Board), Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners) and Glasgow (Clyde Navigation
Trust). The Port of London Authority has 28 members. Ten of the members are
nominated as follows: by the Admiralty (1), the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation (2), the London County Council (4), the Corporation of the City of
London (2), and the Corporation of Trinity House (1). Eighteen of the members
represent various port users: shipowners (8), merchants (8), owners of river craft
(1), and public wharfingers (1). The Authority’s duties include the maintenance
of adequate river channels, the regulation of traffic, the provision and upkeep of
moorings and the licensing of wharves and structures in the area under its control.
A few ports—Bristol is the most important example—are owned by the town or
city council and controlled entirely by a committee of the council.
Finally, there are about 100 ports which are privately owned. Manchester is the
only major port so owned—by the Manchester Ship Canal Company—and here
the Manchester City Council exercises considerable control by appointing 11 of the
Company’s 21 directors.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main, set down
in private Acts of Parliament which relate specifically to the ports concerned.
Labour
There are about 150,000 people employed in the operation of British ports. Just
under half of these are administrative, clerical and technical staff, and pilots, lighter¬
men and customs officials. Over half are the dock workers (formerly and still
popularly called ‘ dockers ’) who do the physical work of handling cargo.
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule, with
the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers available,
sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual labour until 1941,
when war-time schemes were introduced to control the port registers of employers
and workers. The war-time schemes were superseded in 1947 by a permanent
scheme administered by the National Dock Labour Board. Workers on these registers
now receive a guaranteed minimum wage even when there is not enough work for
all of them. The Board consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, and eight members
appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, four to represent
employers and four to represent dock workers.

Tanker Terminals
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude oil
are berthed at special tanker terminals situated near the oil refineries and owned
and operated by the oil companies. Existing tanker terminals are at Thameshaven,
Shellhaven, Coryton and the Isle of Grain, all in the Thames estuary; at Fawley
on Southampton Water; at Eastham and Stanlow in the Manchester Ship Canal
area; at Heysham in Morecambe Bay in Lancashire; at Finart, Bowling and
Ardrossan on the Clyde (the first two are connected by a pipeline to the refinery
at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth). There are other tanker berths in the rivers
Tyne, Tees and Humber on the east coast of England, and in several main ports,
such as Swansea (see photograph facing p. 198).
Several new tanker terminals are planned, including one at Hook in Southampton
Water for tankers up to 60,000 dead weight tons; one at Tranmere, in the River
Mersey, for 45,000 d.w.t.; and two at Milford Haven, in south-west Wales for
100,000 d.w.t. As some of the larger existing tanker terminals are unable to berth
fully-laden oil tankers of more than 32,000 d.w.t., the Milford Haven projects have
assumed great importance in meeting the new trend in size of tankers.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly by
road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland waterways
play an important part in carrying freight, particularly bulky cargoes. Passenger
and freight traffic on the domestic services of British airlines is steadily increasing
(see pp. 256, 257 and 260). There are in Great Britain some 19,000 route-miles of
railways (51,300 track miles) and nearly 200,000 miles of road, of which only about
one-quarter may be classed as main roads. The railway network was developed
mainly in the nineteenth century from 1840 onwards (and there are now more rail¬
ways per square mile in Britain than in any other country, except Belgium), while
the building of new roads and the widening and strengthening of old ones to accom¬
modate the increasing motor-vehicle traffic has been, and still is, a feature of the
twentieth century.
In 1956, the number of passenger journeys made by public transport (road and
rail) in Great Britain was about 17,000 million. In addition, in the summer of 1956,
3,887,906 motor cars and 1,326,210 motor cycles were licensed for use on the roads.
The annual mileage of most of the cars is believed to be between five and ten
thousand. Journeys by public transport are mainly short and a great many of them
are to and from places of work. The resultant concentration of travel in the morning
and evening ‘rush hours’ constitutes a formidable problem in London and other
centres of industry and commerce.
A general picture of Great Britain’s domestic freight transport system is pro¬
vided by the figures in Table 26, produced as the result of a special inquiry into
goods transport by road made in 1952; they are only rough estimates, but no more
accurate or up-to-date figures exist for the system as a whole.
In 1956, British Railways carried 21,473 million net ton-miles2 of freight (918
million net ton-miles less than in 1952) and there were 1,173,311 goods vehicles
on the roads (about 200,000 more than in 1952) so the share of freight traffic carried
by road has increased.
1 For an account of inland transport in Northern Ireland, see page 251.
Net ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance
it was carried.

The State has for a long time exercised considerable control over public trans¬

safety and of efficiency has increased steadily throughout the twentieth century.
THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION
Today the British Transport Commission has an annual turnover of £700 million
and is the largest single employer of labour in the country, employing some 800,000
men and women. Its present role and structure are the result of a series of Transport
Acts passed since 1947*
The Transport Acts of 1947, 1953 and 1956
On 1 st January, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act
of 1947, most of Great Britain’s1 inland transport system passed into public
ownership. On that date, the railways, all railway-owned steamships, docks, hotel
and road transport interests, most of the country’s canals (including all those
owned by the railways) and the whole of London’s passenger transport system
came under the control of the British Transport Commission, a newly created
public authority, which was given the duty of providing an efficient, adequate, eco¬
nomical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities
for passengers and goods. In addition, the Commission was to arrange for the
gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance road haulage firms. Road
passenger transport outside London was not taken over, but the Commission was
given power to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating passenger services by road
and rail, including power to acquire road passenger undertakings for this purpose.
A considerable amount of road haulage, several waterways and many docks were
left outside the Commission’s scope.
1 In Northern Ireland public ownership was brought into effect by the Transport Act
(Northern Ireland), 1948 (see p. 251).
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 239
The Conservative Government which took office in 1951 announced a new
policy for the operation of public transport, including decentralization of the rail¬
way administration, greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice particu¬
larly in charging, the partial return of long-distance road haulage to private
enterprise, and the revocation of the Commission’s power to make schemes for
the co-ordination of road and rail passenger services. The policy was put into effect
by the Transport Act of 1953, and the actual reorganization of the British Trans¬
port Commission was completed by 1st January, 1955. A further Act, the Transport
(Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act, 1956, was necessary to complete the
reorganization of the road services.
Today the British Transport Commission resembles in organization, purpose
and status a large-scale commercial corporation. It is in keen competition with
public and private transport by road, sea and air.
Present Organization
Under the provisions of the 1947 Act, the British Transport Commission is
responsible to the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation who, in turn, is respon¬
sible to Parliament. The Minister appoints the members of the Commission (with
the maximum membership of 14 members and a chairman) and is empowered to
give general directions to the Commission in the national interest and to approve
the general outline of programmes of major development and of training, education
and research. The Commission was originally given borrowing powers of £275
million, which were increased to £600 million in 1955. The Transport (Railway
Finances) Act, 1957, provides for a temporary extension of the purposes for which
the Commission may borrow or secure advances (see p. 240). An annual report
and statement of accounts is submitted to the Minister who lays it before
Parliament.
The Commission itself is a policy-making and not a managing body. It works
through six policy-making Committees each dealing with one particular subject
in relation to all the Commission’s activities, and through Sub-Commissions which
are not policy-making but each of which takes a special interest on behalf of the
Commission in the activities of one of the ‘Divisions’ (see below) and serves as
a clear and easy channel of approach to the Commission. These Committees and
Sub-Commissions are composed of members of the Commission.
There are seven Divisions to carry on various activities of the Commission’s
undertaking: British Railways, British Road Services, Tilling (bus) Group, Scottish
Omnibus Group, British Transport Docks, British Transport Waterways, British
Transport Hotels and Catering Services. The management of British Railways is
in the hands of six Area Boards (the areas corresponding with the former regions,
see p. 242) which leave day-to-day management to the General Managers of the
areas. Important matters affecting general policy are reserved to the Commission
and are dealt with by the British Railways Division and the Railways Sub-
Commission.
Road passenger transport and the underground railways in the London area are
operated by the London Transport Executive (see p. 250), which was established
as an agent of the British Transport Commission by the Transport Act, 1947.
Since September 1956, the business of British Road Services has been conducted
through five limited companies with some 15,000 vehicles altogether. The shares
of all these companies are owned by the Commission although two companies may
still be disposed of as going concerns. British Road Services’ Board of Management
controls the operating companies through their Boards of Directors. For purposes
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
240
of executive management there are six geographical divisions and one division
(Pickfords) for special traffics.
Consultation with coastal shipping operators is provided by the Coastal Shipping
Advisory Committee, which was set up under the 1947 Act to consider, and from
time to time to report to the Minister on all matters jointly affecting the interests
of the British Transport Commission and those of coastal shipping. The 1953 Act
extended the scope of the Committee’s work to include road haulage. The members
of this committee are appointed by the Minister from the Commission and from
among representatives of coastal shipping after consultation with interests concerned;
it is intended to arrange for road haulage interests to be represented on the com¬
mittee. The Commission also consults with the operators of coastal liners on questions
of rates and charges at the Coasting Liner Conference.
Financial Results
The Commission reported in 1956 that it had earned a working surplus in every
year since it came into being in 1948, but in several of those years the surplus
earned was insufficient to meet the central charges of the Commission, which
include central administrative expenses and interest on stock. The Commission is
permitted to balance its accounts ‘taking one year with another’, but at the end of
1934 it had an accumulated deficit of £39 million. By the end of i955> following a
railway strike and a period of increased costs, the deficit had increased to £70
million, and by the end of 1956 it was nearly £120 million. The Commission is
confident that the various corrective measures that it has in hand, particularly pro¬
jects that will be completed early in the railway modernization programme (see
pp. 243-4), bring its financial position into balance by 1961 or 1962. Mean¬
while, in order to place the organization on a sound financial basis during the
critical years of reconstruction, the Government will, under the Transport (Railway
Finances) Act, 1957, make special advances to the Commission up to £250 million
to meet the annual revenue deficits for this limited period. The advances made will
be liable to interest and will be repaid in instalments.
Transport Tribunal
The Transport Tribunal, set up under the 1947 Act, has jurisdiction over the
charges schemes which govern the maximum charges which the British Transport
Commission may make on British Railways, on the road and rail services provided
by the London Transport Executive, at its docks, and by tolls for the use of inland
waterways. The Tribunal replaced the Railway Rates Tribunal (see pp. 24i~2) and
has also taken over responsibilities from certain other statutory bodies. Appeals
arising from applications for road haulage (goods vehicles) licences are heard by the
Tribunal and it has other duties relating to harbours and canals.
Transport Users’ Consultative Committees
There are eleven Area Transport Users’ Consultative Committees and a Central
Transport Consultative Committee for Great Britain, which were set up under the
1947 Act, to give transport users an opportunity of putting forward criticisms and
constructive suggestions for improving transport services provided by the Com¬
mission. The members of these committees are appointed by the Minister, after
consultation with interests concerned, to represent commerce, industry, agricul¬
ture, labour, local authorities and the British Transport Commission itself. The
area committees in England report to the Central Committee, which reports to the
Commission and the Minister, who may give directions to the Commission upon
any matter dealt with by a recommendation of the Central Committee. Since i953>
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 241
the Scottish and Welsh Committees also report direct to the Minister. Matters
dealt with include the British Transport Commission’s proposals for closing branch
railway lines, withdrawing passenger train services, closing stations, and com¬
plaints by the public of inadequacy of services or facilities.
RAILWAYS
For a hundred years Great Britain has had a widespread railway network and,
despite the vast and rapid growth of road and air transport in recent times, the rail¬
ways remain a vital part of the country s transport system. The passenger services
alone show how important a role the railways have to play in this system, particularly
in comparison with the role of railways in some other countries. For instance, the
service of British Railways’ Southern Region carry annually almost the same number
of passengers as all the Class I railways of the United States of America, although,
of course, the average length of journey is much less. The urban and suburban
passenger services for London, Glasgow, South Lancashire and Birmingham carry
about 12' million passengers a day, mainly to and from their work in brief rush hour
periods. These services account for about half the annual total of 1,000 million
passengers on British Railways. The railways are also indispensable to a great part
of the basic freight traffic. Every day British Railways haul a total of some 60
million ton-miles of freight and the flexibility of their operations enables them to
deal with sudden heavy movements of bulk freight such as coal, or crops at harvest
time. In 1956 British Railways carried a total of 277 million tons of freight.
Britain was the pioneer of railway development which was so essential to indus¬
trial and commercial expansion. Railroads were in use around pits and ironworks
by the end of the sixteenth century, but the trucks were mainly drawn by horses.
In the early nineteenth century various British engineers showed how locomotives
could be used and George Stephenson was responsible for improved locomotive
design. In 1825 the Stockton to Darlington railway was opened as the first public
railroad on which locomotives were used. This was followed by the Liverpool and
Manchester railway of 1830 on which George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ loco¬
motive was employed. The great period of railway building was from 1840 to 1875,
with a short lull following the collapse of the speculative railway boom in 1846.’
Government intervention began in 1846 with an Act of Parliament prescribing a
standard gauge of 4 feet 8^ inches for all new lines except extensions of the Great
Western Railway, which then had a gauge of 7 feet; it was not completely converted
to the standard gauge until 1892. During the 1840s and 1850s some railway com¬
panies were amalgamated and arrangements were made between the others to facili¬
tate through traffic from one company’s system to that of another. The Railway and
Canal Traffic Act of 1854 obliged the companies to provide reasonable facilities and
to avoid undue preference between users. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of
1888 drew up a standard freight classification and schedules of maximum freight
charges which came into operation in 1893 ! alterations in rates had to be approved
by a Railway and Canal Commission.
During the first world war the railways all came under centralized Government
direction through a Railway Executive Committee. This experience served to empha¬
size the need for concentration and a comprehensive reorganization of the system.
Accordingly, the Railways Act of 1921 amalgamated 123 companies into four large
groups: the London, Midland and Scottish, London and North Eastern, Great
Western, and Southern. The Railway Rates Tribunal, which was established to take
over the functions of the Railway and Canal Commission, was entrusted with the
duty of carrying out an annual review of standard rates and fares which were to
242
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
be adjusted with reference to the principle of maintaining to the companies a
standard net revenue equivalent to that of 1913. In the inter-war years, the railways
suffered both from the general industrial depression and from the growing compe¬
tition of road transport, and the standard net revenue was never earned. The rail¬
ways experienced sharp competition, partly because road transport often offered
cheaper and better facilities and partly because the statutory regulation of the rail¬
ways’ charging system led to the loss of some profitable traffics and the retention
of unprofitable ones. Proposals made by the railways in 1938 for relief from statu¬
tory regulation of charges were overtaken by the outbreak of war in 1939 when the
railways again passed under the control of a Government Railway Executive Com¬
mittee. After the war came the Transport Act of 1947, bringing the railways under
public ownership and causing them to be operated as a single enterprise known as
British Railways with six regional sub-divisions—London-Midland, Western,
Eastern, Southern, North Eastern, and Scottish. At first they were operated by a
Railway Executive, on behalf of the British Transport Commission, but by the
Transport Act of 1953 the Executive was abolished and a new organization was
set up (see p. 239).

At the end of i95^> there were 363 railway refreshment rooms, of which 70 were
operated by tenants and 293 by British Transport Hotels and Catering Services,
which also operated 36 hotels. Two hotels were operated by tenants. Hotels and
catering services staff numbered 15,305.
Development of British Railways
During the first eight years of the British Transport Commission’s life to the
end of 195b, capital expenditure on British Railways amounted to about £360
million, oome of this was accounted for by maintenance, including arrears of
maintenance inherited from the war period, and renewal of rolling stock. Several
new lines of development have been completed in recent years, including the
electrification of the lines between Wath, Sheffield and Manchester, from London
to Chelmsford and from London to Southend, a diesel service between Edinburgh
and Glasgow and the introduction of diesel rail cars in various parts of the country.
Existing development projects have now been incorporated in a £1,200 million
modernization and re-equipment programme announced by the Commission in
January i955> which is based on the premise that work on its main components
will be capable of being started during the first five years and completed within
fifteen. The Commission expects that the result will ultimately be to improve the
financial position of the railways by at least £85 million a year. The programme is
to be financed partly from internal sources and partly by the issue of Transport
Stock for which a Treasury guarantee will be available.
Major features of the programme are the remodelling of freight services and the
progressive displacement of steam by diesel and electric traction. As regards
freight services, operations are to be completely reorientated so as to speed up
movement, reduce costs, provide direct transit for main streams of traffic and to
attract to the railways a due proportion of the full-load merchandise traffic which
would otherwise pass by road. Larger wagons are to be introduced, continuous
brakes are to be fitted to all wagons, and marshalling yards, goods stations and
handling facilities are to be improved. As regards traction, electricity is regarded
as the ideal alternative to steam, especially where traffic is dense, but the substan¬
tial engineering work involved in converting a length of line to electric traction
imposes a limit on the amount of main-line electrification that can be completed
during the 15-year period. Thus, it has been decided to electrify, during this
period, two major trunk-routes—from London (King’s Cross) to Leeds, and from
London (Euston) to Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester; to extend the existing
electrification from London (Liverpool Street) to Chelmsford as far as Ipswich,
including some branch lines; and to complete the electrification of the main routes
of the Southern Region east of a line from Portsmouth to Reading. On the rest of
the main-line services it is proposed to introduce diesel traction as quickly as
possible. The programme also provides for track improvements, signalling improve¬
ments including an extension of automatic train control, and the introduction of
multiple-unit diesel trains in many areas.
Development projects that veere in progress in 1956 or were due to be under¬
taken during 1957 included: the electrification of the line from London to Bishop’s
Stortford and of the line from Manchester to Crewe (due to be completed in 1959,
this is a ‘ pilot scheme ’ for the electrification from London to Birmingham, Liver¬
pool and Manchester); the extension of various Southern Region electrified ser¬
vices; the introduction of diesel services from Birmingham to Swansea and from
London to Hastings; the improvement of passenger stations at Manchester,
Glasgow, Plymouth, and Cannon Street (London); and the construction of five
new marshalling yards at Stratford and Barking (both in the London suburbs),
244
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Edinburgh, and Margam (in connection with the South Wales steel traffic) which
together will cost nearly £10 million.
By 1957, over one-third of the total sum of £1,200 million, to be spent under
the fifteen-year programme, was committed to developments, either in progress or
authorized. Large individual programmes of expenditure that had been authorized
included £92 million for electrification, £33 5 million for diesel main line and
shunting locomotives, £32-5 million for diesel multiple-unit trains and £46
million for major works such as track widening, new junctions, and station and
depot reconstruction schemes. The following items are some of the main features
of the railway modernization programme for 1957 and 1958- Over 200,000 freight
vehicles will be provided with continuous braking, thus enabling freight train speeds
to be greatly increased. More than 100,000 new freight and service vehicles and
over 13,000 road-rail containers will be delivered. Deliveries of locomotives in
19157—58 are expected to include 20 electric main line locomotives, over 160 diesel
main line locomotives, and more than 500 diesel shunters. In addition, about i,700
powered coaches for multiple-unit electric and diesel trains are expected to be
delivered. Five diesel-electric de luxe trains will come into operation in 1958 on
routes from London to Manchester, to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and to
Bristol. New lines, primarily for freight traffic, will be built at Stratford-upon-
Avon, at Edinburgh, in Yorkshire and in South Wales.
ROADS
The road system in Britain is complex and to a large extent haphazard. For cen¬
turies after the Romans left Britain, road building and maintenance were left
mainly to the parish, which was naturally concerned only with local needs. The
most effective intervention by the central Government was in the seventeenth
century with the institution of turnpike trusts. The maintenance of a length of
road was placed in the hands of a trust, made up of private individuals, empowered
to levy tolls at the gates it erected at the limits of its jurisdiction. Early in the
nineteenth century there were 1,000 of these trusts administering some 22,000
miles of road. The same period was also notable for improvements in construction
associated with the names of Telford, who emphasized the importance of solid
foundations, and McAdam, who demonstrated the value of an arched surface of
broken stone or flint. Turnpike roads made it possible for coaches to reach an
average speed of 12 miles an hour. But transport by river and canal retained the
advantage in handling bulky traffic and, as the nineteenth century progressed, the
railways almost drove long-distance road transport out of existence. Roads held
their own in towns where, first, horse-drawn omnibus services and then horse tram¬
ways were developed; the first of these were introduced into London and Birken¬
head in the early 1860 s. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the tramways
were electrified and largely taken over by local authorities. London’s trams have
now been replaced by buses, as have those of most other cities and towns.
While tramways were still being developed, there came the internal combustion
engine and the rapid increase in the number of motor cars. In 1909, the Govern¬
ment set up a Road Board to assist in providing new and better roads to meet the
needs of the new traffic. In 1919, the Board’s responsibilities were taken over by
the newly created Ministry of Transport.
In 1956, Great Britain had 189,037 miles of public highway, over two miles for
every square mile of territory. There were 8,270 miles of trunk roads, 19,670 miles
of Class I roads, 17,646 miles of Class II roads, 48,818 miles of Class III roads, and
94»633 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to their traffic
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
245
value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining unclassified. On maps and
signposts the trunk and Class I roads can mostly be identified by the letter ‘A’ in
front of a route number, and Class II roads by the letter ‘B’. Trunk roads are the
main arteries of national traffic and the whole cost of their upkeep is met from
Exchequer funds derived from annual grants voted by Parliament. The Minister
of Transport and Civil Aviation is the highway authority for trunk roads in England
and Wales and administers approved expenditure on these roads. For Class I, II
and III roads the Minister makes grants towards approved expenditure at the rates
of 751 60 and 50 per cent respectively. The highway authorities for these and for
unclassified roads are the local authorities—in most cases the councils of counties
and county boroughs. In Scotland, the Secretary of State has the same responsibi¬
lities for roads as the Minister has in England and Wales.
Development
Economic difficulties since the war have restricted expenditure on major im¬
provements and new construction, and the bulk of expenditure on roads—>C110
million in the year ended 3Ist March, 1956—has been devoted to maintenance and
repair, although since IQ53 there has been increasing emphasis on new works. In
February 1955) the Government announced the first instalment of an expanded
programme of road construction and improvement. It is intended that in the four
financial years I955-59 road development works in Great Britain should be
authorized, involving an ultimate expenditure of £147 million by the Government
and of £20—£30 million complementary expenditure by local highway authorities.
The programme includes certain major projects of great national importance. In
July i957> the Government announced a new expanded programme of road works
that will ultimately cost £240 million for the four years 1958-62 (thus overlapping
one year of the existing programme). The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation
has explained the plan of campaign for the road programme. First, to construct
as quickly as possible the first stage of a national network of modern trunk routes;
these will be through routes, in many cases confined to motor traffic only. Secondly,
to clear away the worst bottle-necks in urban areas and thus to give free outlets
from the big cities and from other main sources of traffic to the trunk routes.
Thirdly, to press forward with the maximum amount of smaller road works all
over the country. The Minister has also announced his intention to give priority
as the programme develops to five new major road projects: a trunk road from
London to Newcastle, based on the Great North Road; a new motor road from
London to Birmingham and Lancashire; two new trunk roads from London to
the south-east by-passing the Medway towns, and Maidstone and Ashford; a
new road from the industrial Midlands to the South Wales ports; and a road from
London westwards to London Airport, the West of England and South Wales. In
March 1957, work began on a tunnel under the River Thames from Dartford
to Purfieet to provide a new road link between Kent and Essex; it is expected
that it will be completed by 1962. In Scotland, it is intended that construction
of a new road bridge across the Firth of Forth should begin in the summer of 1958.
ROAD TRANSPORT
Between 1830 and the 1914-18 war, the railways were unchallenged as the chief
means of transport in the country; the war, however, greatly stimulated the develop¬
ment and use of motor transport. In the period immediately following the first world
war, the growth of public road transport began to make itself felt as a serious com¬
petitor of the railways and there was keen competition within the road transport
industry itself. In 1928 a Royal Commission on Transport was appointed to
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
246
consider the issues involved, and following its recommendations legislation was intro¬
duced. The Road Traffic Act, 1930, provided either directly or by regulations for
(i) a reclassification of motor vehicles and the re-enactment of the licensing system
for drivers; (ii) the prescription of speed limits and a variety of ‘ safety ’ measures,
including a restriction on the hours during which drivers of public service and
goods vehicles could remain continuously on duty; (iii) safety requirements govern¬
ing the construction and use of motor vehicles; (iv) compulsory insurance against
third party risks; and (v) the introduction of a comprehensive licensing and
inspection system for public service (passenger) vehicles, under which bodies of
Traffic Commissioners were created with the duty, within defined traffic areas, of
licensing vehicles, drivers and conductors, and services operated. The Traffic
Commissioners consist of a full-time chairman appointed by the Minister and two
part-time members chosen by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by
local authorities. Applications for licences for road services are considered at public
sittings at which competing operators or local authorities can exercise a right of
objection; the Traffic Commissioners have power to suspend or revoke a licence
in certain circumstances. Although the Minister can issue general directions to
Traffic Commissioners, he has no power to intervene in their decisions, unless an
applicant or an objector, being aggrieved at a decision, appeals to him. The effect
of this system has been to ensure for road passenger transport the regularity and
reliability which has been a feature of the railway services.
In 1933, the Road and Rail Traffic Act was passed; it was based on the recom¬
mendations of the Royal Commission and on those contained in a report of a
conference of experts, known as the Salter Report. A system of licensing for road
haulage vehicles was introduced and three types of carriers’ licences were instituted;
the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage; the ‘ B ’ licence for public haulage limited
to certain goods or certain areas and covering also the carriage of the licensee s own
goods; and the ‘ C ’ licence for the carriage by traders of their own goods alone.
The licensing authorities for goods vehicles are the chairmen of the licensing
authorities for public service vehicles in each traffic area, and applications for A
and ‘B’ licences are considered at public inquiries as in the case of road service
licences under the Road Traffic Act, 1930; ‘C’ licences are granted on application
without public inquiry. A licence can be suspended or revoked by a licensing
authority for breaches of licence conditions committed frequently, wilfully or to
the public danger. There is a right of appeal against a decision of a licensing authority
to an independent tribunal, the Transport Tribunal (see p. 240). d he effect of this
system has been to relate the operations of vehicles under ‘A’ and ‘ B’ licences to
approved needs and to eliminate wasteful competition between the different forms
of transport.
The Transport Act, 1947, as already noted, established the British Transport
Commission, which took over ‘A’ and ‘ B ’ hauliers predominantly engaged on long¬
distance haulage. Vehicles operating under ‘ C ’ licences and those used for carrying
certain specialized traffics were not affected by the Act; A and B licensed vehicles
which were not acquired by the Commission could be used only on journeys of
over 25 miles from base under permits granted by the Commission. By the end of
1951, when the acquisition of vehicles by the Commission was completed, 3>2^^
undertakings with 41,265 vehicles and 3>01^ trailers had been acquired. Carriers
licences were not required for vehicles operated by the various undertakings of the
Commission.
The Transport Act, 1953, required the British Transport Commission to dispose
of the bulk of its road haulage undertaking, and all vehicles operated by the Com¬
mission were made subject to the carriers’ licence system.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
247
The Commission was to be allowed to retain a proportion of its road haulage
fleet corresponding broadly to the interest the railways had in road haulage when
they were taken over on 1st January, 1948.
A Road Haulage Disposal Board was set up to supervise the disposal of the
Commission’s vehicles. Purchasers of the vehicles were entitled to operate them
at once without restriction as to distance, and the 25 mile radius limit was removed
from all operators on 1st January, 1955. The Act also established an annual trans¬
port levy on all goods vehicles of more than 1J tons unladen weight and on all
goods tractors, out of which the Commission was to be compensated for the capital
loss suffered; this levy was terminated at the end of 1956 after having produced
about £i2j million. The Road Haulage Disposal Board’s sales of the smaller lots
of vehicles proceeded well, but there was little response to the offers of the larger
units of the trunk services. The Government therefore decided that if the vital
trunk services were to be preserved there was no alternative to leaving them in the
hands of British Road Services. The Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage Pro¬
perty) Act, 1956, was accordingly passed to enable the Commission to make over
to companies under their control more vehicles than permitted under the 1953
Act. In all, 19,000 vehicles were sold during the course of disposals. As from 9th
September, 1956, British Road Services have been conducting their business
through the medium of five companies: British Road Services, Ltd. (general
haulage, 7>7S° vehicles); BRS (Pickfords) Ltd. (special traffic and some contracts,
I>35° vehicles); BRS (Contracts) Ltd. (1,000 vehicles); BRS (Parcels) Ltd.
(4,4o° vehicles); and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. (500 vehicles). The shares of all
these companies are owned by the British Transport Commission; those of BRS
(Parcels) Ltd. and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. are still subject to disposal at some
later date.
At the end of 1956, 1,180,396 goods vehicles were authorized under carriers’
licences, including 87,995 under ‘A’ (public carriers’) or contract ‘A’ licences;
68,906 under ‘B’ (limited carriers’) licences; 998,219 under ‘C’ (private carriers’)
licences; and 25,276 under special ‘A’ licences issued to purchasers of vehicles
formerly operated by the British Transport Commission as part of the nationalized
road haulage undertaking.
Road Safety Measures
In 1956, there were six and three-quarter million motor vehicles licensed to use
Great Britain’s roads, of which over three and three-quarter million were motor
cars and over a million and a quarter were motor cycles. Traffic density, is therefore,
high, presenting serious problems of control and safety. In 1956, 5,367 people were
killed on the roads and 262,593 injured. Under the Road Traffic Acts of 1930 (see
p. 246) and 1934, the Government introduced a variety of measures designed to
improve road safety, such as imposing a speed-limit in built-up areas, requiring all
new drivers to pass a driving test, and laying down penalties for dangerous
driving. A number of new traffic laws were introduced under the Road Traffic Act,
1956, but they were not all put into force immediately. This Act includes provisions
making compulsory the annual testing of all vehicles which are ten years old, or
more; enabling local authorities to designate parking places on the roads at which
charges can be made by means of parking meters; extending to cyclists penalties
for dangerous driving; and placing pedestrians under a legal obligation to obey
the directions of police on traffic duty. Vigorous road safety campaigns are con¬
ducted by local authorities with the aid of Government grants. The Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents, the police and education authorities are all actively
at work to the same end. There is a system of pedestrian crossings including some
R
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
248
marked with conspicuous white stripes—hence the name ‘zebra crossings’—and
illuminated by flashing beacons. The standard of conduct for all road users—
pedestrians and drivers—is set out in The Highway Code, the third edition of which
was published in May 1957. A failure to observe the provisions of this code does
not of itself render a person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind but it may
be taken into account in any such proceedings. Drivers of motor vehicles—includ¬
ing motor cycles, motor scooters and powered pedal cycles—all have to pass a
driving test before being granted a substantive licence to drive; until they pass the
test they may obtain a ‘ provisional ’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘ L’
(Learner) plates and, in all cases of vehicles constructed to carry passengers, they
must be accompanied by a qualified driver. Under a new law that came into opera¬
tion on 1st October, 1956, as part of the Road Traffic Act, 1956, drivers who have
not renewed their licences for ten years or more must pass the driving test before
they can obtain a new substantive licence.
INLAND WATERWAYS
In 1761, James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from the
collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester. This
marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain which played an import¬
ant part in promoting the industrial and commercial expansion of the late eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries. Most of the present network—except, notably, the
Manchester Ship Canal which was built between 1888 and 1894—was completed
by 1840 when the development of railways brought to an end the golden age of
canals. As railway competition developed, many canal companies were reduced to
a precarious position, and, often at the instance of the companies, about one-third
of the canal mileage passed to the control of the railways. During the first world
war, Government control of railways included railway-owned canals. In 1917, the
main canals not owned by the railway companies were placed under the control of
a Canal Control Committee of the Board of Trade, being returned to their owners
at the end of the war. Government control was again the rule in the second world
war and, in 1948, the canals passed direct from Government control to the British
Transport Commission.
The System
There are some 2,400 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain, of
which some 600 miles are now used only a little or not at all by commercial traffic.
Some 1,000 miles are narrow waterways which can generally be used only by boats
not exceeding 7 feet in width with a load varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder
are broad waterways which can be used by craft with from 50 to 400 tons capacity.
Broad waterways are mainly the canalized rivers—e.g., the Severn, Lee and Stort
Navigation, Trent Navigation, Weaver Navigation, and Aire and Calder Naviga¬
tion canals; while narrow waterways are mainly the canals in the interior, e.g., the
Grand Union, the Shropshire Union, and the Birmingham network. The canals in
Scotland are broad.
The British Transport Commission is responsible for 2,164 miles, of which 1,430
miles are in commercial use. The canals in England and Wales under the control
of the Commission are grouped into four divisions based on the main navigable
river estuaries:
1. The North-Eastern Division is based on the Ouse and Humber rivers and
the ports of Hull, Grimsby, Goole and Immingham.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
249
2. The North-Western Division is based on the Mersey estuary and its water¬
ways are connected with Liverpool and Birkenhead, Ellesmere Port, Weston
Point Docks and Manchester, and with Hull via Leeds.
3. The South-Western Division is based on the Severn estuary and its water¬
ways are related to the ports of Avonmouth, Gloucester, Sharpness, Barry,
Lydney, Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
4. The South-Eastern Division is based on the Thames estuary and its water¬
ways give access to the Port of London and to the Midlands.
Canals in Scotland, which are separately administered by the British Transport
Commission, are the Caledonian Canal, the Crinan Canal, the Forth and Clyde
Canal, the Monkland Canal and the Union Canal.
Most of the traffic on the waterways is carried by independent carriers or by
traders in their own craft. The British Transport Commission, however, at the end
of 1956 owned 23 tugs and 1,141 carrying craft with a carrying capacity of 41,140
tons, including 219 power-driven craft with a carrying capacity of 8,391 tons.
Survey of Waterways
Since assuming control, the British Transport Commission has taken steps to
strengthen the commercial organization so as to secure increased traffic, improved
dredging methods and equipment; it has brought better types of craft into service,
established a research organization and undertaken various development works
including the elimination of dangerous bends and the opening up of bottle-necks.
It has spent over £2 million on arrears of maintenance and on new plant and equip¬
ment. In 1956, total traffic amounted to 10 *4 million tons, of which 5 million tons
were coal, 2,i million tons liquids in bulk, and 3-3 million tons general cargo.
Nearly all this traffic is carried on 1,200 miles of waterway, and 85 per cent of it
on only 325 miles, indicating a serious problem of moribund canals.
In April 1954, the Commission appointed a Board of Survey to examine its
inland waterways, to report on whether they were being used to the best possible
advantage and to suggest what should be done with those which could no longer
be put to economic commercial use. The Board of Survey reported in 1955. It
recommended, inter alia, that a separate organization, British Transport Water¬
ways, should be set up for the waterways (this has been done, see p. 239); that
certain waterways of a total mileage of 771, which had insufficient commercial
prospects to justify their retention for navigation, should be transferred to other
authorities such as River Boards; and that responsibility for the canals in Scotland,
which were running at a loss, should be transferred to the Secretary of State for
Scotland.
In I955) the Commission authorized the expenditure of £500,000 as a first
instalment of schemes to develop to the full those waterways which are of real
value to the national transport system. In January 1956, a programme of further
development works costing £5!- million was announced and, in February 1956, the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation instituted a further and wider inquiry
into the economics of the whole system.
LONDON TRANSPORT
London’s transport system, in its modern sense, may be said to have begun when
in 1829, four years after the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the
first omnibus—horse-drawn—appeared on the London streets. Trams, also horse-
drawn, appeared in 1861. In 1863 the first underground steam railway, the Metro¬
politan, was built by digging a great trench for the line and roofing it over. In 1870
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
2SO
a better method for building a railway inside a city was found when the Tower
Subway was constructed. The line was laid in an entirely underground tunnel
shaped like a tube and this became the world’s first tube railway. In 1890 the City
and South London, the first electric tube railway in the world, was opened, and it
was followed in 1900 by the Central London Railway, called the ‘twopenny tube’
because for a time all journeys on it cost twopence. Soon after this, buses and trams
ceased to be horse-drawn and used petrol and electricity respectively for their
motive power, and trams, buses and underground railways rapidly developed into
the vast network of London’s transport system.
Until 1933 there was no unified operation. The large number of transport
interests included: the main line railways with their suburban services; an Under¬
ground Group controlling most of the underground railways which was associated
with the London General Omnibus Company’s buses, Green Line Coaches and
three tramway companies; the independent Metropolitan Railway Company;
London County Council tramways; 13 municipal tramway undertakings; and some
60 small independent bus undertakings. But in 1933, the whole system, except the
main line railways’ suburban services, was vested in a public corporation, the
London Passenger Transport Board. During the second world war, London Trans¬
port was taken over by the Government and operated, like the main line railways,
through the Railway Executive Committee. In 1948, on the establishment of the
British Transport Commission (see p. 238), the London Transport Executive took
over control.
The London Transport Executive is responsible for the operation of passenger
road and rail services in the London area, with the exception of the main line rail¬
ways, suburban services of British Railways, and taxicabs, which are all privately
operated by companies or owner-drivers.1
The Executive consists of a chairman and from four to eight members; in 1957
there were four full-time and three part-time members. The chairman and full¬
time members each have special functional responsibilities apart from their general
responsibility for running the London Transport system.
The operation of London’s transport is a vast undertaking. It serves an area of
2,000 square miles, extending for an average distance of 25 miles from Charing
Cross in the centre of London. It covers, in whole or in part, 10 counties, and in¬
cludes the cities of London and Westminster, 27 other metropolitan boroughs, 2
county boroughs, 48 municipal boroughs, 59 urban and 29 rural districts. The
total population of the area approaches 10 million.
From north to south the railway network stretches 18 miles, from east to west
32 miles and from north-west to east 49 miles. The total length of the railway over
which London Transport trains operate is 253 miles, of which a third is under¬
ground, including the longest tube tunnel in the world, i7i miles. London Trans¬
port trains serve 277 stations.
Diesel buses and coaches travel over roads which have a total length of 2,977
miles, and trolleybuses (which use electricity) over 253 miles of road.
To carry traffic over all this area, the London Transport Executive in December
1956 owned 4,026 railway cars, 7>793 buses and coaches, and 1,614 trolleybuses.
The total staff employed at the end of 1956 was 87,237, of whom 12,017 were
women. The total number of passenger journeys in 1956 was 3>9I3 million, or
about 75 million every week.
1 During 1956 in the Metropolitan Police District, which covers the counties of London
and Middlesex and parts of Essex, Kent, Surrey and Hertfordshire, annual licences were
issued for 5,898 taxicabs; licensed taxicab drivers at the end of 1956 numbered 9,051.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 251
The challenge to the efficiency of London Transport presented by this vast
traffic is being met by a continuous process of development. Thus, since the end
of the war, all remaining trams have been replaced by buses, extensions to the
Underground railway have been built and more efficient light alloy trains have
been introduced. Current development plans include a new tube railway from the
north-east to the west-end of London, and replacement of the remaining trolley¬
buses by diesel buses.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
With the exception of passenger transport in the city of Belfast, which is pro¬
vided by the Corporation, public road transport, road and rail services within
Northern Ireland are mainly provided by the Ulster Transport Authority, a public
body which was established under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1948.
This body provides a country-wide omnibus service and also offers a compre¬
hensive road freight service, both for the carriage of sundries and for the use of
firms not wishing to use their own vehicles.
There are 433 miles of railroad open for traffic. Of these, 266 miles are operated
by the Great Northern Railway Board, which is a joint undertaking of the Govern¬
ment of Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland. The
Northern Ireland members of the Board are drawn from the Ulster Transport
Authority which is responsible for the remaining 167 miles of railway.
The Great Northern Railway is operated as a single unit and statistics for the
Northern Ireland part are not separately available. The scope of the Ulster Trans¬
port Authority’s operations is indicated by the following figures for the year ended
30th September, 1956:

Roads
There are 13,657 miles of public roads in Northern Ireland, comprising 348
miles of trunk roads, 960 miles of Class I roads, 1,747 miles of Class II roads, 2,760
miles of Class III roads, and 7,842 miles of unclassified roads. The Ministry of
Commerce is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of the trunk roads
and makes grants from the Road Fund (which is derived from such sources as the
proceeds of taxation of mechanically propelled vehicles registered in Northern
Ireland and from driving licence fees) to help the local authorities who are respon¬
sible for the other roads. During the four years ended 31st March, 1956, a total of
£i7'i million was spent on work on all types of roads in Northern Ireland.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
CIVIL AVIATION
Responsibility for the general development and supervision of United Kingdom
civil aviation rests with the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.1
Scheduled public air transport services are reserved to the two public corpora¬
tions—British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Air¬
ways (BEA)—and their associates. Scheduled services are those operated regularly
or systematically between two places, one of which is in the United Kingdom, for
the transport of passengers, mail or cargo for remuneration, in such a manner that
each flight is open to use by members of the public.
Non-scheduled or charter flights are operated in the main by independent air
transport companies, although the Corporations undertake such flights as oppor¬
tunity offers with aircraft not required for their scheduled services at any particular
time. Some of these independent firms have large fleets of aircraft and many of
them operate scheduled services as associates of one or other of the Corporations.
Early Development
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the Coronation
of H.M. King George V in 1911) and the first to operate regular mail and passenger
services. The actual inauguration of British civil air transport came on 25th August,
1919, when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow) and
Paris (Le Bourget) by a company called Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited.
The year 1919 was also marked by notable pioneer flights including the crossing of
the Atlantic by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June (both were later
knighted for their achievement) and the first flight between England and Australia
by Captain (later Sir) Ross Smith and his crew in November and December.
In 1923, a Civil Air Transport Subsidies Committee recommended the merger of
the four existing small British companies into one organization capable of develop¬
ing overseas routes. In April 1924, the merger took place and there came into being
Imperial Airways Limited, which received a Government grant of £1 million
spread over the next ten years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was
represented on the Board of Directors.
Imperial Airways Limited proceeded to pioneer the commercial development of
intercontinental air-routes, following up, in most cases, the exploratory work of the
Royal Air Force. Pioneering involved organizing ground services upon which
civil aviation could rely. The route to the Far East came first. In 1927) 3 link was
established between Cairo and Basra and by 1929 there was a through service from
England to India. In 1931, the first service was established to Central Africa. The
first mail service between London and Australia was begun in December i934>
followed by a passenger service in 1935-
In 1937, crossings of the Atlantic were made simultaneously by Imperial Airways
with the modified ‘Empire’ class flying-boat and by Pan American Airways. In
1939, a transatlantic service was operated by both companies. The British Overseas
Airways Corporation was established by the British Overseas Airways Act, i939>
and took over the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways
Limited in 1940.
During the second world war the British Overseas Airways Corporation operated
essential overseas air services in support of the war effort. By the end of the war it
1 Up to 1945, civil aviation was administered by the Department of Civil Aviation
Air Ministry. Between 1945 and 1953 the Ministry of Civil Aviation was the responsible
Government Department and, in October 1953) the Ministries of Civil Aviation and 0
Transport were amalgamated. In the rest of this section, reference will usually be made
only to ‘the Minister’ or ‘the Ministry’.

was carrying more than twice as many passengers as in 1939 and more than three
times as much freight. The routes, moreover, had efficient radio and radar systems
which had been installed for war purposes and which were adapted for civilian use.
There were also about 700 aerodromes in the United Kingdom, although most of
them, having been constructed for war purposes away from large towns, were
unsuitably placed for civil use.
The one serious obstacle to a continued expansion of British civil air transport
after the war was the absence of any new British civil aircraft to take the place of
the pre-war types. The British aircraft industry throughout the war had concen¬
trated entirely on the production of fighters and bombers for the Allied Forces,
leaving the production of all transport aircraft to the Americans. Since the evolu¬
tion of a new airliner takes from five to ten years, there was an awkward gap in the
natural development of British civil air services which could be filled only by the
use of uneconomical converted military types, or the purchase of foreign aircraft.
Both these expedients were adopted, together with the use of the highly successful
interim short-range Viking aircraft, while the British aircraft industry concentrated
on the development of the turbo-jet and turbo-prop airliners, e.g., Comets,
Viscounts and Britannias.
The Corporations
As already noted, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was set up
in 1939. The Civil Aviation Act, 1946, set up two additional public corporations;
British European Airways (BEA) to cover the United Kingdom and Europe, and
British South American Airways (BSAA) to operate to South America and the
Caribbean, leaving the North Atlantic and Eastern Hemisphere routes to BOAC.
In 1949, BSAA was merged into BOAC by the Airways Corporations Act of that
year. I he statutory provisions (now laid down by the Air Corporations Acts, 1949
to 1956) relating to the powers and constitution of BEA and BOAC are as follows:
Operations. Scheduled services are reserved to the two Corporations, working
alone or through associates. They can also engage in charter work. They may not
manufacture airframes, aero-engines or propellers.
Constitution. Each Corporation consists of a chairman, deputy chairman, and not
fewer than five or more than eleven directors. Appointments are made by the
Minister who, in the case of BOAC, may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy
chairmen.
Finance. Each Corporation may, with Treasury consent, borrow either by raising
temporary loans or by issuing stock. The Treasury may guarantee redemption or
repayment of, and payment of interest on, any stock issued and temporary loans
raised. By section 42 of the Finance Act, 1956, the Corporations may also, until
31st March, 1958, raise money by means of interest-bearing redeemable loans from
the Exchequer. Under the Air Corporations Act, 1956, the borrowing powers of
BOx\C and BEA are limited to £160 million and £60 million respectively. This
Act also provides that BOAC may, with the consent of the Treasury, borrow from
the International Bank or the Export-Import Bank of Washington in order to buy
aircraft manufactured in the United States of America and spare parts and equip¬
ment for such aircraft. Provision was made in earlier Acts for Exchequer grants up
to a limit of £8 million a year (for both Corporations together) until April 1956, so
as to enable the Corporations to build up their organization and services over a
period of years. (For 1946-47 and 1947-48 the maximum was £10 million.) BOAC
has operated without Exchequer grant since 1952-53 and BEA since 1955-56.
The Corporations are not exempt from liability for any taxes or rates.

Accounts. Statements of accounts in a form approved by the Minister and the
Treasury have to be prepared by the Corporations for each financial year. The
accounts are audited by auditors appointed annually by the Minister.
Annual Reports. Each Corporation must also make an annual report to the
Minister, and the Minister must lay a copy of this report and of the accounts before
both Houses of Parliament. In addition, each Corporation must submit before the
beginning of every planning period (each three-year period, beginning ist April,
1947) a programme of the services it proposes to provide and of any other activities
it proposes to engage in, as well as an estimate of its receipts and expenditure on
revenue and capital account during the period.
Labour Relations. Each Corporation must, unless it is satisfied that adequate
machinery already exists, consult with any organization which it considers appro¬
priate with a view to establishing machinery for settling terms and conditions of
employment and for discussing matters affecting the safety, health and welfare of
its employees and other matters of interest to both parties, including efficiency in
operating the Corporation’s services. In 1946, the National Joint Council for Civil
Air Transport was set up as the body through which terms and conditions of service
between the Corporations and the 18 Trade Unions representing the employees
are negotiated. A number of the independent air transport companies have since
become members of the Council.
Ministerial Control. The Corporations conduct their own affairs as commercial
businesses. The Minister can give general directions on matters affecting the
national interest but in practice this power is rarely, if ever, used, since it has been
found much more suitable to proceed by means of close consultation and discussion
with the Corporations. In fact, the Minister has maintained closer control over them
than has been the case for the other nationalized industries. During the Exchequer
grant period (1946-56) the Minister had to decide in consultation with the Treasury
what grants, within the ceiling of £8 million, should be given to each Corporation
in any particular year. This necessitated a close examination of the Corporations
programmes of air services and financial estimates. The Minister also keeps in close
touch with the Corporations regarding plans for new aircraft and new routes since
he has to negotiate the necessary rights with foreign governments. He also provides
most of the aerodromes from which the Corporations operate and the navigational
aids and communications necessary to the conduct of their flights. Contact between
the Corporations and the Ministry is, therefore, close, mainly in the form of daily
informal exchanges of information between their staffs.
Independent Companies
The Government considers that non-scheduled or charter services are mainly the
domain of the independent companies. The Corporations are not precluded from
engaging in this work but they do not maintain aircraft specially for it. The opera¬
tion of scheduled services by independent companies under associate agreements
with the Corporations was introduced in 1948. Applications to operate these services
were considered by the Air Transport Advisory Council (see p. 261), which recom¬
mended to the Minister whether or not approval should be given. In the main,
agreements were of short duration, the routes being those which the Corporations
did not, at the time, plan to operate, e.g., some internal routes, short-haul ferry
services across the English Channel and a few holiday routes to the Continent.
The opportunities for independent companies to take part in air transport
developments were increased in I952- In May of that year the Minister outline
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
255
the principles which would be followed in shaping the Government’s policy for
air transport development. These were, broadly, to combine public and private
enterprise in the best interests of British civil aviation; and to promote sound
development, reduce the cost to the taxpayer and give greater opportunities to
private enterprise without impairing the competitive strength of Britain’s inter¬
national services and without undermining the existing international networks of
BOAC and BEA.
This policy is being implemented within the existing legislation so that indepen¬
dent companies seeking to take advantage of new opportunities to operate scheduled
services continue to be appointed associates of one of the Corporations. Applications
by independent companies continue to be made to the Air Transport Advisory
Council, but are considered under new terms of reference issued to the Council in
July 1952. Under these terms of reference, the Corporations’ position is safeguarded
by reserving to them the sole right to operate first and tourist class services on their
established routes. Independent companies and the Corporations alike, however,
are eligible to apply for the right to develop new routes not so reserved and new
types of scheduled services: for example, international services which do not serve
the same traffic areas as services by BEA or independent companies already
approved; services operated solely for the carriage of freight; and ‘coach class’
services to certain Commonwealth and Colonial territories overseas, providing a
lower standard of service than the tourist class and so generating a new class of
traffic. It is expected that even lower fare air services will be developed on world
tourist air routes in which independent airlines will participate.
The Air Transport Advisory Council considers applications in the light of its
terms of reference and, after hearing evidence from interested parties, makes recom¬
mendations to the Minister. Approval of the scheduled services of independent
companies as associates of the Corporations is now normally given for seven years
with extension to ten years in special circumstances, for example, where the pur¬
chase of new aircraft is involved. In this way, it is intended to give independent
companies sufficient long-term security to justify capital outlay and expansion.
Operations
The latest available information about the services, fleets and results of the two
Corporations, and the activities of the independent companies are summarized
below.
British Overseas Airways Corporation
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operates scheduled services
to the Middle and Far East and to Australia, with terminals at Sydney, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Karachi, Bahrain, and Aden; to Africa with
terminals at Johannesburg, Nairobi, Accra/Lagos and Dar es Salaam; and to North
America and the Caribbean with terminals at New York, Chicago, San Francisco,
Montreal, Jamaica and Trinidad. There are regional services between New York
and Bermuda, Nassau and Montego Bay; the services between New York and the
last two points operate as extensions of the London-New York route. The routes to
Central and South Africa are operated in partnership with Central African Airways
and South African Airways, and the route to Sydney in partnership with Qantas
Empire Airways of Australia. Qantas carries on the service from Australia by operat¬
ing routes to North America—formerly operated by British Commonwealth Pacifi
Airlines which went out of existence on 31st March, 1954—which connect at
San Francisco with BOAC’s San Francisco to London service, and thus provide a
Commonwealth round-the-world air service. Tasman Empire Airways, jointly
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
256
owned by the Australian and New Zealand Governments, operates services between
Australia and New Zealand and from New Zealand to Fiji and other islands of the
South Pacific.
This network of services (see front end-paper map) is supplemented by the
activities of subsidiary and associated enterprises overseas in which BOAC partici¬
pates financially or with which it has technical or management agreements.
The airlines in which BOAC has a controlling financial interest include Aden
Airways Ltd.,1 operating in the southern Red Sea area; Bahamas Airways Ltd.,
providing services between the islands of the Bahamas and to Florida (USA);
British West Indian Airways Ltd., which provides services throughout the Caribbean
area and to New York; and Gulf Aviation Company Bahrain Ltd.,1 which operates in
the Persian Gulf area. Companies with which BOAC is associated either financially
or through advisory and other agreements include Middle East Airlines Company1,
which operates services from the Lebanon throughout the Middle East and to Europe;
West African Airways Corporation and East African Airways Corporation, serving
West and East Africa; Malayan Airways Ltd., which operates services in the
Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak; Hong Kong
Airways; Cyprus Airways Ltd.; Iraqi Airways; Kuwait Airways; and Arab Airways1,
which provides services for Jordan. BOAC, like BEA, is also associated with
International Aeradio Ltd. (see p. 263).
To implement its policy of extending the benefits of air travel to a wider public
by charging lower fares, BOAC has introduced tourist services on many routes and
in 1956-57 tourist passengers accounted for 57 per cent of those who travelled on
the Corporation’s services.
On all its services, BOAC carried, in 1956-57, 409,684 passengers, 7,484 tons of
freight and 4,145 tons of mail. The figures in 1947-48 were 115,675 passengers,
2,447 tons of freight and 2,088 tons of mail.
BOAC’s fleet in May 1957 consisted of: 10 Mark 102 Britannias, which came
into service on the Johannesburg route on 1st February, 1957, to Australia on
2nd March, 1957, to Tokyo on 16th July, 1957, and to Ceylon in September 1957;
19 Argonauts; 14 Constellations (five of which are awaiting disposal); 16 Strato-
cruisers; 10 DC.jCs; and 2 Yorks. In May 1957, orders had been placed for the
following British aircraft; 5 Mark 102 Britannias; 18 Mark 312 Britannias; 1 Mark II
Comet; 19 Mark IV Comets; and 12 Viscount yooDs; it had also been decided to
order 35 Vickers VC.ios. In addition, orders had been placed in the United States
of America for 15 Boeing jet aircraft.
The larger Mark 312 Britannias, the first of which was delivered in September
1957, are expected to begin service on the North Atlantic route by 1958.
The Comet I (with which the world’s first scheduled jet service was started on
2nd May, 1952) had been progressively introduced into the Corporation’s fleet until
April 1954 when, following accidents which involved the loss of two aircraft, it was
withdrawn from service pending the report of a Court of Inquiry. This report was
published in February 1955. The Court found that the cause of the accident to the
Comet wrecked off Elba in January 1954 was the structural failure of the pres¬
surized cabin brought about by fatigue. The Court thought it possible that the same
cause accounted for the loss of another Comet near Naples in April 1954. It made a
number of recommendations designed to prevent future similar accidents and these
were accepted by the Government. BOAC’s faith in the future of the Comet is

East) Ltd., a company in which the Corporation has a major interest.

demonstrated by the order it has placed with de Havillands, the manufacturers,
for the Mark IV Comets which will incorporate the improvements in structural
design that are the outcome of research and of the findings of the Court of Inquiry.
Delivery of these aircraft will begin in 1958.
In the year 1951-52, BOAC for the first time made a net profit of nearly £275,000,
after allowing for interest on capital and before crediting the Exchequer grant of
million. In 1952-53, when the profit (before providing for interest on capital)
was reduced from £1 -2 million to £104,000 mainly owing to an increase in costs,
BOAC abstained from claiming any Exchequer grant, and the deficit of £839,000
remaining after paying interest on capital was carried forward. In 1953-54 the profit
was £2 million, and after paying interest on capital, providing for future income tax
and profits tax and allowing for capital and other surpluses, there remained a
balance of £936,911 to be applied to the reduction of the accumulated deficiency.
In 1954-55, a Year made difficult by the withdrawal of the Comets from service in
April 1954. the profit fell to £1 -4 million. At the end of March 1955, the Corpora¬
tion’s accumulated deficiency was £862,000, but during 1955-56 BOAC wiped out
this deficiency, and showed for the first time an accumulated surplus of nearly
£18,000. In 1956-57, the profit was £1 *8 million, and the accumulated surplus had
risen to £440,000.
Over the whole ten-year period up to the end of March 1957, the capacity on
BOAC services increased from 89-5 million to 282-1 million ton miles; operating
revenue increased from £14-6 million to £49-0 million; operating costs were
reduced from 57-7 pence per ton mile to 39-0 pence; and the break-even load factor
(the proportion of aircraft space it is necessary to sell in order to cover all costs of
operation and administration including interest on capital) fell from 115 per cent
to 64 per cent.
British European Airways
British European Airways (BEA) is the seventh largest airline in the world
judged by the annual number of passengers carried: 2,461,065 in 1956-57, when
it operated on its own behalf, in conjunction with its associated companies and sub¬
sidiaries, a network of services covering 26,169 unduplicated route miles serving
69 airports in the United Kingdom, Europe and North Africa, within a periphery
on which the farthest points to the north, south, west and east are Bergen, Benghazi,
Lisbon and Beirut. Its services within the United Kingdom include a number
which cannot be operated commercially with the equipment now available, but
which meet a vital social need. These include services to the Highlands and
Islands of Scotland, winter services to the Isle of Man and inter-Channel Islands
services. Tourist fares have been introduced on all BEA’s domestic routes and on
practically all its international routes. BEA maintains a close working relationship
with BOAC, whose aircraft of necessity fly through a number of European stopping
points on their way east and south. BEA also co-operates with other airlines in
order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. In addition to 2,461,065 passengers, BEA
carried 22,524 tons of freight and 7,541 tons of mail in the year 1956-57. The figures
in 1947-48 were 511,522 passengers, 2,610 tons of freight and 1,558 tons of mail.
A subsidiary of BEA, Gibraltar Airways Ltd., operates services between Gibraltar
and Tangier. BEA is associated financially with Aer Lingus, working primarily
between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom; Aerolinee Italiane Inter-
nazionali {Alitalia), which operates services within Europe and also to the Sudan,
East and South Africa, the Middle East and South America; Cyprus Airways Ltd.,
which operates services to Turkey, Greece, the Middle East and North Africa; and
Malta Airways Company Ltd. BEA is also associated with Societd Internationale de
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
259
Telecommunications Aeronautiques (SITA), a Belgian company which provides
communications circuits for subscribing operators; and, like BOAC, with Inter¬
national Aeradio Ltd. (see p. 263).
BEA’s fleet in May 1957 comprised 25 Viscount 701s, 12 Viscount 802s, 19
Elizabethans,1 38 Pionairs, 8 Pionair Leopard freighters, 4 Herons, and 3 Rapides.
Aircraft on order at that date consisted of 12 Viscount 802s, 14 Viscount 806s, and
20 Vanguards. In August 1957, BEA ordered six Mark IVB Comet jet airliners for
delivery in 1959-60 for longer routes.
The Viscount V.701 ‘ Discovery ’ class was brought into regular scheduled ser¬
vice on 16th April, 1953, on the routes to Istanbul and Cyprus, thus inaugurating
the world’s first commercial operations with propeller-turbine aircraft. During
I955~5^, the 28 Viscounts carried 617,432 passengers on both European and internal
services. A larger version of the Viscount, the Viscount 800, was brought into service
in February 1957 between London and Paris and, by 1st July, it had also been
introduced on the routes from London to Dublin, to Copenhagen, to Nice, and
to Amsterdam. Work is already in hand on the production of a new fleet of Van¬
guards, an airliner providing exceptionally capacious freight holds as well as
accommodation for 90 or more passengers. It is hoped that these aircraft, of which
BEA has ordered 20, will be delivered in 1959-60.
Since 1950, BEA has operated various scheduled services with helicopters, in
order to obtain experience in the civil operation of helicopters which can be used
to assist the design and production of a commercial twin-engined British helicopter,
and the development of navigational aids and ground facilities. At first, BEA
worked with the American type Sikorsky S.51, but towards the end of 1951 the
first British-built and designed helicopter suitable for scheduled flying, the Bristol
171, became available and, after working for a period with one lent by the Ministry
of Supply, BEA took delivery of two in June 1953, one of which has since been
sold. This, like the S.51, is a single-engined helicopter. A prototype twin-engined
helicopter, the Bristol 173, has been developed on which BEA have gained some
flying experience, but the commercial version needed by BEA for the operation
of passenger services is not likely to be available for airline service for some years.
At the end of 1956, BEA’s helicopter fleet consisted of one Bristol 171, one Bell
47B (used for training purposes) and three Westland Sikorsky WS.yjs.
As part of the process of obtaining experience, BEA has operated the following
scheduled passenger or freight helicopter services: in 1950-51 from Cardiff to
Liverpool; in 1951-54 from Birmingham to London; in 1954-55 from London
Airport to Eastleigh (Southampton); from July 1955 to May 1956 from London
Airport to a site adjoining the Waterloo Air Terminal; and from July to October
1956 between Nottingham and Leicester and Elmdon (Birmingham).
Over the period 1947-48 to 1956-57, BEA’s capacity increased from 22 million
to 139 million ton miles, operating revenue from £4 million to £23-9 million, total
costs were reduced from 83 -6 pence per ton mile to 41 -o pence, and the break-even
load factor on total costs fell from 115 per cent to 63-9 per cent. BEA is faced with
the problem of securing adequate revenue from short-haul routes aggravated by a
marked seasonal variation in its traffic.
In I954“5S BEA achieved its first net profit of £63,000. In 1955-56 it earned a
record net profit of £603,614, which was sufficient to wipe out its accumulated
deficit and leave a surplus of £64,528. In 1956-57, a year of political and economic
difficulties, BEA’s net profit was £216,770.
1 BEA expected to have sold all their Elizabethans by the end of 1957, as these are being
replaced by Viscounts.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Independent Companies
The scheduled services that the independent companies operate as associates of
BOAC or BEA (see p. 254) include internal services; passenger services on certain
international routes, chiefly from places outside London to Europe, the Channel
Islands and the Canary Islands; cross-channel vehicle ferry services; overseas
‘ Coach Class ’ services; inclusive holiday tours and various domestic and overseas
all-freight services. In 1956-57, 637,413 passengers were carried by the independent
companies on scheduled services, compared with 377,228 in i954~55 and 61,446 in
1950-51; in 1956-57, 96,605 passengers also travelled on inclusive tours. The total
traffic of these companies on scheduled services increased from just over 1 million
ton-miles in 1950-51 to over 20 million ton-miles in 1956-57. But by far the greater
part of the independent companies’ operations consists of air trooping and general
charter work; in 1956, these activities together accounted for 77 per cent of the total
capacity ton-miles of the independent operators. The general charter work covers a
wide range of business, including transporting the staff of public or private concerns
operating overseas; taking seamen to ships in overseas ports; taking parties to foot¬
ball matches and race meetings in the British Isles; carrying livestock, machinery
and other valuable or fragile cargo; and bringing perishable foodstuffs and flowers
from the continent of Europe to the United Kingdom market. There are also several
firms that specialize in non-transport aerial activities, notably aerial survey and
pest control.
The independent air transport operators have a total fleet strength of over 250
aircraft. The types include Yorks, Bristol Freighters, Hermes, Vikings, Dakotas,
Viscounts, Supertraders, DC.4S and Solent flying boats. A number of these com¬
panies are members of the British Independent Air Transport Association Ltd.
The larger of them have subsidiary companies abroad, and in some cases provide
the management of small foreign airlines. Much charter business is now arranged
through the Air Section of the Baltic Exchange, the London market for shipping
space (see also p. 231), where business from any part of the world is handled between
brokers representing, on the one side, the owners of aircraft available for hire and,
on the other, the prospective shippers of cargo or organizers of passenger trips.
Inquiries for the charter of aircraft were first received on the Exchange as long ago
as 1925, but it was not until 1947 that an Air Section was formed. To assist the
market, the Baltic Exchange set up an air freight advisory committee but this was
dissolved on 1st February, 1949, when the Airbrokers’ Association was formed.
Among other aims, the Association seeks to promote and establish uniformity in
transactions and usages in the airbroking trade, to establish in London a world
market for chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers, to represent the
interests of its members to Government Departments and other bodies, and to
provide commercial arbitration machinery for the assistance of its members.
A recent development has been the increasing participation of shipping finance in
independent air companies: e.g., the Clan line has acquired a 50 per cent non¬
controlling interest in the Hunting Group, Furness Withy and Blue Star Line
have both acquired a substantial interest in Airwork Ltd., the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company Ltd. (P and O) has acquired a majority share¬
holding in another independent company, Britavia, and the Bibby Line has
acquired a substantial holding in Skyways Ltd.
Powers and Duties of the Minister
The Civil Aviation Act of 1949, which superseded both the Ministry of Civil
Aviation Act, 1945, and the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, gives the Minister the duty
of ‘ organizing, carrying out and encouraging measures for the development of civil
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
26l
aviation, for the designing, development and production of civil aircraft, for the
i promotion of safety and efficiency in the use thereof, and for research into questions
| relating to air navigation \
The Minister’s duties in regard to the development of civil aviation cover his
relationship to the Corporations (as laid down in the Air Corporations Act of
I 1949) and his general responsibility for carrying out policy; participation in the
International Civil Aviation Organization; responsibility, in concert with the
Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office, for dealing with other coun¬
tries in civil aviation matters; and the work of the Air Transport Advisory Council.
This body was established by the 1946 Act primarily to bring to the Minister’s
notice important representations from the public concerning any inadequacy in
4 the services provided by the Corporations. It was also laid down that its duties
.» should include the study of any question related to the air transport services
I which the Minister may refer to it. Under this provision, the Minister has given the
Council the task of considering and making recommendations to him on applications
from independent companies to operate scheduled services as associates of one of
the Corporations. This has, in fact, provided most of the Council’s work, which
has been increased following the Government’s decisions in 1952 (see pp. 254—5).
The Act requires that the chairman of the Council must be a lawyer and, of its
two to four members, at least one must be experienced in the operation of air
transport services and one in other forms of transport. The Council makes an
annual report to the Minister who lays it before Parliament.
The supervision of design, development and production of civil aircraft has been
delegated to the Ministry of Supply, which is also responsible for the provision of
all Service aircraft and carries on an extensive programme of research and develop¬
ment to meet civil and Service needs. The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation
; is specifically debarred from ‘ producing ’ aircraft, and any dealings he may have in
aircraft, engines and equipment are subject to Treasury approval.
In exercising his responsibility for safety, the Minister regulates the operation of
aircraft and controls the licensing of flight crews. On all safety matters the Minister
|j may call upon the advice of the Air Safety Board, a standing advisory body of
■ sxperts responsible to him for keeping under continuous review the needs of safety
§ in British civil aviation and for recommending measures calculated to promote
safety, in respect of both the operation of British civil aircraft throughout the world
and the efficiency of the system of ground facilities provided for all civil aircraft
■ aperating over the United Kingdom.
On airworthiness matters the Minister is advised by the Air Registration Board,
:o which he has delegated certain functions relating to the design, construction
and maintenance of civil aircraft. The Board is a non-profit-making incorporated
! aody which was set up in February 1937 and consists of 18 members, of whom 16
epresent the interests concerned with civil aviation and two are appointed by
I :he Minister. The Board is responsible, inter alia, for the investigation of aircraft
■ °r t^ie PurPose °f making recommendations to the Minister for the issue of
■ certificates of Airworthiness. Persons engaged in the maintenance of civil aircraft
I must be the holders of appropriate licences issued by the Board, or must be mem-
s )ers of firms approved by the Board for the purpose.
The Minister is authorized (as are local authorities, subject to his approval) to
■ :stablish and maintain aerodromes for civil aviation. All civil aerodromes not under
he Minister’s direct control, which are used for commercial operations, are subject
J 0 his licensing, inspection and regulation.
The Minister is responsible for determining the conditions, e.g., use of aero-
Iromes and choice of routes, under which aircraft may fly within the United
262
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Kingdom and of those under which passengers or cargo may be carried. He is also
responsible for various other matters, including the use of signals to and from air¬
craft, the prevention of interference (e.g., from displays of lights and signs from
shops) and with the effectiveness of navigational aids. The Minister is jointly
responsible with the Minister of Health for sanitary control at his aerodromes, and
he also assists the appropriate Departments in the application of customs and
immigration regulations.
Aerodromes
There are approximately 100 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and, in
addition, about 50 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil
control include 26 directly controlled by the Ministry, three in the Channel Islands
and one in the Isle of Man administered by the local governments, and 26 aero¬
dromes licensed for public use, of which 16 are owned by municipalities. Customs j
facilities are provided at 12 of the Ministry’s aerodromes and at 12 others. The
Ministry advises the Colonial Office on civil aviation matters, and also assists
United Kingdom dependencies overseas in equipping and maintaining civil aero- j
dromes and in providing necessary technical facilities to accepted international I
standards.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in 1956-57 were:
for European services: London, Renfrew, Birmingham (Elmdon), Manchester
(Ringway);
for North Atlantic services: London, Prestwick, Manchester (Ringway);
for Middle East, Africa and Far East services: London.
Substantial increases in aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aero¬
dromes have continued from 1945 to 1956. In the latter year, all United Kingdom
aerodromes handled nearly 6 million passengers. Of this total, London Airport
dealt with 3 million. Outside the London area, Manchester (Ringway) handled the
largest number, 387,328; followed by Glasgow (Renfrew), 373>94^5 Belfast (Nutts
Corner) 270,413; Prestwick, 243,307; and Isle of Man (Ronaldsway 215,709. The
number of movements of aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations
in 1956 was 293,464 for all United Kingdom aerodromes. The Central Terminal
Area at London Airport was opened on 17th April, 1955- On that day the airport
was divided into two parts for traffic purposes, ‘London Airport North’ and
‘London Airport Central’. Broadly the long-haul services and Royal Dutch Air¬
lines (KLM) continued to be handled at the North terminal; the bulk of the Euro¬
pean short-haul services have been transferred to London Airport Central.
Gatwick Airport, 25 miles south of London, is being developed as the main
alternate to London Airport, to be used for diversions and as a base for Channel
Island services and the services of independent airlines; while Blackbushe, west of
London, will be used as the supplementary aerodrome to handle aircraft which for
any reason cannot use the main alternate. Prestwick is being developed as the second
international airport in the United Kingdom.
Air Traffic Control
The main air traffic control centres are in London for Southern England, Preston
for the North, and Prestwick for Scotland and the Atlantic, while each airport has
its own traffic control unit. An airliner flying into Britain is directed by one of the
control centres on to a specific route and height in the Control Zone. From this it
is passed to the airport control tower. It is brought to within a few miles of the
airport by the Approach Controller and then handed over to the Aerodrome Con¬
troller for landing and taxi-ing instructions.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
263
Radar plays an important part in air traffic control, monitoring the flight of
aircraft and guarding their safe separation from each other when in flight and when
landing or taking off. Even in bad weather a pilot can be brought down to within
sight of the runway by means of the radio and radar aids now in use, such as the
Ground Controlled Approach system (GCA), operated by a mobile radar unit on
the airport, which provides the control officer on the ground with a picture of the
aircraft’s position in the air, and the Instrument Landing System (ILS), which
operates an indicator in the pilot’s cockpit to guide him along the correct course
and angle of descent required for the approach. Meteorological information is
provided by the Meteorological Office of the Air Ministry (see p. 45).
Navigational Aids
Adequate radio navigational facilities are essential to enable aircraft to remain
safely within controlled airspace and to make accurate estimates of their times of
arrival.
The airways are marked by a system of medium frequency radio ranges, radio
beacons and very-high-frequency (VHP) fan markers that help the pilot to steer
his aircraft along the required route. During the next two or three years a number
of very-high-frequency (VHF) omnidirectional radio ranges will be installed at
strategic points in the country. This system may eventually replace many of the
present medium frequency ranges and beacons. In addition, the coverage provided
by the four Decca ‘chains’, now operating in Britain under the Decca Air and
Marine Navigator system, will enable any aircraft fitted with the appropriate
receivers and automatic flight-log to follow any of the air patterns at present planned.
A vital part of the technical services provided by the Ministry is a network of
radio stations giving communication between ground and air. About fifty of these
stations, at aerodromes and other places, provide rapid and efficient communi¬
cation operating in the VHF band to aircraft in flight over and near the United
Kingdom. Special stations at Birdlip (Gloucestershire) and Prestwick (Scotland),
operating in the high frequency (HF) band, maintain communication with aircraft
on the long-distance routes such as the North Atlantic and South African routes.
There is also an extensive system of point-to-point communication between aero¬
dromes and air traffic control centres in the United Kingdom, and to places abroad.
Over this system are transmitted such messages as flight plans and weather, so vital
to safety and regularity. The main United Kingdom signals centre is at Croydon
(near London), where a station, specially designed for the purpose, sends and
receives traffic over a network of teleprinter and radio circuits. Its handling capacity
is about 30,000 messages a day.
On routes outside the United Kingdom, British airline operators rely upon
ground organization provided by the countries over which they fly. In January
1947. the Airways Corporations (which at that time included BSAA) took the ini¬
tiative in forming a company, registered in the United Kingdom, called International
Aeradio Limited (IAL), for the purpose of helping countries in need of assistance in
providing radio communications, air traffic control and navigational facilities for
civil aviation. Airlines of other countries have accepted invitations to become share¬
holders, and the membership is broadly representative of international civil aviation.
IAL operates by entering into contracts with Governments to provide whatever
degree of assistance is required to enable States or Administrations to fulfil the
international obligations resting on them under the Chicago Convention on Civil
Aviation for the provision and maintenance of ground facilities for civil aviation.
I957. International Aeradio Ltd. was operating either directly, or through sub¬
sidiary or associated companies, in 26 countries. It has over 40 stations all over the
s

world as well as at Yeadon (Yorkshire), Cranfield (Bedfordshire) and London in
the United Kingdom. In all overseas areas, IAL trains locally engaged staff up to
the standards required for the services it provides; this policy has been so successful
that more than 80 per cent of overseas staff are locally recruited.
The Air-Sea Search and Rescue Service, operated by the Royal Navy and the
Royal Air Force, is available to civil air operators within the United Kingdom
area and along the overseas routes wherever there are Royal Navy and RAF
stations.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office with its staff of some 366,000 is a Government Department. It
is also the oldest of Britain’s State undertakings. In 1657, under the Protectorate
of Cromwell, an Act of Parliament was passed which declared that ‘ there shall be i
one general post-office and one officer, styled the Postmaster-General of England
and Comptroller of the Post Office ’.
The ministerial head of the Post Office is the Postmaster-General who, with the
Assistant Postmaster-General, is responsible to Parliament for his Department. I
He is subject to the overriding authority of Parliament and the Cabinet, and, on
many questions, of the Treasury. The Postmaster-General is chairman of the Post
Office Board, composed of the principal permanent officials of the Department,
which discusses and gives advice on matters of general policy, and he normally pre¬
sides over meetings of the Post Office Advisory Council, on which the principal
users of the Post Office services are represented. In addition, there are more than
130 local Post Office Advisory Committees, which represent various local interests;
the local Head Postmaster and Telephone Manager attend meetings to discuss the
local Post Office services and problems. More of these committees are being formed.
Under the Postmaster-General, the permanent head of the Post Office is the
Director General, who is supported by three Deputy Directors General and an
Engineer-in-Chief. At the next level there are eight Directors responsible respec¬
tively for Postal Services, Inland Telecommunications, Finance and Accounts,
Radio Services, Mechanization and Buildings, External Telecommunications,
Establishments and Organization, and Personnel. The Comptroller and Accountant
General, who is one of the Deputy Directors General, is responsible for the whole
of the accounting system and advises on financial matters. In addition, responsibi¬
lity for their several specialist functions rests with the Solicitor, the Public Rela¬
tions Officer, the Directors of Savings and of Contracts, and the Controllers of
Supplies and of Factories. The Post Office Headquarters is in St. Martin’s-le-Grand
in the City of London.
Six of the main divisions of work at Headquarters are carried down into the
organization of the three directorates—Scotland, Wales and the Border Counties,
and Northern Ireland, each under the control of a Director of the Post Office, and,
in England, seven regions—the North West, the North East, the Midlands, the
South West, the Home Counties, and London (which is divided into two func¬
tional regions, Postal and Telecommunications), each under the control of a
Regional Director. In the United Kingdom there are 472 head post offices and
over 24,000 subordinate post offices, and, at 31st March, 1957, some 5,900 telephone
exchanges.
The staff at headquarters and in the directorates and regions is divided into two
main groups: general civil service grades (administrative, executive and clerical)
and special grades recruited directly by the Post Office for its engineering and
operational activities.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
265
The work of the Post Office falls into two main categories: (1) direct services—
mail services, telecommunications, remittance and savings bank business; (2)
agency services—broadcasting services and business undertaken on behalf of other
Government Departments.
Mail Services
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from the
time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern airmail
transport. There was a great expansion in the postal services in the eighteenth
century with the introduction of mail-coaches in 1784. In the first half of the nine¬
teenth century the Post Office was quick to take advantage of Britain’s vigorous
period of engineering and railway development, and the first dispatch of mails by
train was made in 1830 between Liverpool and Manchester.
The heavy charges, based upon the actual distance a letter was carried, were
among the factors which inspired Rowland Hill in his great work of postal reform
that led to the establishment of a uniform postage rate. In 1840, a uniform inland
rate of postage of one penny per half-ounce payable in advance came into opera¬
tion, prepayment to be made by means of adhesive postage stamps. Since the busi¬
ness world found cheap postage a boon and since it proved ultimately a great
financial success, it was imitated by almost every country in the world.
The inauguration of the penny post (the rate remained unchanged until 1918)1
was followed by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal services, beginning in
1841 with the introduction of the registered post to ensure additional safety for
valuable mail. In 1845, Rowland Hill became the permanent head of the Post Office,
and it was during his term of office that the Post Office Savings Bank was estab¬
lished, in 1861, to meet the needs of the small investor. The money order system,
which had operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838, was supplemented in
1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed amounts. Letterboxes had been insti¬
tuted in London in 1855 to facilitate the increased postal traffic, and in 1883 the
parcel post was introduced. By the end of the nineteenth century a regular delivery
of letters was assured to every house in Britain. During the twentieth century the
volume of mail has steadily increased and, with the exception of the two war periods
when facilities had to be curtailed, the Post Office’s services have been developed
to match the needs of the traffic. In the seventeen years from 1938-39 to 1955-56
the parcel post increased from 185 million items a year to 238 million, registered
postal traffic from 62 million to 130 million and other posted correspondence from
8,240 million to 9,700 million. Every day the Post Office handles nearly 28 million
letters and parcels. Each year the Post Office deals with an ever-increasing volume
of Christmas mail; in 1956, 735 million letters and cards and about 24 million
parcels were posted in England and Wales during the three-week Christmas period.
The guiding principles of the postal services—speed, reliability and economy—
have motivated all developments in the history of the Post Office. Improvements
include the provision of motor mail van services2 linking rural districts, postal
sorting carriages on the railways, special mail trains on certain routes and the
ingenious apparatus by which bags of mail are delivered and collected by trains
running at express speed. For speedy transmission of mails within the central area
of London, the Post Office has for 29 years operated an automatically controlled
underground railway that runs for 6J miles connecting Paddington in the west with
1 The minimum postage rate for inland letters is now 3d. for one ounce.
In 1919, the Post Office inaugurated its motor transport with 48 vehicles; this fleet
now numbers 37,000, of which over 13,500 are motor postal vans.

Whitechapel in the east and serving six intermediate stations. The Post Office has
set up a Mechanization and Buildings Department at Headquarters to speed the
further mechanization of the postal services and to ensure that new buildings are
designed to accommodate mechanization plant. Particular attention is being given
to the use of electronics in handling the mails.
The Post Office Research Station has developed a partly electronic letter-sorting
machine. The prototype has been tested on actual operations and 20 units are now
being made for further field trials in busy centres. A parcel-sorting machine has
been developed, and new parcel offices being erected in London, Birmingham,
Leeds and Manchester are being designed to accommodate units. Machines are
being developed for sorting letters and packets separately, and for ‘facing’ letters in
the correct position ready for stamp-cancelling by other machines. Experiments are
being undertaken with machines for selling postal orders. The main post offices
are being equipped with machines for issuing parcel post labels printed with the
appropriate value, and the date and name of the office, thus avoiding the use of
stamps and eliminating the operation of cancelling the stamps.
Airmail Services
Railways and motor vans as means of transport for mails are supplemented by
ships and aeroplanes. The figures for the year ended March 1956 show that total
overseas civilian correspondence amounted to 420 million items and Forces’ mail
to 53 million, and that 50 per cent of these items travelled by air. First-class mail
to all European countries is sent by air or by surface transport, whichever offers
earlier delivery, without payment of any special air fee. The Post Office dispatches
about 31 tons of letter mail a week to European destinations by this ‘ all-up ’ service,
mainly in aircraft of British European Airways, whose network of services enables
many of the letters posted in London for Europe to be delivered the following day.
The air parcel service to Europe, introduced on 2nd April, 1949, is now operating to
28 destinations,1 and about 10 tons of parcel mail are dispatched weekly to Europe
by air.
First-class mail and second-class mail are dispatched by air to countries outside
Europe upon payment of special airmail rates of postage. Air parcel services are
also available to over 100 countries outside Europe. Light-weight air letters costing
6d. each are popular, and 47 million were posted in the year ended March 1956.
Telegraphs
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to me control ot the
Postmaster-General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission of inland
telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the present automatic
switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now one of the most up-to-date
systems in the world and gives direct connection between any of the 500 larger
telegraph offices. The Post Office accepted 20-5 million inland telegrams in 1955-56,
and the average time between handing in an inland telegram and its receipt at the
delivery office was 16 minutes, compared with 48 minutes in 1946. In recent years
inland telegraph traffic has decreased while the costs of running the service have
increased, resulting in a deficit which has been partly offset by increased charges.
Telex
The Telex Service provides communication between subscribers with the speed
of the telephone and the authority of the printed word. The printed copy of the
Spain and the Balearic Islands are considered as a single destination.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
267
message is produced on teleprinters at both the sending and receiving subscribers’
installations. Calls may be made between telex subscribers in the United Kingdom,
and to subscribers in certain countries overseas, including parts of the United
States of America. At the end of 1956 there were 3,000 inland subscribers and about
80,000 on the whole international network; the number of subscribers is increasing
rapidly, d he service is available day and night, and messages may be transmitted
to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is unattended, and thus are available
for attention when his office opens.
The United Kingdom is divided into 50 charging areas, each with its telex centre.
T. he call charges are based on the distance (measured in a straight line) between the
telex centres, the minimum charge being for a three-minute call. Calls are con¬
nected at telex exchanges staffed by telegraphists, but it is likely that a completely
automatic service will be achieved within the next few years, when subscribers will
be able to dial all calls within the United Kingdom, and many overseas calls, for
themselves.
Inland and overseas telegrams may be sent to the Post Office by telex; no charge
is made for the calls, and the telegrams are charged for at normal rates. Arrange¬
ments can also be made for incoming telegrams to be received by telex.
Telephones
At the end of March 1956, there were 5,944 telephone exchanges in the United
Kingdom; three-quarters of these have been converted to automatic working.
During the year i955-56, 226 new automatic exchanges were opened for service.
Some of these replaced smaller automatic exchanges of early and obsolete type
which had outgrown their capacity. At many of the automatic exchanges callers
can not only dial numbers in the same city or town but can also dial numbers in
adjacent towns up to a distance of about 15 miles. Plans are being made for dialling
over longer distances in the future, and experiments are being made with electronic
switching systems which may eventually supersede the electro-mechanical system
now in use. The total expenditure on telephone development, mainly new cables
and new exchange equipment, has increased from £50 million in 1951 to £84
million in 1955, and by the end of 1957 it is expected to reach £8g million.
During the year ended 31st March, 1956, some 427,000 new telephones were
provided for subscribers. By the end of 1956 there were over 7 million telephones,
including nearly 70,000 telephone call offices for public use.
During the year ended 31st March, 1939, the total trunk calls amounted to 112
million; in the year ended 31st March, 1956, the Post Office handled a total of 333
million; of these, 87 million were at the cheap night rate, which was instituted in
r934' To meet this increasing traffic, about 12,000 trunk circuits over 25 miles in
radial length have been provided since the end of the second world war, making a
total of over 21,000 such circuits. The number of local calls handled during the
year ended 31st March, 1956, was 3,865 million, an increase of 82 per cent com¬
pared with the year 1938—39.
About 850 exchanges now operate the automatic time service, first introduced
m 1936, by which callers in 86 cities and towns are able to obtain the correct time
automatically by dialling the three-letter code TIM or a figure code which connects
to the speaking clock at Holborn Exchange, London, or to a similar clock in Liver¬
pool. By the end of 1956, the average daily total of calls made to this service was
approximately 275,000.
The 999 emergency dialling service is available to well over 90 per cent of the
subscribers connected to automatic exchanges. Callers using this service are given
priority of answer and are connected as quickly as possible to the police, ambulance
268 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or fire brigade, and in certain coastal districts to lifeboat and coastguard stations.
A telephone weather forecast service, covering a 20-mile radius from London,
was inaugurated in March 1956, and will later be provided in other areas.
Overseas Telecommunications
All the overseas telephone services from the United Kingdom have, for a great
many years, been developed and operated by the Post Office. The overseas tele¬
graph services, on the other hand, were shared until 195° between the Post Office
and Cable and Wireless Ltd. This company, which was brought into public owner¬
ship on 1 st January, 1947, had developed a large and valuable telegraph cable net¬
work (some 150,000 nautical miles of submarine cable) of world-wide extent, and
a large number of radio circuits. It operated not only in the United Kingdom, but
in most parts of the Commonwealth as well as in some foreign countries. Between
1947 and 1951 the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New !
Zealand, South Africa, India, Ceylon and Southern Rhodesia took over the opera- 1
tion of the overseas telegraph services in their own countries; in Pakistan, the
Government took over these services on 1st July, 1957- Cable and Wireless Ltd. ,
retained its cable network and continued to operate its cable and wireless service
in some Colonial and foreign territories. With the acquisition of the Company’s
United Kingdom services, the Post Office operates all overseas telecommunications
from the United Kingdom.
The overseas telegraph, telex and telephone services are operated, under the
general title of Post Office Cable and Wireless Services, through five London stations
having international circuits.
Telegraphs. Most of the telegraph services in the European countries are worked
from the Central Telegraph Office in St. Martin’s-le-Grand, London, from
which there are direct circuits to most countries on the Continent. The extra-
European services, with some services to Europe, are operated from Electra
House, Victoria Embankment, London. In all, the Post Office transmitted 11
million telegrams to countries abroad and received a similar number for de¬
livery in Britain in the year ended 31st March, 1956.
Telex. The International Telex Exchange, in the Central Telegraph Office, St.
Martin’s-le-Grand, provides a teleprinter service to 30 countries abroad. In
November 1954, the separate international and inland services were amalga¬
mated. In 1955-56, over one million outgoing international calls were made.
Telephones. Telephone service to European countries is through the Continental
Exchange in London, from which some 580 direct telephone circuits radiate
to 18 continental countries. These circuits, over which calls can be connected
to almost every country in Europe, are also used to send and receive pictures
and to relay speech and music for broadcast transmissions. In i955~56,1,956,000
outgoing calls were made. Automatic dialling by operators to subscribers in
certain European countries has been introduced on a small scale, and will be
developed progressively. Extra-European services are connected through the
International Exchange (also in London) over radio circuits which provide ,
service with most countries outside Europe and with many of the larger liners
at sea. The number of outgoing radio calls made in i955-56 was 108,000.
On 25th September, 1956, the transatlantic telephone cable—the first long¬
distance submarine telephone system in the world—was inaugurated. The cable
provides 29 telephone circuits with the United States of America and six with
Canada. One remaining telephone circuit is used to provide six new telegraph
channels to supplement the existing telegraph cables between Britain and Canada
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
269
and thus to improve communications with Australia and New Zealand via Canada.
The system provides a secure service that is dependable day and night and quite
free from the uncertainties, distortions and fadeouts that affect the transatlantic
radio-telephone circuits. The whole project was undertaken jointly by the United
Kingdom Post Office, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, who jointly maintain it.
During the first nine months of its operation 220,000 calls were made.
In April 1957, officials of the Governments of Canada and of the United King¬
dom, representatives of Cable and Wireless Limited and the Canadian Overseas
Telecommunication Corporation discussed plans for the laying of another trans¬
atlantic telephone cable with 60 two-way circuits, which it is hoped would be
completed in 1961. A plan has also been agreed between the United Kingdom Post
Office, the Great Northern Telegraph Company and the Danish and Icelandic
Administrations for the laying of a combined telephone and telegraph cable
between Scotland and Iceland by way of the Faroe Islands. In addition to improving
telecommunications with Iceland and the Faroes, it will contain a number of tele¬
phone and telegraph connections for the use of civil aviation services, especially
for the control of the transatlantic air routes. It is expected that the cable will be
brought into operation in 1959.
The United Kingdom is a member of the International Telecommunication
Union, which has its headquarters at Geneva and is the co-ordinating body for
telecommunications throughout the world.
Ship-to-Shore Radio Communications
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post Office
has 12 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations provide for
radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges up
to 300 miles approximately. There is also a long-distance station at Burnham-on-
Sea, which communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with safety
of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or aircraft and take imme¬
diate action, by radio and by advising the appropriate shore authorities, to obtain
assistance for any vessel in distress. During the year ended 31st March, 1956, the
stations handled 247 cases of casualties to shipping and aircraft, including 129
distress calls.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange radio-
telegrams with ships, connect radiotelephone calls between telephone subscribers
ashore and suitably equipped ships, broadcast navigational warnings and weather
bulletins, and operate direction-finding services for ships. During the year ended
31st March, 1956, the stations handled 914,886 radiotelegrams and 72,697 radio¬
telephone calls; they broadcast 1,650 navigational warnings and 10,791 weather
reports; and they gave 797 radio bearings to ships.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master of a
ship may obtain advice on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury
aboard ship. In the year ended March 1956, the stations dealt with 213 medical
messages in this service.
The Post Office Counter: Agency and Direct Services
Largely as a result of the extension of social legislation and the widening scope
of the social services, the volume of work measured on a time basis at post office
counters has increased greatly compared with the total for 1938-39. In the 17 years
270
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to 1955-56 the value of transactions with the public increased from just over £1,000
million to £4,358 million.
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension and his family allow¬
ance, buy a licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set (see
p. 438), renew his car licence, buy National Insurance stamps (see p. 347), National
Savings stamps and certificates, and Premium Savings Bonds (see p. 310), and
bank his savings. In these and many similar transactions the Post Office is an agent
for other Government Departments. In 1955-56, the Post Office paid out 50 million
postal drafts in payment of benefits under the National Insurance Scheme.
Counter sales include also an increasing volume of direct Post Office business:
during the year ended 31st March, 1956, about 600 million postal orders were
issued by post offices.
For over ninety years the Post Office Savings Bank (see p. 311) has provided
facilities for small savings. About half the people in Britain have savings accounts
or other holdings with the Post Office; in 1956 there were over 22 million active
Savings Bank accounts.
VII. LABOUR
MANPOWER
The total working population1 of Great Britain at the end of 1956 was just over 24
million, some 48 per cent of the total population, and included about 73 per cent of
persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for women, 15 years to 64 years
for men). In fact, about 96 per cent of British men of working age are today in
or seeking gainful work. The remaining 4 per cent consist mainly of those con¬
tinuing their education, of the severely disabled and of some persons of private
means. The proportion of women of working age in or seeking gainful work is
much lower, about 48 per cent, as many housewives have no wish to take employ¬
ment outside the home, or if they have, are prevented by household duties from
doing so. Besides those of normal working age, there are more than a million older
men and women still at work. The great majority of the working population work
for a wage or salary, but between 1J and 1 f million are employers or self-employed.
The make-up of the working population has been affected during the century by
decreases in both birth and death rates, the result of which has been that the pro¬
portion of both the total population and the working population over the age of
35 has increased considerably. Changes in social habits have also had their effect.
The minimum working age has been raised to 15 years. The proportion of those
over the normal working age who are occupied has declined (though the great
increase in the number of older persons has meant that the actual number who are
working has increased). The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has
remained high and fairly uniform. Among women, on the other hand, there has
been a steady increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age
groups 15 to 59, but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age
and by a decrease in the proportion of women employed above the age of 59. There
has been a considerable increase in the employment of married women during this
century, most noticeably in the last twenty years.
The proportion of women at work is generally higher for single than for married
women of the same age and for younger as compared with older women of the same
marital status. Thus in 1951 only 16 per cent of married women aged 55 to 59 were
at work compared with 37 per cent of married women aged 20 to 24. About one-half
of the female labour force is under 35 years of age, though an increasing number of
middle-aged women have recently been taking work, including part-time work.
The total working population (including men and women in the armed forces)
rose considerably during the second world war when housewives, including mothers
of young children, manned war factories at great personal inconvenience, while men
The total working population represents the estimated total number of persons aged
IS and over who work for pay or gain, or register themselves as available for such work,
i he total comprises the armed forces, men and women on release leave not yet in employ-
ntent, all persons—employers and workers on their own account as well as employees—in
cml employment (including persons temporarily laid off but still on the employers’ pay¬
rolls) and wholly unemployed persons registered for employment. Part-time workers are
counted as full units.

served in the armed forces. From the end of the war until mid-1947 the size of the
working population declined as women left industry. At the same time the expan¬
sion of the population of working age, a feature of the British economy for two
centuries, slowed down, largely as a result of the low birth rates of the 1930s, and
in the case of women it actually halted. Further, the raising of the school-leaving
age in 1947 removed the 14 age group from the working population. However, after
remaining fairly steady from mid-1948 to mid-1949, the total working population
has been rising slowly, apart from seasonal fluctuations and from checks which
occurred in 1952 and, to a lesser extent, in 1956-57.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between mid-1948
and mid-1957 are shown in Table 27. Figures for mid-1957 are provisional.

Deployment of Labour
Nearly 44 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 45 per cent in agriculture and fishing.
LABOUR
273
Over half of those in manufacturing are in the metals, engineering, vehicles and
chemicals groups of industries, in which the total labour force has approximately-
doubled in the last 20 years.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as under¬
ground work in coal mines, which are forbidden to women. The industrial groups
in which women are chiefly employed are in the metal-using industries, in the
manufacture of textiles and clothing, in the food, drink and tobacco industries,
and in the distributive trades and professional and miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial groups is
given in Table 28. Figures for mid-1957 are provisional.

The figures in Table 28 for the manufacturing and basic industries include those
engaged on administrative and clerical work, so that the numbers engaged on pro¬
ductive processes are smaller than those given for the industries as a whole. The
274
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1951 Censuses of Population (see pp. 6-7) showed that less than a third of men at
work and less than a quarter of women at work were employed in manual occupa¬
tions in mining or manufacturing industry. On the other hand, there were in
Great Britain at the time of the 1951 Censuses of Population over 1,400,000
women clerical workers (including typists), over 800,000 in retail trade, over one
million women domestic workers or charwomen (including those in hotels, insti¬
tutions and offices), 500,000 women in various other forms of personal service
(including catering), nearly a quarter of a million nurses, and 220,000 women
teachers.
At the end of 1956, the unemployed constituted nearly two per cent of insured
employees in Great Britain. Unemployment was mainly short-term. The total
number of persons unemployed for more than six months in Great Britain was
about 0-2 per cent of the number of insured employees. Three-quarters of these
long-term unemployed were men and women over 40 years of age, some 40 per
cent of whom were concentrated in certain areas where unemployment had been
especially severe between 1921 and 1939.
Unemployment in all areas has been very greatly reduced since the pre-war years,
both because of changes in the general economic situation and because of specific
measures taken by the Government to promote a balanced distribution of industry
in order to prevent the recurrence of severe unemployment in the areas previously
most seriously affected (see pp. 134-5)-
Indeed, in Great Britain as a whole, the number of vacancies on the registers of
employment offices has in most months since the second world war been greater
than the number of unemployed, and the demand for certain types of skilled trades¬
men greatly exceeded the supply.
The expansion and technological advance of Britain’s industry has also created
a greater need for more scientists, engineers and technicians. Facilities for scientific
and technical education are accordingly being expanded (see pp. 37^-7 and 408).
Considerable changes in the distribution of persons between various industries
and occupations have taken place during the twentieth century. Some short-term
changes were brought about by the two world wars and by the severe trade reces¬
sion and unemployment of the inter-war years, but the following appear to be the
main long-term trends:
1. A continuance at a decreasing rate of the decline in agricultural employment
which was rapid at the end of the nineteenth century.
2. A general increase in administrative and clerical employment, including
public administration, and a very large increase in the employment of
women in clerical work, including typing.
3. A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries, notably
coalmining and cotton textiles.
4. A very large increase in employment in the metals, engineering and vehicles
group of industries and the chemicals group of industries. Employment in
these industries approximately doubled between 1931 and I951- Expansion
has been most marked in those sections of the industries making relatively
new types of products, e.g., cars, aircraft, electrical and electronic apparatus
and plastics. The rate of increase in certain branches of these industries was
accelerated during both world wars.
5. A decline in indoor private domestic service in which the number of women
employed has fallen by about a million since 1900.
6. A considerable increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades.
LABOUR
This trend was reversed during both world wars—e.g., the number in the
distributive trades fell by 930,000 during the last war, and although increas¬
ing is still below the 1939 level—but appears to be fairly continuous in time
of peace.
Northern Ireland
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—is about 550,000. The
Government of Northern Ireland does not publish up-to-date monthly estimates
of total working population, but at end-May 1956 the number of male employees
was 297,000 and of female employees 176,000. The industry with the largest
number of employees is the linen industry j there are only some 20,000 employees
in agriculture. IVIost agricultural work in Northern Ireland, however, is done by
small farmers and their families without hired help and the total number of persons
engaged in agriculture is about 150,000.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the prin¬
cipal functions of the Ministry of Labour and National Service since its inception in
i9I6. Northern Ireland has its own legislation in these matters which embodies the
main principles of the corresponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing to the
much smaller area of administration and the less favourable employment situation,
the facilities available are not so comprehensive in their scope as is the case in Great
Britain, and administrative arrangements are in some respects on different lines.
The responsible Department is the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in general
to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the services in
Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision of vocational
guidance, and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The Employment and
Training Act, 1948, provided a permanent legislative basis for these wider services.
The main services are provided through the country-wide network of some 1,200
local Employment and Branch Employment Offices, which act as Employment
Exchanges. Local Employment Committees, composed of representatives of em¬
ployers, workers and other local interests, are attached to most Employment Ex¬
changes as advisory bodies to secure for the Department the full benefit of local
knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers. There are
additional services intended to meet the needs of men and women who are qualified,
or who are likely to qualify, for professional, administrative, managerial, senior
executive and higher technical and; scientific posts at home and overseas. These are
operated in Great Britain as follows:
1. The Technical and Scientific Register, kept centrally in London, which
deals with qualified scientists, engineers, architects and surveyors.
2. Regional Nursing Appointments Offices (11) and Nursing Appointments
Offices (over 160), which deal with recruitment for training and employ¬
ment in nursing, midwifery, radiography, physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and medical laboratory technical work.
3. The Professional and Executive Register held at certain of the larger
Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour and National Service.
At these Exchanges a service is maintained for all other persons qualified
for professional and senior executive posts; ex-regular officers of the armed
276
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
forces; and young men suitable for training for management in industry
and commerce. Information about this service can be obtained from any
local office of the Ministry.
General Services for Adults
All the offices referred to above accept on their registers both employed and
unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary function is to introduce
suitable persons seeking employment to employers requiring employees, thus pro¬
viding an efficient service to employers and job-seekers and meeting the needs of
the national economy.
The Employment Exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations to
young men and women aged 18 and over who have not already established them¬
selves in a profession or in the business world, and to older people who wish to
change their careers. Information about this service can also be obtained from any
local office of the Ministry.
A special responsibility of the local employment offices is recruitment under the
Vocational Training Schemes. Two of these schemes—that for the disabled and
that for men and women who need this kind of help if they are to obtain suitable
employment after a period of voluntary service in the regular armed forces are
directed to the resettlement of the individual and cover a comprehensive range of
skilled trade from agriculture to watch and clock repair, from radio and television
servicing to clerical work. Unemployed men and women have also been recruited
for this wide range of trades in some circumstances. The third Vocational Training
Scheme is directed to the filling of urgent vacancies in industries which are im¬
portant to the national economy and which at the same time suffer from shortages
of skilled labour. Any suitable man or woman without an employable skill is re¬
cruited under this scheme, which includes about 20 skilled courses including agri¬
culture, engineering and draughtsmanship.
Training under all these schemes is given mainly at Government d raining
Centres, of which there are 14 in different parts of Great Britain and, for some
trades, in technical colleges or in an employer’s establishment. Courses vary in
length according to the occupation; most last for six months. Maintenance allow¬
ances are paid during training, and men and women with dependants receive higher
rates. These maintenance allowances are higher than the rate for unemployment
benefit. During the period from the beginning of the post-war training scheme on
2nd July, 1945, to 1 ith March, 1957, the number of trainees placed in employment
was 130,908.
Training schemes for particular groups of crafts have been drawn up in consulta¬
tion with representatives of employers and workers, who have agreed that trainees
should be accepted in industry for work which makes full use of the knowledge
acquired during the course. In trades where it is usual for the employee to provide
his own tools he is given these free on taking up a job in his training trade. The job
itself is found whenever possible by the Employment Exchange (local office).
The Ministry of Labour and National Service provides a service to industry
through its Scheme of Training Within Industry for Supervisors. TWI, as it is
usually called, endeavours to develop the supervisory skills—or at least to lay the
foundations for their development—in three training programmes: Job Instruc¬
tion, to impart information to others, whether in giving directions to experienced
workers or instructing the inexperienced; Job Relations, the promotion of goo
working relationships between the people supervised, and between them and t e
LABOUR
277
supervisor; Job Methods, making the best use of manpower, machines and material
by improvements in the working methods employed.
The service to industry is mainly directed to the training of firms’ TWI Trainers,
who will then train the supervisors in their own organizations. The Ministry is
prepared to extend a measure of these services to overseas branches of British firms.
It is prepared also to train suitable persons to develop the scheme in their own
territories. The arrangements may be made by the Government of the country
concerned or (where appropriate) by the International Labour Organization.
A further service to industry is afforded in the provision of courses of instruction
carried out at the Ministry’s Technical Staff College, Letchworth, Hertfordshire,
in the training and teaching of industrial instructors. These courses provide prac¬
tical tuition in demonstrations and trade talks on the workshop floor, followed
by trade lectures, each member of the course gaining practical experience by taking
his turn as instructor to the remainder of the class. These courses have been made
available to overseas countries for the training of suitable persons to undertake
craft instruction in their own territories.
In recent years it has been the Government’s policy, with the support of the
representatives of employers’ and workpeople’s organizations, to promote the
employment of older men and women. The National Advisory Committee on the
Employment of Older Men and Women, appointed in 1952 by the Minister of
Labour and National Service to advise and assist him in carrying out this policy,
has presented two Reports; the first in October 1953 {Gmd. 8963) and the second
in December 1955 (Cmd. 9628).
The first Report recommended that the following general principles should
govern employers’ engagement and retirement policy: (1) that the test for engage¬
ment should be capacity and not age; and (2) that all who can give effective service
should have the opportunity, without regard to age, to continue in work if they so
wish. It also made recommendations for overcoming some of the difficulties that
might prevent these principles from being applied.
These recommendations were accepted by representatives of employers, work¬
people and the nationalized industries on the National Joint Advisory Council (see
P- 286), and have been put into practice by the Government and many leading
employers. Since the Report was published, evidence has shown a steady increase
in the willingness of employers generally to consider older workers for jobs on their
merits, and to retain the services of older employees if they wish to remain and
can continue to work effectively.
The second Report reviewed the progress made since the first Report and dis¬
cussed future developments. The Committee recommended that in bringing this
Report to the notice of employers and workers the Minister should emphasize two
points : (1) the continuing need for firms to examine the age-structure of their
establishments; and (2) the desirability of industries promoting research into aspects
of the employment of older workers that are their particular concern. The Commit¬
tee has now turned its attention to the encouragement of research into specific
problems associated with the employment of older workers.
Services for Foreigners
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to the
prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour and National Service (the Ministry
-1 Labour and National Insurance for Northern Ireland if the proposed employ¬
ment is in Northern Ireland). Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in
- e first instance but may be extended on application by the employer. A foreigner
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
278
already in the United Kingdom, for example as a visitor, may not enter employ¬
ment unless official approval has previously been obtained by his prospective
employer. Approval is subject to the same conditions and requirements as are
applied to the grant of permits to foreigners while still abroad.
The general conditions which must be satisfied before a permit is granted are:
that the proposed employment of a foreigner is reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances \ that adequate efforts have been made by the employer to find suit¬
able labour from among British subjects (or foreigners long resident in the United
Kingdom); and that the wages and conditions of employment proposed for the
foreigner are not less favourable than those commonly accorded to British employees
for similar work in the district concerned.
In considering applications for permits, various other factors must be considered
according to the nature of the proposed employment. Special arrangements have
been applied to the admission of foreigners for nursing, teaching, various forms of
entertainment, and in particular industries. Permits for unskilled workers in indus¬
try are granted only where the employment is productive and where there is a
general shortage of labour. To encourage visits and exchanges of young workers
between Britain and other countries, applications from prospective employers for
permits for student employees are granted freely under properly sponsored arrange¬
ments, organized mostly through unofficial channels.
A foreigner who has been allowed to take employment under a permit, or by
official approval when already resident in the United Kingdom, may not change
his employment, unless his prospective employer has obtained prior approval from
the Ministry to employ the foreigner. From 40,000 to 50,000 permits are issued
each year to bring in individual aliens to work in Britain. Of these, approximately
one-half are for domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other institutions and private
households, and one-eighth for student employees.
The permit system applies to individual aliens. After the second world war, far
greater numbers were being admitted under various schemes organized by the
Ministry of Labour and National Service, notably the resettlement of members of
the Polish Forces who felt themselves unable to return to post-war Poland, and
the recruitment of European Volunteer Workers from the Displaced Persons’
camps in Germany, Austria and Denmark.
More recently, the United Kingdom Government has agreed to admit a number
of Hungarian refugees who fled from their country following the uprising in
October 1956. By the end of May 1957, over 21,000 Hungarian refugees had been
admitted, of whom over 5,000 had emigrated, principally to Canada, and nearly
700 had returned to Austria, or to Plungary and other Eastern European countries.
Of those remaining in Great Britain, about 2,700 were undergoing training for
work in the coal mines, and about 9,000 refugees, and their dependants, had been
resettled in a variety of occupations.
Despite the difficulty in finding accommodation for the refugees, particularly
those with dependants, by the end of May 1957 only some 2,000 refugees who
definitely intended to settle in the United Kingdom had not been placed in work of
some kind.
Youth Employment Service
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is also responsible in Great Britain
for two specialized employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the
Disablement Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people leaving
school and young workers under 18 to get a good start in their working life.
LABOUR
279
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the
Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive
is appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, who is responsible to
Parliament for the Youth Employment Service as a whole. The Minister has
appointed a National Youth Employment Council and separate Advisory Com¬
mittees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him on questions relating to the
service.
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment Offices
established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education authorities)
in accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and
National Service and approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not
in operation, the service is operated by the local office of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information on
careers, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, help to find suitable
employment and keep contact with young workers to assist them in settling down.
A further function is to assist employers in filling their vacancies for young people.
Local Youth Employment Committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers
and other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland, the Youth Employment Service is operated by the Ministry
of Labour and National Insurance; in addition local education authorities in some
areas provide a Vocational Guidance Service. In these areas, there is close liaison
between the Ministry and the authorities.
Disablement Resettlement Service
The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, on which all the Ministry’s work
for disabled persons is based, declares that its purpose is ‘ to make further and better
provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure employment
or work on their own account’, and the Disablement Resettlement Service is
designed to help disabled persons to get and keep suitable work. The service is
available to all persons over school-leaving age who are substantially handicapped
as a result of injury, disease or congenital deformity.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is responsible for the administra¬
tion of the service. At each of its local offices a Disablement Resettlement Officer,
working under the direction of the Manager and in co-operation with other officers,
has the special duty of advising and assisting disabled persons in obtaining suitable
employment. This officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area and visits any
patient who wishes to discuss the question of future employment. His work involves
close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary welfare agencies.
The help given by the service falls under four main headings:
1. Vocational Guidance. This is given at local offices by Disablement Resettle¬
ment Officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local Disablement Advisory
Committees, Hospital Resettlement Clinics and Medical Interviewing Committees,
and also by vocational psychologists in the Industrial Rehabilitation Units (see
paragraph 3).
2. Placing in Ordinary Competitive Employment. On the basis of a disabled
person’s qualifications and aptitudes and with medical guidance, the Disablement
Resettlement Officer endeavours to find work most suitable for the individual, either
immediately or after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To
a limited extent this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons
T
280
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Employment Act, 1944, namely, that all employers of 20 or more persons are
required to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for almost all industries) of
registered disabled persons. Registration is voluntary. The number of disabled
persons registered at April 1957 was 764,446. At the same date 48,955 registered
disabled were unemployed, 45,139 being considered capable of ordinary employ¬
ment. This latter figure is estimated as about 5 g per cent of the total number of
registered disabled persons. In addition, persons so severely disabled as to be
classed as incapable of ordinary employment are to an increasing extent being
found suitable work in unsubsidized competitive undertakings.
3. Industrial Rehabilitation and Vocational Training. Industrial rehabilitation is
provided at residential and non-residential units run by the Ministry of Labour and
National Service where physical and mental toning-up is given and, for those who
need it, vocational guidance as to the best kind of employment to take up.1
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments (see p. 276). For
the more seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by
voluntary organizations with the financial assistance and technical help of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service. There are also arrangements for the
training of special categories of disabled persons such as the blind.
4. Sheltered Employment. Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company,
with no share capital, was established in Great Britain in accordance with the pro¬
visions of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Its objects are to provide
training and employment facilities for registered disabled persons who are unlikely
to obtain work except under special conditions. Its powers are wide enough to cover
the provision of special factories and workshops, hostel accommodation and facilities
for home workers. The directors are appointed by the Minister of Labour and
National Service; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour Vote. At the end of
1956 Remploy Ltd. operated 90 factories and employed 6,200 severely disabled
men and women, including approximately 140 homeworkers.
Facilities for the employment of blind persons are provided by local authorities
directly or through voluntary bodies, with the financial assistance of the Ministry
of Labour and National Service. At end-December 1956 there were 69 workshops
for the blind in which there were 268 blind persons in training and 3,812 in employ¬
ment. The Ministry also helped to finance the provision of training or employment
for 821 severely disabled sighted persons in 44 workshops provided by 36 volun¬
tary undertakings or local authorities. Some 1,250 blind persons were also working
at home under homeworkers’ schemes.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
At the beginning of the nineteenth century industrial workers lacked legitimate
means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their working condi¬
tions. The traditional methods of fixing wages had become obsolete, trade unions
were regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there wras no protective legislation
setting minimum standards of safety, health and welfare in places of work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of Appren¬
tices Act, 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833 which created an
inspectorate employed and paid by the central Government to enforce its provisions.
1 For an account of medical rehabilitation of the disabled, see p. 360.
LABOUR
28l
Since that date, legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the
•statutory protection for employees has been passed at an accelerating rate. The
progress in standards has owed much to the recommendations of strengthened
(inspectorates, much to the example of progressive employers and much to the
persistent pressure of trade unions and disinterested reformers.
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as legal
I entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had been made
acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions, who had aban-
! doned the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of earlier trade unions to
pursue a limited practical objective, i.e. the improvement of their members’ wages
and conditions through skilful and honest negotiation from positions of financial
I strength.
After 1880 the organization of unskilled workers became more extensive and
effective and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and political.
As many employers were still hostile to trade unionism and were unwilling to
? negotiate with trade unions or to recognize agreements made on an industry-wide
basis, many of the first 30 years of the twentieth century were marked by widespread
; and prolonged strikes. Since 1932, however, the strike rate (in terms of man-days
1 lost) has been very much lower, and arrangements for the negotiation of terms of
I service and the peaceful settlement of disputes have become general and are on
the whole satisfactory.
Today, minimum standards have been established by statute or collective agree¬
ment for both the terms and conditions of employment and the working conditions
I of the substantial majority of British workers. The fixing of terms and conditions of
employment, however, involves principles, methods and machinery quite different
from those for the determination of working conditions. Terms and conditions of
employment of the majority of workers are determined by collective agreements
I between employers’ associations and trade unions, and the fixing by statute of mini-
| mum wages and terms of employment is confined to those trades or industries where
) the organization of employers or workers or both is inadequate to negotiate collec-
I tive agreements and to ensure their observance.
Standards for working conditions, on the other hand, are laid down by statute,
[ -•£•> the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, and it is the duty of Government inspectors
and local authority inspectors to enforce their provisions. The various Acts of
Parliament and statutory regulations made thereunder prescribe standards of safety,
I health and welfare for a large proportion of workers, and regulate the hours of work
I ror women and young persons. Health, safety or welfare requirements, additional to
! these statutory requirements, have, in some cases, been the subject of collective
agreement.
Many employers provide working conditions superior to those prescribed by
statute or agreement, and various Government Departments and voluntary bodies

The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
^asis, and rests on the organization of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organizations1 discuss and negotiate terms and
I :onditions of employment and other matters affecting the workpeople at their work.
The few monopolist employers—the central Government and the public corporations
aperating the nationalized industries—and some other employers negotiate directly with
he trade unions representing their different types of employees.
282
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In some cases these negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings, which
are held when necessary; in other cases voluntary joint machinery has been estab¬
lished on a permanent basis. Normally these arrangements suffice to settle all
questions which are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled
to be referred for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain trades where the
voluntary organization of employers and workers is not adequate for the effective
regulation of the workers’ remuneration, provision has also been made by the State
for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Acts, 1945 to 1948. the Catering
Wages Act, 1943, the Agricultural Wages Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Wages
(Scotland) Act, 1949.
Employers’ Organizations
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations, some
of which have their origins in the nineteenth century. They are generally organized |
on an ‘industry basis’, some being purely local in character and dealing with a
section of an industry only, while others have a national scope and concern them¬
selves with the whole of an industry. In some cases the local associations are
organized into district or national federations.
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers’ Confedera¬
tion, to which the majority of employers’ associations and federations in the princi¬
pal industries are affiliated. It deals with matters affecting the interests of organized
employers in their relations with their workpeople, and is recognized by the
Government as the principal channel of consultation between Government Depart¬
ments and representatives of organized employers as a -whole on all such matters.
The Confederation acts as an advisory and consultative body for its member
organizations, providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining and
acting upon their collective views and representing these nationally to the Govern¬
ment and to the public, and also internationally, for example, to the International
Labour Organization.
While the main function of employers’ organizations consists in the safeguarding
of the interests of their members, a number consider that this purpose can be
furthered by the provision of advice and assistance to member firms and by such
special services as the organization of general training courses and special courses
on, for example, work study and its application. Where employers’ organizations
do not themselves provide such services they make arrangements for putting their
members in touch with the appropriate specialist agency.
Trade Unions
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organized into trade unions. These have grown up gradually
and independently over a great many years, and consequently their form and
organization vary considerably. Trade unions started more than two hundred years
ago among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and
unskilled classes. More recently trade unionism has increased among clerical,
supervisory, technical and administrative workers.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational, e.g., they may
recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed, while in others the qualification is
industrial, i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an industry, whatever their occu¬
pation. In a number of unions recruitment is based on a combination of these
principles. A few large unions recruit members in a number of different occupations
and industries.
At the end of 1956 the total membership of British trade unions was about
LABOUR 283
9,662,000. There were 666 separate trade unions, but about two-thirds of all trade
unionists were in the 17 largest unions.
The basic unit of organization in most British trade unions is the local branch or
lodge. Every member of the union belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its
meetings, put forward suggestions about terms and conditions of employment,
discuss the work and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch
officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered purely or mainly of
local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of
work to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on agreed
or customary conditions of work and in some cases to act as representatives of
members at their place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In most large unions the central organization is along the following lines. Elected
officials, including a General Secretary assisted by clerical and specialist staff, are
in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a National Executive
Council or Committee which may be part- or full-time, and which is usually elected
by, and responsible to, annual or biennial conferences of delegates from the
branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government of
the unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry out
policy decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some kind of regional, district or area organization, while
in large unions there is usually also a system of regional, district or area committees
or councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations whose
main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade unions in an
industry in negotiation with employers. The scope and authority of these federa¬
tions and confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
All the trade unions of any size or importance except the National Union of
Teachers, the National Association of Local Government Officers and certain
civil service staff associations are affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the
national centre of the British trade union movement. The objects of the TUC are
to promote the interests of all its affiliated organizations and generally to improve
the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 186
organizations, of which 13 are federations of some 190 separate unions, so that
some 360 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These represent over
8 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions which concern
trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on questions
relating to particular trades or industries at the request of the trade union con¬
cerned. The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for
a week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and to
employees generally. The General Council, elected annually, represents the TUC
between congresses. A large part of its work consists of acting as a spokesman for
British trade unionists on matters affecting their general interests, of co-ordinating
trade union activities and determining disagreements between trade unions, of
providing a number of educational and other common services and of preparing
| a report and agenda for the annual congress.
Both the TUC and a number of affiliated trade unions have in recent years paid
increasing attention to the education of their members not only in general economic
questions and trade union practice but also in production subjects, including work
study and costing, which had not hitherto been thought to concern trade unions.
The TUC itself holds regular one-week courses on production and management
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
284
subjects and on industrial relations, as well as a two-week course on trade union
subjects. It also organizes week-end schools and summer schools. These are open
to members of any affiliated union, usually by nomination from the union. A num¬
ber of the larger unions hold similar courses. In addition, arrangements are made
for union officials to attend courses on production questions at technical colleges.
Some unions also make use of industrial consultants for this purpose.
The Trades Union Congress is recognized by the Government as the principal
channel of consultation between the Government Departments and representatives
of organized workers on matters affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade unions
may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
The TUC is a non-political body, but individual trade unions can, by a ballot
vote of members, decide to set up a political fund, financed by a separate levy, j
which any member can refuse to pay without loss of his normal trade union rights
and benefits. About 80 unions, including most of the largest, have such a fund and, 1
in every case but one, it is used to support the Labour Party.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality often voluntarily affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as local agent of the Trades Union Congress, by which it is annually
registered. There are about 535 trades councils in England and Wales alone,
grouped together in 22 federations.
Voluntary Joint Negotiating Machinery
At National Level. While in some industries all matters affecting terms and
conditions of employment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers’
organizations and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard
procedures for dealing with such matters by joint discussion at a national level. In
many industries there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of representatives of
both sides of the industry with, in some cases, an independent chairman. Some are
known as Joint Industrial Councils, of which there are over 130. The functions of
these bodies vary considerably, some being simply negotiating bodies, while others
deal with a wide range of subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned.
Provision is sometimes made in the constitution of such bodies that, where it is
not found possible to reach agreed terms of settlement in a particular dispute, the
matter should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by indepen¬
dent persons, including the methods provided under the Conciliation Act, 1896,
or the Industrial Courts Act, 1919 (see p. 285).
At District and Factory Level. Similar arrangements exist at district and factory
level in many industries, where matters are discussed either between the appropriate
representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or through regular machinery
provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar bodies and Works Councils
(see p. 286). Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at a national level may
be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have no power to alter the terms
of such national agreements. They also discuss new problems which may arise, and
if no solution can be found at factory or district level the matter may be referred to |
the national body.
Statutory Wage-Regulating Machinery
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organization among employers
and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist for the effective
settlement of terms and conditions of employment or are inadequate to secure their
observance by voluntary methods throughout the industry, statutory bodies known
LABOUR
285
as Wages Councils, Catering Wages Boards and Agricultural Wages Boards have
been set up. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers
and workers in the respective industries, with the addition of certain independent
members. Wages Councils and Catering Wages Boards are empowered to submit
proposals for the fixing of minimum remuneration and of holidays with pay to the
Minister of Labour and National Service, who is then required by the Acts con¬
cerned to make Orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject only to his
right to return them to the Board or Council for further consideration.
Orders relative to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate Agricul¬
tural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such Orders are effective only
in the County Agricultural Wages Committee area in respect of which they have
been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable in England and Wales
and also one for Scotland.
State Provision for Conciliation, Arbitration and Investigation
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred by
agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which the
parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of Labour and
National Service. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and
the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry’s own
machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement and not to
supersede the industry’s own machinery.
To assist conciliation in industry, a staff of conciliation officers forms part of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service. The duties of these officers are to keep
in touch with the course of relations between employers and workers at national,
district, and, in some cases, factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to settle
their problems by joint discussion and negotiation.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both parties,
be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or an ad hoc
Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent tribunal established
under the Industrial Courts Act. The Court is normally constituted of three
members—the president, one member representing employers and one represent¬
ing workpeople. At present, provision is also made by an Order under emergency
legislation for disputes and ‘ issues51 about terms and conditions of employment, to
be reported to the Minister in certain circumstances by one of the parties, and to
be referred, if all other means of settlement have been exhausted, to an Industrial
Disputes Tribunal, whose award can be legally enforced. This tribunal consists of a
chairman and two other independent members appointed by the Minister of Labour
and National Service, together with one member representing employers and one
representing workpeople. These representatives are drawn from panels appointed
by the Minister after consultation with the British Employers’ Confederation and
the Trades Union Congress respectively.
The Minister is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or Committee of
Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended. These procedures
are primarily means of informing public opinion of the facts of a dispute and not
means of arbitration. The report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before Parlia¬
ment. Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies are
1 A dispute concerns the terms of employment or conditions of labour of workmen. An
issue concerns the observance by an employer of the ‘ recognized terms and conditions ’ in
his trade or industry.
286
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
not binding on the parties, they usually provide the basis of a settlement of the
difference.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation of disputes has reduced the need
for direct industrial action, i.e. strikes and lock-outs. Time lost by stoppages of work
caused by industrial disputes has been substantially less in the last twenty years
than formerly. The average time lost in the 24 years 1933-56 was two million man-
days or about a tenth of a day per worker per year compared with an average of
21 million man-days in the 23 years 1910-32. The reduction has been in the size and
duration of strikes and not in their number.
Liaison between the Government and Industry
As will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs, the Government is in contact with
representatives of employers and workers at all levels on matters affecting their
common interests. At local and district level the conciliation officers of the Ministry
of Labour and National Service keep in touch with the representatives of both
sides of industry, while, at national level, officers of the Department attend the meet¬
ings of many Joint Industrial Councils as liaison officers. Standing arrangements
also exist for consultation between the Government, the British Employers’ Con¬
federation and the Trades Union Congress through the National Joint Advisory
Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on matters in which
employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly under the chair¬
manship of the Minister of Labour and National Service. Its membership consists
of representatives of the British Employers’ Confederation and the Trades Union
Congress, together with representatives of the managements of nationalized indus¬
tries. Among the subjects which it has considered in recent years are the machinery
for settling industrial disputes, joint consultation in industry, industrial training
and recruitment, double day shiftworking, and the economic situation with special
reference to production, wages and prices.
Joint Consultation in Industry at Factory Level
In addition to the arrangements already described, the purpose of which is
mainly but not exclusively for discussion and settlement of terms and conditions of
employment, there are, in many industries, national agreements which recommend
the establishment, in firms of sufficient size, of machinery for joint consultation
between management and workers on problems of common interest. This generally
takes the form of a Works Council. In some industries the constitution and func¬
tions of Works Councils are laid down in the agreement, while in others model
constitutions are made available. In other industries, where no national agreement
on the subject has been reached, the practice of joint consultation in the factory
is becoming increasingly widespread.
The range of subjects which Works Councils can fruitfully discuss is wide and
includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety, health, effi¬
ciency of production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training, education, recreation
and employees’ services generally. The constitution and functions of these bodies
vary widely from one firm to another. It is the general practice, however, to exclude
from their scope all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and
other matters covered by negotiation between organizations of employers and
workers. It is the policy of the Government to foster the development of voluntary
joint consultation throughout industry, not only because of its effect on production
but also as a most important means of maintaining good relationships between
management and employees.
LABOUR
287
At individual factory level, Personnel Management Advisers of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service are often approached by firms seeking advice on the
establishment of Works Councils or on ways in which their activities can be made
more effective.
Labour Relations of Public Authorities
The above broad description of labour-management relations in industries where
employers and employees are strongly organized applies in general to the public
as well as to the private sector of industry. There are, however, some special
features both in the public service and in the nationalized industries.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations (trade unions)
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by
means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils1 (see p. 64), corre-
l spending to the Joint Industrial Councils in industry. The two sides of the National
Whitley Council are parties to a Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which, sub-
I ject to certain limitations, provides that if there is failure to reach agreement by
! negotiation a Department or Association may report the dispute to the Minister
| of Labour and National Service for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration
Tribunal. The Tribunal is an independent one appointed by the Minister by
virtue of his powers under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919. Industrial employees
of the central Government are organized by trades and not by Departments. Nego-
itiations regarding their wages and conditions of employment take place on Trade
Joint Councils and Departmental Joint Councils.
In local government services there are separate National Whitley Councils for
| the main grades of employees (e.g., manual, clerical and technical employees, and
road-menders, see p. 70) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well
as other matters. There are corresponding Regional and District Councils.
In the nationalized industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint consulta¬
tion with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free to choose
the arrangements that suit them. In nearly every case a complex system already
existed before nationalization and has been taken over and modified. The arrange¬
ments, therefore, as in industry generally, vary substantially. The main difference
from private industry is that the corporations are not members of employers’ asso-
I ciations. In some industries they are sole or main employers, but even where part
* of the industry is in private hands, as for example in air or road transport, the
» corporations are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Northern Ireland
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same prin-
s ciples as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of Labour and
National Insurance has powers and duties broadly similar to those of the Minister
I of Labour and National Service in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions whose headquarters
are in Great Britain.

man of a committee which investigated industrial unrest from 1916 to 1919.
288
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
WORKING CONDITIONS: THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their employees
and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of care to each
other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety, health and welfare are
laid down in a number of statutes.
The principal Acts involving enforcement of standards of safety, health or wel¬
fare are: the Public Health Acts; the Employment of Women, Young Persons and
Children Act, 1920; the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933 5 the Employment
of Women and Young Persons Act, 1936; the Young Persons (Employment) Act,
1938; the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948; the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954; an^
the Shops Act, 1950. There are a number of other Acts dealing with particular
requirements or particular occupations.
Powers of Local Authorities
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary conveniences in houses and at places of work and
to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances
whose abatement can be enforced. They have also wide powers under the Children
and Young Persons Act, 1933, as modified by the Education Act, i944» to regulate
hours and conditions of employment of children in their areas within the limits
laid down by national legislation. The general effect of the national legislation is
to forbid the employment of children under 13 years of age, and to forbid the
employment of children between the ages of 13 and 15 during school hours, or
before 6 a.m. or after 8 p.m. on any day, or for more than two hours on schooldays
or on Sundays. The employment of children in any industrial undertaking before
they reach the age of 15 is prohibited.
Shops
The Shops Act, 1950, empowers local authorities to ensure that shops in their
area observe the requirements of the Acts with regard to closing hours and the
working conditions of employees, which include special requirements about the
hours of work of young persons. In general, shops are required to be closed on week¬
days by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. on one late day) except on the early closing day when they
are required to be closed by 1 p.m. With certain exceptions, shops are required to
be closed on Sundays. The hours of work of employees under sixteen are restricted
to 44 per week, and those of employees between sixteen and eighteen to 48 per
week. Local authorities also have powers to ensure reasonable minimum standards
of ventilation, temperature, lighting, sanitary accommodation and washing facilities
in shops.
Industrial Premises
About a quarter of a million industrial premises (factories, shipyards, docks and
warehouses) and over 25,000 building and civil engineering sites come under the
Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, which are administered by the Ministry of Labour
and National Service and enforced by H.M. Inspectors of Factories in the Minis¬
try. Any person intending to use premises as a factory has to notify the Inspector
of Factories of his intention not less than one month before he begins to occupy
them.
Under the Acts, every accident causing three days’ incapacity or more must be
reported to H.M. Inspectors of Factories; provision is also made for compulsory
LABOUR
289
notification and investigation of certain industrial poisonings and diseases, and, in
addition, a number of general and specific requirements for safety, health and
welfare are laid down.
Safety requirements include provisions for the fencing of prime movers,
transmission machinery and dangerous parts of machinery; the sale, hire or use
of power-driven machinery without effective guards of certain parts; the cleaning
of machinery in motion; the training and supervision of young persons employed
at certain machines; the examination of hoists and lifting equipment, steam boilers
and steam and air receivers; the construction of floors; precautions against falls,
against gassing, and against explosions of inflammable dust or gas; means of escape
in case of fire; the protection of the eyes; the handling of dangerous substances;
and the lifting of heavy weights.
There are also general requirements with regard to health, covering cleanliness of
workrooms, the provision and maintenance of proper accommodation and ventila¬
tion and of suitable temperatures and lighting, the avoidance of over-crowding and
the provision of sanitary accommodation; and with regard to welfare, the provision
of washing facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking
water, first-aid and seats.
All young persons under 18 years of age must, on entry to employment in fac¬
tories, at docks, or on building operations, be medically examined by doctors ap¬
pointed bytheChief Inspector of Factories and known as Appointed Factory Doctors,
and they must be re-examined annually until they reach the age of 18. The hours
permitted to be worked by women and young persons between the ages of 16 and 18
are limited to 48 in a week and 9 in a day, although some overtime is allowed (up
to six hours a week but not more than 100 hours a year nor in more than 25 weeks
in a year). Young persons under 16 years of age are limited to 44 hours a week.
Adequate intervals for meals must be arranged for women and young persons and
the employment of women and girls at night is, in general, prohibited. Women and
young persons are also prohibited from working in six specified processes concerned
with lead compounds.
These requirements for safety, health and welfare are supplemented or modified
by regulations providing for safeguards against special risks to health or safety. The
regulations cover particular industries, processes, and types of machinery, and they
include provision for the compulsory periodic medical examination of workers in
certain specified industrial processes.
Mines and Quarries
The safety, health and welfare of workers in mines and quarries are the subject
of comprehensive legislation. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of
1842, which forbade the employment of women underground, and successive
measures laid down detailed requirements for the safe conduct of operations and
dealt with such matters as ventilation, dust suppression, support of workings, the
safe use of electricity, rescue and first-aid. The latest stage was reached when the
Mines and Quarries Act was passed in 1954. This Act established the basic modern
principles of safety, health and welfare, leaving the details to be dealt with in statu¬
tory regulations; it both consolidates the previous law and brings it up to date.
Apart from technical matters, it also covers such subjects as the general responsibi¬
lities of owners and managements, the appointment and duties of officials, training,
welfare, the powers of official inspectors, statutory qualifications of managers and
under-managers, employment of women and young persons, and inspections on
behalf of workmen.
The Ministry of Power is generally responsible for the administration of these
290
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
enactments, while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of that
Ministry, is directly responsible for their enforcement.
Agriculture
In agriculture, special attention has been paid to the protection of workers against
risks of poisoning, due to the use of toxic chemicals, and the Agriculture (Poisonous
Substances) Act, 1952, imposed necessary safeguards. The Agriculture (Safety,
Health and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956, provides for securing the safety, health
and welfare of persons employed in agriculture by means of regulations made by
the ministers concerned with agriculture in Great Britain (see p. 158).
Transport
The general safety legislation covering the main forms of transport protects
transport workers as well as members of the public against accidents involving
moving vehicles. In the interests of road safety, the hours of driving and the rest
periods of drivers of buses and goods vehicles are regulated by the Road Traffic
Acts. In addition, there are certain statutory provisions concerned entirely, or
mainly, with the safety, health or welfare of the employees, e.g., the statutory Rules
and Orders made under the Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act,
1900. Merchant seamen are protected by the far reaching and detailed requirements
of the Merchant Shipping Acts and the regulations made thereunder concerning,
inter alia, the engagement and discharge of seamen, limitations on the employment
of young persons at sea, standards of crew accommodation, scales of provisions,
medicines and medical stores, care and repatriation of seamen left behind at ports
abroad, and the seaworthiness of the ships in which they work.
Employment of Young Persons
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, extended the restrictions on the
hours of work of young persons (48 per week under 18 years and 44 per week under
16 years) to certain occupations not covered by the Factories Acts, the Mines and
Quarries Act, 1954, or the Shops Act, 1950.
Northern Ireland
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation similar to that in Great Britain but embodied in separate
statutes to meet the special requirements of Northern Ireland. Provision for the
safety, health and welfare of workers in factories, workshops, ship and building
yards and certain other working premises is embodied in the Factories Acts
(Northern Ireland), 1939 and 1949. The Minister of Labour and National Insur¬
ance is responsible for the administration of these Acts and for their enforcement
by a factory inspectorate, forming part of his Department.
WORKING CONDITIONS IN PRACTICE
Earnings
Minimum or standard time rates for British manual workers, as determined
by agreements or wages orders, vary mainly between 3s. and 4s. an hour for men
and between 2s. and 2s. 8d. for women. Actual earnings are usually higher.
Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates, shift rates and overtime rates
raise the level of average earnings. The Ministry of Labour and National Service
conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings and hours of work in some of the princi¬
pal industries in Great Britain. The survey made in April 1957 covered about 7
LABOUR 291
million workers and showed the average hourly earnings in all the industries
covered to be as follows:
Men 21 years and over . . . . . . . . 5s. O-Od.
Youths and boys under 21 years . . . . . . 2s. 4-Id.
Women 18 years and over . . . . . . . . 3s. 0-4d.
Girls under 18 years .. .. .. .. .. Is. 11-5d.
All workers . . . . . . . . . . . . 4s. 4-6d.
Average weekly earnings were:

All workers
The principal industries not covered by this survey of earnings were agriculture,
where the average weekly earnings for regular adult male workers were 175s. id.
in the half year October 1956 to March 1957; coalmining, where according to
I information collected by the National Coal Board, the average weekly cash earn¬
ings for men were 319s. gd., plus 15s. gd. in kind, in April 1957; railway services,
in which average weekly earnings in March 1956 (including those of non-manual
workers but excluding those of higher paid salaried staff), were 227s. 8d. for men

(a) Employment income includes income from wages, salaries, pensions from employers,
casual earnings of non-professional workers, bonuses, tips, etc.
(b) The income unit is defined as follows: (1) all single persons of x8 or over, whether
living alone or with other members of their family, are regarded as separate income units:
if they have dependent children of their own (of under 18), as may happen in the case of
widows and divorced and separated people, their children form part of their income unit;
(2) married couples living together are assumed to pool their incomes and each couple is
counted as a single unit, and their children of under 18 are also included in their income unit.
(c) Includes 13 income units in which the occupation of the head was not discovered.

LABOUR
293
The difference between men’s and women’s earnings in industry is due
mainly to the fact that women are for the most part engaged on different tasks
from men and are paid less than men on the grounds that these tasks are unskilled
or semi-skilled. In the relatively few instances in the field of manual employment
where men and women are employed on the same work, collective agreements
frequently provide for equal remuneration.
There are no similarly detailed and comprehensive figures for the rates of pay
and earnings of non-manual workers, as these are often based on individual con¬
tracts, except in the public service, teaching and retail distribution. The rather
limited evidence suggests that the majority of male non-manual workers—the
clerks and shop-assistants—have average earnings little different in range from
those of manual workers, but the earnings of women in these occupations are some¬
what higher than in manual occupations. The pay of shop-assistants is on scales
prescribing weekly minima of from about £6 8s. 6d. to £8 ns. for men and
£4 ns. 6d. to £6 6s. for women. The Office Management Association makes
periodical surveys of clerical salaries. The latest survey, of 1st March, 1956, which
covers 1,023 establishments, employing 81,797 workers, shows that the average
weekly salaries for young inexperienced clerks ranged mainly from 54s. lod. to
82s. lod. for youths and from 53s. gd. to 75s. gd. for girls, while average salaries
for adult male clerks ranged from £8 for the lowest grade of skill and responsibility
to £14 for the highest. Corresponding women’s salaries were 25-30 per cent less.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in the
range of £350 to £500 a year; such posts offer increments and opportunities for
promotion, but as recently as 1954-55 only about o-8 per cent of all employees
were earning over £2,000 a year, only about 0-3 per cent over £3,000 and less than
0’i per cent over £6,000. Additional information about the spread of incomes
in different occupations is available from unofficial sources; for example, the national
sample surveys of personal incomes and savings made in the spring of 1952 by H. F.
Lydall and in the spring of 1954 by T. P. Hall. Table 29 is based on these sources.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service are in
the range of £1,000 to £5,000 a year. The posts with salaries of £5,000 to £10,000
a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, chairmen and some other members of
the boards of nationalized industries, judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal,
and Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, the clerks of the
largest municipal authorities, a few persons outstanding in their professions and
the top-management of large businesses. A few persons in business draw still higher
salaries.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices, admini¬
strative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for doing the same
work in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, radiography, university teaching,
journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as Ministers of the Crown, Members
of Parliament, salaried magistrates and solicitors, pharmacists working in hospitals,
and administrative, professional and technical workers in local government. Pro¬
fessional men and women earning fees also have equal pay. In almost all other
occupations, however, a woman in Britain doing the same job as a man is at present
paid less for doing it, although the position may be quite different in a few years’
time. The Government has stated that it accepts the principle of equal pay, and
steps are being taken to put it into effect by stages in the public services. In January
^SS. the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced Government acceptance of a
scheme for progressive increases in the salary scales of non-industrial women civil
servants to make these identical with men’s scales by 1961; in April 1955, the
Minister of Education announced approval of similar proposals by the Burnham
294
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Committee (the advisory body concerned with teachers’ salaries) for equal pay for
women teachers; and in the same month it was decided that equal pay for women
in the administrative departments of local authorities should also be introduced
by stages. Since then similar proposals have been agreed for certain other salaried
workers, including the staffs of the National Health Service and of the electricity
and gas authorities and of the British Transport Commission. Women’s salaries
outside the public service are beginning to be similarly adjusted.
Hours of Work
While, as already stated, the hours of work of women and young persons between
the ages of 16 and 18 in industrial and certain other occupations are limited by law
to 48 a week and those of young persons under 16 to 44 a week, normal hours of
work for all ages and sexes are usually shorter. Agreed weekly hours mainly vary
between 42 and 46, averaging between 44 and 45, and may be worked as either a
five- or a five-and-a-half-day week according to the industry and the rule of the
particular establishment. Hours actually worked are somewhat longer owing to
overtime working. The survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour and National
Service in April 1957 into earnings and hours of manual workers showed that
average weekly hours actually worked were as follows:
Men . .
Youths and boys
Women
Girls . .
All workers . .
48*5 hours
44-9 hours
41- 5 hours
42- 4 hours
46’6 hours
Holidays with Pay
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in industries
covered by agreements or statutory Orders are entitled to paid holidays of twelve
days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or statutory public holidays
which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday and Christmas Day, there are
Bank Holidays in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands on
Easter Monday, Whit-Monday, the first Monday in August and the first weekday
after Christmas (Boxing Day), and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, the first
Monday in May, and the first Monday in August. Many agreements provide that
payment should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
Safety
Safety depends in practice at least as much on the education and voluntary efforts
of the employers and of the worker as upon safety regulations. There are over a
quarter of a million workplaces in Great Britain subject to the Factories Acts. The
total strength of the Factory Inspectorate including medical and other specialists
was 383 before decisions to strengthen it, and in particular to triple its chemical
and engineering staff, were reached in the autumn of 1956. When the decisions
have been fully implemented, its strength will be about 440. In June 1957 there
were 1,698 mines (including 841 main coal mines) and 4,803 quarries, including
238 opencast coal sites; the total strength of the mines and quarries inspectorate
was 147. Except in coal mines, prevention of accidents by frequent inspection is
impracticable. The concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with
safety helps to maintain safety standards, and the requirements about accident
notification (see p. 288) help inspectors to take up the means of prevention with
employers, machinery manufacturers and interested organizations. But the volun¬
tary co-operation of managements and employees in individual workplaces is
LABOUR
295
obviously essential to the safety drive. The Accident Prevention Movement, a
voluntary educational campaign, is strongly supported by the Factory and Mines
and Quarries Inspectorates. Inspectors inquire into safety aspects of machine
design and specification, circulate expert advice by personal exhortation, lectures
and literature, and encourage the appointment of Safety Officers and the forma¬
tion of Works Safety Committees. An Industrial Health and Safety Centre in
London is maintained by the Ministry of Labour and National Service. The
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham is a voluntary organization for
education and training in practical safety methods. The Royal Society for the Pre¬
vention of Accidents helps the Accident Prevention Movement by providing pub¬
licity and by organizing conferences and courses for Safety Officers. The British
Colour Council has evolved a code of safety colours.
Organizations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing extent
with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information and advisory
services to their members. They participate also in Joint Standing and Advisory
Committees established by the Chief Inspector of Factories. Representatives of
the Trades Union Congress, the British Employers’ Confederation, the nationalized
industries and the Ministry of Labour and National Service meet on the Industrial
Safety Sub-Committee of the National Joint Advisory Council.
In road, rail and air transport most of the work is outside the scope of the Factories
Acts, but elaborate safety codes have been laid down by the British Transport
Commission, the London Pransport Executive and the Air Corporations.
Fatal and serious industrial accidents have tended to diminish during the
twentieth century. They rose somewhat in factories during the early years of the
second world war. Since then, however, there has been a further decline, though
accidents sufficiently serious to cause at least three days’ absence still happen to
three per cent of male factory employees every year and one per cent of female
factory employees. Most of these accidents are due to quite ordinary causes—
the handling of goods, the use of hand-tools, or falls—and only a sixth are caused
by power-driven machinery. Fatal accidents reported in 1956 in factories and other
places of employment subject to the Factories Acts numbered 687. Fatal accidents
in mines and quarries numbered 376. The total of fatal industrial accidents in
factories, mines and quarries and railways, and on trading and fishing vessels
numbered 1,367.
Health and Welfare
Employers frequently achieve health and welfare standards considerably higher
than those prescribed by law. They are helped to do this by the inspectorates, by
Government Departments and agencies (e.g., the Medical Research Council), by
employers associations and trade unions and by such expert voluntary bodies as
the Central Council for Health Education and the Industrial Welfare Society.
An increasing number of firms in Britain provide a whole-time or part-time
doctor, an industrial nurse, and a canteen with hot meals, pay part or all of the
cost of clubs and sports grounds, operate retirement and sickness insurance schemes
supplementing the State insurance schemes, and afford training and educational
facilities. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent
homes.
The public corporations operating the nationalized industries have set out to be
model employers and to standardize and improve the varied provisions for safety,
health and welfare made by the undertakings which they took over. They have
established safety and first-aid organizations and medical services and have taken
part in or supported research designed to reduce the risks of accidents or occupational
U
2q6 BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
disease. They have provided or arranged for convalescent homes and, in some
cases, rehabilitation centres. They have extended the provision of canteens and
other facilities at the place of work, and have made increased contributions to social
welfare. Where necessary, they have undertaken considerable housing programmes
to provide accommodation for their employees.
Prompt and effective action in the field of industrial health depends, among
other things, on an adequate industrial health research service, properly integrated
both with industrial health services and industrial research. Apart from field investi¬
gations carried out by H.M. Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service and its specialized medical and technical branches, this is pro¬
vided by Government agencies such as the Medical Research Council, the Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research (including the National Physical
Laboratory), and the Government Chemist; by the Departments of Industrial
Health and Social Medicine of the universities: and by the research departments of
various large industrial concerns. Co-ordination is provided by a number of general
and special committees.
Welfare standards vary considerably from one factory to another. Between a
third and a half of the factory workers of the country are employed by small firms
employing fewer than 250 workers, many of which, largely for economic reasons,
have not raised their standard of welfare as much as the larger firms.
The amenities provided by large factories depend partly on the employees’ needs
and desires. The requirements of a factory where the work is light, and many
employees are women or young persons, are different from those of an engineering
or steel works, where work is arduous and dirty, and undertaken mainly by men.
Progressive firms are careful to find out what their employees want, and welfare
policy is often decided in consultation with the workers, whether through regular
consultative machinery or by other means.
During and since the second world war the provision of meals for workers at
their place of work has become usual in large undertakings and quite common in
smaller ones. At the end of 1956 over 19,000 industrial premises were providing
their workers with canteen facilities. There were also some 1,000 colliery canteens
providing meals for about 98 per cent of coalminers. Any surplus earned by can¬
teens is used to improve the canteen or to finance some other welfare services.
Losses are borne by the firms.
Human Relations in Industry
In recent years there has been a considerable growth of interest in ‘human
relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between management and their workers as
individuals, as distinct from relations between organizations of employers and
organizations of workers. This has led to more widespread attention being given
to all aspects of personnel management and to the establishment of more personnel
departments. Practically every large industrial firm and many small ones now have
a personnel department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of
organization of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer is generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on the development of good
human and industrial relations. This officer also has particular duties with regard
to recruitment, selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the application
of wage agreements, the promotion of joint consultation and the supervision of
working conditions and employee services.
Since the end of the second world war, there has been an intensification of the
educational and training activities arranged by industry. Short-term training is
almost entirely the responsibility of individual firms, but in over 100 sections of
LABOUR
297
industry and commerce, employers and trade unions have agreed to establish
national or regional schemes of apprenticeship and other long-term training.
Both voluntary and official organizations have been concerned with the promo¬
tion of better human relationships in industry. The voluntary organizations include
bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to subscribing
firms, professional associations linking individuals who have a common interest in
particular functions of management and administration, and bodies which provide
specialist services usually on a fee-paying basis.
In 1945, the Ministry of Labour and National Service established a Personnel
Management Advisory Service which has done much to promote good personnel
management and to assist firms by discussing problems of personnel policy. The
service is staffed by a team of experienced Personnel Officers recruited from
industry.
In March 1953, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the
Medical Research Council set up two committees which are concerned with
research into the human factor in industry. They are known respectively as the
Committee on Human Relations in Industry and the Committee on Individual
Efficiency in Industry.
The Committee on Human Relations has approved a number of projects for
research into factors influencing the effectiveness of incentive payment schemes,
factors facilitating and restricting the introduction of new techniques and methods
in industry, characteristics of management organization affecting productivity,
industrial education, training and promotion, and the problems of the effective
employment in industry of special groups such as older persons and married
women.
The Committee on Individual Efficiency has concerned itself with research into
such matters as the influence of equipment and tool design on operator efficiency,
factors affecting the efficient utilization of industrial engineering techniques, and
training methods in industry.
The results of the work sponsored by these two committees are now appearing.
The committees themselves are shortly to be replaced by new machinery to be set
up by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical
Research Council.
VIII. FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (i.e. the central
Government and local authorities) finance their activities how their expenditure
is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Moneys administered by public authorities1 2 can be roughly divided into two
categories:
1. The moneys of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but
also in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer" in
accordance with the proposals of the Government, as approved by Parlia¬
ment (principally the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central Govern¬
ment Departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts which
do not come from the Exchequer. The only important one is the National
Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions and National
Insurance, used for the payment of benefits under the National Insurance
Scheme (see pp. 347-5°)-
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes on
dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property and trading
receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer, and partly from
loans raised in the open market.
The following broad account of Government finance will be concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government3 and other public
funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the principle
that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was gradually evolved.
The principle was established, at the end of the constitutional struggles of the
Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the King
was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free to spend it as he
chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Flouse of Commons graduall}
developed the modern system of controlling expenditure through the device of
Appropriation, which was embodied in its final form in the Exchequer and Audit
Departments Act, 1866.
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that of the
United Kingdom, see pp. 305 and 308. ,
2 The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in t e
twelfth century.
3 For further information on local government finance, see pp. 70-72.
298
FINANCE
299
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such financial
control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of Commons.
This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seventeenth century, but
as regards expenditure it was not effective until the nineteenth century. The con¬
trolling power of the House of Commons is acknowledged today in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of a new session of Parliament, which is addressed to
both Houses but contains a special paragraph addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to
modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus, to mini¬
mize the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of embodying the main
financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill. Since the passing of the
Parliament Act, 1911, however, the assent of the House of Lords is no longer needed
for a Bill certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill (see pp. 32 and 33-34).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all expen¬
diture by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue by taxation
or borrowing. All Government revenue is paid into the Government account with
the Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated Fund.
With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously stated, being National In¬
surance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and revenue
are authorized and controlled, the purposes on which public money is spent and the
sources from which revenue is obtained.
ESTIMATES AND EXPENDITURE
Classification of Expenditure
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorized by Act of Parliament without
limitation to any particular year. This expenditure includes the interest,
sinking fund and cost of management of the National Debt, the financial
provision made for members of the Royal Family, and salaries and pensions
of judges and certain high officers whose independence of the Government
is thought to be better guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote.
These Consolidated Fund Services represent a permanent charge on the
Consolidated Fund.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorized from year to year
and which includes all expenditure on defence, on the social services and on
the general administration of the country. These are called Supply Services
because the House of Commons, when voting money, is granting to the
Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . . the pecuniary
necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that some of this expen¬
diture may also depend on legislation, such as the National Health Service
Acts, relating to a specific object of expenditure.
Authorization of Expenditure
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of Com¬
mons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House with the
Chairman of Committees, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair). The Committee
usually discusses public policy relevant to the Estimates, though any Estimate could
be examined in detail if members wished and if time allowed (see also p. 36).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on xst April are
submitted to the Treasury by each Department in the preceding November and
300
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’
which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in the
Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes. Inside each
Vote, a ‘virement’, the spending of money on one subhead instead of on another,
is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they please
subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An excess of expenditure, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or a virement
of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be brought to
the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate. The Treasury
exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Expenditure
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, by the Select Committee on Public Accounts of the House of
Commons and by the Select Committee on Estimates.
The Treasury
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the responsibility
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the House
of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by Departments, the Treasury
has to weigh the advantages of administrative proposals against the monetary and
economic cost, taking into account current Government policy, to decide the rela¬
tive merits of expenditure proposed by different Departments and to eliminate any
overlapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of
departmental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates of pay and
the aggregate size of the staff in all Government Departments, in addition to exer¬
cising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure. The Treasury also
lays down general rules of financial and accounting procedure for Departments and
prescribes the principles on which departmental contracts shall be made and the
limits within which losses may be written off.
The Comptroller and Auditor General
Control over issues of money to Departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent appoint¬
ment as an officer of Parliament. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comp¬
troller of the Exchequer he controls entries and issues of public money to and from
the Exchequer Account, and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts
and submits the Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. His statutory function is
to ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made
which go beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has
been obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged
by successive Committees on Public Accounts (see the next paragraph) to examine
departmental expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any cases of apparent
waste or extravagance.
The Select Committee on Public Accounts
The accounts of each Department and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor
General thereon are considered by the Select Committee on Public Accounts (PAC).
FINANCE
301
This was set up in 1861, by Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expen¬
diture was properly incurred in accordance with the Estimates and with any rele¬
vant Acts of Parliament, but it has since developed much wider powers. Nowadays
it may consider whether full value has been obtained for the sums spent by Depart¬
ments and it examines cases in which the administration appears to have been
faulty or negligent. The Committee has therefore become a powerful instrument
for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It embodies its findings in Reports which
may be discussed in the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered
by the Treasury in consultation with Departments and put into effect, so far as
they are accepted, according to Treasury instructions. If the recommendations are
not acceptable, a reasoned reply has to be submitted to the Committee, which may
either accept the objections or return to the charge in subsequent Reports.
Select Committee on Estimates
This Committee was originally set up in 1912 but was re-formed in 1929 with
wider terms of reference. Under these terms it has been re-appointed annually
except during the war years. The Committee’s functions are to examine the Esti¬
mates, to suggest the form in which they should be presented, and to report
whether there are any economies which could be made without altering the policy
implied in the Estimates. It is customary for the Committee to select each year a
few aspects of Government-voted services for review. In practice, the Estimates for
the current year are not affected, but the Committee’s recommendations may rein¬
force Treasury control and influence the nature of expenditure in succeeding years.
THE BUDGET
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The use
of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘ The Chancellor of the
Exchequer opened his Budget’, which was applied in Parliament to the annual
speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals for balancing
revenue and expenditure.
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the financial
state of the nation, and its formal basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising
money by taxation. By the time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the
Estimates of expenditure under various headings will have been presented to Parlia¬
ment and published, and the expected total of Government expenditure for the
year will be known. The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis
of existing taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as will provide whatever
surplus or deficit he considers desirable on economic grounds. These proposals are
later embodied in detail in a Finance Bill.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to certain payments of a capital
nature for which the Government has statutory power to borrow and which are
therefore excluded from the Budget expenditure met from revenue. These items
and others are set out in the part of the Budget which lies ‘ below the line’d
Budget Policy
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money for
Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated that
taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the level of
expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it came to be realized
1Items ‘below the line’ are: (1) receipts applicable by statute to debt interest which
would otherwise be paid out of revenue; (2) receipts applicable to debt redemption; and
(3) payments for which the Treasury has power to borrow.
302
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore the general
level of economic activity. Since the second world war, Budgets have been con¬
sciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring the total demand for goods
and services into balance with the supplies which could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the proportion of a
high income taken in tax being much greater than the proportion of a small one;
at the same time, the services provided by the Government (whether in cash or
kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth, but in some cases they are
specially designed to benefit people with lower incomes. Indirect, or outlay taxes
(see p. 304) do not affect the distribution of income; their main purpose has always
been the raising of revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of
particular goods they can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the
pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the total
demand for goods and services, in the following way: if there is an increase in
Government expenditure without an increase in taxation then total demand for
goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will happen if there is a decrease
in taxation without a decrease in Government spending. In this way the Budget
can be used to counter unemployment. On the other hand, if there is an increase
in taxation without an increase in Government expenditure or a decrease in Govern¬
ment expenditure without a decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods
and services w^ill tend to fall. In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation.
For some years after the war, budgetary policy was mainly designed to avoid
inflation by holding down consumer demand for goods and services so that it would
not hamper exports, investment or (since 1950) the defence programme. The
Budgets of 1951 and 1952 aimed also to hold down investment in the interests of
exports and defence. By 1953, however, as total demand had fallen while productive
capacity had increased, some unused resources became available; in consequence,
there was a reduction of taxation in the 1953 Budget, which aimed particularly at
encouraging higher investment and production. These aims were continued in the
1954 Budget, when, however, changes in taxation were much smaller than in 1953.
The Budget of April 1955, which gave further tax reliefs, was followed in October
by a Supplementary Budget which had the purpose of reinforcing measures,
including a tighter credit policy, instituted earlier in the year with the object of
curtailing excessive internal demand and of strengthening the balance of payments
position. The Budget of April 1956 was designed to continue the drive against
over-spending and to provide new inducements to savers. During 1956, as a result
of budgetary and other measures, inflationary pressure was reduced and the balance
of payments improved; consequently, in the Budget of 1957, it was possible to
make some reductions in the burden of taxation. These included income tax relief
on higher earned incomes and increased child allowances for older children, and
concessions in entertainments duty, petrol duty, purchase tax, and taxation of
United Kingdom corporations trading overseas.
Sources of Revenue
Money to meet ‘ Ordinary ’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the central
Government is in normal years derived from taxation. Taxes can be divided into
two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond roughly to the duties collected
by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Customs and Excise Department. The
most important Inland Revenue duties—income tax (including surtax), profits tax
and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly on the income or property of those
FINANCE
303
who, in general, have to bear them. Income tax on individual (though not on cor¬
porate) incomes and estate duty are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and
estates bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. Stamp duties, although not
a direct tax, are also collected by the Board of Inland Revenue. Taxes on motor
vehicles are collected by local taxation authorities, which are the county or county
borough councils in England and Wales and the corresponding councils in Scot¬
land; the proceeds are paid by the local authorities to the Exchequer.

income tax and not for surtax. ... , . > ^ j
(c) Age Exemption. Where the taxpayer is over 65 and his total income does not exceed

Income Tax, Surtax, and Profits Tax . .
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. For 1957-58 the standard rate is 8s. fid. in the £. I he tax imposed on
an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances, by reduced rates of
tax on the first sections of taxable income, and by the surtax. In the case of a
married couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated and are treated as
one income, but a higher personal allowance is given than for a single person.
3°4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Examples of the amounts of income tax paid yearly by people with different
incomes and family responsibilities are shown in Table 30, p. 303.
Most wages and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘ Pay-as-you-
earn ) Scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling them to keep
up to date in tax payments.
Companies are liable at the standard rate of tax on their total income irrespective
of its amount; they are also subject to profits tax of 30 per cent on profits distri¬
buted as dividends, and of 3 per cent on undistributed profits.
In general, income arising from sources within the United Kingdom is subject
to United Kingdom income tax, even though the person entitled to the income is
not resident in the United Kingdom, except in the case of certain United Kingdom
Government securities. Where the income arises from sources outside the United
Kingdom, tax is not chargeable unless the owner becomes chargeable as a resident.
The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries providing
for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are not in force, the United
Kingdom allows unilateral relief.1
Estate Duty
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether settled or not) which
passes or is deemed to pass at death. Estates with a net capital value of £3,000 or
less are exempt from duty, but on estates of a higher value there is a progressive
duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
Indirect Taxes
Most indirect or outlay taxes are Customs and Excise duties and are levied on
commodities or services. They are called indirect because the importer, manufac¬
turer, wholesaler, or provider of commodities or services pays them first and then
passes them on to the individual consumer in the form of higher retail prices.
Customs duties are levied on imported goods, and excise duties on goods pro¬
duced, and services provided, at home. The purchase tax, which is also collected
by the Customs and Excise Department, applies equally to home-produced and
to imported goods.
The system of customs duties is twofold in its purpose: it has the function of
providing a measure of protection for British industries or preference for products
imported from Commonwealth countries (see pp. 323-4) and it has also the function,
in association with the excise system, of providing revenue.
The principal revenue duties collected by the Customs and Excise Department
are those on tobacco, alcoholic drinks, hydrocarbon oil (mainly petrol), entertain¬
ments (cinemas), betting, matches and sugar. The protective customs duties cover
a wider field, but their total contribution to the yield of indirect taxation is relatively
small.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them consumer
goods, at rates varying from 5 per cent to 90 per cent of the wholesale value. The
tax applies to imported goods at the same rate as to those produced in the United
Kingdom. Articles subject to revenue duties of the Customs and Excise Depart¬
ment are in general exempt from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax include
food, fuel, books and newspapers, young children’s clothing and household textile
articles.

THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS, 1957-58
In the Budget of April 1957, total current expenditure for the financial year
ended 31st March, 1958, was estimated to reach £4,827 million, while the estimate
for total current revenue (after allowing for taxation changes) was £5,289 million,
making a surplus of £462 million. These figures exclude self-balancing revenue and
expenditure (almost entirely post office trading), for which the estimate was £308
million. ‘Below the line’ total payments (see p. 301) were estimated at £854
million, while total receipts were estimated at £267 million leaving a deficit, to be
met by borrowing, of £587 million. ...
Table 31, p. 306 shows the Budget estimates for I957-58 in comparison with,
the out-turn (Exchequer receipts and issues) for the previous year. The diagram
on p. 307 illustrates the pattern of Government estimates of revenue and expendi¬
ture on current account in i957~58-
CAPITAL PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS
In the last few years the main items of capital expenditure dealt with in the part of
the Budget statement which lies ‘ below the line have been loans to local authorities
for housing and other investment; funds to meet capital expenditure by the Post
Office; war damage payments; working capital for the National Coal Board, and
loans to other nationalized industries. Capital receipts have come mainly from the
repayment of these loans. If, on balance, there is a deficit, it is met from the pro¬
ceeds of Government borrowing or from the surplus, if any, in ‘ Ordinary’ revenue
and expenditure, i.e. ‘above the line’, while if there is a surplus it goes to reduce
the National Debt.
Since the war, new lending by the Government has exceeded loan repayment, as
in the main, repayments are spread over a long term. From 1945 to the end of
1952 local authorities relied on the Exchequer for virtually all their loans. As
from 1 st January, 1953, they were given permission to borrow on the open market.
In his Budget Statement of October i955> the Chancellor of the Excheque,
announced that local authorities had been asked to exercise restraint in their
expenditure. The volume of Government lending to them would be restricted and
the Public M^orks Loan Board (see p. 71) would put all applicants on inquiry as
to their ability to raise the finance on their own credit either in the stock market
or in the mortgage market’. Any advances granted would be at a rate of interest
‘reflecting not Government credit, but the credit of local authorities of good
standing in the market for loans of comparable periods ’.
The National Debt
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million in
1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7>I3I million
in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March, 1957, the total National
Debt was £27,005 million, of which £2,065 million was repayable in currencies
other than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the
£24,940 million of internal debt, about £4,835 million was short-term debt, mainly
in the form of 91-day bills on the Treasury, while the long-term loans included a
variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest
(ranging from 2 J to 5 per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.

similar to that operating in Great Britain, under which public revenues, with a few

minor exceptions, are paid into the Exchequer, from which no money can be with¬
drawn except on the authority of Parliament. That authority, as in Great Britain, is
expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund charges in permanent legislative form,
and in the case of Supply Services by annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates
prepared by Departments and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of the taxation in Northern Ireland, comprising customs and
excise duties, purchase tax, income tax and surtax and profits tax, is levied and
collected by the United Kingdom Government and the proceeds are paid in the
first instance into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From this portion, known as
‘ Reserved ’ Revenue, there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom Treas¬
ury, under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the sum contributed by Northern
Ireland towards Imperial Services (called the ‘ Imperial Contribution’), the cost of
the administration of the Supreme Court, the Post Office, and other Reserved Ser¬
vices, and the cost of collecting Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the ‘Resi¬
duary Share of Reserved Taxes ’, is paid over to the Exchequer of Northern Ireland
and joins with the proceeds of taxes levied and collected by the Government of
Northern Ireland, called ‘Transferred’ Revenue, and with other non-tax receipts
of a miscellaneous nature to form the public income. The items of Transferred
Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties, betting duty, entertainments duty
(cinemas), excise licence duties and motor vehicle duties.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
constituted in accordance with the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, determines
the amount of Reserved Revenue and the cost of Reserved Services attributable to
Northern Ireland for each year, the amount of the Imperial Contribution and such
other questions affecting the financial relations of the two Governments as may be
referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1957-58 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £97'6 million and expenditure at £87 million. After
allowing for a small Budget surplus of £44,500, the Imperial Contribution was
provisionally estimated at £10-5 million.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £67 million at 31st March, 1957,
is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held by the Ministry of
Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have been
established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific pur¬
poses. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal
being those relating to National Insurance and Government loans. The latter con¬
stitutes a pool of capital funds available for local and public authority borrowings;
at 31st March, 1957, a sum of approximately £67-5 million was outstanding against
such authorities.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It consists of
a Central Bank; of Commercial Banks which carry on the usual main banking
services; of the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main business is in
other countries; and of various specialized banks and similar financial institutions.
The Bank of England
The Bank of England is the Central Bank and its principal business is to act as
banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the Government
for important financial operations and as the central note-issuing authority; it also
FINANCE
3°9
maintains relations with central banks overseas. It was established in 1694 by Act
of Parliament as a corporate body, and its entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act, 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England acts in conjunction with other banks
and financial institutions in co-ordinating the application of the Government’s
monetary policy. One of the main instruments for this purpose is the Bank Rate1—
the minimum rate at which the Bank of England will discount approved bills of
exchange.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main Government
accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and registration of
Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the administration of exchange
control which has been in force since 1939 (see p. 325).
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England and
these balances form part of the bankers’ cash reserves.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities, the part
covered by the latter being the ‘Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to
parliamentary control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Depart¬
ment of the Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign
exchange) reserves being in a separate account, known as the Exchange Equaliza¬
tion Account, originally established in 1932, for the purpose of checking undue
fluctuation in the exchange value of sterling. The provision of coin for circulation
is the responsibility of a Government Department, the Royal Mint.
The Commercial Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the
United Kingdom are, in the main, limited liability companies which are subject to
the ordinary law relating to such companies.
Some of the main distinguishing features of the United Kingdom commercial
banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
Domestic banking members of the British Bankers’ Association number 25,
including 6 in Scotland, and 3 in Northern Ireland; these banks control
nearly 12,500 branches and have total assets of over £8,000 million.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp duty
of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small payments
—are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques, drafts, bills and
bankers’ effects cleared in 1956 through the London and Provincial Clear¬
ing Houses was £532 million; and many cheques do not, for various
reasons, pass through Clearing Houses.
3. It is the practice of the chief United Kingdom banks to maintain a ratio of
about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which about
two-thirds are repayable on demand, the remainder being deposits at
interest and subject to notice).
On an average, in 1956, about 35 per cent of the banks’ deposits were
covered by cash and short-term securities, while longer-term securities
amounted to about 32 per cent and advances to customers to about 30
per cent of total deposits. It is not the practice of British banks to partici¬
pate directly in industry, the financing of which is, as far as they are
concerned, normally limited to short-term advances.
1 On 19th September, 1957, the Bank Rate was raised from 5 per cent to 7 Per cent.
3io
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited rights
to issue notes; these issues must, apart from an amount for each bank which
is specified by legislation, be fully covered by Bank of England notes and

The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main business
is in the Commonwealth and other countries to maintain London offices; in some
cases, indeed, the institutions concerned are United Kingdom companies and the
London office is the head office. These London offices form part of the complex
structure engaged in the financing of trade not only between the United Kingdom
and other countries but also in goods which are shipped direct between other
countries.
Savings Banks and the National Savings Movement
The function of Trustee and Post Office Savings Banks is to provide facilities for
the investment of voluntary savings and particularly of the small savings of persons
with low incomes. Both these types of banks were well established during the
nineteenth century. The growth of their business was, however, encouraged in the
first world war when the War Savings Committee was set up under Government
auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type of long-term security for
the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was the National Savings
Certificate, with interest payable only on encashment, but free of income tax. From
this war-time drive originated the present National Savings Movement devoted to
the encouragement of the widespread investment of savings in Trustee Savings
Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National Savings Certificates and
Defence Bonds. The policy of the movement is determined by the National Savings
Committee for England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and
Northern Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent persons represent¬
ing regional savings organizations and various national institutions connected with
such matters as finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a salaried
staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often assisted or pro¬
moted by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
In 1956, the Government introduced an additional type of savings security—Pre¬
mium Savings Bonds—which, after an initial period of six months and thereafter
monthly, give investors a chance to win a prize instead of receiving interest.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and managers,
and most of the funds deposited with them are ordinary deposits which are with¬
drawable on demand or at short notice. These deposits are invested with the
National Debt Commissioners, and the Government is responsible to the trustees
for the repayment of the money so invested with accrued interest as and when
required. In certain circumstances, Trustee Savings Banks also accept deposits of
up to £2,000 for special investment. These deposits, which may receive a slightly
higher rate of interest than ordinary deposits, are invested under the supervision
of the National Debt Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible to
the trustees for the repayment of these investments. In December 1956, there were
about 1,330 Trustee Offices controlled by 84 independent banks.
1 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration of
Ulster Savings, but the furtherance and organization of the savings movement in Northern
Ireland is the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is assisted by county and
local committees and district groups, all of a voluntary nature.
FINANCE
311
The Post Office Savings Bank is the largest organization of its kind in the world.
It has over 22 million active accounts; in December 1956, total balances, which
carry a Government guarantee, amounted to £1,687 million, about £73 Per deposi¬
tor. Through a centralized system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or
make a withdrawal at any one of some 20,000 post offices throughout the country.
To ensure that Savings Banks are used primarily by the small investor there is a
limit of £500 on the amount which may be deposited by any individual in one year,
and of £3,000 on the total balance which may be held by one individual in the
ordinary departments of Trustee Savings Banks and in the Post Office Savings
Bank. The maximum amount of National Savings Certificates which may be held
by any one person is £450 worth of the current (tenth) issue, in addition to holdings
of previous issues, and £500 worth of Premium Savings Bonds. The limit on
individual holdings of the current issue of Defence Bonds (4^ per cent) is £ 1,000,
this is in addition to holdings of previous issues.
Co-operative Banks
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in banking
was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act in 1876. The
primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to serve the
co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become, but the bank has
also come to include among its clients trade unions and other mutual societies, local
authorities and individual depositors.
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which are
supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly provided
through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, the Stock Exchange, Invest¬
ment Trusts, Building Societies and the Insurance Market. New issues, except for
certain small operations, are controlled by the Treasury with the advice of the
Capital Issues Committee (see p. 314).
The firms engaged in such activities are in the main highly specialized, e.g.,
discount houses, stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
Another type of financial institution, the merchant bank, has been of great import¬
ance in the finance of trade and commodity dealings and in the flotation of major
issues of bonds, particularly for overseas concerns and governments.
The merchant banks helped to give London an international reputation as the
main world centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long-term loans for
development purposes floated on the London market earned for Britain a con¬
tinuing flow of interest and attracted a steady flow of orders for British goods and
products. This increasing trade and also a large proportion of trade between foreign
countries was usually financed by bills of exchange, which were accepted as pay¬
able at maturity by the merchant banks (also known as accepting houses) and
were traded on the discount market, thus providing an easy method of transferring
debts and claims.
The Discount Market
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury bills and
other short-term securities.
x
312
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1 o the extent to which the various firms w^hich compose the Discount Market
have insufficient funds of their own to finance the bills and securities which they
wish to hold, they obtain loans from the banks and, to a lesser extent, deposits from
the public. In the main these loans and deposits may be called in at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the Discount
Market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held until they become
of a currency required by the banks.
If the banks call in loans which they have made to the Discount Market and the
latter is unable to cover its needs elsewhere, it will be forced to borrow from the
Bank of England. It is not the practice of the commercial banks themselves to
obtain direct loans from the Bank of England to augment their cash resources if
the need arises.
Finance Corporations
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in 1945 to
assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and development.
Although the Government displayed considerable interest in their formation, the
Corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies with no official repre¬
sentation on their boards and having no recourse to public funds. Another finance
corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited, was
established in 1953 to assist development projects in the Commonwealth. Among
other financial corporations of note are the Ship Mortgage Finance Company
Limited, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, Air Finance Limited,
the National Film Finance Corporation and the Estate Duties Investment Trust
Limited.
Finance Corporation for Industry Limited
The FCI wras formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of £200,000
and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major industries with a
view to promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase
of employment.
The Corporation has an authorized and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of £125
million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance companies,
30 per cent by trust companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of England. As at
the 31st March, 1957, the capital had been paid up to the extent of 2 per cent
(£500>000)> the liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital repre¬
senting security to the banks who provide the funds out of which the Corporation
makes its advances.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
e.g., steel, oil, chemicals, shipping, diesel engines, electrical components and
permanent prefabricated houses.
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited
The ICFC is smaller than the FCI and has as its main object the provision of
credit and finance by means of loan capital and share capital for industrial and com¬
mercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where the existing facilities
provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange are not readily or easily
available.
The authorized and issued share capital of the Corporation is £15 million which
is paid up as required; the Corporation can borrow up to a further £30 million and
FINANCE
313
can thus have a maximum of £45 million available. Although the Bank of England
has a token participation, the principal shareholders are the London Clearing
Banks and the Scottish Banks in proportion to their size; the loan capital is pro¬
vided by all the shareholders in the same ratio as their shareholdings.
The nature of the Corporation’s business is to provide finance in sums ranging
between >£5,000 and £200,000 for small and medium-sized concerns. It has a large
number of customers and has established branches in Birmingham, Leeds
Leicester, Manchester and Edinburgh.
Ship Mortgage Finance Company Limited
This company was formed in 1951, the capital being subscribed by the ship¬
building industry, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Its main
object is to assist in financing shipbuilding in the United Kingdom. In special
cases, loans in respect of existing ships built in the United Kingdom may be
considered.
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited
The primary function of this Corporation, which was established in 1928, is to
grant long-term loans against first mortgages on agricultural lands and buildings
in England and Wales. The share capital was subscribed by the Bank of England
and other banks, but the greater part of the funds is derived from public issues of
debentures, of which about £27 million is outstanding (see also p. 165).
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited
This Corporation, with share capital subscribed by Scottish banks, fulfils similar
functions in Scotland (see also p. 165).
Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited
This Company was established early in i953> It originated from the Conference
of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in December 1952 and its purpose is to finance
non-governmental development schemes in the British Commonwealth. The
authorized and issued capital of this company is £15 million, which is held by
the Bank of England and by a number of companies; £3-9 million of the capital
has been paid up. The Company is empowered to borrow up to twice its issued
capital (see also p. 337). At the end of March 1957, the Company had entered into
commitments totalling £14‘5 million.
Air Finance Limited
This Company was formed by a group of bankers and the FCI late in 1953 f°r
the purpose of financing aircraft exports. Its initial resources were £11 million (for
an account of the aircraft industry, see p. 214).
National Film Finance Corporation
The Corporation is a statutory body established under the Cinematograph Film
Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949- Its function is to make loans to film pro¬
ducers and distributors in order to help to finance the production of films (see also
P- 434)-
Estate Duties Investment Trust Limited
The Trust was established in 1953 to assist small family businesses to find the
finance to meet estate duties.
The Stock Exchanges
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the London
Stock Exchange is by far the most important.
3i4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stock or
shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer for his
securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new capital by
Government and commercial borrowers.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains are
made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and demand for the
securities concerned.
All the Stock Exchanges operate under strict rules of conduct which they formu¬
late themselves.
The Capital Issues Committee
Since 1932 there has been control to a greater or lesser degree over capital issues
in the United Kingdom. The 1932 controls, and such modifications as were made
up to 1939, were without a statutory basis but resulted from public requests by the
Chancellor which the various markets observed. At the outbreak of war in 1939 the
Foreign Transactions (Advisory) Committee, which had been set up in 1936 to
advise the Treasury on issues involving remittances to countries outside the Com¬
monwealth, was renamed the Capital Issues Committee and was given the wider
task of advising the Treasury on the administration of the statutory control of
capital issues (and analogous transactions) for which provision was made in
Regulation 6 of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, 1939.
The end of the war in 1945 saw the retention of the Capital Issues Committee
with its primary function unchanged; permanent provision for capital issues control
was made the following year with the passing of the Borrowing (Control and
Guarantees) Act, 1946.
The Committee is entirely independent; it consists of seven men of experience
in commerce, industry or finance, who consider applications to raise loans or issue
capital (except those which do not involve more than ;£ 10,000* in any one year for
the borrower concerned, or which, for certain other reasons, may be exempt) and
tender their advice to the Treasury upon them.
Investment Trusts
Investment trusts cater for the investor who does not wish or has not sufficient
resources to hold a large number of investments in his owm name but who desires
to have an interest in several securities as a means of spreading his risk.
The ordinary type of investment trust is a public company, limited in liability
and registered under the Companies Acts; investment trusts in this form have been
established in the United Kingdom for about a century. They invest their share
and their loan capital over a range of securities, the precise choice depending in
part on the objects of the particular company concerned.
Since 1931 there have also been ‘unit trusts’ in the United Kingdom; a trust of
this type is normally limited by its trust deed to a specified range of securities. The
original conception of the unit trust was that securities could be grouped in fixed
proportions to form units, and these units could be divided into sub-units which
could be sold to the public. In practice, while retaining this unit basis of investment,
many unit trusts have considerable flexibility in their choice of the underlying
securities.
Up to 13th March, 1956, this figure was £50,000.
FINANCE
315
The Insurance Market
The institutions providing insurance services fall into two main groups: the
insurance companies and Lloyd’s. Additional life assurance facilities are also pro¬
vided in the United Kingdom by certain Friendly Societies.
Insurance Companies
There are about 300 British insurance companies, the large companies of inter¬
national repute accounting with their subsidiaries for about a third of this total.
In addition, nearly 100 overseas companies carry on business (and even more com¬
panies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasizing the international
nature of the market. The natural centre of the market is in London, but some of
the large companies have their administrative headquarters elsewhere.
In 1955, the premium income of British insurance companies amounted to about
£1,080 million. The three non-life branches—fire, accident and marine—together
accounted for some £604 million. * Ordinary branch life assurance accounted for
£349 million and the balance of £127 million was represented by ‘industrial’ life
assurance (i.e. a system of assurance in which the contributions are collected by
house-to-house visits at intervals of less than two months).
The total assets of British insurance companies at the end of 1955 are estimated to
have been about £4,823 million. This included £1,223 million invested in British
Government and British Government guaranteed securities, £939 million invested in
debenture and loan stocks and preference and guaranteed stocks and shares, £736
million in ordinary stocks and shares, £109 million in municipal and public
boards’ securities, and £506 million in mortgages.
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. Although in its
earlier history the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine
insurance business, during the last sixty years there has also been built up at
Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market for the transaction of other classes
of insurance business, except life assurance of which the amount, transacted at
Lloyd’s is negligible. In addition to its insurance activities, Lloyd’s maintains a
world-wide organization for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence
(see p. 230).
The name ‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established
in the seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Lloyd s
coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business and of
intelligence about shipping movements. In 1871 Lloyd’s was incorporated by Act
of Parliament. . r t 1 •
The conduct of insurance business and the affairs of the Society of Lloyd s in
its corporate capacity are administered by the Committee of Lloyd s.
The interests of a holder of a Lloyd’s policy are safeguarded in the following
ways: (1) every Lloyd’s underwriter is liable for his underwriting debts to the full
extent of his means and is required to lodge security by way of a deposit with the
Committee of Lloyd’s; (2) the whole of the premiums received by an underwriter
must be placed in a trust fund to be used exclusively for the payment of his under¬
writing liabilities and expenses, and only ascertained profits can be released to the
underwriter and then only with the consent of the trustees; every underwriter must
submit his accounts to an annual audit.
The usual practice of underwriters today is to form themselves into groups
known as syndicates which generally specialize in particular branches of insurance.
The underwriters forming the syndicate appoint an agent who is empowered to
316
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
accept risks on their behalf and to control all matters concerned with the syndicate’s
business. If the insurance is for a relatively large amount, several syndicates may
participate, but each underwriter is individually liable only for the proportion of
the risk accepted on his behalf.
Underwriters may not accept business directly from the public, but must trans¬
act through Lloyd’s brokers (see below) in London, who must be connected with
Lloyd’s, either as members or subscribers.
The total premium income of Lloyd’s underwriters in 1956 after deduction of
brokerages, commissions, returns and reinsurance premiums was about £245
million, of which some £108 million was in respect of marine, aviation and transit
insurance.
Insurance Brokers
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf of
the insured, who are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable part of
the company market. Many brokers specialize in reinsurance business, acting as
intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between companies, both British and
overseas, and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
International Insurance Services
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business comes from
abroad, partly by direct placing in London and partly from branches and agencies
established in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business
is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for use
in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the assets of the
companies (aggregating over £4,800 million) in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and per¬
sonal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
Building Societies
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on the
security of private dwelling houses purchased for owner-occupation, though loans
are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial premises and
farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly from the general public
who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of share capital is not fixed but may
be regulated in accordance with the amount of mortgage business; shares are not
dealt with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The rapid expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few very
large societies. At the end of 1956, 773 societies were in operation, with total assets
of £2,235 million. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1956 was £339 million.
IX. TRADE
Although relatively small in area and population, the United Kingdom is one
of the world’s principal trading countries. It has acquired this position as a con¬
sequence of several factors. It was one of the earliest countries to remove legal and
fiscal restrictions on the internal movement of persons and goods, and the first to
develop adequate facilities for the movement of large quantities of goods by mechani¬
cal transport (canals, roads, railways and steamships). With its resources of coal and
iron, and its succession of mechanical inventions, Britain was also the first country
to industrialize on a large scale and to produce a wide variety of consumer goods in
large quantities. In addition, Britain evolved, over a long period of years, the
specialized financial services needed to facilitate the maximum volume of trade.
This chapter outlines some of the main features of Britain’s external trade,
balance of payments and internal trade. Some account of external trade and pay¬
ments is essential to an understanding of Britain’s economy but only a brief treat¬
ment of trade policy and commercial relations has seemed appropriate in a
Handbook devoted to the United Kingdom, its people and internal institutions.
EXTERNAL TRADE
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a position of pre-eminence in inter¬
national trade. At the end of the nineteenth century Britain’s share of exports of
manufactures entering into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of world
imports was somewhat larger than that of world exports, as imports into Britain
were paid for not only by exports of goods but by interest on overseas investments,
receipts from shipping and a variety of financial services. Even before 1914, how¬
ever this supremacy was being increasingly challenged by other nations, including
Germany and the United States, and although Britain’s imports and exports
increased in absolute terms over periods of years, its share of the world total
tended to decline. By 1937, Britain’s share in world exports of manufactures,
measured by value, had fallen to 22 per cent compared with 24 per cent in 1929
and 30 per cent in 1914. In the years immediately following the second world war,
Britain’s share rose again, and in 1950 was 25 per cent; but by 1956 the share had
declined once more, to about 19 per cent.
For over a century, Britain’s internal economy has been dependent on inter¬
national trade to an extent almost unparalleled by any other country. Britain relies
upon imports for half its total consumption of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw
materials needed by British industry. Its exports, chiefly manufactured goods,
absorb about a sixth of the gross national product.
In 1956, Britain was the world’s second largest exporter and importer. It was a
major supplier of machinery, ships, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, chemi¬
cals and textiles. Britain was also one of the world’s largest markets for foodstuffs,
metals, cotton, wool and petroleum.
PATTERN OF TRADE
Changes since 1938 in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution
of imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
3i7
3l8 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Value and Volume
Imports rose in value from £919 million in 1938 to £1,802 million in 1947 and
£3,889 million in 1956. The rise in value of exports was from £471 million in 1938
t° £1,142 million in 1947 and £3,172 million in 1956.
Calculations of changes in trade volume (i.e. changes after eliminating variations
due to price movements) compared with pre-war cannot be made with precision as
the relative values of different types of goods on which the volume figures are based
have changed considerably since 1938. Broadly speaking, however, by 1947, the
volume of imports was a quarter less than before the war and exports had regained
their pre-war volume. It has been estimated that the volume of imports in 1956
was only just about the 1938 figure, while the 1956 volume of exports approached
a level twice that of 1938. Statistics showing the value and volume of imports and
exports in 1938 and in post-war years are set out in Table 32.

(a) Silver bullion and all coin not of legal tender in the United Kingdom are excluded
from 1938 figures.
(b) ‘Cost-insurance-freight’, i.e. including shipping, insurance and other expenses
incurred in the delivery of goods as far as their place of importation in the United Kingdom.
Most of these expenses represented earnings by United Kingdom firms.
(c) ‘Free-on-board’, i.e. the cost of the goods to the purchaser abroad, all costs and
charges accruing up to the time of placing the goods on board the exporting vessel having
been paid by the seller.
(d) The ratio of import to export price index numbers: a rise indicates an adverse
movement.
(e) Approximate.
Some indication of the increased importance of exports in the national economy
is shown by the rise in the proportion of total national income derived from export
earnings—from 10-3 per cent in 1938 to 12-2 per cent in 1947 and 18-8 per cent in
1956. Over the same period, the rise in the proportion of expenditure on imports
to gross national expenditure was smaller—from 15-1 per cent in 1938 to 16-6 per
cent in 1947 and 19-5 per cent in 1956: this trend w'as caused mainly by the rise in
import prices relative to other prices.
The diagram on p. 319 shows the changes in the volume of imports and exports
from 1947-56.
TRADE
319
Commodity Composition
Changes in the commodity composition of trade are shown in the diagram on
p. 32°.
The most notable change in exports has been the increased importance of engin¬
eering products—e.g., motor vehicles, aircraft, machinery and electrical goods—
and the declining, though still considerable, share taken by the older staples such
as cotton textiles. In 1938, coal accounted for 7-9 per cent of United Kingdom
exports by value, textiles for 19-4 per cent and engineering products for 24-4 per
cent. By 1948, the percentages were 2-5 per cent, 18-4 per cent and 35-8 per cent
and, in 1956, 1-4 per cent, 9-3 per cent and 40-0 per cent. While coal exports have
been declining, exports of refined petroleum—2-9 per cent of total exports in
1956—have increased, particularly since 1951 as a result of the post-war refinery
development. Exports of chemicals—7 7 per cent of all United Kingdom exports
in 1956—have also increased greatly since the end of the war. Within the category
of engineering products, particularly notable gains have been made by road vehicles,
aircraft, and certain types of machinery and electrical goods.
Owing to the expansion of the output of domestic agriculture (by about one-half)
and of industry (by about 60 per cent) compared with 1938, Britain relies relatively
less than before the war on food imports, but needs a relatively larger supply of
imported raw materials. Whereas 47 per cent of total imports in 1938 consisted of
food, beverages and tobacco, the proportion in 1948 was only 42 per cent and,
in 1956, 37 per cent. On the other hand, the proportion for basic materials rose
from 26 per cent in 1938 to 31 per cent in 1948, but was reduced to 28 per cent in
1956. Imports of manufactures in 1956 represented 23 per cent of total imports,
a slightly higher proportion than in 1938. Imports of fuels rose from 5 per cent
in 1938 to 11 per cent in 1956, mainly on account of increased consumption of
petroleum products; increased imports of coal are also a factor.

Area Distribution
The area distribution of external trade in 1938 and 1947 in comparison with that
of 1956 is shown in the diagram on p. 320.
In 1938. imports from the dollar area represented 23 per cent of the total value
of Britain’s imports, but in 1947 their share had increased to 34 per cent. Mean¬
while, imports from non-sterling member countries of the Organization for Euro¬
pean Economic Co-operation (OEEC) and their overseas territories fell from 24
per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent in 1947 and those from the rest of the non-sterling
world declined from 22 per cent to 18 per cent. Imports from the sterling area
(see p. 330) in 1947 took the same share of the total as in 1938, i.e. 31 per cent.
By 1956, imports from the dollar area had fallen to 22 per cent as against 34 per
cent in 1947, and from the rest of the non-sterling world they had declined further,
to 14 per cent. The sterling area in the meantime increased its share to 39 per cent
in 1956 and OEEC countries regained their pre-war share of 24 per cent.
The share of exports taken by the dollar area in 1947 was a little below the 1938
level of about 11 per cent of the value of exports—but by 1956 their share had
increased to 16 per cent. Exports to the sterling area also rose from 45 percent of
the total in 1938 to 49 per cent in 1947, but fell back to 46 per cent in 1956, while
exports to member countries of the OEEC and their dependencies, after declining
from 25 per cent in 1938 to 23 per cent in 1947* increased to 27 per cent in 1956.
Exports to the rest of the world fell from 19 per cent of the total in 1938 to 18 per
cent in 1947 and 11 per cent in 1956.

million ounces of silver borrowed from the United States under war-time Lend-Lease
arrangements.
Re-Export Trade
Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they are
imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—e.g., simple blending,
husking, repacking—which leave them essentially unchanged. For some hundreds
of years Britain has been an important centre of re-export trade though, over the
past forty years, its importance relative to total United Kingdom export trade has
declined. The greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade has always been in
raw materials and foodstuffs, e.g., wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals and fur-
skins. Traditionally, re-export commodities are imported from Commonwealth
countries and re-exported to countries in Europe.
Tourist Trade
During the post-war years, the tourist trade has become an important source of
foreign currency earnings. In 1956, overseas visitors spent in the United Kingdom
the equivalent of £121 million, of which some £43 million was in dollar currency.
United Kingdom residents touring overseas spent £123 million in the same year.1
The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom in 1956 was 1,107,000,2 an
increase of 7 per cent compared with 1955, and well over twice the number of
those who came in 1937, the peak year before the war.
The British Travel and Holidays Association, which is a Government-sponsored
body, is concerned with the promotion of the tourist trade, particularly by
means of publicity overseas. The Association was formed in April 1950 by the
merger of the British Travel and Holidays Board and the Travel Association. Its
work is directed by a Board consisting of a chairman and 23 members. The Presi¬
dent of the Board of Trade appoints the chairman and eight members, the Council
of the Association elects seven members, the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland
Tourist Boards between them appoint four members and the Board itself has

2 This total excludes tourists (other than aliens) from the Irish Republic and foreign
visitors in transit to other destinations.
TRADE
323
power to co-opt four members to represent tourist interests not otherwise covered.
The Association runs a Tourist Information Centre (to which all correspondence
should be addressed) at 64-65 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.i, and has overseas
offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam
and Stockholm.
CONDUCT OF TRADE
It has been a major aim of successive United Kingdom Governments since the
second world war to work for the removal of restrictions on trade and payments,
to secure a reduction of impediments to exports and, when possible, to restore the
convertibility of sterling. To this end, Britain has taken a leading part in the setting
up of such organizations as the International Monetary Fund, the General Agree¬
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Organization for European Economic
Co-operation (OEEC) and the European Payments Union (EPU), and has played
a major part in these organizations’ activities, especially as regards the freeing of
trade from restrictions which grew up in the war and post-war periods.
In addition to substantial reductions in tariffs on imported goods carried out
through the GATT (see p. 324), the United Kingdom has greatly relaxed its quota
restrictions on imports and has modified its exchange restrictions on foreign curren¬
cies. By mid-1957, nearly all its imports from the sterling area, 94 per cent of
those from OEEC member countries and over 50 per cent from dollar countries
had been freed from quantitative restrictions.
The current trade and payments policy of the United Kingdom and the sterling
area Commonwealth countries has been worked out at a series of conferences.
There are three main objectives: (1) the maintenance of a strong balance of pay¬
ments position and the strengthening of the reserves; (2) sound internal policies
on which ‘ depend the purchasing power of money, the cost of living and the ability
to sell exports in increasingly competitive markets ’; and (3) the development of
resources, with particular emphasis ‘on the development of those resources which
directly or indirectly contribute on an economic basis towards improving the
balance of payments of the sterling area’. In the matter of financing development,
the United Kingdom has undertaken to make a special effort in the knowledge that
this, added to other overseas commitments, including military expenditure and
debt repayments, requires an increase in current account earnings.
Tariff Policy
In the nineteenth century the United Kingdom became strongly attached to the
principles of free trade, and at the beginning of the twentieth century the only
customs duties were those imposed, solely for revenue purposes, on a small range
of products. After the first world war, certain key industries notably optical and
scientific instruments and fine chemicals, were given protection for strategic reasons
under an Act passed in 1921. It was not until 1932, however, that any serious de¬
parture was made from the principles of free trade. Under the Import Duties Act
of that year, the United Kingdom imposed a duty of to per cent ad valorem on all
imported goods except those on a Free List (mainly important raw materials and
foodstuffs) and set up machinery for the imposition of additional duties and for
additions to be made to the Free List where appropriate. This measure provided
a degree of protection to British industry and a basis for negotiations with foreign
countries already in possession of a tariff structure.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United King¬
dom customs tariffs in 1919 and, as a result of the Ottawa Conference in 1932,
324
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
agreements were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries providing
for reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of Commonwealth
goods. The Import Duties Act had already permitted the duty-free entry of goods
from the United Kingdom dependencies.
A series of bilateral trade negotiations with other countries between 1932 and
1939 resulted in some modification in the level of protection and in the Common¬
wealth preferences which had been established. During the second world war,
because of Government purchase and import control, protection by the tariff was
of relatively minor importance, and it was only with the substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls from 1949 that the tariff again became an effective
instrument of protection.
Since the war, the United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably
modified as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under the
auspices of the GATT, which permits the retention of existing tariff preferences,
but prohibits the creation of new preferences. The United Kingdom has, however,
obtained certain limited waivers from the GATT no-new-preference rule; these
permit, under certain conditions, increased tariff protection for United Kingdom
industries while preserving duty-free commitments for Commonwealth goods, and
allow increased preferences for the benefit of Colonial products whose disposal is
wholly or mainly dependent on the United Kingdom market. In the negotiations
under the GATT, many United Kingdom customs duties have been reduced, or
bound against increase, in return for concessions by other countries. Margins of
preference have thereby been reduced in some instances, but only in return for
compensating tariff concessions by other countries, and only after consultation
with all the Commonwealth countries concerned.
The United Kingdom Government has put forward proposals under which the
six countries which in March 1957 signed the Treaty establishing the European
Economic Community, together with the United Kingdom and other members of
OEEC, would be associated in a Free Trade Area in Europe. Negotiating machinery
for this purpose has been set up by OEEC. Under the British proposals, protec¬
tive tariffs and other barriers to trade affecting industrial products, but not agri¬
cultural products and foodstuffs, would be progressively reduced.
In April 1957, the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act entered into
force. It empowers the Board of Trade to impose duties on imported goods of any
description which have been dumped or subsidized.
Private and State Trading
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry,
the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export trade, espe¬
cially of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through export merchants
in the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to importers and consumers
abroad through their own agents or resident representatives in the countries con¬
cerned; in other cases, sales are made through a firm’s own branch office, distri¬
buting organization or subsidiary sales company established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or domestic
trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may find it more
convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export houses, commis¬
sion agents, and the representatives of overseas firms.
In the immediate post-war years nearly all the principal imported foods and raw
materials and some other goods were bought wholly or mainly on Government
TRADE
325
account, and the Government was also the sole purchaser of nearly all domestically
produced food and certain raw materials such as flax and timber. By IQS1* a con¬
siderable number of major commodities including wool, rubber, tin, woodpulp,
hardwoods, hides and skins, flax and leather, had been restored to private trade.
Since 1951 the changeover from state trading to private trading has proceeded
rapidly. Government monopoly overseas purchasing, which was responsible for
about half of the United Kingdom’s total imports in 1951 (about two-thirds of
food imports and about one-quarter of raw materials) was, by i954> confined to
two foodstuffs—raw sugar and bacon—and one industrial commodity—jute goods.
These three items accounted for only about 5 percent of total imports in 1954- In
1956, under the provisions of the Sugar Act, a Sugar Board was set up to buy
sugar at fixed prices under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, and sell that
sugar on commercial terms. On 1st January, 1957, trade in sugar reverted from
Government to private account. In October 1956, bacon imports were also returned
to private trade.
CONTROLS ON TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Concurrently with the process of reversion from public to private trading,
import licensing restrictions have been substantially eased, so that for most of the
principal foodstuffs and raw materials no limit is now imposed on the quantity or
value of imports from any country; for balance of payments reasons, imports from
certain areas have not as yet shared fully in the relaxation of controls.
The principal quantitative controls still in operation on external trade are (1)
currency exchange control, and (2) import and export licensing.
Exchange Control
Exchange control, i.e. control over the purchase and sale of gold and foreign
currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in September 1939. The legal
basis was at first the Defence (Finance) Regulations issued under the Emergency
Powers (Defence) Acts, but in 1947 most of these temporary war-time powers were
embodied in permanent legislation in the Exchange Control Act, 1947-
Exchange control does not affect transactions wholly within the sterling area. It
is imposed only on (1) transactions between residents within the sterling area and
residents outside, and (2) transactions conducted in sterling between persons resi¬
dent outside the sterling area. Although the main structure of exchange control has
continued intact since 1939, relaxations in its operation have been made in recent
years.
In March 1954, the facility which certain countries possessing transferable
accounts have enjoyed of settling current transactions between each other as well
as with sterling area countries—in sterling was extended to virtually all non-dollar
countries. The facility now applies to capital as well as to current transactions.
There are no restrictions on the amounts of sterling that United Kingdom
tourists visiting sterling area countries may take with them. For visits to non¬
sterling countries, including the dollar area, United Kingdom tourists are entitled
to take a basic foreign currency allowance of £100 per twelve-month period. Special
arrangements apply to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe
Islands: United Kingdom tourists visiting these countries are allowed all reasonable
amounts of currency.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of the
administration is in practice carried out by the Bank of England as agent of the
Treasury—and in turn the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks
a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
326
Import and Export Control
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers the
Board of Trade to make Orders prohibiting or regulating the import or export of
goods. The powers of both import and export control derive from the same legis¬
lation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
Import Licensing
Although goods can be imported into the United Kingdom only under licences
issued by the Board of Trade, an importer does not have to apply for a licence every
time he wishes to import anything. A large number of goods can be imported under
the Open General Licence, which authorizes any person in the United Kingdom to
import a wide range of specified commodities without any limits of quantity or
value, either from anywhere in the world or from specified countries or groups of
countries. Similarly, for a number of goods, individual traders are granted Open
Individual Licences, which allow them to import unlimited amounts of the goods
from any country or from specified countries or groups of countries.
When an importer wishes to bring in goods not covered by the unrestrictive
Open Licensing arrangements, the Board of Trade decides whether he should be
granted a licence to import a limited value of the goods in accordance with one of
three basic methods of determining who should be allowed to import goods and
in what quantities. These methods are:
(1) ad hoc consideration of applications for licences;
(2) apportionment of quotas among importers; and
(3) apportionment of quotas among exporters to the United Kingdom by
arrangement with the Governments of the exporting countries concerned.
The choice of method depends on the circumstances of the particular trade under
consideration.
Import and exchange control are closely linked. All holders of import licences
and anybody who wishes to import goods admissible under the Open General
Licence are granted the currency required to pay for their imports.
Export Controls
For the most part, United Kingdom exports are not subject to any Government
control or direction. Such controls as are in operation are imposed for the following
reasons:
(1) to control goods of strategic importance;
(2) to conserve or regulate the distribution of scarce materials;
(3) to assist exchange control operations in preventing exports of capital in
the form of valuable goods (e.g., diamonds);
(4) to control the re-export of materials purchased with dollars;
(5) to control the export of goods the prices of which have been subsidized
for consumption in the home market; and
(6) to prevent the export of works of art of national importance.
The operation of export licensing control is such that goods are freely exportable
to all destinations unless there is a specific ban on their export without licence.
Normally, individual licences are required for specific consignments of goods sub¬
ject to export licensing control, but in a few cases Open General Licences are
issued. In other cases, bulk licences are issued to permit exports of specified
quantities of controlled goods within a given period.
In recent years, export controls have been greatly reduced, and now cover only
a small proportion of total shipments. The position is continually under review
TRADE
327
and relaxations in control are made whenever circumstances permit. Following
improvements in the supply position, the majority of goods now subject to control
are of strategic importance. Certain of these strategic goods may be exported with¬
out licence to the Commonwealth (other than Hong Kong), the Irish Republic and
the United States of America, but exports of such goods to other destinations are
subject to export licensing control.
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO OVERSEAS TRADE
The United Kingdom Government does not subsidize exports. For the most
part, too, it does not subject British exports to Government control or direction.
Encouragement is, however, given to manufacturers and merchants by way of
exhortation and advice and by the provision of information and credit insurance
facilities. In addition, the Government, in its general economic policy, seeks to
create conditions in which export trade can flourish. This involves (1) the imposition
of fiscal, credit and other measures to damp down excessive internal demand for
goods and services, so as to release resources for export industries; and (2) action
internally and through international negotiation to reduce barriers to the free flow
of trade and to move towards a freer system of trade and payments.
Information and Advice to Exporters
The United Kingdom Government provides a service of information and advice
to merchants and manufacturers in the export trade.1 T he Government Department
most concerned is the Board of Trade, which calls upon the assistance of overseas
representatives. At each Embassy or Uegation there is always an officei of high
rank, a Minister, Counsellor or First Secretary (Commercial), who specializes in
commercial matters. These officers direct the commercial activities of Consular
officers in their respective territories.
At important centres in the Commonwealth there are Trade Commissioners, who
are directly responsible to the Board of Trade.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions,
pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and generally
assist the exporter to overcome the difficulties he encounters in trade with the
country in question, particularly those arising out of governmental regulations.
These officers indicate potential demand for United Kingdom products, advise
about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass on all oppor¬
tunities for export business and inquiries for United Kingdom goods. Assistance
is also given to United Kingdom exporters in finding agents and likely importers.
From the records the Department keeps in London, brought up to date by reports
from its overseas officers, it can provide information concerning any country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) goods most likely to sell;
(5) local tastes and preferences in design; and
(6) the probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates
entering into business relations.
1 In Scotland and Northern Ireland, export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish
Council (Development and Industry), and the Northern Ireland Development Council,
see p. 140.

Export Credit Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department is a Government agency run on
commercial lines to provide insurance for United Kingdom exporters and mer¬
chants against the main risks of financial loss incurred in overseas trading. These
facilities have been developed over a period of more than thirty years, and the
Department now underwrites some £500 million worth of insurance a year, for
more than 4,000 policy holders. The Department is obliged to conduct its business
on a self-supporting basis, taking one year with another, and cannot therefore be
regarded in any way as a provider of subsidies to exporters.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, action
by the buyer’s Government which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom, imposition of new import licensing restrictions in the buyer’s
country, war between the buyer’s country and the United Kingdom, cancellation
or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence, or ‘ any other cause of loss
occurring outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the exporter
or the buyer, and not normally insurable with commercial insurers’. Cover may
commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date of
shipment.
There are three main types of export insurance policy:
1. Short-term policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to six
months’ credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the whole
of his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve months covered
by his policy. For certain engineering goods this type of cover is extended
to goods sold on maximum credit terms of up to two years. Cover is also
available for goods of foreign origin sold by a United Kingdom merchant
to third countries, provided this trade does not conflict with direct United
Kingdom exports.
2. Medium-term policies which cover capital and other goods sold on credit
terms exceeding two years. Specific policies are negotiated for each indi¬
vidual contract.
3. Dollar market policies for North America and the Dollar Account countries
of Central and South America. The policies listed above cover risks affecting
payments under a contract of sale: the dollar market policies are designed to
reduce to manageable size the special risks of loss in breaking into these
markets. The exporter insures against a percentage of the loss which may
result if market surveys, advertising or sales promotion campaigns, or
stockholding, do not produce sufficient revenue to defray their cost. A
similar but more extensive form of insurance is provided by ‘Joint Venture ’
policies.
In the case of all the Department’s policies, the exporter or merchant is required
to retain an interest in the debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are
given up to a maximum of between 85 and 90 per cent. Premium rates are assessed
separately for each country, and vary according to the risks and the terms of
payment.
Trade Fairs
The British Industries Fair (BIF), one of the largest national trade fairs held
regularly in any country, was first held in 1915 and has since been an annual event
except for a break in 1925 and again from 1940 to 1947. Until 1956, the Fair was
held simultaneously in two centres in London and at Birmingham. In 1957, it was
concentrated at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, under the management of the
TRADE
329
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce; the possibility of making it an international
fair is now under consideration.
In addition to the British Industries Fair, which serves industry generally, there
are many specialized trade fairs held in the United Kingdom; a list of the more
important ones appears regularly in the Fairs Section of the Board of Trade
Journal. Some of the specialized fairs, such as the Motor Show, the Mechanical
Handling Exhibition and the Radio and Television Show, attract large numbers
of the public as well as many trade buyers from home and overseas, and provide an
important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufactures are shown at most of the large international
trade fairs throughout the world. For example, the products of more than 400
United Kingdom firms were exhibited at the 1956 Milan Fair, more than 300 at
the 1956 Brussels Fair and nearly 120 at the 1956 Damascus Trade Fair. At the more
important of these international trade fairs there is often an official United King¬
dom export promotion stand, where officials deal with trade inquiries and assist
British exhibitors, and an impression is given of some aspects of British industry.
In addition to these international events in which British goods are shown, from
time to time there are specially organized displays of British products: a successful
trade fair of this sort was organized in Zurich in 1953 by the British Chamber of
Commerce in Switzerland, and the Federation of British Industries organized a
British Trade Fair in Bagdad in 1954, in Copenhagen in i955> an<^ in Helsinki in
1957. An increasing interest is also being shown by United Kingdom manufacturers
in the many important specialized international fairs which are held in North
America and Europe.
BRITAIN’S ROLE IN THE FINANCING OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
By a process of evolution through the centuries, the United Kingdom has
developed an efficient and adaptable organization of trade and financial services,
centred mostly on London, and capable of meeting the needs, not only of Britain
itself, but of the world in general. Britain’s supremacy in this respect derives from
a number of factors—historical, geographical and economic—as well as the tech¬
nical efficiency and low cost of its services. In the nineteenth century, the rapid
growth of British industry, commerce and shipping under the stimulus of the
industrial revolution made Britain the market as well as the workshop of the world.
It became the site for the chief world markets in raw materials, freight, insurance,
and precious metals. At the same time British capital was invested in overseas
countries to assist their development, increase their output and exports, and pro¬
vide markets for manufactured goods. London became the chief supplier of capital
for many Commonwealth and foreign governments and a centre for entrepot trade
proceeding to and from the growing industrial areas on the continent of Europe and
in North America. In course of time, the pound sterling and the sterling bill of
exchange developed into the principal form of money for transactions between one
country and another in all parts of the world.
Side by side with these developments, a sound commercial banking system and
a flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialized
institutions such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the Stock
Exchanges, investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy par¬
ticular needs for short-term or long-term finance (see pp. 308-16). The facilities
provided by merchant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been
used to finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but between any
two countries overseas.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
More recently the sterling area countries (see below) have linked their currency
to the pound sterling.
The Sterling Area
The sterling area succeeded what was known as the ‘sterling bloc’—a group of
countries which followed Britain in abandoning the gold standard in 1931—and
which pegged their exchange rates to the pound sterling. In 1939, after the out¬
break of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely convertible into other cur¬
rencies and the sterling area became more formally defined as a currency area, for
exchange control purposes. Within the sterling area the United Kingdom imposes
virtually no restrictions on payments, whether in respect of current or of capital
transactions (see Exchange Control, p. 325).
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma, Ice¬
land, Iraq, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Libya and the British Protected States in
the Persian Gulf are members of the sterling area. These countries contain one-
quarter of the world’s population and do one-quarter of the world’s trade. The
main feature of the sterling area is that the greater part of the overseas trade of
member countries is financed in sterling; they keep their foreign reserves largely
in the form of sterling and maintain a fixed relationship between their currencies
and sterling. Member countries for the most part sell their foreign currency earn¬
ings to the United Kingdom Exchange Equalization Account in exchange for
sterling and can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require. They
generally also sell gold in the London Market for sterling, and United Kingdom
purchases of gold are also held in the Exchange Equalization Account. Members
have agreed to extensive restraint in their demands for foreign currency, particularly
dollars. South Africa is in a special position as a large gold producer. Although it
used to finance its net dollar requirements from the sale of its own gold, making
available most of the balance for the central reserves, it now sells most of its gold
through London, acquiring sterling with which it can, like other member countries,
draw on the central reserves for its dollar requirements.
All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or centralized
rules of conduct, the Commonwealth member countries agreeing between them¬
selves at periodic conferences the broad policies to be followed for the strengthen¬
ing of the reserves.
Commodity Markets
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic com¬
modities. These markets were largely closed during the war but they have gradually
been reopened and are rapidly regaining their previous position. Among the more
important are the London Rubber Market, the London Wool Exchange, the
London Metal Exchange and the Liverpool Cotton Exchange. Apart from the
import of goods for home consumption, many transactions are arranged between
buyers and sellers from other countries and the British commodity exchanges are
the most important centres for international dealings in a wide range of products.
The Foreign Exchange Market
From the beginning of the war until December 1951, authorized spot transactions
in the more important foreign currencies by residents of the United Kingdom were
permitted only at official buying and selling rates, which were fixed at a narrow
margin either side of the respective parities for those currencies in terms of sterling.
Forward margins were also controlled on a uniform basis in interest terms. From
17th December, 1951, wider spreads, between which spot exchange transactions
TRADE
331
could take place, were introduced and forward margins were entirely freed from
control, making it possible to reopen the Foreign Exchange Market on a restricted
basis. Subsequently, progressive relaxations in the regulations governing foreign
exchange operations have been introduced, particularly in the currencies of the
members of the European Payments Union, where a greater measure of trans¬
ferability has permitted the multilateral exchange arbitrage in the currencies of
members.
The Market remains subject to United Kingdom Exchange Control regulations,
which continue to govern the purchase and sale of foreign currencies by residents
in the sterling area.
The London Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak of
war, was reopened on a restricted basis in March 1954, under the general super¬
vision of the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the world’s
leading centre for dealings in gold.
Authorized dealers in gold are now free to deal with residents outside the sterling
area against payment in sterling convertible into dollars, but residents of the sterling
area have access to the Market only as sellers, except where permission is given for
the purchase of gold for essential purposes.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
For about a hundred years the total value of goods imported into Britain each
year has exceeded the total value of goods exported from Britain. The gap, or
‘visible trade deficit’, has, in normal years, been more than covered by net current
receipts from invisible transactions—e.g., the interest and dividends from overseas
investments and the earnings accruing from shipping, banking, insurance and other
professional services—leaving an overall credit balance which has been applied to
further investment overseas.
The Burden of two World Wars
Nevertheless, the pattern of the current balance of payments was seriously upset
in the first world war, when export earnings were sacrificed and overseas invest¬
ments liquidated in the interests of the war effort. It was also upset during the
nineteen-thirties, when the basic exporting industries were hard-hit by the world
economic crisis.
A more fundamental disturbance occurred as a consequence of the second world
war (see pp. 122-3).
The Post-war Balance of Payments Problem
The diagram on p. 332 indicates the changes in Britain’s balance of payments
between 1946 and 1956. The main balance of payments problem for Britain since
the second world war has been to earn enough abroad (1) to pay for half its food
and nearly all the raw materials needed for its factories1; (2) to provide a balance
of payments surplus in order to build up the gold and foreign exchange reserves
needed in a world of multilateral trading and convertible currencies, and to meet
1 In addition, since the war, the United Kingdom Government has had to meet a heavy
overseas military expenditure. In 1956 this was running at £180 million a year in foreign
currencies.

obligations overseas, including foreign debt service and obligations voluntarily
accepted in respect of development in Commonwealth countries and elsewhere.
The resources available for export have been limited by the very high level of
defence expenditure (see pp. 102-3) and by the needs of internal investment.

In the early post-war years the challenge was met by rapid reconversion of pro¬
ductive capacity to the needs of peace, and the mounting of an export drive coupled
with severe restrictions of home demand and imports. Assistance on a large scale
was obtained from lines of credit granted by the United States in 1945 and by
Canada in 1946 (see p. 335). Even so there were deficits on current account of
£298 million in 1946 and £443 million in 1947. In 1948, when there was a small
surplus of £1 million, the flow of dollars began under the European Recovery
Programme (ERP). In 1949, the year when, to protect the gold and dollar reserves,
the exchange value of sterling was reduced from $4.03 to $2.80, there was a surplus
of £31 million. In 1950, when a trade boom followed the outbreak of war in Korea,
the surplus was £300 million, and in December allocations of aid to Britain under
ERP were suspended. But the improvement in 1950 was followed by a serious
balance of payments crisis in 1951, when imports were over £1,000 million greater
than the year before and there was a deficit of £403 million (including United
States Defence Aid of £4 million). More severe restrictions had to be imposed on
imports and on home demand, but these were gradually relaxed as, from 1952,
the balance of payments position improved, helped by more favourable terms of
trade and by United States Defence Aid. After the inclusion of Defence Aid, there
were surpluses of £247 million in 1952, and £188 million in 1953.
In 1954, after including defence aid of £50 million, there was an overall surplus
of £228 million; but this masked a change from a large surplus in the first half of
TRADE
333
the year to a very small one in the second half. The main reason for this was that
exports, while they attained a record level, did not rise enough to meet the in¬
creased cost of imports, owing to a rise in the average price as well as in the volume
of imports.
In 1955, there was an overall deficit on current account of £79 million, after
including defence aid of £44 million. This deterioration occurred because imports
were flowing into Britain at a rate greater than the country could pay for by its
overseas earnings. In 1956, by forgoing increases in consumption and production
and simultaneously encouraging exports, the nation secured a substantial improve¬
ment in the current balance of payments, converting the deficit of £79 million in
the previous year to a surplus provisionally estimated at £233 million (£154 million
in the first half of the year and £79 million in the second half), including £23
million in Defence Aid.

The Balance of Payments of the Sterling Area
In assessing the gold and dollar reserve position of the United Kingdom it is
necessary to take into account, not only the United Kingdom balance of payments,
but also the balance of payments of the sterling area, of which Britain forms a
part. The reason for this is that the United Kingdom’s gold and dollar reserves
serve also the needs of most of the rest of the sterling area (see p. 330).
Following the balance of payments crisis of 1951—which affected all the sterling
area and not only the United Kingdom—Commonwealth Finance Ministers met
in January 1952 to agree on remedial measures. Action was agreed on to bring
334
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the sterling area into balance with the rest of the world in the second half of 1952,
to stop the drain on the reserves1—which had fallen by £550 million in the last
six months of 1951—and to restrain inflation. These immediate aims were largely
accomplished and the reserves rose from a low point of £602 million in June 1952—
to which they had fallen from £1,381 million in June 1951—to £659 million by the
end of the year.
In 1953, the United Kingdom had a surplus on current and capital account of
£26 million with non-sterling countries, and the rest of the sterling area had one
°f £29° million, so that the whole sterling area’s surplus was £316 million; and
the reserves rose by £240 million. In 1954, largely due to increased payments for
imports in the second half of the year, the United Kingdom had a non-sterling
deficit of £79 million and the rest of the sterling area’s surplus was reduced to
£176 million, so that the whole sterling area had a surplus of only £97 million.
The reserves rose by £87 million. In 1955, the United Kingdom had a non-sterling
deficit of £348 million, and the rest of the sterling area’s surplus was £132 million,
making a net deficit for the sterling area as a whole of £216 million.
In the first seven months of 1956, the gold and dollar reserves rose by £102
million and stood at £859 million on 31st July. By the end of November, partly
on account of the Suez crisis, they had fallen to £702 million. In December 1956
and January 1957, the Government took various measures to augment the reserves.
First, arrangements were made with the International Monetary Fund for the
purchase with sterling of U.S. $1,300 million—the amount of Britain’s quota in
the Fund. These arrangements fell into two parts: facilities for an immediate draw¬
ing of $561 million and a standby arrangement under which $739 million could
be purchased over the ensuing twelve months. Secondly, the Government
obtained a line of credit of $500 million, secured by pledging part of the United
Kingdom’s holdings of United States dollar securities, from the United States
Export-Import Bank. Thirdly, agreement was reached with the United States
and Canadian Governments for a change in the interest and capital repayment
provisions of the Anglo-American and Anglo-Canadian loans of 1945 and 1946
(see p. 335). By the end of June 1957, the reserves had risen to £850 million,
but fell sharply to £765 million at end-August 1957.
Monetary Assets and Liabilities
In estimating changes in the monetary position of the United Kingdom and of
the sterling area as a whole, it is necessary to take into consideration not only
changes in the gold and dollar reserves, but other changes in what might be des¬
cribed as ‘ monetary assets and liabilities These are made up of items of a very
diverse character, but a rough measure of the change in the balance between them
is given by the difference between sterling accounts held by residents outside the
United Kingdom and the holdings, by United Kingdom residents, of overseas
currencies other than dollars. Table 36 brings together the changes since the begin¬
ning of 1951 in United Kingdom net monetary balances, including the gold and
dollar reserves. Changes in the balances with the non-sterling areas reflect the
transactions—including short-term capital transactions—of the sterling area
as a whole with the non-sterling world. The changes over all areas, on the

including the United Kingdom balance of payments with the dollar area, the rest of the
sterling area’s balance of payments with the dollar area, gold sales by the rest of the sterling
area in Britain, and certain other capital transactions, including those with the European
Payments Union and the International Monetary Fund.

External Financial Aid received by Britain
Since the war, Britain’s difficulties in balancing its external accounts, particularly
with the dollar area, have been alleviated appreciably by aid received from Canada
and the United States.
In 1945, the United States extended to Britain a line of credit amounting to
$3,750 million, and a loan of $650 million (later adjusted to $622 million) in settle¬
ment of Lend-Lease and reciprocal aid adjustments arising out of the war. In 1946,
Canada also extended a line of credit, amounting to $C. 1+50 million, of which the
United Kingdom drew $C. 1,185 million. The terms of settlement with both
countries provided for payment in 50 annual instalments, starting on 31st Decem¬
ber, 1951, with interest at the rate of 2 per cent a year. Provision was made in the
United States agreement for waiving the interest element of the payment if in any
year Britain was experiencing certain defined economic difficulties in meeting its
international obligations; and a similar waiver on the Canadian loan could be made
in years in which the United States waiver applied. Under the terms of agreements
signed by the United Kingdom, United States and Canadian Governments in
March 1957, these waiver of interest provisions were replaced by new arrangements
whereby the United Kingdom Government could defer up to seven of the annuity
payments of both capital and interest if it judged postponement necessary, either
because of international exchange considerations, or on account of the level of its
gold and foreign exchange reserves. In addition, it was agreed that the interest for
1956 should be deferred, on the same terms as those governing the seven deferments.
Between 1948 and 1950, Britain received in all $2,700 million in Marshall Aid
from the United States under the European Recovery Programme. Of this, $1,700
million was grant aid, some $620 million was ‘ conditional aid (i.e. dollar aid on
condition that Britain provided corresponding sterling aid to other European
336
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
countries) and $337 million was a loan to be repaid with interest at 2^ per cent.
By far the greater part of the Marshall Aid allocated to Britain was used to buy
essential food and raw materials. But technical assistance and help in promoting
intra-European trade co-operation were also provided.
Since 1950, the financial aid received by Britain from the United States has been
mostly under the provisions of the United States Mutual Defence Assistance Pro¬
gramme and Mutual Security Programme. Between 1951 and 1956, net receipts by
Britain amounted to $964 million, including a loan of $48 million repayable with
interest at 2^ per cent. Mutual Defence Assistance allocations in 1950-51 totalled
$122 million, mainly for the purchase of machine tools. The Mutual Security
grants of $241 million in 1951-52 and $371 million in 1952-53 were used chiefly
to buy raw materials. Allocations in later periods have been used for the purchase
of military aircraft manufactured in Britain, surplus agricultural commodities in
the United States, and tobacco.
The Mutual Security Programme has also assisted Britain’s dollar balance of
payments by the system of ‘ offshore procurement ’, under which the United States
has placed contracts in Britain for military goods to be supplied to other NATO
countries. This has enabled Britain to increase its dollar earnings.
United States Private Investment in Britain
oince the war, Britain’s dollar balance of payments has also derived consider¬
able benefit from the expansion of United States corporate investment in Britain
and the growth of licensing arrangements between United Kingdom and United
States companies.
Much of the United States investment has been in new, or relatively new,
British industries, such as office machinery, agricultural tractors, earth-moving
equipment, refined petroleum and synthetic detergents. These developments have
not only enabled Britain to make considerable savings in imports, but also to expand
its export business in the new commodities. It has been calculated1 that, whereas
in 1938 the consumption of these newer commodities cost the United Kingdom
some £40 million in foreign exchange, in 1954 there was a net inflow of £100
million.
United Kingdom Government Grants and Loans to Other Countries
In spite of its post-war economic difficulties, the United Kingdom has made
available to other countries considerable sums in grants and loans for relief, rehabi¬
litation and development. It has been estimated that the total sum made available
by the United Kingdom Government in this way between 1946 and 1952 was
£1,504 million.
Aid provided through United Kingdom Government channels between 1952
and 1956 has included the following: £2-3 million for technical aid under the
Colombo Plan for Co-operative Development in South and South-East Asia;
£22 9 million for United Nations technical agencies; £53 million for the Middle
East and £13*4 million for Yugoslavia.
For Commonwealth development, Government finance is, in addition, provided
as follows:
1. The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts of 1945, 1950 and 1955 pro¬
vided for the expenditure of £220 million over the period 1946-60 to

supplement local revenues and loan resources in United Kingdom depen¬
dencies for development and welfare purposes. Of this amount, a sum of
£120 million remains available for the five-year period 1955 to i960.
2. The United Kingdom Colonial Development Corporation can lend up to
£100 million for development schemes of a commercial nature in the
United Kingdom dependencies; about £74 million had been approved in
respect of 66 schemes by the end of 1956-
3. The United Kingdom Government has agreed to release £60 million of
its capital subscription to the International Bank for loans within the
sterling area over six years from 1953-
4. As a special measure the United Kingdom Government made available
through the Export Credits Guarantee Department a credit of £10 million
to Pakistan in 1953. A similar credit has been offered to India to finance
Indian steel plant and this offer has been accepted.
United Kingdom Private Overseas Investment
With the progress of post-war recovery, Britain has been able to resume its role
as a provider of funds for investment in development overseas, particularly in the
Commonwealth. Thus, between 194? and 1956. the Governments of member
countries of the sterling area Commonwealth raised loans in London totalling
about £107 -4 million, while Governments of United Kingdom dependencies raised
loans totalling some £149-9 million. Private borrowing in the London market for
Commonwealth development has increased in recent years, Capital Issues consent
(see p. 314) having been given to applications totalling £4° million in i953> £48
million in 1954 and £51 million in 1955. Development in the sterling area Common¬
wealth is also being assisted through the Commonwealth Development Finance
Company Ltd. (see p. 313) which, by 31st March, 1957, had invested or committed
£14-5 million.
Private capital from Britain going directly into private overseas enterprises and
the reinvestment of profits from existing undertakings have, of course, always repre¬
sented an important element in Commonwealth development. Under the Finance
Act, 1957, United Kingdom companies engaged in business overseas are exempted
from United Kingdom income tax and profits tax on their trading profits earned
overseas; this measure is expected to stimulate further private investment abroad
of United Kingdom capital. It is not possible to measure the supply of invest¬
ment funds with any accuracy, since only those which involve raising new money
are subject to control. In the case of Canada a dollar country where, as with all
non-sterling countries, United Kingdom investment requires Exchange Control
approval as well as Capital Issues consent where new borrowing is involved, partici¬
pation by United Kingdom investors in economic development has been facilitated
in various ways, and private investment in Canada was authorized to the extent of
£44 million in 1954, £32 million in 1955 and more than £30 million in 1956. In
addition the investment of smaller amounts in the United States and other foreign
countries was authorized. For example, in 1954, applications were approved for
the investment of £29-7 million in the United States, £15'7 million in Europe and
£6 7 million in other countries.
Total Net Overseas Investment
It has been estimated that the amount of the United Kingdom s net long-term
private investment overseas (i.e. excluding inter-governmental lending and net of
overseas investment in the United Kingdom) averaged £120 million a year between
1946 and 1953; in 1954 it was £200 million, in 1955 it was £110 million, and in
1956 it was £140 million.

r^^ie average figure for I953~5^ represented more than one per cent of United
Kingdom national income, a higher proportion than that of any other country.
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad cate¬
gories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products (for
example, vehicle components) and trade in consumer goods, that is to say goods
for direct sale to the public. The following account is primarily concerned with the
distribution of consumer goods.
The results of a Census of Distribution taken in 1951, relating to 1950 and pub¬
lished between 1953 and 1955, the Census of Distribution and Other Services, 1950,
made it possible to obtain for the first time a fully documented account of the
structure of the distributive trades in Britain. The Census covered the numbers
and types of establishments and organizations in the wholesale and retail trades
Great: Britain (but not in Northern Ireland), the numbers employed, wages and
salaries, sales and other information on both a national and an area basis, including
all towns with a population of more than 25,000. In the case of the wholesale trade,
the Census covered about 92 per cent of all establishments; the corresponding pro¬
portion of retail trade outlets was 91 per cent, responsible for 95 per cent of total
turnover. The Census showed that, in the undertakings covered, a total of 3,773,867
people, including working proprietors and unpaid family workers ’, were employed
in the distributive trades in I95°- This total was made up of 2,265,291 in retail
establishments, 79°i266 in wholesale establishments and 718,310 in services trades,
such as catering and hairdressing.
WHOLESALE TRADE
On the basis of some pre-war researches,1 it would appear that about 17 per
cent of sales were made to consumers through producers’ own selling organiza¬
tions, including their own retail outlets and mail-order businesses, while more
than 40 per cent were accounted for by direct sales by producers to retailers; thus
it is estimated that approximately a further 40 per cent of sales move through
wholesale channels.
These channels are most in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural
produce and foodstufifs. The 1950 Census returns showed that out of a total of
55,701 wholesale establishments, there were 7,019 in the clothing, footwear and
textiles trade, 6,946 in the groceries, confectionery and drink trades and 6,917 in
other food trades.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fresh fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres or, in some cases, direct
to retailers; fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, may be sold by growers to
commission agents who dispose of the produce either to wholesalers or direct to
retailers, or alternatively the grower may deal only with wholesale firms.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of Retail Shops
Retail shops in Britain may be classified under four heads: (1) independent
retail businesses consisting of a single shop or a small group of shops, such
indication of the general pattern before the war is given in some unofficial pioneer
studies, for example, The Distribution of Consumer Goods, by James B. Jefferys published
in 1950.

establishments account for about one-half of the total retail turnover; (2) the
departmental store with a number of departments selling different types of goods,
in some cases a group may own several departmental stores; (3) multiple shops
(included within this category are the variety chain stores, which handle a wide
range of merchandise); and (4) retail co-operative societies. In addition, there are
a number of market and street traders, but, according to the Census of Distribu¬
tion, the amount of business done by these groups is usually very small, with a
turnover averaging under £2,000 a year.
340
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Census provided extensive information on the structure of the retail trade
in Great Britain. There are a large number of small undertakings, including more
than 400,000 with working proprietors; 250,000 retail outlets had, in 1950, an
annual turnover of less than £5,000. Out of a total of 531,143 establishments
recorded in the Census, and reproduced in Table 37, grocery and other food
retailing groups numbered 256,046 establishments and the clothing group 89,046.
Present Trends in Retail Trade
In recent years multiple concerns and the retail co-operative societies have
succeeded in raising their sales relative to those of other groups. The indices of
weekly sales published quarterly by the Board of Trade show that sales in multiple
stores and retail co-operatives rose by 56 per cent and 54 per cent respectively
between 1950 and 1956. The corresponding advance by independent retailers
amounted to 40 per cent and by general department stores to 21 per cent. The
growth in the value of retail sales has been most marked in food shops, where the
multiple stores have also expanded more rapidly than other groups, and in sales
of radio and electrical goods.
Self-Service Shops
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has probably
helped the multiple stores and the retail co-operatives to achieve a higher rate of
expansion in sales. Unofficial estimates give the number of self-service shops in
operation in the United Kingdom at the end of 1956 as 3,300, and new self-service
outlets are being established at the rate of 500 to 600 a year. About 60 per cent of
these shops are thought to be owned by retail co-operative societies and the majority
of the remainder by multiple stores.
Supermarkets on the American model are being introduced in the United King¬
dom, but at present are to be found only in London and the adjacent counties.
Self-service shops as a whole have been estimated to be responsible for 7 to 8 per
cent of retail sales in the grocery trade, but for other types of merchandise the
proportion is thought to be insignificant.
Retail Co-operative Societies
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organizations
engaged in the retail trade and controlled by their members who are also their
customers. An operating surplus is returned periodically, usually annually, to
members as a dividend, and the amount distributed is proportionate to the value
of the member’s purchases over the period.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open to
anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the member
to an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of the society.
Investment by individual members is limited to £500 but the rules of some societies
may fix lower limits. Only a low rate of interest is paid on the shares.
At the end of 1956, there were 1,006 retail co-operative societies registered under
the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, but more than a quarter of the total
membership of the co-operatives (11,856,000, an increase in the year of 297,000)
was provided by the eleven largest societies, each of which had a member¬
ship of more than 120,000. Total sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1956
reached £886 million, the largest having a turnover of more than £50 million.
Retail co-operative societies are free to purchase where they wish or to produce
their own goods, but in order to secure the advantages of large-scale production
TRADE
341
and distribution, they have collectively established wholesale and production
societies.1
Hire-Purchase Sales
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods such as
furniture, washing machines, refrigerators and cookers—has been greatly assisted
by the development of instalment purchasing. In July i954> the Government re¬
moved controls over hire-purchase and credit sales. In order to restrain consumer
expenditure, however, controls were re-imposed in February 1955> and have since
been reinforced. They take the form of stipulating minimum initial payments,
varied according to the type of product, and maximum periods for payments.
Measures have also been taken to limit severely the amount of new capital which
hire-purchase finance companies are permitted to raise. Since October 1955. the
Board of Trade has compiled a series of monthly returns, on a sample basis, relat¬
ing to hire-purchase sales. According to these returns, about 40 per cent of the
sales of furniture shops and shops selling furnishings, and about 20 per cent of
those of hardware goods shops in 1956 were hire-purchase transactions.
Controls on Consumer Goods
The last remnant of the war-time food rationing system was ended in July 1954-
The supply of household coal, however, remains restricted in so far as consumers
may purchase only ‘maximum permitted quantities’.
The most important price control still affecting the general public is that on a
range of housing rents, and this control was relaxed in some important respects
under the Rent Act, 1957 (see p. 390). The price of milk, because of the provision
of certain subsidies, has remained controlled.
Consumer Protection
Personal judgment and experience are generally considered to provide the best
safeguards for the general public against overcharging and inferior quality. Various
legislative measures, however, have been taken in the United Kingdom to pro
tect the consumer against specific abuses, and independent organizations have also
sought to establish minimum standards of quality.
The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953, and their several amendments, are
designed to ensure that the marking of goods is both accurate and honest. Weights
and Measures legislation, one of the earliest forms of consumer protection, is strict y
enforced by qualified inspectors. In establishing standardization of consumer goods,
the British Standards Institution (see p. 141), which is assisted by its Consumer
Advisory Council, is providing valuable services; individual trades and industries
have also taken measures towards raising standards of quality.
Interests of the consumer are also safeguarded by the Restrictive Trade Practices
Act, 1956 (see pp. 145-6). This Act makes unlawful the collective enforcement of
resale price maintenance. t? a a
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and
Drugs Act, 1955 (see p. 356).
Consumer Expenditures
Estimates of consumer expenditures in the United Kingdom are prepared
annually by the Central Statistical Office. Aggregate outlays by consumers in I95^
are estimated at £13,409 million at current market prices, an increase of £4,0 1
1 The two major wholesale societies are the Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited
and the Scottish Wholesale Society Limited.
342
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
million over the level of expenditures in 1950. If expenditures in 1950 and 1956
are valued at prices of 1948, the actual increase is slightly more than £1,000
million; that is to say, the growth in consumer expenditures over this six-year
period was about 12 per cent at fixed prices and 43 per cent at current prices.
In 1956, household and other personal expenditures on food accounted for about
a third of the total of £13,409 million as compared with slightly under 30 per cent
in 1950. A marked increase of.supplies of higher quality foodstuffs, the gradual
reduction in subsidies and the general upward trend of food prices have all con¬
tributed to the higher level of consumer expenditures. Housing, including both
rents and maintenance charges, is estimated to have required £1,116 million or
slightly more than 8 per cent of the total, fuel and light absorbed a further 5 per
cent. Expenditures on clothing and footwear over the period 1950-56 have advanced
relatively slowly and in 1956 accounted for nearly 10 per cent, but those on private
motoring and cycling increased almost threefold—from £198 million to £561
million in 1955, falling back to £523 million in the following year as a result of
the measures taken to restrain personal expenditures. In 1956, outlays on private
motoring and cycling absorbed about 4 per cent of total consumer expenditures.
X. SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local government
authorities, for a range of services covering subsistence for the needy, education
and health* services for all, housing, employment or maintenance, the care of aged
or handicapped persons, the nutrition of mothers and children, and sickness,
maternity and industrial injury benefits, widow’s and retirement pensions and
family allowances. Public authorities in the United Kingdom are spending nearly
£3,000 million a year on social services; and Exchequer expenditure on social
services amounts to over a quarter of total Exchequer expenditure.
Voluntary organizations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all
the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and
social and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They made
themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the
homeless and the handicapped, before it was generally accepted that the whole
community had a responsibility towards these people. Where the services and the
facilities they provided were adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The
State now supplements these voluntary services and provides financial assistance,
sees that essential services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures
that the necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services surround and supplement the State services. The
two types are complementary, not competitive, and they merge into each other. The
State services often work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
individual or special needs. The welfare work of the National Assistance Board is
supplemented by the work of many voluntary social service societies with whose
workers the Board’s officers co-operate, while the institutional provision made by
the State and by local authorities for the care of the chronic sick and the aged is
supplemented by voluntary homes of various types for the care of the sick and
elderly, most of whom receive State pensions or benefit.
Voluntary Bodies
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain runs into
thousands. Some of them are large and some are small and local in character. Some
have general aims and others, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
have been established for a particular purpose. The societies co-operate with each
other and with local authorities engaged on the same work.
Foremost among societies providing general social service are the National
Council of Social Service, with the Scottish Council of Social Service and the
Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, and the Family Welfare Association.
The National Council of Social Service was established in i9I9> and the correspond¬
ing Scottish Council in 1943, to create a closer link between the machinery of
343
Z
344
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
government and the voluntary activities of the ordinary citizen. The Family
Welfare Association, formerly the Charity Organization Society, which was founded
m 1869, works on personal lines to help any individual or family in need or diffi¬
culty. It works mainly in London, but there are some 180 voluntary family case¬
work agencies serving other areas of Britain.
There is a Central Council for the Care of Cripples, and the major societies
caring for homeless children (see p. 353) are represented on the National Council
of Associated Children’s Homes. Other examples of co-ordination in a specialized
field are the National Association for Mental Health, the Women’s Group on Public
Welfare and the National Marriage Guidance Council.
Societies working on a national scale whose social work is definitely religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, the Social Service of
the Church of Scotland^ the Church of England Children’s Society, the Church
of England Moral Welfare Council, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the
Young Women’s Christian Association, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the
Crusade of Rescue, the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council.
War-time organizations such as the Women’s Voluntary Services (WVS) and the
Citizens Advice Bureaux (there are still about 440 of these bureaux) continue, with
official support, to do very valuable work. The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux act as
interpreters between the Government Departments and the ordinary citizen and,
though the inquiries are somewhat fewer now than during the war, more skill and
time are often needed for their solution. WVS activities are many and various. They
include welfare work for children, the aged and the sick, and for certain foreign
workers, as well as relief work in emergencies.
The old-established British Red Cross Society not only aids the sick and wounded
in time of war but works in peace time for ‘the improvement of health, the preven¬
tion of disease, and the mitigation of suffering’. It is, in particular, developing its
welfare services for civilian disabled, invalid and crippled children and the aged. The
members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and, in Scotland, the St. Andrew’s
Ambulance Association likewise render voluntary auxiliary medical services and
undertake welfare work for the sick and the infirm.
The Social Worker
While the voluntary worker giving full- or part-time service has done pioneer
work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an essential part in
probably every service, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their
operation primarily on the professional social worker, that is the full-time salaried
worker trained in the principles and technique of social service. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university diploma or certificate course in
social science followed by a specialized training for a particular service. The latter is
usually organized by the profession concerned. An attempt is being made to lessen
specialization in social work.
Voluntary organizations were the pioneers in the employment and training of
social workers, but Government Departments and local authorities now employ a
considerable number of trained social workers of various kinds. Such workers include
regional and local welfare officers, children’s care organizers, children’s officers for
work under the Children Act, 1948 (see p. 353), neighbourhood workers, youth
leaders, almoners, mental health workers, psychiatric social workers, tuberculosis
care workers, housing managers, personnel managers and probation officers; in fact,
representatives of most branches of social work. In June 1955 the Minister of Health
and the Secretary of State for Scotland set up a working party to examine the field
SOCIAL WELFARE
345
of work, recruitment and training of social workers in the local authorities’ health
and welfare services.
NATIONAL INSURANCE AND RELATED SERVICES
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
National Assistance together constitute a system of social security in the United
Kingdom which ensures that in no circumstances need anyone fall below a minimum
standard of life. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the
first three of these measures in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are adminis¬
tered by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
National Assistance is administered by the National Assistance Board in Great
Britain, and in Northern Ireland by the National Assistance Board for Northern
Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants
(see p. 354) are the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance
throughout the United Kingdom.
Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits or war pensions, or applications
for assistance, are not decided by the Ministry or the Board but by independent
authorities appointed under the Acts.
The Poor Relief Act of 1601 can be regarded as the starting-point of public provi¬
sion for social security in England and Wales. From the beginning of the present
century, and particularly after the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief
of Distress had issued its report, with the influential Minority Report, in i9°9> a
strong movement arose against the form and spirit of the poor law as it had been
administered under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. The first departure
from the poor law as the sole means of relief given from public funds had been the
introduction in 1908 of non-contributory old age pensions granted on a test of means.
Other changes followed, the broad effect of which was gradually to transfer more
and more of the old poor law functions from local to central government adminis¬
tration, and the process was completed in 1948 with the passing of the National
Assistance Act. In the same period there was a development of compulsory insurance
administered on a national basis. The Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1897 fore¬
shadowed the present National Insurance Industrial Injuries scheme; although the
system it introduced was not itself a State-administered insurance scheme, it required
employers to pay compensation to workers for accidents at work. In 1912 came the
National Health Insurance scheme and with it the introduction of the contributory
principle on which all later measures have been based. In return for a small weekly
contribution it provided a small cash payment and medical treatment without charge
during sickness. It applied only to a limited number of the lower-paid workers. In
1912 also a limited scheme of unemployment insurance was started. This was
extended in 1920 to cover the great majority of employed persons, a very neces¬
sary provision in view of the large-scale unemployment of the inter-war years. In
1926 contributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans were introduced.
By the beginning of the second world war the social services in Britain were among
the best in the world, but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their piece¬
meal development, and they were not universal. A comprehensive, co-ordinated and
unified plan for social security was needed.
Under the stimulus of war, when plans for post-war reconstruction were being
formulated, Lord (then Sir William) Beveridge was invited by the National Coali¬
tion Government to investigate the country’s existing social insurance system. In
1942 the Beveridge Report was published; it recommended the creation of a com¬
prehensive and unified system of social insurance. The report aroused intense
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
346
interest and was accepted in general by the Government as the basis on which the
future social security structure should be built.
In the immediate post-war years a series of Acts introduced a new comprehensive
system which became fully operative on 5th July, 1948. Adjustments have been
made in a number of subsequent Acts.
Reciprocity
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of Great
Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a single system.
Reciprocal agreements on family allowances are in operation with Australia, New
Zealand, Jersey and Guernsey, and there are further agreements with Australia and
New Zealand (on sickness, unemployment and widow’s benefits, and retirement
pensions), with Jersey (on sickness, industrial injuries and widow’s benefits, guard¬
ian’s allowances and retirement pensions), with the Irish Republic (on sickness,
unemployment, maternity and widow’s benefits, and the insurance of seamen), and
with Malta (on sickness, industrial injuries, unemployment and widow’s benefits,
guardian’s allowances and retirement pensions). Agreements covering various
aspects of social security have been in operation with France since November 1949,
with Italy since May 1953, with Switzerland since June 1954, with Luxembourg
since April 1955 and with the Netherlands since June 1955. Comprehensive agree¬
ments with Sweden and Belgium came into operation in 1957, one with the
German Federal Republic was signed in December 1956 and one with Norway in
July 1957. An agreement with Denmark on industrial injuries benefits has been in
operation since May 1954. Similar agreements with other Commonwealth and
European countries are under negotiation. The schemes in Northern Ireland are
similarly linked with most of the countries mentioned.
A multilateral agreement on social security, signed by the five Brussels Treaty
Powers, was ratified by the United Kingdom in May 1950, and was implemented
a year later for limited purposes; it will not come into full operation until the
network of bilateral agreements between the five participating countries has been
completed. Other multilateral provisions, embodied in two interim agreements on
social security signed by the member countries of the Council of Europe and in a
United Nations Convention on the status of refugees, have also been ratified and
were brought into effect during 1954.
FAMILY ALLOWANCES
Family allowances have been provided by the State since August 1946, under the
Family Allowances Act of June 1945. Some five and a quarter million allowances are
being paid in Great Britain to over three and a quarter million families with two
or more children. An allow ance is paid for each child other than the first or only
child below the age limits. A child is below the age limits up to the end of compul¬
sory school age (normally 15) and while receiving full-time instruction in a school,
or engaged as an apprentice, for any further period up to the eighteenth birthday.
The allowance was raised from 5s. to 8s. a week in September 1952 and, by the
Family Allowances and National Insurance Act, 1956, for the third and each sub¬
sequent child in a family the rate was increased by 2s. to 10s. as from October 1956.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit the
family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to the mother
or the father. There is no insurance qualification, and parents who are not British sub¬
jects may claim allowances if they satisfy a special residence qualification.
The corresponding scheme in Northern Ireland makes similar provision for
family allowances.
SOCIAL WELFARE
347
NATIONAL INSURANCE
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th July, 1948.
It has been amended by the National Insurance Acts, 1949 and 1951, the Family
Allowances and National Insurance Acts, 1952 and 1956, and the National Insurance
Acts, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957- The Acts apply, in general, to everyone over
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in Northern
Ireland and the Isle of Man.
Contributors are divided into three classes:
Class 1—Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a contract of
service or are paid apprentices—about 21 f million.
Class 2—Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—about million.
Class 3—Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in Class 1 or 2—
about half a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by regulations,
to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in their own house¬
hold duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’ insurance and cannot
become insured in their own right unless they were insured under the old scheme
on the 5th July, 1948, and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or have since taken up paid work. Employed married women may choose whether
to pay separate contributions themselves or to rely on the cover provided by their
husbands’ contributions. Students undergoing full-time education and unpaid
apprentices need not pay contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions are
credited to them. Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed per¬
sons (Class 3). Self-employed and non-employed persons whose income is not more
than £156 a year can apply for exception from liability to pay contributions under
the scheme.
Contributions . .
The main weekly rates of contribution as in September 1957 are shown m 1 able
38. These contributions, which the Exchequer supplements from general taxation,
are normally paid on a single contribution card by National Insurance stamps
bought from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see
that the Class 1 contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employee s share from
his or her wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards.
Contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or injury,
or if widow’s benefit is being paid. .
An insured person ceases to be liable for National Insurance contributions when
he retires, or is deemed to have retired, from regular employment. If such a person
does any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an Industrial Injuries
contribution (sd. weekly for a man, 3d. for a woman) and his employer s liability
remains the same as shown in 'Fable 38.
The scheme provides sickness, unemployment, maternity and widow s benefit,
guardian’s allowance, retirement pension and death grant. Persons in Class 1 are
covered for all benefits; those in Class 2 for benefits other than unemployment and
industrial injuries benefits (see p. 350); and those in Class 3 for benefits other than
sickness, unemployment and industrial injuries benefits, and maternity allowance.
34^ BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
TABLE 38
(a) The amounts shown in the left column under each heading include the National Health
Service contribution (see p. 359)> which is also shown separately in italics.
(b) Includes Industrial Injuries Insurance contributions.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before any
benefit can be paid, a minimum number of contributions must actually have been
paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid
unless a certain number of contributions have been paid or credited over a specified
period. For guardian’s allowance and industrial injuries benefits there are no
contribution conditions.
Rates of benefit have been increased since the scheme began. The rates current
in mid-1957 are set out below.
Sickness Benefit
The standard weekly rate of sickness benefit for a man or woman over 18 (except
a married woman) is 40s., with an increase of 25s. for an adult dependant and 1 is. 6d.
a week for the first or only child under the family allowances’ age limits (see p. 346),
with 3s. 6d., in addition to any family allowance payable, for each subsequent child.
The weekly rate for a married woman is 25s., but she is paid at the 40s. rate if she
is maintaining an invalid husband or is separated from her husband and cannot get
financial support from him.
Unless 156 Class 1 or Class 2 contributions have been paid since the entry into
insurance, sickness benefit can be drawn only for a year, but in general it continues
for as long as sickness lasts, once 156 contributions have been paid.
Unemployment Benefit
The rates of unemployment benefit are the same as for sickness benefit except
that the standard rate for married women is 30s. instead of 25s.
Unemployment benefit is payable in the first place for 30 weeks, but it may
be continued for up to a maximum of 19 months in all, according to the person’s
record of contributions paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in recent years.
Maternity Benefit
The National Insurance Acts, 1953 and 1954, amended the maternity benefits
of the 1946 Act. A maternity grant of £10 is payable for a confinement, provided
SOCIAL WELFARE
349
the required contribution conditions have been satisfied, and a further grant of £10
for each additional child born at the confinement who is alive twelve hours after
birth. A home confinement grant of £4 is payable where the mother is not confined
in free accommodation under the National Health Service or in accommodation
otherwise paid for out of public funds. A maternity allowance of 40s. a week, begin¬
ning with the eleventh week before the expected wreek of confinement, payable for
18 weeks, is available for working women who satisfy the contribution conditions.
These are that in the 52 weeks ending 13 weeks before the expected week of her
confinement, the claimant must have paid 26 contributions at the full rate as an
employed or self-employed person and, for an allowance at the maximum rate, have
a total of at least 50 contributions paid or credited. Increases of maternity allowance
for dependants are payable in certain circumstances at the same rates as increases of
sickness benefit.
Widow's Benefit
There are three kinds of widow’s benefit, paid only on the deceased husband’s
insurance. A Widow’s Allowance of 55s. a week plus 16s. 6d. a week for the first
or only child under the age limits (see p. 346) and 8s. 6d. a week for second and
subsequent children (in addition to family allowances) is paid for 13 weeks. A
Widowed Mother’s Allowance of 56s. 6d. a week is paid following widow’s allow¬
ance to a widow who has a child who qualifies under the age limits; she also receives
8s. 6d. a week, in addition to any family allowance, for each child after the first.
A widowed mother’s allowance at the lower rate of 40s. a week may be paid to a
widow who has residing with her a person under 18 who, but for age or because of
absence abroad when the husband died, would have qualified as a child for this
purpose (for example, a son or daughter aged 17 who is neither at school nor an
apprentice and, therefore, is not within the family allowances’ age limits). A Widow’s
Pension of 40s. a week is paid to a widow who is 50 or over at the time of the
husband’s death and has been married three years, or who is 50 (40 if the husband
died before 4th February, 1957) or over when her widowed mother’s allowance
ends, provided three years have elapsed since the marriage. Widowed mother’s
allowance and widow’s pension are reduced by 6d. for each complete is. of the
first 20s. of earnings in excess of 60s. and 50s. respectively, and by is. for each
shilling of higher earnings. In the case of widowed mother’s allowance the total
deducted in any one week cannot exceed 40s., whatever the earnings may be.
There are special rules to help widows to qualify for sickness or unemployment
benefit if they are unable to obtain work when widow’s allowance or widowed
mother’s allowance ends.
Guardian's Allowance
A Guardian’s Allowance of 18s. a week may be paid to a person who has in his
family a child whose parents (or step-parents) have died and one of whom was
insured under the National Insurance Acts. This continues while the child remains
in the guardian’s family and is a child within the meaning of the Family Allowances
Act.
Retirement Pension
Retirement pensions are paid to men at the age of 65, and to women at the age of
60, provided the required contributions have been satisfied and they have retired
from regular employment. From the age of 70 (men) and 65 (women), however, the
pension is payable whether or not the claimant has retired. The standard rate is 40s.
a week. A married woman ordinarily qualifies for pension on her husband s insurance

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
at the standard rate of 25s. a week. If after retirement a pensioner below the age of
70 (65 for a woman) earns over £2 10s. a week, 6d. is deducted from the pension for
each is. earned over that amount up to £3 10s. and is. is deducted for each
shilling earned over £3 10s.
Men and women are encouraged not to retire at minimum pension age and are
able to earn a larger retirement pension by continuing at work. For every six
months they stay at work between the ages of 65 and 70 (men) or 60 and 65 (women)
their pension is increased by is. 6d. a week. The pension of the wife of such a con¬
tributor is increased by is. a week for each six months’ extra work after the husband
has reached the age of 65 and the wife has reached 60, and it continues at this rate
up to the time of the contributor’s death; if his wife survives him her pension is
re-calculated at the is. 6d. rate if the is. increases were earned after 16th July, 1951.
A man now reaching the age of 65 who continues at work for a further five years can
therefore receive a pension of as much as 55s. a week on attaining the age of 70.
If he has a wife not more than five years younger than himself, their combined
pensions can be 90s. a week; if the wife survives her husband her pension can be 55s.
a week.
A retirement pensioner is entitled to an increase of 25s. a week for his wife if she
is under 60 and also to an increase of ns. 6d. for the first child under the family
allowances’ age limits (see p. 346), and 3s. 6d. for each succeeding child, in addition
to any family allowance payable.
Death Grant
A Death Grant of up to £20 is paid towards the expenses in connection with the
death of an adult, and a smaller sum on the death of a child, provided the required
contribution conditions have been satisfied. Grants are not paid for persons already
over pension age on 5th July, 1948, or for children born before 5th July, 1948,
who die before they are ten years old. Reduced grants are paid on the deaths of
people who on 5th July, 1948, were over 55 (men) or over 50 (women).
NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES)
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which replaced the Workmen’s Com¬
pensation scheme in July 1948, provides benefits for personal injuries caused by
accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases
due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in Class 1 of the
National Insurance scheme and certain others. The relevant Acts are the National
Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, 1946 to 1956. Cover against industrial in¬
juries and diseases in Northern Ireland is provided to the same extent by the separ¬
ate legislation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
Benefits
Injury Benefit
Injury Benefit for an adult is 67s. 6d. a week plus 25s. for an adult dependant
and ns. 6d. for the first or only child under the family allowances’ age limits (see
p. 346) and 3s. 6d. for each other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance
payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as a result of an
industrial accident or disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26
weeks from the date of the accident or development of the disease.
Disablement Benefit
Disablement Benefit may be paid when injury benefit stops and the amount
depends on the extent of the disablement, as assessed by a medical board. It varies

to qualify under (ii), or (iv) she is pregnant by her late husband. In other cases the
pe,[n addition?aUwances will be paid for children under the family allowances age

a week for the first or only child and 8s. 6d. a week for each other child. For other
beneficiaries, the rate is us. 6d. and 3s. 6d. a week respectively.
Certain other dependants, such as parents, are entitled to pensions, allowances or
gratuities. The amounts vary with the closeness of the relationship and the extent
to which the dependants were maintained by the deceased during his lifetime.
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND WELFARE SERVICES
The National Assistance Act, 1948, came into operation on 5th July, 1948. It
provides a unified State service of financial assistance for those in need, replacing
the various services of this kind provided in the past by the'State and ocal authori¬
ties. As the residual service, National Assistance meets the financial needs of all
those people who are unable to maintain themselves and who fall outside the scope
of the other social security services, and supplements the insurance benefits when
thev are insufficient. ... . ^ . 1
The National Assistance Board is responsible for administering these weekly
cash grants. It has various other duties, including the administration of non¬
contributory pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936 (still payable on a
nationality, means and residence test to a diminishing number of persons over 70
and blind persons over 40, who have not qualified for pensions under the contribu¬
tory scheme); the administration of hostels provided under the Polish Resettlement
Act, 1947; and the assessment under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, i949> an e
352
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act, 1949, of the maximum amount a person
applying for legal aid may be called upon to pay towards the cost of the action.1
The Board is responsible for influencing ‘ persons without a settled way of living ’
to lead a more settled life. It provides temporary accommodation for such persons,
usually through the agency of local authorities, and it runs a residential re-establish-
ment centre for men of this type or men who have been long unemployed and in
receipt of National Assistance grants.
The provision under the National Assistance Act of residential accommodation
for the aged, infirm and others, and of special welfare services for the blind, the
deaf, the crippled and other handicapped persons is the responsibility not of the
National Assistance Board but of county and county borough councils in England
and Wales and, in Scotland, of councils of counties and large burghs.
In Northern Ireland financial assistance is given under the provisions of the
National Assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, to persons in need and there is
also a system of non-contributory pensions similar to that in operation in Great
Britain. Under the Welfare Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, local authorities,
in their capacity as welfare authorities, provide residential accommodation for the
aged, infirm and other persons who are in need of care and attention. The welfare
authorities also provide special services for the blind, deaf and other handicapped
persons.
Old People’s Welfare
County and county borough councils in England and Wales (in Scotland, county
and large burgh councils) have a statutory duty to provide homes for those old and
infirm persons who are in need of care and attention not otherwise available to them.
These homes have accommodation for 25 to 40 residents; about a thousand have
been opened since the end of the second world war. County welfare authorities in
Northern Ireland have provided over 20 similar homes. These smaller homes are
gradually replacing the larger institutions which were previously maintained by
local authorities.
Voluntary bodies take a large share in work for old people, which has been steadily
expanding since the second world war brought into prominence the problems of old
people’s welfare that social and population changes had already begun to accentuate.
Voluntary homes for old people now number over 1,500 and some 7,000 social clubs
for elderly people have been started in recent years in all parts of Britain. The regular
visiting of lonely old people and the delivery of cooked meals to their homes (‘ meals-
on-wheels ’) are other welfare services that are being developed by voluntary effort
with the support of local authorities. Their object is to enable old people to continue
to live in their own homes wherever possible.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees are formed by those concerned in this
work, and are aided by the National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated
group of the National Council of Social Service widely representative of voluntary
and statutory bodies having direct contact with old people, or by the Scottish Old
People’s Welfare Committee, a committee of the Scottish Council of Social Service.
A National Corporation for the Care of Old People was established in 1947 by the
Nuffield Foundation (see p. 406) to stimulate and to give financial support to schemes
for the welfare of the aged, to maintain an expert technical advisory service, and to
encourage and to undertake research and experiment for the welfare of old people.
The Corporation is now concentrating its main effort on home services for old people.

The King George VI Foundation has allocated £440,000 from the King George VI
Memorial Fund to schemes for the benefit of old people.
CARE OF CHILDREN
The Children Act, 1948, which came into force with the ending of the Poor Law,
places upon local authorities in Great Britain a duty to receive into their care any
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been abandoned
or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or permanently. Local
authorities must keep a child in care until he is 18 or until he no longer requires it.
Under the Children and Young Persons Acts, 1933-52. as regards England and
Wales, and under the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act, 1937, local
authorities are required also to accept children committed to their care, until the
age of 18, by Juvenile Courts, as needing care or protection. Both categories of
children are to be treated so as to further their best interests and to afford them
opportunity for the proper development of their characters and interests.
Children in care are, if possible, to be boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home cannot be
found, a child may be placed in a children’s home managed by a local authority or
a voluntary organization. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses,
on housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of ten or fewer children
live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband following his normal
employment. Other children may be placed in hostels or lodgings or in other accom¬
modation specially suited to their needs. Great importance is attached to the desira¬
bility of securing a child’s return to his family circle as soon as possible and work is
carried out to rehabilitate the family where this is necessary.
To carry out their functions under the Children Act each local authority (county
council and county borough council or, in Scotland, council of a large burgh) is
required to appoint a Children’s Committee and a Children’s Officer to be respon¬
sible for the care and upbringing of children in the authority’s care. Children s
officers are assisted by a staff of child care officers who undertake inquiries and who
supervise children placed in foster homes. Regulations for England and Wales safe¬
guarding the boarding out of children by local authorities and voluntary organiza¬
tions and the conduct of children’s homes have been made by the Home Secretary.
The Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible Minister in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland),
19 SO gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county borough the duty
of caring for homeless and neglected children under the general direction of the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
Voluntary organizations, many of which were pioneers in the work of child care,
continue to play a valuable part. The larger societies, such as Dr. Barnardo’s the
Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic Child Welfare Council, are
constituent societies of the National Council of Associated Children s Homes to
which a large number of smaller voluntary homes are also affiliated. In Scotland a
valuable contribution is also made by the Children’s Homes and Hostels under the
auspices of the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service and by voluntary
organizations, including the Orphans’ Homes of Scotland. .
Children’s homes provided by voluntary organizations are required to be regis¬
tered under the Children Act. The boarding out of children and all children’s
homes, whether local authority or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by
Inspectors of the Home Office Children’s Department or the Scottish Home
Department.
354
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The cost of the local authorities’ child care service, including the provision of
training for houseparents and child care officers, is shared between the local authori¬
ties and the Exchequer.
To safeguard the welfare of children living with their own parents or guardians,
the children’s departments have a duty to cause inquiries to be made in any case
in which it is reported that a child may need care or protection. In addition, all
local authorities have been asked by the Government Departments concerned to
appoint a committee to co-ordinate local authority and voluntary services dealing
with unsatisfactory families, and to designate one of their officers as co-ordinating
officer for the purpose of calling meetings of interested bodies to discuss particular
‘problem families’ and to decide on a course of action. Local health authorities
have wide powers under the National Health Service Act to make arrangements
for the prevention of illness, and for care and after-care; these arrangements enable
preventive and remedial measures to be taken to safeguard the physical and mental
health of the children of problem families (see p. 365). These problem families, a
very small minority in the community, are the focus of much attention from health,
housing, education, children’s and welfare authorities and voluntary bodies. The
Family Service Units undertake intensive and prolonged casework with such
families and there are several voluntary recuperative centres to which mothers,
with their children, can be sent for a period of residential training, sometimes as a
condition of a probation order. The old-established National Society for the Pre¬
vention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors
and visitors for the investigation of cases of reported cruelty or neglect of children
in their own homes; when necessary they resort to law for the protection of chil¬
dren, but they prefer to achieve their purpose by warning and advice.
WAR PENSIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Pensions to persons disabled or bereaved through the wars are paid under Royal
Warrants and regulations.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
67s. 6d. a week, but the amount varies according to the rank and the degree of dis¬
ablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the disabled person with a normal
healthy person of the same age and sex, without taking earning capacity into account.
Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic pension and
there are various supplementary allowances, the main ones being for unemploya¬
bility (45s. a week), constant attendance (up to 30s. and, exceptionally, 60s. a week),
and lowered standard of occupation (up to 27s. 6d. a week). There is an allowance
(at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a week) for persons drawing disablement
pensions who are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary payments are free of
income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any allowance payable
under the Family Allowances Acts.
War pensioners have priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of
their war disabilities in National Health Service hospitals.
Pensions are paid to war orphans and to war widows. The standard rate of pen¬
sion for war widows is 52s. 6d. a week, and they also receive allowances for their
children (21s. 6d. for each child), and, in certain cases, an allowance for rent (up to
20s. a week). Parents or other relatives who were dependent on a person whose death
resulted from the wars may receive pensions if they are in pecuniary need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans.
SOCIAL WELFARE
355
Many ex-Service organizations, e.g., the British Legion, and other voluntary asso¬
ciations give financial aid and personal service to disabled ex-semcemen and women
and their families. The Ministry and these bodies work in co-operation.
The Imperial War Graves Commission
The Imperial War Graves Commission was founded in 1917, its purpose being
to commemorate the war dead of the British Commonwealth and Empire by estab-
hshin" war cemeteries, ensuring the perpetual care of war graves whether m these
cemeteries or elsewhere, and erecting suitablememonals to those who have no
grave A Charter of 1940 extended the Commission s powers to enable it to deal with
the dead of the i939-45 war. The members of the Commission delude representa¬
tives of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Governments and of the thr
Services and a number of unofficial members chosen for distinction in various walks
of life. The cost of the Commission’s work is borne by the respective Governments
in proportion to the numbers of the graves of their dead.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of the
last 100 years. The second half of the nineteenth century saw the growth ot the
environmental or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage,
d^al of refuse^nd cleaning of streets, and also Gilding byelaws and oth
measures designed to promote healthy living conditions in Britain. Local author
ties provided smallpox and other infectious-disease hospitals and poor law infirmaries

absorbed in the National Health Service created m 1948. . ,
Over the past forty years advances have been made in many directions: med cal

War also stimulated developments in industrial health services (see pp. Z95 6) and
ta he rehabilitation of the dtsabled (see pp. a8o and 360). These ^7--
and improved services are reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 8) and
improved physique.
PUBLIC HEALTH
The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and COI}f
Acts; it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and Wale .
Local authorities are mainly responsible for its implementation am ey a
sive powers for the making and administration of byelaws (laws of local aPP ^ation)
bating to matters of public health. The local authorities chiefly concerned are the
councils of county and non-county boroughs, urban and rural district councils, an ,
to a limited extent, parish councils.
356
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The development of the public health services in Scotland and in Northern
Iieland has been largely on the same lines as in England, although these services
have been based on separate Acts, and different authorities are responsible for the
various services. The Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, and the Burgh Police
(Scotland) Act, 1892, constitute the basic legislation for Scotland. The local authori¬
ties concerned are the councils of counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland, the
county and county borough councils are mainly responsible for administering the
Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland), 1878-1949.
Control of Infectious Diseases
Local authorities are responsible to the Minister of Health (or the Secretary of
State for Scotland) for recording notifications of the prescribed infectious diseases;
they are also responsible for the investigation by the Medical Officer of Health of
outbreaks of infectious diseases, and for disinfection and other measures advised
by the Medical Officer of Health for prevention of the spread of infectious diseases
in the area.
The same Ministers have the general responsibility for supervising the operation
of health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of which is to prevent
the introduction of infectious disease into the country. It is operated at the principal
seaports by Port Health Authorities specially constituted for the purpose, and at
others by the riparian local authorities. Health control at airports is operated by the
local authorities. At seaports, the work is carried out by the Port Medical Officer
assisted by Port Health Inspectors, rodent officers and others; at airports, the Air¬
port Medical Officer is responsible.
Pure Food
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation now
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and for
Scotland in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act, 1956. In England and Wales, the
Act, and Regulations made under it, are mainly carried out and enforced by Food and
Drugs Authorities (i.e. county councils, county borough councils and, generally,
the larger borough and urban district councils) in relation to composition, adultera¬
tion and description, and by local authorities (i.e., county borough, borough, urban
district and rural district councils) in relation to purity and hygiene; the Ministry
of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central
Departments responsible for advising and for making Regulations under the Act.
All premises where food for sale for human consumption is prepared, sold or stored
are required to conform to certain hygienic standards. Authorized officers of food
and drugs authorities and of local authorities are empowered to take samples of any
food for sale for human consumption, for analysis or for bacteriological or other
examination. Special regulations are in force for certain foods such as milk, meat
and ice-cream.
In Scotland, the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of counties
and large burghs; the central department is the Department of Health for Scotland.
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service was established in 1948. The relevant Acts, the
National Health Service Act, 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act,
1947, and the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, came into force
simultaneously on 5th July, 1948.
The National Health Service Act, 1946, aims ‘to promote the establishment in
England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improve¬
ment in the physical and mental health of the people of England and Wales and the
SOCIAL WELFARE
357
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and for that purpose to provide or
secure the effective provision of services’. The National Health Service (Amend¬
ment) Act, 1949, and the National Health Service Acts, 1951 and 1952, make some
modifications in the scheme for Great Britain and provide for charges to be made for
certain parts of the Service, which is otherwise free of charge, and which is available
to all according to medical need. Its availability is not dependent on contribution to
National Insurance.
Health Service Administration in Great Britain
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has direct responsibility for (x) the
provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, (2) the mental
health functions previously in the hands of the Board of Control and local authori¬
ties, except for the quasi-judicial functions of the Board designed to safeguard the
liberty of the patient,1 (3) the conduct of research work into matters relating to the
causation, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or mental defect, (4) a public
health laboratory service, and (5) a blood transfusion service. He has indirect respon¬
sibility for the general practitioner services and local health authority services. He is
advised by the Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory committees
on various aspects of the Service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through Regional Hospital
Boards and Hospital Management Committees or, in the case of teaching hospitals,
by Boards of Governors. The hospitals themselves have been grouped into admini¬
strative units; these consist sometimes of several formerly independent hospitals
and sometimes of one. There are nearly 400 such groups under the control of
hospital management committees, which are in turn under the control of 14 regional
hospital boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services
can conveniently be associated with a university having a school of medicine.
The members of the hospital management committees are appointed by the
regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution, reflect the com¬
munities concerned, for they usually include not only medical practitioners but
members of local authorities, trade unionists and others. The regional hospital
boards are appointed by the Minister and are similarly constituted. The term o
office is three years, one-third of the board or committee retiring each year but
being eligible for reappointment. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are
appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being nominated by the
teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and the medical staff.
All appointments to hospital management committees, regional hospital boards and
boards of governors are honorary. .
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister. It is the
Minister’s responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
1 The functions of the Minister include the supervision of local authorities in the per¬
formance of their duties with regard to persons of unsound mind (see p. 304), the genera
supervision of matters relating to mental defectives, and the licensing or other forma
approval of accommodation for mentally ill or defective patients outside the JNational
Health Service. The Board of Control deals with the admission, discharge and periodic
review of mentally disordered or defective patients and inspects all institutions tor t eir
care, whether in or outside the National Health Service. In Scotland, there is a separate
General Board of Control with functions similar to those of the Board of Control in
England and Wales. The Royal Commission set up in 1954 to inquire into the existing
law and administrative machinery in England and Wales governing the certification and
care, other than hospital care or treatment under the National Health Service Acts, of
persons suffering from mental illness or defect, reporting in MaY 1957. reconam^ncie

The administration of the General Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical and Optical
Services (see p. 361) is in the hands of 138 Executive Councils, each covering the
area of a county or county borough. (In a few cases two areas are combined un er
one council.) Each council has an Ophthalmic Services Committee responsible for
administering the Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. Doctors dentists and phar¬
macists are represented on the Executive Councils and each profession also forms a
local committee. Councils of counties and county boroughs are the 146 local health
authorities in charge of local health services (see pp. 361-5)-
In Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible Minister; 31
county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health authori¬
ties; hospital and specialist services are administered by five Regi°nal Hospital
Boards appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 84 Boards of Management
(the equivalent of hospital management committees in England); and there are 25
Executive Councils, each serving the area of one or more local health authorities
The teaching hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the Regional Hospital
Boards, but special Medical Education Committees consider matters relating to
medical teaching. The Scottish Health Services Council and its Standing Advisory
Committees advise the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central
Health Services Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 355.
Health Service Finance
Annual expenditure on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
amounts to about 3i per cent of total national resources. The greater part of the
cost falls on the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation, and a small part is
met from local rates. Other income is derived from the National Health Service
contribution paid with the National Insurance contribution (see p. 34 ) an rom
the payments for those parts of the Service for which charges are made.
To help to limit expenditure without reducing the services offered, it was found
necessary in 1951 and again in 1952 to introduce charges for certain items in the
Service. There is a charge of is. for each item prescribed on a prescription foim,
and charges are also made for dentures and spectacles (except children s spectacles
in standard frames), for elastic hosiery supplied in the family doctor service or hos¬
pital out-patients’ department, for certain appliances supplied to out-patients, tor
treatment in the dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given
to persons under 21 or to nursing or expectant mothers), and for some local health
authority services. Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply
to the National Assistance Board for help in meeting any of these charges. Ln er
the 1946 Act a limited number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients wishing
for privacy, provided that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds tor
non-paying patients. Charges for these ‘ amenity’ beds are fixed under Regulations.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private
patients’ accommodation on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation an
treatment. Such patients may make private arrangements for treatment by a doctor
of their own choice. . • Q
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried or part-time; part-t m
medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept private
patients. General medical practitioners in public service are remunerated main y
by capitation fees according to the number of persons on their lists.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed sea e
of fees according to the items of treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists is-
pensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they dispense.
2A

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the Supplementary Ophthalmic Ser¬
vice are paid on the basis of the number of sight tests made; opticians who dispense
spectacles are paid according to the number of pairs supplied.
A committee set up in 1953 to review the present and prospective cost of the
Health Service found no opportunity for making recommendations which would
either produce new sources of income or reduce substantially the annual cost of the
Service. It found that the real cost of the Service, after allowing for rising prices, had
increased little during the years 1949-54 while many of the services provided were
substantially expanded and improved.1
Hospital and Specialist Services
The hospital and specialist services include the provision of consultants; hospitals
of all kinds including maternity accommodation, tuberculosis sanatoria, mental
hospitals and institutions for the mentally defective, infectious-disease units, con¬
valescent homes and rehabilitation centres; and all forms of specialized treatment.
At the end of 1956, there were in the Service in England and Wales 2,662 hospitals
(including teaching hospitals) with about 482,400 available beds and a nursing
and midwifery staff of some 145,800 full-time and 35,500 part-time nurses. In
Scotland, there were 400 hospitals with about 66,600 beds and some 21,000 full¬
time and 5,000 part-time nurses and midwives. A small number of hospitals remain
outside the Service for special reasons. Most of these are run by Religious Orders.
An expanded programme of new hospital building and increased expenditure on
capital improvements in existing hospitals was begun in 1956.
Teaching Hospitals
The 26 London teaching hospitals are in fact groups of hospitals, and include 97
hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes or treatment centres. The 10
teaching hospitals in Wales or in the provinces cover some 67 hospitals and other
establishments.
Rehabilitation
The importance of rehabilitation as a facet of medical treatment is firmly estab¬
lished and, today, hospital treatment is not limited to the relief of pain, or alleviation
or cure of pathological conditions, but aims at restoring the individual’s functional
capacity without delay. Special rehabilitation facilities are provided, for those
requiring them, in the departments of physical medicine and occupational therapy
at the main hospitals, and in a few special rehabilitation centres which are not
attached to any hospital. The work is carried out under the guidance of the appro¬
priate medical specialist by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational thera¬
pists and social workers, working as a team. Experience has shown that efficient
medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in hospital, the incidence of permanent dis¬
ability and the period of incapacity for full work. The departments work in close
association with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour
and National Service (see pp. 279-80). Rehabilitation methods have been applied
with advantage in the care of the chronic sick, aged and handicapped and have
enabled many patients to become self-sufficient or to be discharged from hospital
and to resume an independent life in their owm homes.

Blood Transfusion
The National Blood Transfusion Service is administered by the regional hospital
boards under the National Health Service. Each region maintains an organization
for collecting blood within the region. Voluntary donors, recruited from the public,
give their blood without payment. It is kept in the Regional Blood Bank, or issued
to Area Blood Banks which are maintained at general hospitals in each county. There
are two central laboratories administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf
of the Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which prepares
grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it, and the
Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma fractions.
Medico-Social Work
There are over 1,000 trained almoners working in Britain; the majority work in
hospitals, others in local health authority sendees or elsewhere. The almoner
co-operates with the medical staff in the investigation and treatment of disease by
elucidating and adjusting social and economic factors which contribute to a patient s
disability or impede his restoration to health. Psychiatric social workers are specially
trained for work in the mental health and education services. They are an invaluable
complement to doctors, not only in mental and mental deficiency hospitals but also
in the local health and education services, in assessing the environmental factors in
mental abnormalities and in helping patients to make the necessary adjustments to
their environment.
The General Practitioner Services
The General Practitioner Services cover the medical attention given to individuals
by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those enrolled in the
Service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own surgeries; in a few places
they practise in health centres established under the National Health Seivice Acts.
Nearly 24,000, or almost all, general practitioners (principals and assistants) in
Great Britain take some part in the Service. .
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the Service at its start in the
place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice have to
apply through their Executive Councils to the central Medical Practices Com¬
mittee, so that a better distribution of doctors throughout the country may be
facilitated. The maximum number of patients’ names permitted to be on one
principal’s list is 3,500. The average number in England and Wales is about 2,200.
Of about 11,200 dentists in England and Wales available for general practice,
about q,8oo are in the Service, and in Scotland 1,155 dentists (practically all those
in general practice) are in the General Dental Service.
Over 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,000 ophthalmic and dis¬
pensing opticians in England and Wales, and 70 ophthalmic medical practitioners
and 900 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland, are engaged in the bupp e-
mentary Ophthalmic Service. This service provides for the testing of sight and pro¬
vision of spectacles. Cases requiring treatment are dealt with through the hospital
eye service. •
Almost all chemists (nearly 16,000 in England and Wales and 2,600 in Scotland)
are taking part in the Service.
Local Health Services
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough
councils (in Scotland, county and large burgh councils) include those for maternity
and child welfare (but not hospitals and maternity homes), domiciliary midwifery,
362
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
vaccination and immunization, health visiting, home nursing, the prevention of
illness and the care and after-care of the sick (including the mentally ill and also the
mentally defective), the provision of domestic help (in such circumstances as sick¬
ness, confinement or old age), the ambulance service (in Scotland, the responsibility
of the Secretary of State), and the establishment and maintenance of local health
centres (in Scotland, the responsibility of the Secretary of State).
Welfare Centres
Maternity and child welfare centres have been established for many years. In
England and Wales there are about 5,500 child welfare, 2,000 ante-natal and 230
post-natal clinics. In Scotland there are about 430 child welfare, 107 ante-natal and
84 post-natal clinics. These are part of the advisory and preventive services of the
local health authority and they provide regular supervision by nurses and doctors for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Special sessions for test feeding
and for remedial exercises are also arranged at some centres. A special feature of the
service is the education of mothers by means of talks, demonstrations and classes.
Practically all centres are distribution points for the national dried milk and vitamin
preparations provided for expectant mothers and young children which are distri¬
buted by local health authorities (see below). In England and Wales more than 75
per cent of all babies are taken to the centres.
Maternal Care
According to the advice given by the doctor or midwife and her own preference,
the expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital; in alloca¬
ting hospital beds, priority is given to those for whom domiciliary confinement is
inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home conditions.
For a home confinement every mother has available to her the services of either a
general practitioner obstetrician or her own family doctor if he is willing to under¬
take her maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife employed in the domici¬
liary service of the local health authority. The doctor carries out certain ante-natal
and post-natal examinations, attends at the confinement if he thinks it necessary,
and gives any other medical care required. The services of a consultant obstetrician
are also available if the doctor thinks it necessary to ask him to advise. Routine super¬
vision and advice is provided by the midwife, who visits regularly before the con¬
finement for the purpose of examination and to give the mother advice and help.
In addition, the expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction
in preparation for motherhood and in some cases for interim ante-natal supervision.
The midwife delivers the patient (unless the doctor considers it necessary to be
present) and continues in attendance for the first 14 days after the birth. Midwives
work in close touch with the welfare centres in the care of the mother both before
and after the birth of the child.
Welfare Foods Service
Local health authorities distribute the welfare foods, other than liquid milk, that
the Welfare Foods Service1 provides for expectant and nursing mothers and young
children, at a low cost or free of charge. These foods are National Dried Milk as an
1 The Service began as a war-time measure with the National Milk Scheme in 1940, but
in 1946 the Government decided to continue the extended scheme as part of the peace¬
time social services. Beneficiaries now obtain the necessary coupons from the Ministry of
Pensions and National Insurance.

alternative to liquid milk1 and at an equivalent price; orange juice, at 5d. a six-fluid-
ounce bottle, and cod liver oil, free of charge, for expectant mothers and for children
under two and five; vitamin A and D tablets, free of charge for expectant mothers as
an alternative to cod liver oil, and also for mothers for 3® weeks after confinement.
Milk and orange juice are supplied free to expectant mothers and to children under
school age if the families cannot afford to pay.
Other Maternity and Child Welfare Services
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature babies
remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing experienced
nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are some 650 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain pro¬
vided by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with them. The
National Health Service Act, 1952, gave local authorities power to make charges
for the use of day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries (of which there are about
450 altogether) must be registered with the local health authorities; this regulation
applies also to persons who mind for payment more than two children, not all of the
same family.
Local authorities co-operate with voluntary denominational and other bodies
caring for unmarried mothers and their babies, or make direct provision for their
special needs through welfare workers, homes, hostels and nurseries, and by finding
suitable foster-mothers.
Health Visiting
Health visitors, who are qualified nurses with special additional training, give
expert advice to mothers in their own homes on such matters as breast feeding, the
general care of the baby, and the nurture of children up to five years old. They are
also responsible for giving advice on the care of the sick and the measures necessary
to prevent the spread of infection. They, together with special tuberculosis visitors,
have a particular interest in tuberculosis. They are also employed in the School
Health Service.
Home Nursing
The employment of nurses for attending persons who require nursing in their
own homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Although many
authorities employ nurses directly for this purpose, others have entered into arrange¬
ments with voluntary organizations to provide a service on their behalf.
Domestic Help
Local health authorities have the power to make arrangements for providing
domestic help in households where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or
the presence of children, old people or mental defectives. This is not one of the
free services and authorities are authorized to recover from those assisted such
charges as the authorities consider reasonable, having regard to the person s means.
Ambulance Services
Free conveyance by ambulance between home and hospital or clinic is provided,
where necessary, either directly by local health authorities or, on their behalf, by
1 The liquid milk allowance (which is obtained through the usual retail channels) is one
pint a day at qd. a pint for expectant mothers, children under five, and children between
five and sixteen who are physically or mentally disabled and are unable to attend school
(where they would receive milk).

voluntary organizations. The Hospital Car Service (organized by the St. John
Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, and the Women’s Voluntary
Services) provides transport in many areas for patients who do not require an ambu¬
lance ; such patients are conveyed in private cars whose owners volunteer to give this
service, and the authorities make a mileage payment to the volunteers to cover their
expenses. In Scotland, ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance Service
(St. Andrew’s Ambulance Association and the Scottish Branch of the British Red
Cross Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State.
Mental Health Services
Persons who are suffering from mental illness can consult the family doctor and
receive specialist advice at hospital out-patient clinics in the ordinary way. If they
need to enter a mental hospital they can do so as voluntary patients with little
formality. If need be, they may be admitted under Order as temporary or certified
patients. If patients, or their relatives, are unable or unwilling to make the
necessary arrangements for admission to a mental hospital, it is the duty of a duly
authorized officer of the local health authority to do so. The local health authority is
expected to offer a welfare service to such patients, whether before admission or to
help their rehabilitation on discharge.
Local health authorities have a duty to ascertain mental defectives in the com¬
munity, to supervise them and to provide, where practicable, suitable training or
occupation. This is given in occupation centres where the defectives attend daily,
as at school, or by home teaching. If supervision affords insufficient protection it
is the duty of officers of the local health authority to take the initial steps to place
such defectives under guardianship within the community or to arrange for their
admission to a mental deficiency hospital.
Prevention of Illness: Care and After-Care
Measures for the prevention of tuberculosis, e.g., the tracing of sources of infec¬
tion, the prevention of its spread, and the removal of the cause of infection, are the
responsibility of all the local health authorities. Facilities for diagnosis and treat¬
ment are the responsibility of the hospital service and are provided through sana¬
toria and chest clinics. The chest physicians staffing these clinics are often employed
jointly by the hospital authorities and local health authorities, to ensure that diagnosis
and treatment are properly co-ordinated with prevention and after-care. Among the
duties of these officers are those of making recommendations for residential treat¬
ment, visiting the homes of patients, and examining and advising ‘ contacts ’. They
are assisted in this work by tuberculosis health visitors and nurses. Most local health
authorities have statutory or voluntary tuberculosis care committees.
Mass miniature radiography was introduced in 1943 as a means of early diagnosis
of tuberculosis. About 75 units now operate under the regional hospital boards in
England and Wales, in close co-operation with local health authorities; there are
10 units in Scotland. They examine over three million persons a year, concentrating
increasingly on areas with a bad record for tuberculosis, on specially susceptible
groups in the population, and on adults in regular contact with organized groups of
children.
Care and after-care of patients is supplemented by general advice and assistance
given to households in which the patients live. Local health authorities send suitable
patients to the village settlements for tuberculous persons which are run by volun¬
tary bodies or by local health authorities of other areas; and training for employ¬
ment is carried out in conjunction with the training and resettlement schemes of
the Ministry of Labour and National Service (see pp. 279-80).
SOCIAL WELFARE
Care and after-care arrangements are made by all local health authorities for other
types of illness, including mental illness or mental defectiveness.
As part of their preventive work, local health authorities give help and advice to
families which may be in difficulties and in danger of breaking up (see also p. 354)-
A charge may be made for some of these services, if the person wishing to make
use of them can reasonably be expected to contribute towards their cost.
Vaccination and Immunization
Arrangements for vaccination against smallpox and immunization against
diphtheria, without charge, as part of the National Health Service, are made y
all local health authorities; in addition, most local health authorities have simi ar
arrangements for immunization against whooping cough, and a small number have
authority to provide for immunization against tetanus. In 1956 there were only
deaths from diphtheria in England and Wales as against 2,641 m 19415 m Scotland,
only 2 deaths as against 517 in 194
Vaccination against poliomyelitis was introduced in 1956 and extended in 1957-
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis is available to certain adults and children.
Health Centres
A few health centres have been established, differing widely in size and character
according to local need. Experience shows that they are likely to be most successful
in areas of housing development where new services are needed. 1 he need to
observe the working of the largely experimental centres already provided and to
conserve scarce resources is likely to prevent any general expansion of the service
in the near future. In Scotland, where the provision of health centres is the direc
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, two have been built.
HEALTH SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland the historical development of the health services has taken
broadly the same course as in other parts of the United Kingdom and the Health
Service established under the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, corre¬
sponds fairly closely to the medical care system established under the National
Health Service in Great Britain. The essential principle is that the same range ot
services shall be available to citizens in Northern Ireland as in England Wales and
Scotland. The Service in Northern Ireland is financed as in the rest of the United
Kingdom. ^ .
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite so
immediate or direct as in Great Britian, and hospital property, for example, is vested
not in the Minister of Health and Local Government but in the Northern Ireland
Hospitals Authority. The Hospitals Authority has under its control 62 hospitals
and three special care institutions containing in all about 14,9°° beds.
The Tuberculosis Service is on a separate footing from the main Hospital Service,
having been established a little earlier to deal urgently with a serious tuberculosis
problem. The Northern Ireland Tuberculosis Authority, which was constituted for
the prevention of tuberculosis and the care of tuberculous patients by the Public
Health (Tuberculosis) Act (Northern Ireland), 1946> has eight hospitals under its
Vaccination against smallpox is compulsory in Northern Ireland but otherwise
the range of preventive and domiciliary services is similar to that existing in Great
Britain. Domestic help (whole-time or part-time) for aged or handicapped persons
and expectant mothers is provided by county welfare authorities under the Welfare
Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949-
366
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
VOLUNTARY AID FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organizations provide services of various kinds for sick
and handicapped persons in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision
made by central and local authorities. Some convalescent homes, for instance, of a
type outside the scope of the hospital service, are administered by such bodies. In
many areas invalid children and others needing care in their own homes are visited
and helped by voluntary organizations. Though the need for material aid from pri¬
vate sources becomes less as public provision extends, many forms of help to meet
individual needs that would not otherwise be met are given by voluntary agencies.
Their most valuable service is probably to provide personal service and the con¬
tinued personal interest that can contribute so much to the welfare of the sick and
infirm. These voluntary agencies usually depend largely on the work, part-time or
full-time, of unpaid volunteers.
A great deal of voluntary help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and indi¬
vidual voluntary helpers. More than half the hospitals in England and Wales have
their own Leagues of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who organize
and undertake a variety of services for their hospitals. Many hospitals also have help
from the British Red Cross Society, the Order of St. John, the Women’s Voluntary
Services, or a similar organization. The operation of canteens for out-patients and
trolley-shops and library services for in-patients, visiting in the wards, receiving
new patients, and mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken.
THE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from medical practitioners, only persons
whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise dentistry in Britain. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, plus one year as an intern; for a dentist,
four or more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical
profession is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists
is the General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for State registra¬
tion as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children’s, mental, and mental deficiency nursing. The enrolled assistant nurse
has taken an essentially practical training for one year, followed by a year’s work
under supervision before her enrolment. The governing body of the nursing pro¬
fession is the General Nursing Council, set up in 1919.
Only registered pharmaceutical chemists may practise as pharmacists or describe
themselves as such, and qualifications requiring four to five years’ academic study
and practical training are necessary for registration. The Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain is the governing body of the profession.
For the professions of almoner, chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory techni¬
cian, occupational therapist, psychiatric social worker, physiotherapist, radiographer
and speech therapist a good general education is required followed by a professional
training. The length and nature of the training varies according to the profession,
and may be as long as three years.
MEDICAL RESEARCH
The Medical Research Council (see p. 412) is the chief organization engaged in
medical research in Britain, although the Health Ministers are also able to initiate and
maintain research work as part of the National Health Service (see p. 357). Hospital
SOCIAL WELFARE

boards and committees have power to conduct research, and it is a function of teach¬
ing hospitals to provide the facilities required for clinical research by the universities
with which they are associated. The Public Health Laboratory Service, administered
by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health, in addition to its more
routine duties, undertakes research on problems of bacteriology, virology and
epidemiology, thus providing an important complement to the work of the Council.
A valuable contribution to research in particular branches of medicine is made by
private organizations, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the
Nuffield Foundation are the largest. There is close collaboration between the
Medical Research Council and these other organizations to ensure the best alloca¬
tion of their respective resources.
Work of the Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council’s programme of work, carried out both in its own
research establishments (see Appendix II, pp. 459-6i) and by independent in¬
vestigators, in the universities and elsewhere, receiving grants from the Council,
includes fundamental studies of the structure and natural processes of the body ;
clinical and laboratory studies of disease; the development and evaluation of special
methods of treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of social
and occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.
In planning and carrying out its programme, the Council may be assisted by tech¬
nical committees which it appoints to advise on special subjects. An important
advisory committee to the Council is the Clinical Research Board, set up m con¬
sultation with the Elealth Departments to assist the development of clinical research
in the National Health Service.
The Public Health Laboratory Service
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales to assist in the diagnosis,
prevention and control of epidemic diseases, the largest establishment being the
Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, in north-west London, which
includes the National Collection of Type Cultures, the Standards Laboratory for
the Supply of Diagnostic Cultures and Sera, and reference laboratories specializing
in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
EDUCATION
There are nearly nine million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, training colleges or technical colleges in the United King¬
dom. Over 90 per cent of school children attend publicly provided or aided schools.
The universities are independent, self-governing institutions but are aided from
public funds. Most technical colleges and other centres of further education are
publicly maintained. Many schools and colleges continue to benefit from the endow¬
ments provided by benefactors in past centuries. .
The bulk of expenditure on education in the United Kingdom therefore comes
from public funds. It is estimated for 1957-58 that total public expenditure on
education, which is increasing, will be about £733 million. This includes expendi¬
ture on university education. Of public expenditure on education other than in the
universities, at present about 60 per cent comes from taxes and about 40 per cent
from local rates.
In England and Wales, the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning of
the present century. In 1833 the Government had begun to make annual grants to
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
368
the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the Elementary Educa¬
tion Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory education. By the end of the
nineteenth century, elementary education had become virtually both compulsory
and free. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started
in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public
education in England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational oppor¬
tunities at every stage.
The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems both have long histories
independent of that of education in England, but the same general policy is now
being implemented throughout the United Kingdom, with some national variations.
Educational Administration
Administration of publicly provided education in Britain is divided between the
central Government Departments (the Ministry of Education for England and
Wales, the Scottish Education Department, and the Ministry of Education for
Northern Ireland), local education authorities, and various voluntary organizations.
The relation between these three groups is based on consultation and co-operation,
both by direct contact between the parties and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors
who act as liaison officers, particularly between local education authorities and the
Departments.
The local education authorities (called education authorities in Scotland) are
responsible for ensuring that adequate provision is made in their areas for the two
stages of school education (primary and secondary), and that those pupils who
would profit by proceeding to a university have the opportunity of doing so. They
are also responsible for the provision of all forms of ‘further education’, i.e. post¬
school education outside the universities.
All schools, including independent schools (which, from September 1957, must
be registered), are subject to official inspection.
SCHOOLS
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or otherwise, between the ages of 5 and 15. In England
and Wales over 6,720,000 children, including about 180,000 under and 249,000 over
compulsory school age, are attending publicly maintained schools, besides 102,000
others (including 1,500 under and 29,000 over school age) who are at schools
receiving direct grants from the Ministry of Education. There are also about half
a million children of all ages at independent schools. In Scotland, 840,000 children
are attending publicly maintained or aided schools and about 21,000 are at indepen¬
dent schools. In Northern Ireland, 257,000 children (including 14,000 under and
20,000 over compulsory school age) are attending publicly maintained or aided
schools; independent schools are few.
In England and in Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to be taught
together in primary schools, but more often than not they attend separate secondary
schools. Mixed schools are more common in Wales; and in Scotland all but a few
city schools take both boys and girls.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except in classes
for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are co-educational.
In England and Wales three broad types of school are supported from public
funds: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained by local
education authorities, i.e. their full cost falls on public funds; voluntary schools
which have been provided by a voluntary body (usually of a religious denomination)
SOCIAL WELFARE
369
but which are maintained by local education authorities; and direct grant schools
which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive a
grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education. These last (the smallest group) mostly
provide education of the grammar school type; they include some schools of ancient
^n^cotland, most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by
education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used
for a type of independent school of which there are also a few m Scotland and
Northern Ireland). There are also a few grant-aided schools (some of ancient
foundation) conducted by voluntary managers which receive grants direct horn
the Scottish Education Department. , u 1 1
In Northern Ireland, there are county schools, managed by local educati >n
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under voluntary
England and Wales, no fees are charged to parents of children attending schools
maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment are supphe
free. Grammar schools receiving grants direct from the Ministry of Education st
charge fees but they are required to offer each year, to pupils who have at any tim
previously attended a grant-aided primary school for not less than two years, fre
places to the extent of not less than 25 per cent of the previous year s admission to
the upper school; and a further 25 per cent of the places must be put at the disposal
of the local education authorities if they require them. Pupils occupying these latt
places need not previously have attended a grant-aided primary schooh Day pupils
not holding free places are entitled to claim a remission of fees in accordance with
an approved income scale, and the Ministry pays the governors of the school the
amount of the fees so remitted. Local education authorities also pay for some free
places in independent schools, which normally charge fees. A number of mdepen
dent schools are able to offer some scholarships from endowments.
In Scotland, education authorities may charge fees in certain schools provided
that this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all wh° lt>
In Northern Ireland, no fees are charged to parents of children attending a y
county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school; qualified pupils
attending both county and voluntary grammar schools receive scholarships from
the local education authorities which cover the whole or most of the fees charged
by the school.
Primary Schools • 1 j vn
A child’s primary education continues until about the age of 11 m England, Wales
and Northern Ireland and .a in Scotland. There are some tmmrv rrtoolr and classes
for children between 2 and 5 years old. In England and Wales there are tn/ant schools
or departments, for all children between 5 and 7 and junior schools for those aged 7 to
11. In Scotland there are primary departments for children between 5 and 12 years old.
Secondary Schools . . .
Public provision of secondary education is being greatly extended with the aim
of providing for all children an education suited to their particular abilities.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
In England and Wales, the grammar school takes children who hope to reach a
university and others likely to profit from an academic type of education. A 1 g
proportion of university students are recruited from these schoo s which, in England
and Wales, are attended by about one secondary school pupil in our. econ ary
37°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
modern schools form the largest group of secondary schools. They give a general
education with a practical bias, closely related to the interests and environment of
their pupils. The secondary technical schools are the smallest group and offer an
education largely related to industry, including commerce, or agriculture. Each
local education authority decides how the selection shall be made for its secondary
schools: generally speaking, this selection depends upon an assessment of the child’s
ability as shown in the primary school, often coupled with objective tests taken
at about eleven years of age. There is provision for an appeal to the Minister of
Education in the event of a dispute between a local education authority and a
parent, and almost all authorities reconsider original decisions when subsequent
events prove this to be necessary.
Two types of education may be given in one school—a bilateral school; some
authorities are establishing comprehensive schools providing all types of secondary
education.
In Northern Ireland, the secondary intermediate school is the equivalent of the
secondary modern school in England and Wales. Technical intermediate schools in
Noithern Ireland offer the same facilities as secondary technical schools in England
and Wales.
IVlost grammar school pupils remain until they are 16 years old, some until they
are 17, 18 or 19. Most secondary modern pupils at present leave at the age of 15,
but the number staying on until the age of 16 is increasing.
Scotland
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing courses
extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary schools, and
those providing courses of five or six years, known as senior secondary schools. In
each type of school the courses are intended to provide a general education, but
they are differentiated in character to suit the varying needs and abilities of the
pupils, and include literary, commercial, boys’ technical, domestic and rural courses.
While some schools are purely junior secondary and some purely senior secondary,
there are also a number of schools of the ‘ comprehensive ’ type in which all kinds of
courses, both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Many schools
also provide modified courses for pupils of limited ability for whom the normal
courses are too exacting.
Promotion from the primary to the secondary school takes place usually between
the ages of 11J and 12J. The fitness of pupils to profit from the various types of
secondary course is assessed on the basis of teachers’ estimates of attainment, intelli¬
gence tests, and attainment tests, with due regard to the wishes of the parents. There
is provision for an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the event of a dis¬
pute between the education authority and the parent and also for the reconsideration
of original allocations where transfer to another course subsequently appears to be
necessary.
Independent Schools
The largest and most important of the independent schools are known in England
as public schools, although not all schools classed as public schools are indepen¬
dent (those which are not are mostly direct-grant schools) and public schools form
only a minority of all independent schools.
The public school is a characteristic English institution which has made a notable
contribution to English education. Many public schools date from the sixteenth
century, some are older (e.g., Winchester, founded in 1382, and Eton, founded in
1440), and many have some income from endowments. Each is controlled by its
SOCIAL WELFARE
371
own Board of Governors. Public schools have emphasized the importance of
character-building, and in these schools were developed the prefect system, whereby
day-to-day discipline is largely maintained by the pupils themselves, and the house
system, whereby a school is divided into groups of about 50, each under the care ot
a housemaster. The public school is also characterized by a high staffing ratio and
a high proportion of pupils doing advanced work. A public school is often, althoug
not necessarily, a boarding school; day boys are also taken at some of these boarding
schools. The usual age of entry to the independent public schools f°r boYs 13 x3 and
the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public schools modelled to a certain
extent on the public schools for boys. , ,
There are also preparatory schools, most of them boarding schools, for boys aged
from about 8 to 13 years of age who are intending to enter public schools, some
similar schools for girls and a wide range of other day and boarding schools
covering every age group and grade of education and every variety of educational
method Some of these schools are owned and managed, often under a trust deed,
by independent non-profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned by pro¬
prietors for whom the running of the school provides a living.
Secondary School Examinations
In 1951, the General Certificate of Education superseded the former School
Certificate and Higher Certificate examinations in the secondary schools (State-
aided and independent alike) of England and Wales. This examination, which may
also be taken by candidates not attending school, is conducted at three levels
(ordinary, advanced and scholarship). Most candidates are at least 16 years old on
1 st September of the year of their examination, but a child can sit at an earlier age
at the discretion of the headmaster or headmistress of the school and many do so.
In Scotland, the courses in senior secondary schools lead to presentation for the
Scottish Leaving Certificate at about the age of 17, although many pupils who are
under 17 take the examination. The certificate, which can be taken only by pupils
in attendance at Scottish schools, is awarded on examinations conducted by t e
Scottish Education Department. . . , u . „
In Northern Ireland, the Junior Certificate Examination is taken at about the age
of 15 and the Senior Certificate Examination, which is conducted at two levels, at
about 17 years of age.
T eachers
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing bodies
or managers. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland they are not subject to
official control on questions relating to curricula or methods. In Scotland, schemes
of work in primary and secondary departments are subject to the approval ot one
of Her Majesty’s Inspectors, and no pupil may be presented for the Scottish eaving
Certificate examination unless he has followed a course approved by the Scottis
Education Department. . . • ,
In 1956, there was one full-time teacher to 27 pupils in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in England and Wales; the figure was 24 for
Scotland and 30 for Northern Ireland. The high birth rate at the end of the second
world war is the chief of several factors in the present need for more teachers.
There are 155 teachers’ training colleges in England and Wales. At present, .e
usual training course lasts for two years, but there are three-year courses for women
taking housecraft or physical education and the ordinary course is to be extended
to three years in September i960. There are 23 university departments of education
providing a one-year course for graduates. In Scotland, there are four genera
372
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
training centres, two denominational training colleges and a college for women
teachers of physical education. Courses are normally of one year’s duration for
graduates or the equivalent, and of three years for non-graduates. Northern Ireland
has two general teachers training colleges, one university training department and
three specialist colleges one for training teachers of physical education, one for
teachers of domestic science and one for teachers of art. The basic course in the
general training colleges lasts three years.
The Education Departments, the universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short courses for practising teachers. Teachers
from schools in the United Kingdom go to a number of overseas countries each year
under interchange schemes or schemes for temporary overseas posts.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland; and these scales influence the salaries paid to teachers in many
independent schools. There are also national superannuation schemes which are
the responsibility of the central Departments.
In England and Wales, agreed salary scales are submitted to the Minister by
joint committees of representatives of local education authorities’ and teachers’
associations. The best-known of these committees are the Burnham Committees
dealing with the salaries of teachers in primary and secondary schools and in
establishments of further education.
I he Minister can accept or reject (but not modify) the committees’ recommen¬
dations and make the approved scales mandatory on local education authorities.
Broadcasting and Visual Aids
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out over 50 sound transmissions a week which reach nearly 28,000 schools in
the United Kingdom, some 73 Per cent of the possible total. School broadcasting
does not attempt to cover the whole school curriculum, or to replace the teacher,
but to supplement existing work in the schools.
Experimental television services for schools began in 1957 (see also p. 444). Other
visual aids to education films, film strips, wall charts, pictures, and models—are
being increasingly used in Britain’s schools.
Religion in Schools
In England and Wales, all children in county or voluntary schools, that is, all
schools wholly or partly financed by local authorities, receive religious instruction
and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless their parents object. In
county schools, and in certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruc¬
tion of an undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary
school1 there is opportunity for denominational instruction. Over a third of the
schools maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are volun¬
tary schools and the majority of these are Church of England primary schools.
There are nearly 2,000 Roman Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers
belonging to other religious bodies. In county schools in Northern Ireland clergy
have a right of access to give denominational instruction to children of their per¬
suasion for a limited period each week. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the
individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruction are in the hands of
1 The majority of voluntary schools are either ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools. The
controlled school has less independence than the aided school: for example, in the con-
trolled school, denominational instruction may be given only for two periods a week, and
only to children whose parents desire it. The aided school, however, has financial obliga¬
tions for part of its maintenance, whereas the controlled school has none.

the school managers, but there are a number of denominational schools conducted
by education authorities. • i +
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part ol the
life and education of the independent public schools and most of these schools are
linked to some religious denomination.
Health and Welfare of School Children
Physical education forms part of the general curriculum in all schools.
The School Health Service provides regular medical examination and certain
free treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local education
authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child guidance centres.
(There are also child guidance clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern
Ireland the School Health Service is operated by the health authorities.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all children m schools
who wish to have it, and the School Meals Service provides a daily dinner at a
subsidized price (remitted where there is need) to nearly half the pupils m coun y
and voluntary schools. Free transport is provided for children attending these
schools who live more than a reasonable walking distance from their schools
defined as two miles for those under eight years (i i years m Northern Ireland) and
three miles for those over eight years. ... • , ,
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is provided
between the ages of five (or less) and 16 for children who require it on account of
any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment There are over 800
special schools in the United Kingdom, including hospital schools, day and boaid-
ing schools, and boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary
schools.
School Building . „ . .
An extensive building programme for education has been undertaken in Britain
since the end of the second world war. In the early post-war years, schools, together
with factories and houses, were given priority over the claims of less essential forms
°f Many war-damaged schools had to be repaired or rebuilt. Entirely new schools
both primary and secondary, were needed to provide for the increased number of
school children and their longer school life, and for the many post-war housing
estates and for the new towns; new buildings were also needed to repiace or impro
those which, by modern standards, were out of date and ill-equipped. Althoug
3,000 new post-war schools had been completed in the United Kingdom by June
lor? and over 1,000 more were under construction, much remains to be done.
Advantage is being taken of this opportunity to raise standards m public educa¬
tional building and to introduce new ideas and methods in the design and construc¬
tion of schools. Education authorities are using both traditional and new method
of building. Post-war school buildings are light and airy, with an imaginative use
of colour and generous provision of practical rooms and space for outdoor games
Local education authorities are responsible for providing the schools an
buildings needed for public education in their areas, but the central Departments
exercise control by approving annual building programmes, framing a ion ,
fixing cost limits and approving or rejecting the authorities plans, ey a
guidance to authorities in the form of building bulletins and in other ways.
UNIVERSITIES
There are 16 universities in England, four in Scotland, the University of Wales,
and the Queen’s University of Belfast in Northern Ireland.
374
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The English universities are: Oxford, Cambridge, London, Birmingham, Bristol,
Durham, Exeter, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham,
Reading, Sheffield and Southampton. There is also the University College of
North Staffordshire, which is empowered to award its own Bachelor of Arts
degree.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the other universities
were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are each composed of a number of
residential colleges. These colleges are corporate bodies governed by their own
Fellows and distinct from the university. Most of the Fellows of the colleges are
university teachers or officers and the majority of university teachers are also
Fellows of colleges. The universities, as distinct from the colleges, own the main
libraries, laboratories, and other buildings used for teaching and research.
The other universities in Britain are in the main non-residential and most are
non-collegiate. Those which are composed of groups of largely autonomous colleges
are London, with over 19,000 students by far the largest of Britain’s universities;
Durham, which includes King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne; and St. Andrews
University, which consists of colleges in St. Andrews itself and in Dundee. The
University of Wales comprises the University Colleges of Aberystwyth, Bangor,
Cardiff and Swansea, and the Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff. The
Queen’s University of Belfast recognizes Magee University College, Londonderry,
for certain arts courses.
The Education Departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and their
relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school teachers, the
provision of extra-mural education, and the award of scholarships from public
funds. The universities receive aid from the State mainly in the form of direct
grants from the Treasury which, in Great Britain, are made on the advice of the
University Grants Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer from persons with experience of university administration and
education.
The proportion of university income provided by the Exchequer is increasing
and in 1955-56 was over 70 per cent for the United Kingdom. Another 3 per cent
was contributed by local authorities, 11 per cent by fees, and the balance by endow¬
ments and other sources.
Students
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no religious
test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with men, but at
Cambridge their numbers are limited by statute (as they were at Oxford until 1957).
The general proportion of men to women students is three to one; at Oxford it is
six to one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
All universities in Britain limit the number of undergraduates; in spite of
the increase in these limits which has taken place since the end of the second world
war, the demand for places continues to be very keen and many candidates are
unable to gain entrance to the university of their first choice.
In the year 1956-57 there were over 91,000 full-time students at universities or
university colleges in the United Kingdom. Although the total shows an increase of
77 per cent over the pre-war number, a further increase to at least 106,000 by the
mid-1960s is already planned for Great Britain alone, and still greater expansion is
under consideration.

Studies and Degrees .
Courses in arts and science are offered by all universities and at nearly alum-
versities courses are available in one or more applied sciences. In the year 195 b 57,
43 per cent of full-time university students in Great Britain were taking arts courses
and S7 per cent were studying science or technology (including medicine).
University degree courses generally extend over three, four years; though m
medicine five or six years are required. The first degree of Bachelor (Master in
Scotland) is awarded on the completion of such a course depending on satisfactory
examination results. In most universities an ordinary (or pass courses

University Expansion for Science and Technology
As part of a national programme to expand provision for technological education
and research, a large programme of building for science and technology was begun
in the universities in 1953. The programme includes extensions to the Imperial
College of Science and Technology in the University of London to enable the
number of students to be increased from 1,650 to 3,000 by the end of 1962, major
developments at Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds Universities, and
specialized developments at other universities.
Over and above the large sums required for the expansion of Imperial College,
other university buildings of all kinds to the value of about £4'8 million were begun
in 1956 and projects to the value of £10-4 million have been authorized to be started
in 1957, and of £12 million for each of the years 1958 and 1959. These amounts are
only those to be met from taxes and exclude sums collected by the universities
towards the cost of their own buildings.
About two-thirds of the additional students who are expected to be in the uni¬
versities by about 1965 will be students of science or technology.
TECHNICAL COLLEGES
In England and Wales there are over 550 technical or commercial educational
establishments, varying from large colleges of technology to small technical insti¬
tutes. Nearly all are maintained by local education authorities but for a few relatively
small and highly specialized industries there are National Colleges and there are
also a relatively small number of independent colleges.
Some 80 per cent of the work done in technical colleges is vocational. Most of it
is part-time but over 330 (more than half) of the technical colleges in England and
Wales (other than art colleges1) provide for full-time students.
Scotland has 16 Central Institutions for further education of which seven are
technical colleges. Five of these have full-time courses leading to their own diploma
or associateship, and in some the greater part of the work is full-time. The full-time
courses are of three or four years’ duration and comparable in scope and standard
with university degree courses. There are close ties between the central institutions
and the universities. The central institutions, working on a regional basis, are sup¬
ported by some 50 local technical colleges, providing full-time and part-time day
courses, and by evening classes at local centres.
Fees at technical colleges are moderate and many full-time students pay no fees.
All local education authorities grant awards to full-time students which cover fees
as well as maintenance, and authorities normally place no limit on the number
of such awards they are prepared to make, provided the students can show the
necessary qualifications.
Technical colleges, in co-operation with industry, provide courses at craftsman
level and at intermediate or technician level, as well as at advanced level. One form
of advanced course which is gaining favour is the ‘sandwich’ course. This lasts
four or five years and involves alternate periods, usually of three to six months, of
full-time theoretical education in a technical college and specially designed prac¬
tical training in industry.
Most of the part-time work is done in the evenings, but an increasing number of
young employees, apprentices and others, are released by their employers to attend
technical classes and some general educational classes during working hours, usually
for one day a week. The number of these day-release students in Great Britain in
i9S5~56 was 412,000.
1 For information on art colleges see pp. 426—7.
SOCIAL WELFARE
377
Part-time courses for the award of National Certificates are provided by the
technical colleges and are approved by joint committees representative of the
Education Departments and the professional body, e.g., the Institution of Mechani¬
cal Engineers. These courses are normally at two levels ordinary and higher.
Most courses for the ordinary certificate last three years and students usually
follow them between the ages of 16 and 19, studying for 150 to 180 hours a year
according to the course. A higher certificate takes a further two years work.
Ordinary and Higher National Diplomas are similar qualifications but require full¬
time instead of part-time study for two or three years.
There are over 300 local technical colleges in England and Wales which provide
courses up to the level of the ordinary national certificate and more than 175 area
colleges which offer, usually in addition to more elementary courses, advanced
courses up to higher national certificate standard, which is, within its range,
approximately that of a first university degree.
There is a growing demand for courses of postgraduate standard at technical
colleges for students who have already obtained a first degree or a higher national
certificate. _ , . , „ • • r*
A considerable amount of research is carried on in technical colleges; this is often
applied research with reference to a local industry. ..... .
In Northern Ireland, the system of technical education is similar to that m
England and Wales and includes courses leading to national certificates. The
Ministry of Education awards junior and senior trade scholarships to apprentices,
to enable them to follow full-time courses of study at the Belfast College of
Technology. The junior course lasts five months and the senior course eight
months.
Expansion of Advanced Courses
In 1956, the Government announced a five-year programme for the expansion of
technical colleges, designed to provide for an increase of about half as many again
in the number of students completing advanced courses and to double the numbers
released by their employers for part-time courses during the day. The cost of the
programme, for buildings and equipment, in the five years 1956-61 was estimated
at nearly £100 million, comprising £70 million to be spent on buildings and £15
million on equipment in England and Wales, and £10 million for buildings and
£2 million for equipment in Scotland. , r 11
Part of the Government’s programme is to develop a small number of colleges
spread over England and Wales as colleges of advanced technology to form the apex
of the structure of technical education; these will concentrate entirely on advanced
work, including postgraduate and research work. Other colleges will be developed as
regional colleges undertaking a good proportion of advanced work. The expansion
of advanced courses is being aided by a special higher rate of grant from central
government funds, introduced in 1952* , , ,
A new national qualification, the Diploma in Technology, has been established
and is administered by a new autonomous body called the National Council for
Technological Awards. The diploma will be awarded for the successful completion
of a course at a technical college approved by the National Council and the courses
will be equivalent in standard to university honours degree courses.
ADULT EDUCATION
Besides making provision for part-time vocational studies, local education
authorities offer comprehensive opportunities for spare-time non-vocational studies
and creative activities. Voluntary bodies are also very active in this sphere.
378
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Evening classes (and some afternoon classes) in a very wide range of subjects,
academic, cultural and practical, are provided in technical colleges and evening
institutes. Many institutes occupy day-school buildings, but other suitable build¬
ings are often used. Students pay a small fee.
The extra-mural departments of the universities and the Workers’ Educational
Association and other voluntary bodies organize cultural, non-vocational courses
with the aid of grants from public funds. Voluntary bodies with a particular view¬
point, such as the National Council of Labour Colleges and the Co-operative
Union, organize adult education courses without grant aid.
There are six residential colleges (five in England and Wales and one in Scotland)
directly aided by the Education Departments which provide one-year or two-year
non-vocational courses for adult students and, since the end of the second world
war, more than 20 residential colleges have been established where adult students
can take short courses lasting from a few days to a few weeks. The latter are, with
few exceptions, either maintained or aided by local education authorities.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a centre of information and
research on adult education and a means of consultation and co-operation for the
many bodies concerned. It is assisted by a grant from the Ministry of Education.
The Scottish Institute of Adult Education carries out similar functions in Scotland.
Education authorities have powers to provide community centres for the use of
people of all ages. Such centres normally provide a mixture of formal and informal
further education. The centres are usually run by community associations, some of
which are affiliated to the National Federation of Community Associations.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS IN BRITAIN
Opportunities for students from overseas to come to Britain to study in univer¬
sities or other educational institutions, or to obtain specialized training in industry
or elsewhere, have greatly expanded since the second world war. There are some
35,ooo overseas students in Britain, of whom about one-third are at universities,
another third at technical colleges, and the remainder training for the law, in indus¬
try, or as hospital nurses. In the year 1956-57, Britain’s universities contained over
6,750 students from Commonwealth countries overseas and 3,650 students from
foreign countries. About 200 British Council scholarships, tenable usually for one
year in the United Kingdom, are awarded annually to graduates of overseas univer¬
sities.1 Twelve Marshall Scholarships for university study in Britain are offered
annually by the United Kingdom Government to graduates from the United States
of America, and the universities and colleges themselves offer many scholarships
for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible.
Universities and other educational institutions in the United Kingdom annually
reserve a proportion of their places for students from the United Kingdom
1 The British Council exists to promote a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and
the English language overseas and to develop closer cultural relations with other countries.
It was founded in 1934 and was granted a Royal Charter in 1940. Nine of the 30 members
of its Executive Committee are nominated by Government Departments; it is financed
almost entirely from public funds, mainly through the Foreign Office. In the Common¬
wealth it acts directly as the agent of the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial
Office. It is usually designated as the Government’s principal instrument for the imple¬
mentation of cultural conventions to which the United Kingdom is a party. The Council
maintains staffs who, in about 60 overseas countries, foster English studies, provide regular
information on British life and thought and promote knowledge of the scientific, literary
and other developments and achievements of the United Kingdom. It arranges study
programmes in the United Kingdom for scholars, teachers and other professional visitors
from overseas.

Dependencies. In January IQ57, there were 12,622 students from United Kingdom
Dependencies studying in the United Kingdom, many of them at universities. Of
this number, 3,167 held scholarships. Some 600 of them were schoiars from
Malaya studying in teachers’ training colleges set up in the United King om y
Government of Malaya. The chief sources of grants are funds set aside by Colonial
Governments (sometimes supplemented by United Kingdom Colonial Deve op-
ment and Welfare funds) and funds provided by public boards and corporations
in the territories. , 1
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to members of Commonwealth countries
overseas. Under the Athlone Fellowship Scheme the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment has from 1951 awarded 38 fellowships a year to engineering graduates in
Canada for up to two years’ further study, training or research in institutions or
industries in Britain. .... , ^
Under the United Nations Programmes of Technical Assistance, by the end o
19=56 some 1,900 fellowships and scholarships had been granted for study an
training in the United Kingdom. In the year 1956. the United Kingdom provided
for more trainees (396) than any other country. The Technical Co-operation
Scheme of the Colombo Plan for co-operative economic development in South and
South-East Asia was responsible for bringing i,549 trainees to Britain from ten
countries in the six and three-quarter years up to the end of March 1957-
Arrangements for Overseas Students
Various bodies in the United Kingdom, official and unofficial, have assumed
responsibilities for the welfare of overseas students. , . TT-. ,
The British Council maintains student welfare services throughout the United
Kingdom and assists many overseas students, especially those from the United
Kingdom Dependencies, to find suitable accommodation. The Council maintains
a number of overseas student centres in which a varied programme of lectures,
discussions, and social and other activities is organized; it introduces students to
United Kingdom residents who offer hospitality in their homes; and it runs vaca¬
tion courses in many parts of the United Kingdom.
Official arrangements for students from United Kingdom Dependencies are
supervised by the Students Branch of the Colonial Office, and by Students Units
maintained in the United Kingdom by certain of the dependent territories.
Among voluntary organizations making provision for the welfare of overseas
students are the National Union of Students, the East and West Fnendsffip
Council Rotary, the Victoria League, the Dominions Fellowship Trust, the
Over-Seas League, the Royal Empire Society and Churches of all denominations.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of the youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people and to offer them opportunittes-complementary to
those of home, formal education and work-for discovering and develop,ng them
personal resources, so that they may be better equipped to be respons.ble members
of a free and civilized society. There is no regimentation of young PeoPle > they arc
free to join any of the youth organizations, or none, and the aim is that the facilities
for recreation, educational pursuits and social contacts offered should be sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl. •
Responsibility for youth services is shared by the Education Departments, local

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
education authorities and numerous voluntary organizations. There is no attempt
to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a national youth move¬
ment. Youth groups, the oldest-established of which have been active for over a
century, have been developed and financed mainly by voluntary effort. Some of
them now receive aid from public funds but all retain their independence of action.
The practice of democratic self-government has an established place in most youth
organizations and service to the community is encouraged. Over two million young
people under 21 years of age are members of voluntary youth organizations in
Britain.
Many of the youth organizations formed during the nineteenth century
are religious in origin and purpose; for example, the Young Men's Christian Associa¬
tion (1844), the Young Women’s Christian Association (1855), the Girls’ Friendly
Society (1875), the Boys’ Brigade (1883), and the Church Lads’ Brigade (1891). Later
organizations, such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Associations, which, as move¬
ments, have no definite affiliation to a religious body although local groups are often
attached to a church or chapel, also recognize the importance of spiritual values in
the formation of character and seek to inculcate high ideals of personal conduct and
of service to others.
Local education authorities have been indirectly concerned with youth sendees
since 1918, and in 1939 the then Board of Education decided to give active en¬
couragement to youth welfare. The Board urged local education authorities to
stimulate the provision of leisure activities for young people, both by co-operating
with voluntary agencies and by establishing Youth Centres and other recreational
facilities of their own. The status of youth services as an essential part of the educa¬
tional system, thus recognized in 1939, was confirmed by the Education Act of 1944
and the Education (Scotland) Act of 1945.
All local education authorities are required to ensure that adequate facilities for
the recreational and social needs of young people exist in their areas. In areas where
voluntary youth organizations are well established, local education authorities
co-operate with them, for example, by making grants, by offering the use of
premises and playing fields, by lending equipment, and by employing youth
organizers to help in the development of local youth work; and where existing
services are inadequate, the authorities make provision themselves (usually in the
form of youth centres and clubs). Most local education authorities have also
appointed local youth committees or councils, on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented.
In Northern Ireland, in accordance with strong local tradition, youth work is
carried out mainly by voluntary organizations, which are eligible to receive financial
assistance by way of direct grant from the Ministry of Education for Northern
Ireland under the Youth Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Acts (Northern
Ireland), 1938-47. In practice, most of the necessary funds for the support of these
organizations are found from voluntary sources. The substantial contribution of
the local authorities under these Acts is made mainly in the provision of playing
fields, swimming baths and other facilities. In addition, the local education authori¬
ties provide further education facilities, under the Education Acts (Northern
Ireland), 1947-56, which in some respects approximate to the work of the voluntary
organizations.
Twenty-four of the largest voluntary youth organizations, each with an adoles¬
cent membership in England and Wales of at least 10,000, belong to the Standing
Conference of National Voluntary Youth Organizations. The Conference, with
which other, smaller, youth groups are associated, was founded in 1936 as a consul¬
tative body which takes action only in the name of its constituent members and
SOCIAL WELFARE

with their consent. Its member organizations have a common aim in the develop¬
ment of character through educational and recreational interests, and in the
promotion of the physical, mental and spiritual training of their members.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate Standing Conferences, and there
is a Regional Standing Conference for Wales.
In addition, each of the leading political parties maintains a junior organization,
and there are a number of bodies which, although not specifically youth organiza¬
tions, promote the welfare of young people by providing them with opportunities
for physical training, holidays, camping and travel. , ,
Contacts with democratic youth movements in other countries are promoted by
the World Assembly of Youth {WAY), which was founded in 1949, following a youth
conference, held in London in the previous year, at which 25 countries were repre¬
sented In 1956 it comprised the National Youth Committees of 53 countries. T e
British National Committee of WAY includes representatives of most of the leading
youth organizations in the United Kingdom. . . , f
Finance for youth work is provided by voluntary subscriptions from members of
youth organizations and others, by money-raising efforts by members, by contri¬
butions from local education authorities and direct grants from the Education
Departments, and by grants from charitable trusts such as King George s Jubilee
Trust and the King George VI Foundation. , , ,
The local education authorities finance youth work under their direct control an
also assist the local clubs and branches of voluntary youth organizations. For their
expenditure on this work they receive grant aid from the Education Departments.
Direct grants are made by the Education Departments to some national volun¬
tary youth organizations towards the cost of administration and training carne
out at their headquarters, and towards capital expenditure incurred by loca
branches •
For the financial year 1957-58, direct grants by the Ministry of Education to
voluntary youth organizations in England and Wales are estimated at £298,000
and direct grants by the Scottish Education Department at £87,000, while local
education authorities will spend considerably more than these amounts on youth
services. The Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland estimates its expenditure
on youth work in 1957-58 at £101,000, and local authorities and local education
authorities will spend further sums for this purpose. * -u + ^
Since its inauguration in i935, King George’s Jubilee Trust has contributed
over £1 million for youth work, and the King George VI Foundation (created in
I9S3) has allocated a similar sum to finance three schemes for the provision of
youth leadership training courses, national recreation centres and youth hostels.
In addition, the Foundation undertook in i955 to provide £50,000 to finance the
five-year experimental period of a nation-wide scheme, the Duke of Edinburgh s
Award, designed to encourage young people to attain high standards of achievemen
in various spheres of endeavour, and to develop their fitness, initiative an
determination.
Some Voluntary Youth Organizations
The following examples are selected to illustrate the variety and wide scope of
the services and activities provided by voluntary organizations in Britain concerned
with the welfare of young people in their leisure hours. Among the other numerous
voluntary youth organizations are the Catholic Young Men s Society, the Methodist
Association of Youth Clubs and other religious groups, the Co-operative Youth
Movement, and the Welsh League of Youth.

Scouts and Guides
1 he Boy Scouts Association and the Girl Guides Association, which were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 respectively, aim to develop character and
good citizenship in boys and girls by training them in habits of observation, self-
reliance, self-discipline, loyalty and consideration for others, and by promoting
physical fitness and a knowledge of useful crafts. Both associations have world¬
wide affiliations, and are undenominational and non-political in character.
In March 1957, there were 246,894 Boy Scouts (aged 11 to 15 years), Senior
Scouts (15 to 18) and Rovers (over 17! years) in the United Kingdom. This total
includes Sea Scouts and Air Scouts. There were also 254,077 Wolf Cubs (aged
8 to 11 years). At the end of 1956 there were 227,000 Girl Guides in the United
Kingdom, including Cadets and Land, Sea and Air Rangers (aged 15 to 21 years).
There were also 240,000 Brownies (aged 7J to 11 years).
Other Uniformed Organizations
The Boys’ Brigade, founded in 1883, is essentially a Protestant religious organi¬
zation. Every company is attached to a church, and regular attendance at church
is a vital principle. Companies have frequent drill parades, there are club rooms
for games and other pastimes, and summer camps are held.
The Church Lads' Brigade, founded in 1891, is a similar organization attached to
the Anglican Church. Companies are formed in parishes under the direct control of
the incumbent. Summer camps are a special feature of the Brigade.
The Girls’ Life Brigade, founded in 1902, is an inter-denominational organiza¬
tion. Each company is connected with a church or other religious body.
The National Association of Training Corps for Girls comprises the Girls’ Train¬
ing Corps, the Girls’ Nautical Training Corps and the Women’s Junior Air Corps.
Each constituent corps, besides its special activities, gives a basic training in
physical education, health and hygiene, craftsmanship and public affairs. Cadets
are trained for responsibility through personal service.
National Associations of Clubs
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs and the National Association of Mixed
Clubs and Girls’ Clubs provide recreational facilities for young people designed to
develop their mental, physical and spiritual well-being. Discussion groups, handi¬
crafts, drama, music and many other activities are encouraged.
Pre-Service Organizations
Pre-Service organizations, which comprise the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet
Force, the Air Training Corps and the Combined Cadet Force (see pp. no, 114 and
116), have special connections with the respective Service Departments and receive
financial grants from them. The training of boys for entry into the armed forces,
provided by these organizations, is linked with training to promote their social,
educational and physical development.
Young Farmers’ Clubs
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs (see also p. 171) instructs its
members in agricultural subjects and rural crafts, and each club has the support of
an advisory committee on which local farmers are represented.
Youth Sections
Youth Sections are maintained by several adult voluntary organizations which
have a particular function; for example, the British Red Cross Society and the
St. John Ambulance Brigade train their young members in first aid and home¬
nursing.

other social activities, and they are trained to take an active part in party politics.
These groups receive no aid from public funds.
Other Bodies Concerned with Youth Work
Outward Bound Trust . , , ,
The Outward Bound Trust maintains mountain schools at bskdale and at
Ullswater, in the Lake District, and sea schools at Aberdovey, in North Wales, and
at Burghead, Morayshire, in Scotland. In these schools it provides four-week
character-building courses for boys, mainly young employees of industrial hrms
sent at their employers’ expense. Since the Trust was founded mi 946, more than
15,000 boys have passed through the Outward Bound Schools. The boys live as a
community and are given the opportunity to assess and develop their qualities of
courage endurance, initiative and self-discipline in learning the techniques of sail¬
ing or of rock-climbing, by various physical tests, and in expeditions over rough
hill country lasting several days. Similar, but modified, courses for girls are held at
the National Recreation Centres, Bisham Abbey in Berkshire and Bias y Bremn in
North Wales, and occasionally at the Trust’s mountain schools.
Youth Hostels Associations , , . . ^
The Youth Hostels Association (YHA), which was founded in i93°> seeks to
promote a greater knowledge of, and love for, the countryside. It caters for young
people of limited means by providing hostels where they can stay for a small charge
when on walking or cycling tours or canoe trips. In 1956, the YHA in Eng and an
Wales had a membership of over 192,000; it maintains 286 hostels in England an
Wales. The Scottish YHA has 31,000 members and 94 hostels, and the Northern
Ireland Association, 4,000 members and 15 hostels. The YHA is linked closely wit
similar organizations in other countries and, through its International Trave
Bureau, it encourages and facilitates the exchange of visits.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation , , , _
The Central Council of Physical Recreation, on which the leading voluntary
youth organizations are represented and from which they receive practical and
advisory services, is grant-aided by the Ministry of Education by the corresponding
Department in Northern Ireland, and by the King George VI Foundation. It was
established in 1935 to improve the physical and mental health of the community
through phvsical recreation. The Central Council arranges training courses and
provides instructors in games and athletics for young people and adults who wish
to learn new forms of physical recreation or to improve their standards under
expert tuition, and it plans and judges athletic competitions and organizes demon¬
strations of sport and physical training. It also arranges training holidays for young
people in its three National Recreation Centres. The corresponding bo y in
Scotland, the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, maintains two National
Recreation Centres, and is grant-aided by the Scottish Education Department and
the King George VI Foundation.
The National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is a central organization founde in
1925, with 54 affiliated county and city associations throughout England and Wales,

the provision and preservation of public playing fields and playgrounds for the
present and future needs of all sections of the community and advises local authori¬
ties and sports organizations on the acquisition, layout, construction and use of
grounds. It also keeps a watch on all matters relating to playing fields, endeavours
to stimulate recreational activity by grants, publications and persuasion, carries out
technical research and pioneers new ideas. The Association has spent over £ 1 million
since its inception in providing public playing fields and playgrounds. It also
provides an information service for Commonwealth countries overseas.
XI. HOUSING AND
PLANNING
PROBLEMS AND ADMINISTRATION
The problems of housing and of planning the use of land in Britain have their
origins mainly in the sevenfold expansion .of the population in the last two and a
half centuries and its concentration in industrial urban areas. This gave rise to
overcrowding in the older houses in the centres of cities and to the unplanned
spread of outer suburbs. Overcrowding persisted in spite of a high rate of building
in the nineteen-thirties and was aggravated by the second world war which left
behind increased needs and new opportunities for housing and planning. New
building had virtually ceased for six years, while the United Kingdom population
had risen by nearly i£ million; meanwhile, approximately one house in every three
had been destroyed or damaged by enemy action.
Ministerial Responsibility for Housing and Planning
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is responsible in England and
Wales for formulating housing policy, for housing standards and for general super¬
vision of the housing programme. In planning, the Minister is responsible for
implementing general policy regarding the use and development of land throughout
England and Wales, and for the direction and guidance of local planning authorities,
the New Towns Development Corporations and the National Parks Commission
in the carrying out of their planning functions.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has similar responsibilities in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Minister of Health and Local Government is responsible
for housing and planning. . .
The Ministry of Works acts as production authority in Great Britain for the
building industry (see p. 140). The Agricultural Departments are responsible for
advising on the agricultural value of land proposed for housing or other develop¬
ment. The Board of Trade is responsible for regulating the distribution of industrial
development. An Inter-Departmental Committee on Services Land Requirements
meets to harmonize Service and civilian needs and proposals for land use.
HOUSING
While responsibility for housing policy and for the general execution of the
housing programme rests with the Minister (see above), local authorities have
executive responsibilities (as set out below) for housing in their areas.
HOUSING AUTHORITIES
In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the local housing authorities are the
councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including metropolitan boroughs), urban
385
386
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
districts and rural districts, the London County Council and the Common Council
of the City of London. In Scotland, all town and county councils are housing
authorities.
Housing Powers and Duties of Local Authorities
The local housing authorities are responsible for ensuring as far as possible that
housing conditions in their areas are satisfactory. They must ensure that all dwell¬
ings in their areas comply with certain standards of fitness, design, construction and
equipment. Under the Housing Acts they are empowered to provide housing
accommodation themselves by erecting houses on land acquired by them, by
acquisition of suitable houses, or by the conversion of existing buildings.
Scottish Special Housing Association
The Scottish Special Housing Association, a statutory body, assists local authori¬
ties in their housing programmes. It has built about one in eight of the permanent
post-war houses completed in Scotland. The Association is financed entirely from
Government funds and is under the general direction of the Secretary of State for
Scotland.
Northern Ireland Housing Trust
The Northern Ireland Housing Trust, a statutory body, was established in 1945
for the purpose of erecting houses for letting to supplement the activities of local
authorities. The Trust has built about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war
houses.
PROGRESS AND POLICY
There are in all about 15! million houses in the United Kingdom: 13J million in
England and Wales, i| million in Scotland, and nearly half a million in Northern
Ireland.
Housebuilding was restarted after the second world war early in 1945. By
mid-1957, 2,757,234 new permanent houses had been built in the United
Kingdom, besides nearly 160,000 temporary houses (some of which are now
being replaced). Many other means have been employed to rehouse the families
needing homes, including repair and reconditioning of war-damaged and other
dilapidated property and the adaptation and conversion of old houses.
When the most pressing needs for additional accommodation had been met, the
local housing authorities were, in 1954, required to prepare proposals for dealing
with houses unfit for human habitation, in order to hasten slum clearance; and it
is on slum clearance that the main emphasis in local authority housing is now laid.
In 1955 and 1956, 76,629 unfit dwellings in Great Britain were demolished or closed
pending demolition. A similar campaign was launched in Northern Ireland at the
end of 1956.
New Building
The agencies for building houses in Britain are local authorities, New Towns
Development Corporations, private builders, certain Government Departments
which need to house the families of the armed forces or other services, and housing
associations which are non-profit-making bodies providing houses mostly for letting
rather than for sale. There are also Self-Help Groups whose members, in their
spare time, are building houses to be occupied by group members. Some of these
groups are organized as housing associations.
Local authorities (that is, for the most part, private builders under contract to
HOUSING AND PLANNING
387
local authorities) have built about three-quarters of the permanent houses com¬
pleted since the second world war. In the first post-war period, when resources
were very limited and the demand for houses urgent and widespread, local authori¬
ties were made responsible for the greater part of the programme. Since the
beginning of 1952, private enterprise has been able to build an increasing propor¬
tion of the new houses; the restrictions on private building imposed by the post-war
licensing system were finally abolished in November 1954-
In 1956, 268,724 new houses were completed in England and Wales, 31,501 in
Scotland, and 7,049 in Northern Ireland. Of the United Kingdom total of 307,274,
56 per cent were built by housing authorities and New Towns Development
Corporations, 41 by private builders, and the remainder by Government Depart¬
ments and voluntary housing associations. ,
Local authority houses are normally built for letting, and privately built houses
for owner-occupation. In England, Wales and Scotland, local authority houses may
be sold on certain conditions, with the consent of the Minister, to occupying tenants
or to persons in need of a house for their own use. . .
The central Departments have issued manuals of guidance for local authorities
setting standards of space, structure, design and equipment for different types of
houses, and describing how estates can be laid out attractively while saving land
and money, by the use of new and improved types of layout.
A number of new forms of construction for permanent houses have been
developed with practical encouragement from the Government during the experi¬
mental stage. Some of these new types were steel-framed, some of pre-cast con¬
crete, some concrete poured on the site, and some timber-framed A number ot
proved new systems have competed successfully with traditional house-building
methods and these have made a considerable contribution to the housing
programme.
Slum Clearance
Because of the need to concentrate on providing new houses for families without
a separate home of their own, slum clearance was virtually in abeyance for some
years after the end of the second world war, and the number of houses demolished
was relatively small. With the increase in the number of new houses it became
possible, however, to resume the campaign of slum clearance which the war had
Returns made by local housing authorities in 195 5 indicated that there were about
one million slum dwellings in Great Britain which ought to be cleared. In Eng an
and Wales, about 850,000, or 6-5 per cent of all houses, were estimated to be un t
for habitation. In Scotland, over 145,°°° houses (about 10 per cent of all houses)
were estimated to be unfit and due for demolition. Local authorities in England an
Wales proposed the demolition of approximately 375,000 houses (44 per cent ot a
unfit houses) within five years, and Scottish authorities proposed to demolish or
close 39,000 houses in three years. Local authorities in Northern Ireland are
carrying out a similar survey to establish the number of houses unfit for habitation.
The Government’s target for slum clearance in England and W ales, announced
in November 1955, is to secure as soon as possible the rehousing of at least 200,000
persons a year from unfit houses, involving the demolition or closure of between
60 000 and 70,000 such houses. An Exchequer subsidy of £22 is. a year or
6o'years (i.e. the duration of the loan period) is payable to the local authority tor
every dwelling built to rehouse a family displaced from an unfit house.
To help in those areas of Great Britain where the number of slum houses is so
large that it would not be practicable to replace all of them within the next few years,
388
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
local authorities are empowered to acquire houses unfit for human habitation and
to patch them in order that they may be occupied for a strictly limited period
pending their demolition. The intention is that these houses should be demolished
as early as possible: patching is not intended as an alternative to slum clearance.
Exchequer contributions are available to meet part of the costs of acquisition and
patching.
I lousing authorities are under a statutory obligation to see that other accommo¬
dation exists or can be provided by them for persons to be displaced from slum
clearance areas. Compensation is not payable for the demolition of a house unfit
for numan habitation, but, in England and Wales, owner-occupiers and business
occupiers may, in certain circumstances, receive payments to alleviate hardship.
Payments are also awarded, where appropriate, in recognition of good maintenance.
Hardship payments are not provided in Scotland, where the basis of compensation
for unfit houses is different, but payments in recognition of good maintenance are
available as in England and Wales.
HOUSING FINANCE
The average 3-bedroom house built by a local authority in England and Wales in
1956 had a superficial area of about 912 square feet and cost about £1,470 to build.
Trends affecting the cost of building in recent years have been a reduction in size
due to the adoption of space-saving designs, and improved productivity to which
the greater use of mechanical plant and better organization and management have
contributed. These factors have helped to offset increases in wages and cost of
materials.
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by raising
loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on loans, is met
from rents, rates and, where available, subsidies. Local authorities may raise loans
for housing either in the open market or by borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (see p. 71).
Funds for private enterprise housing are obtained in the main by borrowing. The
chief agencies concerned in lending money are the building societies (see p. 316),
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
Subsidies
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for varying purposes, have been provided
in Britain since 1919. After the second world war, high rates of subsidy, payable
annually for 60 years, were provided under the Housing (Financial and Miscel¬
laneous Provisions) Act, 1946, and the Housing Act, 1952, for all new local
authority houses. A standard rate of subsidy was paid for ordinary flats or houses
built to meet general needs, and special rates of subsidy were provided for special
types of housing (e.g., high blocks of flats and blocks of fiats built on expensive
sites), houses built for special purposes (e.g., for the agricultural population) and
houses in special areas (e.g., poor areas of low rate-paying capacity).
The Housing Subsidies Act, 1956, continued to provide subsidies for special
classes of housing but initiated a change of policy. It provided a higher rate of
subsidy (£24 a house a year) for houses built to relieve congestion in overcrowded
areas, houses built by New Towns Envelopment Corporations and houses built to
meet the urgent needs of industry, while continuing at the same rate (£22 is. a house
a year) the subsidy on houses built to replace slums, but it reduced, and provided
for the abolition of, the standard subsidy on dwellings built for general needs. The
annual subsidy on houses in the last category was reduced to £10 a house and it was
HOUSING AND PLANNING
389
abolished as from November 1956, except in respect of one-bedroom dwellings as an
encouragement to the provision of accommodation for elderly and single persons.
For flats, other than those provided for general needs, higher subsidies are
payable for blocks of four or more storeys. There is also a subsidy for residential
hostels built by local authorities or by certain other bodies.
Housing subsidies are separately provided for in Scotland and Northern Ireland
where the amounts are generally higher on account of the different circumstances.
Subsidy rates in Scotland were revised under the Housing and Town Development
(Scotland) Act, 1957. These include a subsidy of £24 a house a year for housing
to meet general needs, with higher rates of subsidy for special needs, par¬
ticularly houses built to meet the urgent needs of industry and to relieve
congestion in overcrowded areas. In Northern Ireland, annual subsidies are paid for
60 years to local authorities, the Northern Ireland Housing Trust and housing
associations. The Housing Subsidy Order (Northern Ireland), 1956, altered the
basis on which subsidy is paid, and prescribed a subsidy higher than the standard
rate in respect of houses for persons displaced from slum houses. In addition lump
sum’ subsidies are paid to private persons who build houses for letting or for
owner-occupation. Under the Housing on Farms Act (Northern Ireland), i9S°>
grants are available for the provision of new houses and for the reconditioning o
existing premises to accommodate farmers and approved workers.
The cost of housing subsidies in the United Kingdom for the calendar year 195
was £107 million (£78 million paid by the central Government and £29 million
paid by local authorities).
House Purchase Schemes
Loans to enable persons to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are provided by many local authorities as well as by building societies, certain
insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Many local authorities also operate a scheme whereby, for a house costing up to
£2,500, they guarantee part of the loan made by a building society so that an
advance greater than normal (up to 95 per cent of the value of the house in some
cases) may be made to the purchaser. The Exchequer undertakes to share any
liability local authorities may incur under this scheme.
Improvement Grants
The Housing Act, 1949, provides Exchequer assistance for the improvement of
existing housing or adaptation of buildings for housing by local authorities or
private owners in England and Wales. Grants can be made by local authorities,
with Exchequer assistance, to persons converting or improving existing buildings
for housing at a cost of over £100 a dwelling. The grants may amount to half the
cost, with a maximum grant of £400. There are certain technical conditions which
the dwellings as improved or converted must satisfy to ensure that public money is
only spent on property that will provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficiently
long period. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, considerably eased the
conditions attaching to these grants. Similar provisions apply in Scotland and are
contained in the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1950, and the Housing (Repairs and
Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954-
Rent Control
The great majority of the privately owned houses in Great Britain which are let
are subject to rent control. Houses owned by local authorities, New Towns
39°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Development Corporations, housing associations, and the Scottish Special Housing
Association are, in general, free from control, as are new houses completed since
30th August, 1954.
In the autumn of 1956, the Government announced a policy of progressive aboli¬
tion of rent control on the grounds that the existing system led to deterioration and
wasteful use of the nation’s stock of housing accommodation.
The first Rent Restrictions Act was passed in 1915. The Acts now in force, either
wholly or in part, are the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1920 to
1939, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act, 1949, the Housing Repairs and
Rents Acts, 1954, and the Rent Act, 1957.
These Rent Restrictions Acts, which apply, with few exceptions, to all unfur¬
nished dwellings below a certain rateable value, limit the rent a landlord may
legally recover from a tenant, while at the same time giving the tenant in most
circumstances security of tenure. The Acts also make illegal most premiums for the
grant of a tenancy of rent-controlled premises. Landlords restricted in this way are
themselves protected against undue increases in rates of mortgage interest and
against the calling in of mortgages so long as they pay the restricted interest due.
The Housing Repairs and Rents Acts, 1954, allowed landlords to increase their
rents to pay for repairs, subject to certain conditions and to a maximum limit.
The Rent Act, 1957, establishes, for houses which remain in control in England
and Wales, revised rent limits more in keeping with the current value of money and
the cost of maintenance, and permits in Scotland an increase in controlled rents
subject to certain conditions. It provides that new unfurnished lettings should be
free of control, whether of the 4| million houses now in owmer-occupation,
or of houses at present controlled which fall vacant and are re-let. In
addition, over 800,000 houses let at controlled rents are released from control by
the lowering of the limits of rateable value below which rented houses are subject
to control.1 The Act provides for the de-control from time to time of further
categories of houses by Order, subject to approval by Parliament. The Act provides
for certain exceptions and safeguards for the protection of tenants.
In England and Wales, the rents payable for houses, or parts of houses, let fur¬
nished or in which services are provided, are controlled by the Furnished Houses
(Rent Control) Act, 1946. The Rent Act, 1957, provides that if the premises let
unfurnished would be above the rateable value limits for control, they should not,
if let furnished, come within the scope of the Act of 1946. Local rent tribunals,
appointed for the purpose, determine the rents of furnished lettings in cases referred
to them by either party or by the local authority. Similar legislation for controlling
rents of furnished lettings was passed for Scotland in 1943.
Somewhat similar measures of control apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951,
however, legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
controlled houses, provided they were maintained in good repair; and the Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law (Amendment) Act (Northern
Ireland), 1956, provided for an increase of one-third in the rent levels fixed by the
1951 Act where the landlord had recently incurred expenditure of a certain amount
on repairs. The 1956 Act also released from control houses with a net annual value
of over £50 (with certain safeguards) and houses with a net annual value of over
£26 of which the landlord was in actual possession when the Act came into force,
or of which he subsequently obtained possession.
1 The limits under the Act are £40 a year in the London Metropolitan Police District
and Scotland and £30 a year elsewhere. For definition of rateable value see p. 71.

HOUSING AND PLANNING
391
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
The land of Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and
it is therefore of vital importance in the public interest that competing claims to its
use should be settled in such a way that the necessary balance between them is
maintained.
From 1909 onwards, the idea of the planned use of land was given a degree of
expression in successive Acts of Parliament, but because the pattern of development
over much of the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban con¬
centrations (as a result of the industrialization processes of the previous century)
the powers granted to planning authorities by the early Acts were inadequate for
the task in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were decades of expansion in
industry, engineering and house-building; population was increasing, and there was
a general movement towards better standards of living, and consequently a greater
need for systematic planning than had hitherto been required. At the beginning
of the nineteen-thirties, a major effort was made to consolidate and strengthen
planning law and to extend the planning powers of central and local authorities to
the point at which they could exercise effective control. Despite this effort, which
culminated in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, inter-war planning
legislation had only a limited effect, mainly because it failed to deal adequately with
the question of compensation, which had always been an obstacle to satisfactory
planning. By the nineteen-twenties, the principle had been accepted that the
property of an individual might be subjected to restrictions in the public interest,
provided that he received some compensation out of public funds for any depriva¬
tion (which went beyond the requirements of good neighbourliness) that he might
suffer thereby. The method adopted for implementing this principle, however,
placed so heavy a financial burden on planning authorities that they were often
prevented from, or at least hampered in, carrying out their work. As a result, at the
time of the outbreak of the second world war, many of the outstanding problems of
land use remained unsolved.
Renewed efforts were made to deal with these problems during the course of
the war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert committees were appointed to study
and report upon (1) the unregulated growth and spread of industry, (2) the ham¬
pering of planning by the financial and administrative difficulties of compensation
and betterment and (3) the encroachment of urban development upon the country¬
side. After the war, other committees studied the question of New Towns and
National Parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees have
now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the Distribution of
Industry Act, 1945; the New Towns Act, 1946; the Town and Country Planning
Act, 1947; the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947; the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949; the Town Development Act, 1952;
the Town and Country Planning Act, 1953 ; the Town and Country Planning Act,
1954; and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1954.
The Town and Country Planning Acts
The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947, are comprehensive and radical measures which
provide a framework or pattern of land use for the whole of Great Britain.1
1 For an account of town and country planning legislation in Northern Ireland, see
P- 398.
2C
392
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Their main purposes are:
1. To co-ordinate planning throughout the country by means of development
plans against which day-to-day development can be considered.
2. To bring development (with certain exceptions) under control by making
it subject to the permission of a local planning authority or of a central
Government Department.
3. To extend both the powers of public authorities to acquire and develop
land for planning purposes and the scope and scale of grants from central
funds to local authorities towards carrying out the acquisition and clearing
of land.
4. To deal with certain specific amenity problems, e.g., the preservation of
trees and woodlands and of buildings of special historic or architectural
interest, and the control of the display of advertisements.
The 1947 Acts were also intended to solve the compensation-betterment prob¬
lem; and, to this end, they provided for the transfer of development values in
land to the State, the establishment of a system of ‘ development charges ’ payable
before development could take place by any person whose land was increased in
value by the grant of planning permission to develop, and the setting up of a £300
million fund from which payments could be made to owners whose land was depre¬
ciated in value by the passing of the Acts. It was hoped that by these provisions the
pre-war obstacles to effective planning might be removed; but, in the event, serious
difficulties were encountered in the working of the system, due mainly to the fact
that the development charge became in effect a tax on development. The financial
provisions of the 1947 Acts have therefore been amended in three subsequent Acts:
the Town and Country Planning Act, 1953, which abolished the development
charges and suspended payment from the £300 million fund; and the Town and
Country Planning Act, 1954) and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act,
I954> which provided a new scheme for the payment of compensation for deprecia¬
tion in land values and a new basis of compensation for public acquisition. Under
the terms of the Acts, claims for compensation out of the £300 million fund form
the basis for all future compensation payments, but payments will not actually be
made unless and until loss is suffered. Since development charges have been
abolished, owners will normally be able to realize the full value of their land on
the open market and compensation will, in fact, become payable only when land is
acquired by a public authority or restricted against development. On compulsory
acquisition, compensation is paid for development value only if a claim on the
£300 million fund had been established or could have been established, if made,
and up to the value of the claim. Loss of development value through the imposition
of planning restrictions, other than restrictions in the interests of ‘good neighbour¬
liness ’, is to be met by the State, in order that local planning authorities shall
continue to be relieved of the burden of paying the compensation for which they
were responsible until the passing of the 1947 Acts.
The 1954 Acts also provide a transitional system of payments, again based on
claims, to redress the financial effects on owners of land of the provisions of the
T947 Acts and also a simplified and extended system of planning grants to local
planning authorities to replace that of the 1947 Acts.
Development Plans
Under the terms of the 1947 Acts, local planning authorities in England and
Wales and in Scotland are required to prepare, and submit to the Minister of
HOUSING AND PLANNING
393
Housing and Local Government and to the Secretary of State for Scotland respec¬
tively, development plans covering the whole of their districts, based on a survey
of physical and other resources; by the end of 1956, all but two of those in
England and Wales and more than half of those in Scotland had already done so, and
about two-thirds of the plans in England and Wales, and 30 plans in Scotland, had
been approved. The local authorities for the purpose are: in England and Wales,
the county councils, the county borough councils, or, where necessary, joint plan¬
ning boards; and in Scotland, the councils of counties and of large burghs, and the
councils of the two small burghs of St. Andrews and Thurso. Provision is made in
the Acts for public inquiry before any plan receives ministerial approval, so that
persons whose land is affected may have an opportunity to state their case; and for
a five-yearly revision of development plans. By the end of 1956, 11 plans had been
approved without the need to hold an inquiry or hearing, and 85 inquiries and
two hearings had been held, which varied in duration from one day to several
weeks.
Individual plans for the reconstruction of parts of many of the large towns and
cities in Great Britain have also been drawn up and approved, and in many cases
considerable progress has been made. For example, by the end of October 1956,
in the City of London, projects valued at over £24 million had been completed,
work valued at nearly £32 million was under construction and some £17 million
worth of building had been commissioned.
The Distribution of Industry
The Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, and the Town and Country
Planning Acts, 1947, contain provisions to control the general location of industry
throughout the country (see pp. 134-5).
General problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of
Government Departments, but the main responsibility for controlling the siting of
industry as apart from its general location rests with the local planning authorities,
for it is their duty to ensure that industrial development fits properly into existing
and expanding communities and is consistent with the best use of land.
The New Towns
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are the responsible ministers,
powers to make an order designating any area of land (which may include as its
nucleus the area of an existing town) as the site of a proposed new town after con¬
sultation with the local authorities concerned, and if it is in the public interest to
do so. Once the site has been designated, the responsible minister appoints a
Development Corporation (consisting of a chairman and up to eight other mem¬
bers) to be responsible for the development of the new town. One of the first tasks
of the development corporation is to prepare a master plan which becomes the basis
for development proposals, each of which covers a part of the area. Every proposal
must be submitted to the responsible Minister who must consult the local planning
authority and, together with the Treasury, must be satisfied with the proposal on
economic grounds before giving approval.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for
Scotland) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any land or property
necessary for their purposes. They may provide housing, commercial and industrial
premises, estate roads and sewers and other buildings essential for the development
394
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the towns; and, in certain circumstances, they may make provision for main
services. In England and Wales, the Minister of Housing and Local Government
has made a special development order to exempt the development corporations
from the necessity of obtaining planning permission from the local planning
authorities; but in Scotland, in the absence of a similar order, permission to
develop has to be obtained from the local planning authority.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and must be repaid on terms approved by the ministers with
the concurrence of the Treasury. The corporations must submit their reports
annually to the Minister or to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are respon¬
sible for laying them before Parliament; the accounts of the corporations must be
audited annually and are then presented to Parliament by the Comptroller and
Auditor General.
Fifteen new towns are coming into being in Great Britain (see map, p. 395)—
twelve in England and Wales and three in Scotland. Eight of the new towns in
England and Wales Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Hemel Flempstead, Steven¬
age, Hatfield and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and Bracknell in
Berkshire are designed to help in absorbing excess population from the Greater
London area; four others—Corby in Northamptonshire; Aycliffe and Peterlee in
Durham; and Cwmbran in Monmouthshire—are to serve the special needs of their
areas. Of the Scottish new towns, East Kilbride in Lanarkshire and Cumbernauld
in Dunbartonshire are being established to assist in housing the surplus population
from Glasgow; while Glenrothes in Fife provides housing and other facilities for
miners and their families transferring to an area where mining activities are steadily
expanding.
In spite of the fact that the development corporations have been somewhat handi- "
capped by shortages of materials and labour and by restrictions on capital invest¬
ment, their work represents a notable achievement in the translation of planning
into reality. By the end of June 1957, the total population of the new towns in >
England and Wales, designed to be 550,000 when the towns are completed, had
reached an estimated total of 315,000 (including the people previously living in the
area) > 53)79° houses had been built by the development corporations, and a further
9,780 were under construction; 270 factories had been established and a further 42
were being erected; 837 shops had been completed, and 439 more were being built;
90 schools had been finished and 26 more were under construction. Many miles of
roads had been laid, and large main sewerage works had kept pace with domestic
and industrial needs.
In the Scottish new towns, by the same date, the population, eventually to be
125,000, had reached an estimated figure of just over 32,000; 6,560 houses had been
built, with a further 1,696 under construction; 71 shops had been completed and
42 were under construction; nine new schools were in use and the building of one
more was in progress; and the extension of communications and public services was
under way.
Lnder the New 1 owns Acts of 1946, 1952, 1953 and 1955, Parliament approved
a consolidated fund of £250 million to provide for advances to the development
corporations for work on the new towns. By the end of June 1957, £215 million of
expenditure from this amount had been approved by the Minister of Flousing and
Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Wales as National Parks. It was laid down that the characteristic landscape of these
areas was to be carefully preserved, and that facilities for open-air recreation were
to be improved or provided,
A National Parks Commission for England and Wales was set up by the Act of
1949, and by June 1957 its work had resulted in the establishment of ten of the
12 National Parks recommended by the National Parks (England and Wales) Com¬
mittee, which reported in 1947.
The established parks are: the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia in
North Wales, Dartmoor in Devon, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York
Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor in Somerset and Devon, Northumberland
(comprising most of the upland country from the Cheviots in the north to the
Roman Wall in the south), and the Brecon Beacons in South Wales (see map, p.
395). These parks cover a total area of 5,248 square miles, or one-eleventh of the
area of England and Wales. The administrative arrangements for the parks are as
follows: the Peak District and Lake District National Parks are administered by
Joint Planning Boards; for Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York
Moors and Northumberland, special Park Planning Committees of the county
councils concerned have been set up; while in Snowdonia, the Yorkshire Dales
and Exmoor there are special Park Planning Committees of each of the constituent
county councils concerned with the parks under the general supervision of a Park
Joint Advisory Committee.
Under the provisions of the 1949 Act, the Commission was also given authority
to select other, less extensive, areas in England and Wales for designation as ‘ areas
of outstanding natural beauty’ in order to keep them unspoiled. By the end of
June 1957, three such areas had been established, another had been designated,
and proposals for a further nine were under consideration.
A Scottish National Parks Working Party has considered all five areas recom¬
mended as National Parks in Scotland—the Trossachs, Glen Affric, the Cairngorms,
Wester Ross (Loch Maree) and Glen Coe—with a view to their possible develop¬
ment under existing statutory powers, and has submitted to the Secretary of State
for Scotland a report on each of these areas.
In addition to the establishment of National Parks, the Act provided that a com¬
plete survey should be made of all footpaths and bridle-vrays in England and Wales
to be a comprehensive national record of public rights of way and that long-distance
routes should be created, which by connecting existing footpaths and bridle-ways
would become continuous rights of way. Individual surveys of footpaths are being
carried out by parish and county district councils; on completion, they are collated
and published by the county councils. Responsibility for making proposals for
long-distance routes rests with the National Parks Commission; once the proposals
are approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, it falls to the
local authorities to give effect to them. By the end of June 1957, the National Parks
Commission’s proposals for the creation of five routes, covering some 850 miles,
had been approved (see map, p. 395); progress had been made by means of surveys,
cairn building and footpath agreements, towards their completion; and discussions
were taking place between the Commission and the relevant local authorities
regarding the establishment of several more routes of this kind.
The Act also gives local authorities the task of surveying in their areas the access
enjoyed by the public to open country, i.e. mountain, moor, heath, down, cliff and
beach, and empowers them to improve such access, where necessary, by means of
agreements with owners or by access orders. By the end of 1956, agreements
granting access to some 12,000 acres, mainly in the Kinder Scout area of the Peak
District, had been drawn up, and further negotiations are in progress.

Nature Conservation
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy
(see p. 414), which derives the necessary powers for the proper discharge of its
functions from the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949- These
functions (the provision of advice, the practice of conservation, and the stimulation
and conduct of research) entail the acquisition and full control of a representative
series of Reserves, as well as the establishment of laboratories (see p. 414).
Fifty-six Nature Reserves, covering 121,823 acres, had been declared by the end
of June 1957, of which 34 are in England, 15 in Scotland and 7 in Wales: of these,
the Cairngorms, which covers 39,639 acres, is the largest Reserve in Great Britain
and one of the largest in Europe. Two Forest Nature Reserves have been set up, m
agreement with the Forestry Commission and the Commissioners of Crown Lands,
to be managed in the interest of ecological research and of timber production.
In addition to national Nature Reserves and Forest Nature Reserves, there were,
by end-June 1957, six local Nature Reserves, established and administered by local
authorities, in consultation with the Nature Conservancy, using their own powers
under the Act. For information on the National Forest Parks, see pp. 180 and 181.
The Government is empowered, under the Bird Protection Act, 1954, to estab¬
lish bird sanctuaries1 in Great Britain. The first sanctuary was established in
October 1955; since then, three more have been established, one in England and
two in Scotland.
Preservation of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain (from tree preservation and the preservation of ancient
inns to the prevention of atmospheric pollution, see p. 182) is vested mainly in
the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
and the various statutory planning authorities and commissions. The Ministry of
Works, however, is also concerned, in that it is the Department responsible for the
maintenance of royal parks and palaces and, in addition, is empowered by the pro¬
visions of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, to assist in
the preservation of historic houses by making grants (after consultation with
specially constituted Historic Buildings Councils, see p. 42^) f°r their upkeep to¬
gether with their contents and their adjoining land. By July 1957, grants totalling
£ 1,272,241 had been approved towards the cost of urgently needed structural repairs
to 425 historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales.
Unofficial amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, founded
in 1926 to organize concerted action to secure the protection of rural scenery and
of town and country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the Association for
the Preservation of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the protection of rural
scenery and the amenities of country districts and towns and villages in Scotland;
the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Ramblers
Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, the Pilgrim
Trust2; the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and the National T rust for Scotland. The

societies and other bodies. , . -.y • , ^

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National Trust for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (which was founded in
1895 and by the end of 1956 had nearly 61,000 members) is the largest landowner
in the United Kingdom other than the State and State institutions. It has acquired,
mainly through gifts, about a thousand properties, which it holds for the enjoyment
of the public; it administers over 250,000 acres of land of great natural beauty
(including 31,000 acres of woodland); and it owns many fine gardens. The National
1 rust for Scotland, which was founded in 1931 to promote the preservation of
places of historic or architectural interest or of natural beauty in Scotland, for the
benefit of the public, now has under its care some 60 properties, covering in all
about 55,000 acres.
Planning in Northern Ireland
Town and Country Planning in Northern Ireland is governed by two enactments:
the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931, and the Planning (Interim
Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944.
The Act of 1931 > which continues to be the main source from which power to
prepare a planning scheme is derived, provides for the preparation by local authori¬
ties of planning schemes for development or redevelopment of their areas, with
the general object of securing proper sanitary conditions, amenities and con¬
veniences in connection with the laying out and use of land. The Interim Develop¬
ment Act of 1944 enables persons wishing to carry out development to do so
without delay, while ensuring that such development shall conform to the
provisions likely to be included in the planning scheme for the area.
The provisions of the Act brought under planning control all land in Northern
Ireland and required every local authority to prepare a planning scheme for its
area. Interim control is exercised in accordance with the section of the Act which
requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission to develop,
the authority may grant the application conditionally or unconditionally or may
refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or conditional approval, the applicant
has a right to appeal to the Ministry of Health and Local Government for Northern
Ireland (which is the Department primarily responsible for the administration of
the Planning Acts).
Since the Act of 1944 was passed, all local planning authorities in Northern
Ireland have made appreciable progress in the preparation of outline plans which
indicate broadly the proposals for their areas. The outline plans not only provide a
foundation for the preparation of more detailed plans at a later stage but also
facilitate materially the work of interim development control. Many interim
development applications have been decided by local planning authorities, and
appeals lodged with the Ministry have been relatively few.
XII. RELIGION, SCIENCE,
AND THE ARTS
RELIGION
Every person living in Britain possesses the rights of religious freedom as des¬
cribed in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he may change
his religion at will and may manifest his religion in teaching, practice, worship and
observance. Churches and religious societies of any faith may own property, con¬
duct schools and propagate their faith in speech and writing.
Freedom of conscience for minority religious groups and for non-religious groups
has been achieved gradually and not without a struggle. Legal insistence on strict
conformity with the established church was first modified over 250 years ago with
the passing of the Toleration Act of 1689, which granted freedom of worship to
Protestant dissenters. In 1829, the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed
non-conformists from political disabilities, and made it possible for them to be
appointed to public offices. Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under
the Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1829; the Jewish Relief Act, 1858, enabled Jews
to become members of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed
on prospective students and members of the academic staff of the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge were successively abolished by the Acts of 1854, 1856 and
1871. Nowadays, public offices are open without distinction to members of all
religious groups or of none.1
The Church of England
The Church of England is the established Church, and claims to be the ancient
Catholic Church of the land. At the Reformation it repudiated the supremacy of
the Pope, but retained the historic episcopate, the creeds, the sacraments, and the
appeal to Scripture, upon which its doctrine is based: therefore it claims to be both
Catholic and Reformed. Its form of worship is embodied in the Book of Common
Prayer, which was first compiled in 1549. Religious Orders were restored a hundred
years ago.
No single law defines the establishment of the Church of England in any such
way as, for example, the Treaty of Union, 1707, defines the position of the Church
of Scotland. The relation of Church and State in England is one of mutual obliga¬
tions : of privileges accorded to the Church but balanced by certain duties.
The Church of England is uniquely related to the Crown. The Sovereign, who
must be a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’
(a statutory title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or her accession
to uphold it. The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Primate of all England; prayers for the Sovereign and other members
of the Royal Family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; all bishops
1 An exception is that the Lord Chancellor may not be a Roman Catholic.
399
400
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister;
and all the clergy take the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
The second link of Church and State is through the House of Lords, in which
the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 bishops have seats. This
makes it possible for the views of Church leaders to be expressed freely on any
great moral issue raised in connection with the corporate conduct of the State, as
well as on more narrowly ecclesiastical issues—a matter of particular significance
in view of the fact that clergy of the Church of England are legally disqualified
from sitting in the House of Commons, and that the Church is therefore not
specifically represented in that House.
The State recognizes and protects church property, but it makes no payments
to the Church except for services rendered (e.g., chaplaincies to the armed forces
and to prisons). Church property belongs to parishes, dioceses or church societies.
An investigation in 1951 showed that half the Church’s income came from present
giving and half from past giving, in the form of endowments. Endowments pro¬
duced an income of £8f million a year and, of this total, property representing an
annual income of £7 million was administered by the Church Commissioners, most
of it for specific purposes from which it could not be transferred. Property adminis¬
tered by the Church Commissioners at the end of March 1956 produced a gross
income of approximately £ 11 million a year, but there may be other factors affect¬
ing the aggregate which any new inquiry would have to take into account. The
Commissioners include representatives of the State (including four laymen nomi¬
nated by the Crown), and present an annual report to Parliament.
The Church of England is not free to change its forms of worship, as laid down
in the Book of Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament. In 1928 a
proposed revision was approved for submission to Parliament by the Church
Assembly and the Convocations of Canterbury and York (see below), though with
substantial minority opposition, but it was rejected by the House of Commons.
A church-appointed commission on Church-State relations, which reported in
January 1952, suggested certain changes in the relations between Church and State,
but was opposed to disestablishment; its report was unanimously accepted by the
Church Assembly.
The Church is organized mainly by geographical areas (dioceses subdivided into
parishes), and not by congregations. Everyone in England is born in a parish—
about two-thirds being baptized by the established Church to which the great
majority tend to look for personal services (baptism of children, marriage and
burial), and which is expected to play a part in local life. Only those who are
baptized and confirmed may receive the Holy Communion, but anyone who is
baptized and not a member of another Church and who is over 17 years of age
may apply for membership of the electoral roll of the parish where he or she
habitually worships. The number on the roll is just under 3 million, but this figure
by no means represents the total Church membership.1
Spiritual authority in the Church of England rests in the bishops. There are 43
dioceses, 29 in the province of Canterbury and 14 in that of York. The most ancient
authoritative bodies in the Church in matters of doctrine and discipline are the
Convocations of Canterbury and York. Each is presided over by its archbishop and
consists of an upper house of bishops and a lower house of deans, archdeacons and
elected clergy. The Houses of the Convocations meet separately or together in May
and October.
1 No inquiries are made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official
returns, and for this reason, no uniform basis exists for assessing the exact number of
a dherents to the various Churches, which adopt different criteria in counting their members.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
401
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts (see p. 80), which exist
for disciplining the moral and ecclesiastical offences of the clergy, for granting
faculties for alterations in churches, and for dealing with questions of repair to
church fabric and with disputed rights to pews. They have no power to award
damages or grant injunctions or, except as regards certain minor offences, to inflict
any of the punishments open to the temporal courts. The remedies open to eccle¬
siastical courts are monition, suspension ab ingressu ecclesiae, penance and excom¬
munication ; and against the clergy, further remedies such as suspension from office
or benefice, deprivation of benefice, inhibition from exercising the cure of souls,
deposition or degradation. Sentences passed by the ecclesiastical courts1 2 are upheld
by the State. The highest court of appeal against such sentences is the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council.
In 1919, by Act of Parliament, the Church of England was given a National
Assembly, commonly called the Church Assembly. This consists of three houses,
Bishops, Clergy and Laity. The Laity (347 in number, including 95 women) are
elected on the basis of the electoral rolls to represent their dioceses. The Church
Assembly may pass regulations and measures. Regulations affect matters which do
not require parliamentary consent: for example, the Diocesan Conferences were
set up in 1935 by regulation. Measures, when passed through successive stages,
are presented to an Ecclesiastical Committee of both Houses of Parliament, con¬
sisting of 30 members, 15 of whom are appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and
15 by the Speaker of the House of Commons. This committee reports on the expe¬
diency and possible legal results of the measure; and on its advice, the measure is
either laid before Parliament and forwarded on resolution for the Royal Assent, or
more rarely, is the subject of debate like any other Bill." The advantages of this
procedure to the State are the removal of the greater part of church business from
its overcrowded debating time; the advantages to the Church are the initiation,
discussion and framing of necessary matters by a representative church body and
their speedy passing into operation.
The Assembly co-ordinates the vast scattered labours of the Church through
Councils which report to it annually. The Training Colleges Council is concerned
with 27 colleges in England and Wales for the training of teachers an indication
of the part played by the Church in the country’s educational system. The Schools
Council, in co-operation with the Church Assembly, deals with matters affecting
the church schools. The Central Advisory Council of Training for the Ministry
arranges for recruitment to the ministry in schools, colleges, universities and, among
older men, for the selection of ordination candidates for training in accordance
with plans approved by the bishops; and for the inspection of theological colleges,
of which there were 24 in England at the end of 1956.
At the time when the Church Assembly was set up, the Laity were associated in
the government of the local churches through elected bodies, the Parochial Church
Councils.
Anglican Communities
In the United Kingdom, there are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland,
Scotland and Wales: the Church of Ireland (disestablished in 1869) has 14 dioceses
or united dioceses, and some 478,000 members; the Episcopal Church in Scotland,
7 dioceses and some 116,000 members; and the Church in Wales (disestablished
in 1920) 6 dioceses and some 200,000 Easter communicants.
1 Procedure in ecclesiastical courts is now under review. . .
2 Parliament has no power to amend a measure of this kind; but it may reject it altogether.
402
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Outside the United Kingdom the Anglican Communion exists wherever
Englishmen have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant
Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Church of India, Pakistan,
Burma and Ceylon, and the Anglican Churches of South Africa, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, the West Indies, China, Japan, the Middle East, West Africa and
Central Africa are all autonomous members of the Anglican Communion, while
there are 21 overseas dioceses, mainly in Africa and Asia, which are under the
jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In addition, terms of limited inter¬
communion with the Church of South India, similar to those already existing
between that Church and the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, were
laid down in resolutions passed by the Convocation of Canterbury in 1955.
Since 1867, except for the war years, the Lambeth Conference has met every
tenth year as an unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; the next
meeting is to be held in July and August 1958. The conference has no authority,
but enjoys great moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations
with other communions, and on the attitude of the Churches to political and social
questions are widely studied. A periodic Anglican Congress (which includes clergy
not in episcopal orders and laymen as well as bishops) is held in the years between
the Lambeth Conferences. The first took place at Minneapolis in the United States
in 1954; it is expected that each future congress will be held in a different country.
The Church of Scotland
The established Church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland, which in govern¬
ment is Presbyterian. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a Church
which is established and yet is free*. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union,
1707, was further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act, 1921.
Whereas in Episcopacy, church government is a hierarchy of persons, in Presby¬
terianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal status, and each
of the 2,289 churches is governed locally by a Kirk Session, consisting of the
minister and elected elders (of whom there are over 42,000 in all): above this is the
Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, which meets annually and consists of elected ministers and elders pre¬
sided over by an elected Moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is
represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The com¬
plete freedom of the Church of Scotland in all spiritual matters and its right to
appoint its own officers and decide all matters of doctrine and discipline has been
fought for by the Church with the utmost vigour down the years, and is recognized
by Parliament; its decisions are not subject to parliamentary debate or modification.
The thorough training of the ministry—lasting a minimum of six years—has
given the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The communicant membership of the Church
of Scotland is over a million and a quarter.
The Free Churches
The phrase ‘ Free Churches ’ has now come into common use, especially to des¬
cribe in England those Churches which were more generally known in the past as
Nonconformist Churches. Strictly speaking, all Churches in Wales and Northern
Ireland are Free Churches, since in those countries there is no Established Church,
but the Churches formally described as Free Churches are the Methodist, Baptist,
Congregational and (other than the Church of Scotland) Presbyterian Churches.
There are other religious associations, e.g., the Society of Friends and the Salvation
Army, which have links in certain ways with the main Free Churches.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
403
The word ‘Nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies and
practices of the Church of England. The Free Churches would more positively
affirm that the reason for their existence is a deep conviction about the nature of the
Church. The Baptist, Congregational and Presbyterian Churches have their roots
in the Reformation movement, and the Methodist Church originated in the evan¬
gelical revival led by John Wesley within the Church of England in the eighteenth
century. The Baptist and Congregational Churches regard the Church as a gathered
covenanted community of believers. The Presbyterian Churches lay great stress on
the doctrine of the Sovereignty of God and the way in which that must be reflected
in the ordering of Christ’s Church.
The Methodist Churches
The largest of the Free Churches is the Methodist Church, the product of a
union of Methodist Churches in 1932. It has 742,000 adult full members. The
supreme authority in the Church is the annual Conference, and the system of
government is in many ways presbyterian: the Leaders’ Meeting corresponding to
the Kirk Session, with Circuit Meetings and District Synods resembling Presbytery
and Synod. One of the Church’s characteristics is its strong emphasis on lay leader¬
ship. There are nearly 23,000 trained lay preachers sharing the ministers’ work and
preaching in thousands of local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the Indepen¬
dent Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary basis and
women (many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men; and the Wesleyan
Reform Union which, while retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives
autonomy to each of its 177 individual Churches.
The Congregational and Baptist Churches
The Congregational and Baptist Churches both regard the Church as a covenanted
fellowship of believers; ministers (who may be men or women) are called to special
service, and trained and recognized by the Church. Local Churches have formed
county and national unions, whose secretariat and assemblies have much influence,
but no compulsive authority over them, since great importance is attached to the
autonomy of local church meetings.
The Congregationalists in Britain, including Welsh Independents, number
340,000 and the Baptists 335,000 adult members. Baptists differ from Congrega¬
tionalists in practising the baptism of believers only; they do not baptize infants.
The Unestablishcd Presbyterian Churches
The largest of the Presbyterian Churches outside the established Church of Scot¬
land is the Presbyterian (or Calvinist Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from
the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in i735» and now embraces a con¬
siderable proportion of the Welsh-speaking population; its members number some
150,000. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the next in size, followed by the
Presbyterian Church of England, which is organized in fourteen presbyteries. The
highest court of the Presbyterian Church of England is the General Assembly;
women are admitted to the eldership and ministry.
Other Presbyterian Churches in Britain include: the Free Church of Scotland;
the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church
of Ireland (which consists of 38 congregations and preaching stations, all but 5 of
which are in Northern Ireland); and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of
Ireland, comprising 4 presbyteries and synods (3 of which are in Northern Ireland)
with 30 congregations.
4°4 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other Christian Denominations
Among other Christian denominations in the United Kingdom are: the Unitarian
and Free Christian Churches, which number about 300 and are united by loyalty
to the principle of freedom of thought in religion; the Churches of Christ (known
also in the United States of America as Disciples of Christ) which have been an
organized community in Great Britain since early in the nineteenth century, and
have a membership of about 10,000; the British Province of the Moravian Church,
which is an international missionary church; the Free Church of England (or
Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the
Oxford Movement; the Society of Friends; and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, was founded in the middle of the seventeenth
century by George Fox. It has no ordained ministry and does not observe the sacra¬
ments. One of the chief characteristics of the Quakers is their belief in pacifism
and their firm adherence to pacifist methods. Their influence in many parts of the
world, especially in social reform and ip the relief of suffering, is very wide in relation
to their numbers. There are about 21,000 Quakers in Britain.
The Salvation Army, founded by William Booth, a Methodist, in 1878, is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual and
social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to those hitherto
untouched by religious effort. The movement, in which military rather than eccle¬
siastical terminology is used, has branches all over the world, and its social work
(particularly that connected with the welfare of members of the British armed
forces serving overseas) is well supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other Free
Church, have over 340 branch Churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church
I he Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became temporarily
extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish hierarchy
became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in 1878, while
the Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct. The normal government of
the Church, namely by territorial archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule
in the whole of the United Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organization is
the province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an archbishop.
The chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is the Archbishop of
Westminster. A province normally comprises several dioceses, each under a bishop
aided by a chapter of canons and others, and by priests in charge of the parishes
into which the diocese is sub-divided. In England and Wales, at the end of 1956,
there were four provinces: Westminster, Liverpool, Birmingham and Cardiff; 14
dioceses; and 1,919 parishes. In Scotland, there were two provinces: St. Andrews
and Edinburgh, and Glasgow; six dioceses; and about 375 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there were five dioceses (several of which, since there is one hierarchy for
the whole of Ireland, have territory partly in the Republic of Ireland and partly in
Northern Ireland) all of these are in the Province of Armagh; and 172 parishes.
In the whole of the United Kingdom, there are over four and a half million adhe¬
rents, including children, to the Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
Roman Catholic children in their own faith, and requires that the children of
marriages between Roman Catholics and members of any other Church should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in the
United Kingdom are staffed by members of the great Roman Catholic Orders for
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS

men and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing, child care,
and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jewry
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the beginning of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being the
Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth century an
Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was established, which
increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial cities. By 1956, as a result
of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on the Continent during
the second world war, the Anglo-Jewish community of some 400,000 had become
the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought, each of
which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox (the original
groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches less religious
importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the Jewish faith, began
in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the Liberal Jewish Move¬
ment which, in addition, lays emphasis on the reinterpretation of traditional
Judaism in the light of modern thought and custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain
who belong to any kind of synagogue, about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief
Rabbi is the head of the largest group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the
Haham is the head of the Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain of all sections of Jewry, number approximately 445»
including 17 Liberal and 15 Reform congregations. There are a few schools which
cater exclusively for Jewish children, but the vast majority attend the ordinary
State or independent schools, and receive extra-curricular instruction in the Jewish
faith.
Other Religious Communities
Among other non-Christian communities in Britain, the Moslems are the most
widely represented. The principal mosque is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking,
and there are also mosques in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and
Glasgow.
A Buddhist temple was ceremonially opened in South Kensington, London, in
May 1954; and other premises were opened in 1956 as a meeting place and dis¬
cussion centre for adherents of Buddhism.
Co-operation between the Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the Churches. The British Council of Churches was founded in 1942 and
includes official representatives from almost all the Churches of the British Isles,
with the notable exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council facilitates
common action between the Churches and seeks to further the cause of Christian
unity. The Archbishop of Canterbury is president. In addition, many though not
all of the Free Churches in England and Wales are members of the Free Church
Federal Council (formed in 1940 by the amalgamation of the Federal Council of
Evangelical Free Churches with the National Free Church Council), the aims of
which are to promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches, and to
provide a channel through which the Free Churches can communicate and nego¬
tiate with central and local government organs as a united body. Exploratory dis¬
cussions on changes in organization to allow of closer relations between the Church

of England, the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the
Presbyterian Church of England have been taking place for the last few years, and
a report containing a number of proposals was issued in 1957. In 1956, conversa¬
tions between representatives of the Church of England and the Methodist Church
were also initiated.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the four countries which make
up the British Isles also participate in the World Council of Churches, which was
constituted at Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948, and held its second assembly at
Evanston, Illinois, U.S.A., in August 1954. The Council links together 162 Churches
in 49 nations for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes place on
specific issues, but there is no machinery of continuous co-operation. The Council
of Christians and Jews works for better understanding between members of the
two religions, and deals with problems arising in the social field.
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
While the promotion of the sciences in the United Kingdom is largely the
concern of those learned societies and institutions devoted specifically to this end,
only a small part of the research which is vital to science is carried out directly by
them. Most of the ‘ pure ’ or ‘ fundamental ’ research is conducted in the universities,
which also play an essential part in promoting the sciences by maintaining a steady
supply of trained scientists. In practice, it has become impossible to distinguish
clearly between science and its extensive applications in everyday life, with the
result that scientific research in the widest sense has become the concern also of
industry and of various Departments of Government.
In recent years it has become an acknowledged responsibility of the Government
not only to undertake research directly but also to keep under review' the facilities
for the training of scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain
research projects, and to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters of
national interest. As a result a system of collaboration has developed between the
universities, industry, the learned societies and the Government w'hich is of great
value to the community and leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to
individual scientists.
Though scientific research is carried out mainly under three different kinds of
administration—university, industry and Government—there is strong liaison and
close co-operation between them, while the learned societies remain free to play a
most important part in the discussion and publication of the results of research.
Important work is also undertaken by independent organizations—for example,
in medical research, by the British Empire Cancer Campaign, the Imperial Cancer |
Research Fund, the Nuffield Foundation, the Lister Institute of Preventive Medi¬
cine, the Wellcome Foundation and Trust, and by some large pharmaceutical firms.
The Nuffield Foundation, which was established by Lord Nuffield in 1943, has a
wider scope. Its aims are: the advancement of health and the prevention and relief
of sickness; the advancement of social well-being; the care and comfort of the aged
poor; the advancement of education; and such other charitable purposes as shall
be declared by Lord Nuffield in his lifetime and by the trustees after his death.
Prominent among the Foundation’s many activities are the promotion of medical,
scientific and social research and the development of medical services and of technical
and commercial education. Its resources consist of a fund of £10 million provided
by Lord Nuffield and of gifts and bequests from other persons.

RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
407
THE LEARNED SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the develop¬
ment and organization of science in Britain ; not only have they provided the back¬
ground for the continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards, but
they have been a meeting ground where all scientists can forgather for the exchange
of ideas, and a reliable source from which new ideas for the enrichment of know¬
ledge can flow. Although today the bulk of research operations is conducted under
auspices other than theirs, the learned societies have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of scientific knowledge and the application of new
discoveries.
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with approxi¬
mately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical institutions
and professional associations, many of which are playing a distinguished part in
promoting their own branches of science and are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. Prominent examples of these are the
British Medical Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of
Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Physics, and the
Institute of Biology.
The Royal Society (or, more fully, the Royal Society of London), founded in
1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s scientific affairs, although for two
centuries scientists were in a minority among its members, whose interests lay
mainly in history, art, archaeology or exploration. The Society has always been
independent of State control but its advice on scientific matters has frequently
been sought by the Government. Today its influence remains as strong as ever and
its Fellows serve on most of the Advisory Councils of Government Departments.
Its Fellowship consists of approximately 500 eminent scientists and 50 foreign
members. Admission of the former is restricted to 25 a year, and of the latter to four
a year; a few eminent non-scientists are also elected to Fellowships. The Society
maintains a library (145,000 books of a purely scientific nature), issues a large
number of publications, including the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceed¬
ings, and convenes conferences which are attended by scientists from all countries.
In addition, the Society is responsible for the administration of many research
funds and special funds derived from various sources and a number of Government
grants. These funds and grants are used for the promotion of science through
research, publications, congresses, the award of medals, lectures, and in many other
ways.
The Royal Society of Arts (originally the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce) was founded in i754> and as it was the first society
of its kind its work was at first very wide, covering scientific, technical, industrial
and commercial matters on a world-wide scale. As institutions devoted to the
specialized branches of science and industry came to be established, the Society
gradually abandoned some of its earlier fields of work, but it is still a recognized
forum for the discussion of technical and other subjects.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching
the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the promotion of
chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manufactures ,
and ‘ the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge ’. Its character, however, was
largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday who
established a tradition of research. Today, the Institution has extensive research
2D
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
408
laboratories, and lectures are given on the recent developments in science and other
branches of knowledge. Its library of some 70,000 books includes many early
scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. At the present day one of
its chief activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as
well as by eminent scientists. Its 13 sections cover the whole range of pure and
applied science other than medical science, and there is a division for studying the
social and international relations of science. Collaboration with other scientific
organizations has always been an important function of the British Association,
and it has an organized relationship with over 150 scientific bodies and learned
societies. It has also played an important part in the development of science by
taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and application
of scientific knowledge.
THE UNIVERSITIES
The universities carry the main responsibility for the pursuit of fundamental
research and for the training of scientists. During recent years there has also been
a considerable expansion of technological training and research facilities within the
universities, all of which now offer work in one or more technological subjects
(e.g., applied science, engineering, metallurgy and industrial fermentation).
According to a survey carried out by the Ministry of Labour and National
Service, the number of qualified scientists and engineers (i.e. holders of degrees
or diplomas, or members of certain professional institutions) in employment in
Great Britain at the beginning of 1956 was 142,000, including some 7,000 engaged
in postgraduate research at universities and on National Service. Starting from
these figures the Committee on Scientific Manpower of the Advisory Council on
Scientific Policy has estimated that over the next ten to fifteen years the present
annual output of some 10,000 qualified scientists and engineers should be raised
to 20,000. The Government has accepted this figure as a reasonable goal and will
support measures to ensure that the universities and technical colleges together
will be able to produce at least this number. The Government’s plans for a large-
scale and rapid expansion of education in advanced technology include the increase
of advanced work at technical colleges, as well as at the universities (see pp. 376
and 377)- Certain technical colleges in England and Wales have been designated as
‘colleges of advanced technology’; in Scotland, advanced instruction in a wide
range of technologies is given at Central Institutions (see p. 376). Details of the
Government’s plans for technical education were published in February 1956
(Cmd. 9703).
Nearly all universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom (see p. 374)
have laboratories or research departments. Over two-thirds of the income of the j
universities comes from Government sources. There is no direct departmental con¬
trol and the method of administering the grant—through the University Grants
Committee (see p. 374)—ensures academic freedom. Additional funds for the prose¬
cution of research are also secured in some instances by the private endowment of
research fellowships generally awarded by the universities to selected persons, or
by grants from outside bodies tenable at the universities. Examples are the Lever-
hulme Fellowships, the Imperial Chemical Industries Fellowships and the research
grants of the Nuffield Foundation.
The universities are also assisted by grants from industry and commerce and
from the Government Research Councils. An example of the close co-operation
that has been achieved between several branches of industry and the research
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
409
departments of universities is the Glass Delegation of the University of Sheffield.
This is responsible for the general direction of the work of the Department of Glass
Technology and is composed of members appointed by the Council of the Univer¬
sity and representatives of firms and companies who subscribe funds for the
furtherance of training and research. A notable example of co-operation between a
Government Department, an independent organization and a university is the
world’s largest steerable pencil-beam radio telescope (see photograph facing p. 406)
at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, which is being financed jointly by the Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 412) and the Nuffield Foundation,
and developed by Manchester University. The telescope will be used mainly for the
study of stars detectable only from their emission of electromagnetic waves, very
distant nebulae and galaxies.
RESEARCH IN INDUSTRY
Industrial research in Britain is conducted by individual industrial firms and
organizations independently of Government aid, by co-operative Research Associa¬
tions which make use of facilities afforded by the Government, by sponsored research
institutes, and by universities and some of the major technical colleges. (Estimates
of the expenditure of these various research agencies are given on pp. 422-3.)
The main nationalized industries have their own research establishments and
also give financial support to organizations concerned with research into matters
of interest to them. An account of the research arrangements of the National Coal
Board, the Central Electricity Authority and the Gas Council is given on pp. 186,
195 and 198.
Research Associations
A scheme to form Research Associations, by which the Government associated
itself with groups of firms having similar interests, was started in 1915, on the recom¬
mendation of the then newly formed Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, which has only recently been replaced by an Executive Council with
rather different functions (see p. 412). In 1957 there were 46 such Research Asso¬
ciations (see Appendix II, pp. 458—9) with a combined income of £4 million, of
which about one-third is contributed by the Government through the Industrial
Grants Committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The
amounts of the Government grants are related to the contributions made by the
industries concerned.
The Research Associations are autonomous bodies, governed by their own
councils, the large majority of whose members are representatives of industry.
The councils are advised by research committees in the preparation of research
programmes.
Sponsored Research Institutes. A number of sponsored research institutes have
been established to meet the needs of private firms which are unable to maintain
fully equipped research laboratories. In these institutes research can be carried out
confidentially so that the results and any patents which may arise from it are
retained as the property of the sponsoring body. The principal institutes are the
Fulmer Research Institute and the Sondes Place Research Institute.
National Research Development Corporation. T. he National Research Develop¬
ment Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the Board of d rade in 1948. Its function
is primarily to develop, in the public interest, inventions resulting from research
carried out by Government Departments and other public bodies. Under the
Development of Inventions Act, i954> however, NRDC is now allowed, under
certain conditions, to initiate research as well as to develop inventions resulting
4io
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from research. It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by the
Board of Trade, with powers to borrow from Government funds up to £5 million
in the first ten years of its life. Projects selected for development include electronic
digital computers, Merton diffraction gratings, a lightweight power unit, a potato
harvester, printed electrical circuits, and the manufacture of cortisone from heco-
genin obtained from the sisal plant.
GOVERNMENT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
Early Developments
Although the active participation by the Government in scientific effort is, for the
most part, a twentieth-century development, its association with science dates from
a much earlier time. Interest in navigation led Charles II in 1675 to establish
Britain’s first State-supported institution—the Royal Observatory at Greenwich,
now transferred to Herstmonceux, Sussex—for the purpose of correcting the tables
of the positions of the moon and fixed stars ‘ for the use of his seamen ’. The Geo¬
logical Survey of Great Britain—the first national institution of its kind in the
world—originated in 1835. In 1842 the Department of the Government Chemist
was founded, and in 1854 ‘for the safe-guarding of seamen’ the Meteorological
Office was established by the Board of Trade. All these Government Departments
were using scientific knowledge but there was little organized effort towards the
application of the discoveries made in pure science. Government scientific organi¬
zation, like many British institutions, evolved gradually in response to the changing
social and economic circumstances of the times.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into methods
of precise measurement, led to the establishment of the National Physical Labora¬
tory under the control of the Royal Society in 1900, with a modest grant from the
Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant towards upkeep.
From i9°9, however, the Government assumed a wider responsibility for pro¬
moting and encouraging scientific research and since that time its assistance has
been adapted to meet the rapidly changing conditions in industry and education.
The Development Commission (see p. 171), appointed in 1909 by the Govern¬
ment, recommended that financial aid should be made available from the Develop¬
ment Fund to ‘ aid and develop agriculture and rural industries by promoting
scientific research’. In 1911 the Development Fund was used to establish a scheme
which led to the formation of most of the present-day agricultural research institutes.
In 1913 a Medical Research Committee (the forerunner of the Medical Research
Council) was appointed to administer the research funds provided under the
National Health Insurance Act of 1911.
Up to the outbreak of the first world war, the Government’s contribution to
scientific research was made directly through such organizations as these, and
indirectly through grants administered on its behalf by such bodies as the Royal
Society and the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London.
The recognition of the importance of scientific research and of the application of
scientific knowledge to commerce and industry led to the establishment of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as a separate Govern¬
ment Department in 1916.
In 1918 financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory was trans¬
ferred from the Royal Society to the DSIR, although the Royal Society continued
to advise on the scientific direction of the Laboratory.
The Forestry Commissioners were appointed in 1919 with powers to undertake
and aid research for the promotion of forestry.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 411
In 1920 the Government established the Medical Research Council with a grant-
in-aid provided directly by Parliament.
The third of the Councils created by the Government for the promotion of
research, the Agricultural Research Council, was established in 1931. In addition to
its duties as adviser to the Development Commissioners and the Agricultural
Departments (for England and Wales and for Scotland), the Council was given
funds of its own from which grants could be made for special research projects.
During the second world war a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War
Cabinet was created, with the object of co-ordinating defence research and civil
research.
The Lord President of the Council, as the Minister responsible for the three
Research Councils and as President of the Scientific Advisory Committee, came
to be regarded as the member of the Cabinet responsible for the direction of
Government scientific organization.
Post-war Developments
At the end of the second world war, the Government established an Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy 1 to advise the Lord President of the Council in the
exercise of his responsibility for the formulation and execution of Government
scientific policy’.
The Advisory Council, appointed by the Lord President in January I947> has 15
members—12 eminent scientists from the universities, industry and Government
service, and 3 senior Government administrators.
In the same year the Defence Research Policy Committee was established ‘to
advise the Minister of Defence and Chiefs of Staff on matters connected with the
formulation of scientific policy in the defence field
These two bodies replaced the Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet.
In order to give adequate attention to each of the subjects within its wide range
of interest, the Advisory Council has established the following standing committees:
the Committee on Scientific Manpower;
the Scientific Library and Technical Information Committee; and
the Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations.
Government Machinery for Civil Scientific Research
The principles underlying Government scientific organization are briefly as
follows:
1. The Lord President of the Council is responsible for the formulation and
execution of Government scientific policy and is advised by the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy on general questions which relate to the whole
field of civil science.
2. The Lord President is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research
Council, the Agricultural Research Council, and the Nature Conservancy,
and is chairman of the three Privy Council Committees to which they report
—the Committees for Scientific and Industrial Research, Medical Research,
and Agricultural Research and Nature Conservation.
3. The Prime Minister is the Minister responsible to Parliament for general
oversight of the development of atomic energy, and appoints the members
of the Atomic Energy Authority (see pp. 414-6).
4. Other Ministers are responsible for the scientific establishments within their
own Departments.
412
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
5. The advice of the Research Councils is at the disposal of the Executive
Departments and there is close liaison between them, but the Research
Councils are not subject to departmental control.
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The DSIR is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research of which the Lord President is chairman. Since DSIR was
set up in 1916, this Committee has been advised by an Advisory Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, which included in its membership eminent
scientists and leading industrialists, two members closely connected with organized
labour and assessors appointed by Government Departments. But, in 1955, with
the large increase in the Department’s work, the Government set up a Committee
of Inquiry into its organization.
The report of this Committee was accepted by the Government and its recom¬
mendations embodied in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
Act, 1956. The first and main purpose of this Act was to replace the existing Advi¬
sory Council by an Executive Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; the
second, to provide in a specific Act of Parliament for the expenditure of the Depart¬
ment to be met out of funds provided by Parliament.
The Council, which consists of a Chairman and 12 members, is charged with the
organization, development and encouragement of scientific and industrial research
and with the dissemination of the results of such research, and, in particular, may:
(1) encourage and support scientific research in universities, technical colleges
and other institutions;
(2) establish or develop institutions or departments of institutions for investi¬
gation and research relating to the advancement of trade and industry; and
(3) take steps to further the practical application of the results of scientific and
industrial research.
The DSIR discharges these functions through 13 national research organiza¬
tions under its own control and direction and financed from its own Vote, and one,
the Fire Research Organization, which is maintained by the Department and the
Fire Office Committee jointly; and also through the autonomous Research Asso¬
ciations (see Appendix II, pp. 458-9).
The Council may also make grants for these purposes and grants for postgraduate
instruction in science and technology to individual workers or to institutions.
The close contacts maintained between the DSIR and other Government Depart¬
ments, Research Associations and other bodies help to ensure that the scientific
resources of the Department are applied to the solution of problems which are of
most importance to the national economy and are used to make the maximum
contribution to improving industrial efficiency.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC), the successor of the Medical Research
Committee, was incorporated under its present title by Royal Charter in 1920.
The MRC is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Medical
Research, of which the Lord President is chairman and the Secretaries of State for
the Home Department, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, and the Colonies, and
the Ministers of Health and of Labour and National Service are members.
The members of the Council, appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council
for a period normally of four years, are twelve in number. Nine members, repre¬
senting the different branches of medical knowledge and the fundamental sciences
413
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
on which these are based, are appointed after consultation with the President of
the Royal Society and with the Council. On retirement these scientific members are
not eligible for reappointment. Three members are appointed in respect of other
than scientific qualifications; one of them must be a member of the blouse of Lords
and one a member of the House of Commons.
The Council’s chief function is to undertake or promote scientific investigations
to obtain new knowledge likely to be of value in the field of curative and preventive
medicine. In planning and carrying out its research programme, the Council may
be assisted by special committees which it appoints to advise on particular subjects.
In general, the arrangements for the support of research fall under three headings:
x. Investigations by members of the Council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in the Council’s own research establishments.
2. Temporary research grants to independent investigators in universities and
elsewhere.
3. Research scholarships, travelling scholarships and fellowships for work both
at home and abroad.
The Council’s own research activities are conducted in the National Institute
for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead, London, and in some 50 smaller
establishments, generally known as Research Units or Groups, which are attached
in most cases to universities and hospitals (listed in Appendix II, pp. 459-61);
some of these are concerned with clinical research and others with laboratory
studies. In 1951, the Council assumed the major financial responsibility for the
Institute of Cancer Research, which has continued to receive substantial support
from the British Empire Cancer Campaign. The Council also undertakes medical
research in certain dependent territories and, with additional support from Colonial
Development and Welfare funds, maintains laboratories in the Gambia and units
in Uganda and Jamaica.
The MRC administers the Public Health Laboratory Service on behalf of the
Ministry of Health (see p. 367)*
Agricultural Research Council
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established by Royal Charter in
1931. It is responsible to a Committee of the Privy Council for agricultural research,
consisting of the Lord President of the Council, the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Under the Agricultural Research Act, 1956, which took effect from 1st April,
1956, the ARC was charged with the organization and development of agricultural
research, and there was established an Agricultural Research Fund into which are
paid the Parliamentary grant-in-aid, and other sums received by the Council, and
out of which are met all expenses incurred by the Council under the Act or in
accordance with the terms of its Charter. rl he accounts of the Fund are audited by
the Comptroller and Auditor General.
The Council consists of not more than 18 nor fewer than 15 members, five of
whom are appointed for their general experience of and interest in agriculture.
Others are appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council, after consultation
with the President of the Royal Society, on account of their qualifications in one
or other of the sciences relating to agriculture. Included in the Council s member¬
ship are the Chief Scientific Adviser (Agriculture) and the Chief \ eterinary Officer
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, also one member appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and one by the Secretary of State
414
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for Scotland. The Council has 17 research stations and units under its direct control
in Great Britain (see Appendix II, pp. 461-2).
Since 1st April, 1956, when the Agricultural Research Act came into force,
responsibility for the administration and financing of the independent research
institutes in England and Wales (but not in Scotland) was transferred to the
Council from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The programmes of
all these institutes are co-ordinated and approved by the Council and are integrated
with those of the independent research institutes in Scotland and of the institutes
and units directly controlled and financed by the Council.1
I he Council also makes grants to universities and other recognized research in¬
stitutions for special investigations, and awards research fellowships, training
grants and research studentships in agricultural and veterinary science, including,
for the first time in i95^» scholarships in agricultural and dairy engineering and
statistics.
Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy was established by Royal Charter in 1949 and is
directly responsible to the Lord President of the Council as Chairman of the Privy
Council Committee for Nature Conservation. Its functions, as summarized in the
charter, are ‘ to provide scientific advice on the conservation and control of the
natural flora and fauna of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature
reserves in Great Britain (see p. 397), including the maintenance of physical
features of scientific interest; and to organize and develop the research and scientific
service related thereto’.
Research stations have been set up by the Conservancy at Merlewood, Grange-
over-Sands in Lancashire, and Furzebrook, Wareham in Dorset, and field stations
at Moor House, Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross-shire, where long-term
ecological research is undertaken into such problems as the relation of vegetation
to soils and climates, peat growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal
erosion, roadside spraying and the spread of myxomatosis. Grants are made for
research, and the Conservancy awards a number of postgraduate studentships
annually.
Atomic Energy Authority
Before 1946 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was respon¬
sible for atomic energy research and development.
From 1946 to the end of 1953, this responsibility rested with the Minister of
Supply. By April 1953, however, the Government had decided in principle to
transfer responsibility for atomic energy from the Minister of Supply to a non-
departmental organization, in view both of the growing importance of the indus¬
trial applications of atomic energy and the need for an organization for atomic
energy more akin to that of a large industrial undertaking. It was subsequently '
announced that, as from 1st January, 1954, the Lord President of the Council
would be generally responsible for the development of atomic energy in the United
Kingdom.
Under the Atomic Energy Authority Act, 1954, the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority assumed responsibility for the operation of the atomic energy
project from 1st August, 1954. The Lord President remained responsible to Parlia¬
ment for atomic energy policy generally and also, subject to the consent of the Trea¬
sury, for providing funds for the Authority out of money provided by Parliament.
In particular, he had the duty of securing that, in the Authority’s operations,
Tor a list of these institutes and units see Appendix II, pp. 461-2.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
the proper degrees of importance were attached to the various applications of
atomic energy. He was assisted, in the exercise of these responsibilities, by the
Atomic Energy Office, which also provides any necessary liaison between the
Authority and other Government Departments. In April 1957, the Lord Presi¬
dent’s responsibility for atomic energy was transferred, by Order in Council, to
the Prime Minister. The Minister of Supply continues to be responsible for pro¬
viding atomic weapons to the Services and places contracts with the Authority for
the production of nuclear components of such weapons and research related to
them; the Authority is free to conduct experimental work which may lead to
improved types of warheads for such weapons. The Atomic Energy Authority
advises the Electricity Authorities on nuclear factors in the construction of power
stations (see p. 192).
The Atomic Energy Authority, whose members are appointed by the Prime
Minister, may consist of not fewer than eight and not more than 11 members,
including the chairman.
The Authority, like other statutory corporations, is free from day-to-day Govern¬
ment control (subject to the power, given to the Minister responsible, to issue direc¬
tions to the Authority on any matter where he considers over-riding national
interests require his intervention), but differs from them in that the bulk of its
revenue is derived from money voted by Parliament and in that its accounts are
examined and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General (see p. 300).
The Authority’s establishments are divided into three groups: Research,
Industrial and Weapons.
The Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Plarwell, in Berkshire, is respon¬
sible for fundamental research into all aspects of atomic energy and particularly
for basic research and early development work on the generation of power from
nuclear energy. Harwell operates a number of experimental and materials testing
reactors. Some assistance is given to the Weapons Group on specific problems.
The Harwell Establishment, and its principal outstation, the Radiochemical
Centre at Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, are also concerned with preparing and
distributing radio-isotopes and other radioactive substances (see p. 218).
In March 1936, the Atomic Energy Authority announced that it was acquiring
two built-up areas on Grove Airfield, near Wantage, Berkshire, as a site for a small
outstation of the Harwell Establishment primarily intended to allow the Tech¬
nological Irradiation Group to develop more rapidly in association with industrial
requirements. This group, a part of the Harwell Isotope Division, was formed in
June 1955 to assist industry in making full use of the large amounts of radioactive
material which will become available from the expanding nuclear energy pro¬
gramme (see p. 192). As Harwell is now nearing its limit for growth, another site
at Winfrith Heath, in Dorset, will accommodate further expansion.
At Harwell, there are both isotope and reactor schools. The Isotope School was
started in April 1951. The first laboratories were in a converted wooden hut, but
the school has moved twice to larger and better equipped premises. From its incep¬
tion until 1st February, 1957, 817 students from 40 countries had passed through
the school. . , .
The Reactor School at Harwell was opened on 27th September, 1954i.'ts object
is to provide training for staff from industrial firms so as to accelerate industna
participation in the atomic energy project. For the first course, 41 students were
enrolled. The first course open to overseas students was held in the autumn of
1955 J of a total of 49 students on that course, 21 were from overseas countries. Up
to, and including, the first course in i957, a total of 471 students have passed
through the reactor school, of whom 84 came from overseas. New buildings, which

416
will increase its capacity, were completed in September 1956, and the programme
of courses has been adapted to meet the needs of several types of student.
The production of fissile material and the design, construction and operation of
certain prototype nuclear plants (see p. 192) are directed from the headquarters of
the Industrial Group at Risley, near Warrington in Lancashire. The Group is re¬
sponsible for atomic factories and laboratories at Springfields, Windscale and
Capenhurst, and also for laboratories at Culcheth and Dounreay. Research on
atomic weapons is carried on at the establishment at Aldermaston, in Berkshire,
and at outstations at Woolwich, London, at Foulness in Essex and at Orfordness
in Suffolk (see map, p. 193).
The London office of the Atomic Energy Authority is responsible for materials
procurement and for various centralized functions relating to such matters as staff,
finance and international relations.
National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science
In February 1957, the Government set up a National Institute for Research
in Nuclear Science, which provides, for common use by universities and others,
facilities and equipment which are beyond the scope of individual universities
and institutions carrying out research in the nuclear field. It does not replace
the research already being done in individual universities with assistance from
Government funds; nor does it affect the Government’s participation in the
international scheme for common facilities set up in Geneva under the auspices
of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The Institute is
financed in the main by grants through the Atomic Energy Authority from the
Atomic Energy Vote. The universities’ expenditure is confined to the payment of
salaries and expenses of their own academic staff using the research facilities provided.
The Institute is managed by a governing board appointed jointly by the
Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and consists
of representatives of the universities, the Atomic Energy Authority, the University
Grants Committee, the Royal Society and the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research, with an independent chairman.
Other Government-sponsored Scientific Research
All Departments rely on one or other of the Government Research Councils for
scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of scientific
information, a few have set up supplementary research organizations of their own.
Defence Research with Civil Applications
Research and development undertaken by the Admiralty is primarily directed to
meeting the requirements of the Royal Navy, but a substantial amount of this work
has important civil applications. Furthermore, the Admiralty is responsible through
the Royal Naval Scientific Service for inter-Service electronic valve research and
development. The research activities of the Royal Observatory and the National
Institute of Oceanography, which are mainly in the civil field, are also administered
by the Admiralty.
The Ministry of Supply carries out research needed to meet the technical
requirements of defence and is also responsible for research in some civilian fields,
e.g., the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the National Gas Turbine Establishment
at Farnborough, and the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern. Some funda¬
mental research is also carried out for the Ministry by universities and industrial
organizations.
The Air Ministry is responsible for the Meteorological Office (see p. 45), where
the research carried out has many applications on the civil side.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
417
Agriculture
Apart from research at the grant-aided Institutes and the centres financed by
the Agricultural Research Council and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food conducts research in its own
Veterinary Laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey and at Lasswade, Midlothian, Scot¬
land, and also at its Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire; and
its Infestation Control Division at Tolworth, Surrey, conducts research into prob¬
lems affecting the destruction and control of insect pests of stored food, rodent
pests and other animal and bird pests. Limited research in entomology and
helminthology is carried out by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland at its
plant pathology laboratory in Edinburgh. In Northern Ireland research in all the
major agricultural sciences is carried out directly by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Fisheries
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are: the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food, which maintains four laboratories for marine, shell-fish,
salmon and freshwater fisheries research, and four research vessels; the Scottisn
Home Department, which maintains a marine research laboratory, four research
ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater research laboratory at Pitlochry; and the
Development Commissioners. . .
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on
Fishery Research, co-ordinate all fishery research. From the Development Fund
(see p. 410) a number of independent institutions receive grants for marine and
freshwater research.1
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, under the direction of its
Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), conducts research in nutrition and food tech¬
nology. In addition, it has experimental laboratories and kitchens in London and
an experimental factory at Aberdeen to facilitate the commercial development and
application of the results of research.
The Forestry Commission (see pp. 177-8) undertakes experimental work relating
to silvicultural and allied problems. By means of grants, it also aids forest research
work undertaken by various universities and other institutions, including the
Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford.
Power ... ,
The Ministry of Power has responsibility for research on safety in mines, and
plays a direct part in research such as that into the development of coal-consuming
gas turbines, underground gasification and total gasification. There is close colla¬
boration between the Ministry, the Scientific Departments of the National Coal
Board, the Central Electricity Authority, the Gas Council, and the Fuel Research
Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, all of which are
responsible for research in their own fields.
Transport , • , , . ^
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is concerned with research into
aspects of marine navigation, road construction and airport operations, ut most

Biological Station); Scottish Marine Biological Association Millport Isle of Cumbrae^
Freshwater Biological Association, Ambleside, Westmorland; Dove Marine Laboratory
(King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the basic work is carried out for the Ministry by the Admiralty, the Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Ministry of Supply. Research on
radio aids for marine navigation, for instance, is undertaken by the Admiralty,
while the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research concerns itself with
researches into the materials and construction of roads, soil mechanics and road
safety.
A variety of researches of an operational and applied character are conducted
b> Ministry staff, sometimes in collaboration with the research establishments
mentioned above. Studies have been made of problems related to matters such as
the landing and take-off of aircraft, slippery runways, aircraft noise and tele¬
communications .
Land Use and Planning
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for policy relating
to the use and development of land in England and Wales. Through its Technical
Services Directorate, the Ministry deals with technical planning and geographical,
geological, economic and sociological research. Similar arrangements are made for
Scotland by the Department of Health for Scotland. The Ministry of Health and
Local Government is responsible for the general administration of the planning
legislation in Northern Ireland.
Building
The Ministry of Works is responsible for reviewing the whole field of research
and technical development of the building industry and for ensuring that the results
of research are made available to the industry. Research is carried out by the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, in particular at the Building
Research Station.
Radio and Telecommunications
The Post Office undertakes scientific research on a wide range of subjects relating
to telephone, telegraph and radio systems which is carried out by the Research
Branch of the Engineering Department. It also undertakes the experimental
development of radio transmitters and receivers for Post Office services and other
Government Departments. The Post Office keeps in close touch with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Television Authority (ITA)
in connection with the development of broadcasting techniques.
Analytical Chemistry
The Department of the Government Chemist is responsible for providing
analytical services to all Government Departments that may require them. It
carries out special investigations, e.g., in connection with nutritional and physio-
logical surveys, and conducts fundamental research in infra-red spectrography,
chromatography and X-ray study of crystals.
Medicine and Health
In addition to the work carried on under the aegis of the Medical Research
Council, the Ministry of Health may conduct and promote research into the cause,
prevention and treatment of illness or mental defectiveness.
Phe Department of Health for Scotland has similar responsibilities, and an
Advisory Committee on Medical Research in Scotland works with the Medical
Research Council.
In Northern Ireland, the Hospitals Authority (a statutory body set up by the
Minister of Health and Local Government) has power to conduct or assist medical
research. In addition, it has a statutory duty to provide adequate bacteriological
and pathological services.
4I9
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
The General Register Office carries out research in four main fields: (i) analysis
and interpretation of statistics of causes of death; (2) statistical inquiry into the
treatment of cancer and its results; (3) morbidity as revealed in hospital statistics;
and (4) mental health.
Colonial Research
The bulk of the research work relating to Colonial development is done locally,
but much of it requires close collaboration with research institutes and laboratories
in Britain. It is the function of the Colonial Research Council to co-ordinate the
work of the specialist committees and to advise on general questions relating to
policy. The specialist bodies concerned deal with research into such subjects as
agriculture, animal health, forestry, medicine, social science and colonial products.
Anti-Locust Research
Since 1929, the Government has financed an Anti-Locust Research Centre in
London which, since 1931, has been internationally adopted as the world centre
for locust research. This organization has during the past twenty years received
and co-ordinated information on locust movements and breeding from some 40
countries, undertaken scientific research into the life-history and habits of the
different species, and investigated and developed methods for their control and
destruction.
Other Research Work
Finally there are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government
Departments which undertake a certain amount of research work in addition to
their other scientific activities. These include the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew)
and the Ordnance Survey Department. The main library at Kew Gardens, attached
to the Herbarium, one of the amenities offered to research w’orkers, was founded
in 1853 and consists of more than 50,000 botanical books including a section of
books on botanical exploration. The library is classified both by subject and geo¬
graphically, and contains a valuable collection of prints and drawings of plants. Two
branch libraries at Kew comprise books on gardening and on economic botany
respectively. The Ordnance Survey was founded in 1791 to prepare a map of Great
Britain mainly for defence purposes. The present work of the Survey, which is
now the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, is chiefly
civil in character.
Scientific Museums
The British Museum (Natural History)—an independent section of the British
Museum—contains one of the world’s largest collections of natural history material
and is recognized as a leading research institution.
The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science
in all countries, but chiefly in Great Britain which has always held a leading place
in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the development
of industrial machinery and processes, all of which are represented in the Museum s
collections. The geology of Britain is known in more exact detail than that of any
other country in the world, and the Geological Survey, responsible for this work,
has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological Museum. These three
museums are in South Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and Industry,
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.

The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939 by
members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary Science
Committee. It is one of a number of informal, unofficial, all-party Parliamentary
groups which have grown up spontaneously and have a varying degree of influence
(see p. 34). Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party and in
both Houses, and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making
scientific and technological organizations in Britain as may be affiliated under its
constitution. Membership in 1956 comprised 173 members of Parliament and
representatives of 100 scientific and technological institutions. The aims and objects
of the committee are:
1. To provide members of Parliament with authoritative scientific information
from time to time in connection with debates.
2. To bring to the notice of members of Parliament and Government Depart¬
ments the results of scientific research and technical development which
bear upon questions of current public interest.
3. To arrange for suitable action through parliamentary channels whenever
necessary to ensure that proper regard is had for the scientific point of view.
4. To examine all relevant legislation and to take such action as may be
suitable.
5. To watch the financing of scientific research.
6. To provide its members and other approved subscribers with a regular
summary of scientific matters dealt with in Parliament.
Broadly speaking, the activities of the committee may be divided under two
headings. First it provides, as far as possible, for a regular exchange of information
between members of Parliament and scientists; secondly, it endeavours to ensure
that action is taken to right matters seen to be wrong in the light of such information.
Scientific Liaison Overseas
The history of scientific progress is essentially a story involving many nations;
the organization of a country’s scientific research would be incomplete without
provision for adequate liaison with other countries.
Before the second world war, international scientific collaboration took place
through the exchange of university staffs, the awards of scholarships and fellow¬
ships, the close relations existing between the learned societies in this country and
their equivalent bodies abroad, and through international conferences and
congresses.
The war and the post-war period saw the emergence of a number of new develop¬
ments in overseas scientific collaboration, including the exchange of scientific
information. Well-known examples are the specialized agencies of the United
Nations Organization, e.g., the Food and Agriculture Organization, and those
concerned with nuclear energy, e.g., the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), in which the United
Kingdom is playing a full part.
Among the various channels through which scientific liaison is conducted are:
1. The British Commonwealth Scientific Offices. A feature of the war-time pattern
of scientific collaboration was the establishment of Scientific Missions, in London
by the United States and the Commonwealth countries, and in Washington by the
United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries; the latter subsequently
421
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
joined together as the British Commonwealth Scientific Office in Washington.
Since 1948 the Scientific Offices in London of the Commonwealth countries, set
up after the war, have been located in the same building, and are closely associated
with the Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR.
2. The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations. This committee of
the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was set up after the war to provide, among
other things, for discussion of general policy on overseas scientific representation,
scientific relations with Commonwealth and foreign countries, and scientific aspects
of the work of the United Nations.
3. The Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR. This division is responsible for the
executive work arising from the Standing Committee’s activities. It is regarded as
the general inter-departmental body responsible for overseas scientific liaison, an
is placed within the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for con¬
venience of organization.
4. Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux. Machinery exists in the Commonwealth
Agricultural Bureaux for liaison in the field of agricultural science between coun¬
tries of the Commonwealth. In the United Kingdom there are 10 Bureaux,
specializing in various branches of agricultural science, and two Institutes t e
Commonwealth Mycological Institute and the Commonwealth Institute of Ento¬
mology. A third Institute, the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, 1a
its headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. The Bureaux collect, collate and disseminate
information resulting from agricultural research.
5. The British Council. The aims of the British Council in the pure and applied
sciences are to foster closer co-operation between British scientists and scientists of
other countries, and to promote a better understanding of Britain among overseas
specialists by disseminating a knowledge of British activities and achievements
Under the first objective the exchange of visits between scientists in the United
Kingdom and other countries is of prime importance. Besides arranging lecture or
advisory tours overseas by eminent British scientists, the British Council, am g
many activities of a similar nature, brings to the United King om every year a
number of senior overseas specialists, postgraduate students and technicians on
visits of varying duration, for the purpose of study in Britis universities an o
institutions, or for discussion with British experts. In addition to publishing
British Medical Bulletin, intended primarily to keep overseas specialists informed ot
progress in medical research in Britain, the Council maintains a^.e^t^S1Yf ,
much used specialist information service. In the 60 countries in which the British
Council is represented, libraries are maintained and in many instances these have
strong sections of scientific and technological literature.
The British Council maintains at its headquarters specialist departmen
medicine and science (including agriculture and engineering), w 1 e in som
tries scientists are attached to its overseas representatives. The Council is advised y
eminent scientists who serve on its Science Advisory Committee and on specialist
panels for the different subjects.
Co-operation for the International Geophysical \ ear
The United Kingdom is taking a leading part in the International Geophysical
Year (IGY), which started on 1st July, 1957, and is to continue until the e
1958. During this period, scientists of some 60 nations will take part in an 1
nationally planned and co-ordinated attempt to extend and intensify observation
of the physical phenomena of the Earth.
422 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A number of important posts connected with this project, including that of
president of the special committee controlling all IGY operations, are held by
United Kingdom scientists.
The Royal Society of London (see p. 407) is planning a co-ordinated research
effort by Government Departments, universities and other institutions. It is obtain¬
ing Government grants, expected to total about £650,000, to cover costs of addi¬
tional expenditure on IGY. Nearly half the United Kingdom contribution will be
spent on the IGY Antarctic Expedition, and other work will include studies of
the upper atmosphere from stations in the United Kingdom and its dependent
territories. A Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, financed partly by the
various Commonwealth Governments and partly privately, was planned indepen¬
dently of the IGY but coincides with it and is contributing to it. British-built
instruments will be used all over the world during the IGY; and in Britain itself, the
Jodrell Bank radio telescope (see p. 409 and photograph facing p. 406) among
many other instruments will be used to provide data.
Expenditure on Research and Development
According to estimates based on the preliminary results of a survey conducted
by DSIR, Britain spent about £325 million on research and development in the
financial year April 1955 to March 1956 (though this figure is subject to a margin
of error, possibly as high as £80 million). Of the total expenditure, £185 million
was spent by private industry, over three-quarters of it by aircraft, electrical
engineering and chemical firms.
The detailed estimates, liable to be revised when the Survey is completed, are:

Some 130,000 people are engaged in research and development in United King¬
dom industry (equivalent to 106,000 full-time workers or 1 per cent of the total
employees). Of these, 30,000 hold a degree, or equivalent qualification, in science
or engineering. Only 100,000 of them spend all their time on research and develop¬
ment ; the rest combine this with other kinds of work. Aircraft firms lead in the
proportion of manpower employed on research or development (12 per cent),
followed by mineral oil refining (6 per cent), electrical engineering (4 per cent),
and the chemical and allied industries (3 per cent).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
The preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage and the promotion of literature
and the arts are the active concern of a number of official and unofficial bodies.
There is no Ministry of Fine Arts of equivalent organization to formulate or
administer policy in the arts, though bodies such as the Standing Commission on
Museums and Galleries (appointed 1931) and the Royal Fine Art Commission
(appointed 1924) act in an advisory capacity. Government interest in the arts is
expressed mainly through the provision of grants to such bodies as the Arts Council,
the British Council (see p. 378), the British Film Institute (see p. 433), and the
Council of Industrial Design (see p. 427), and also to the national museums and
art galleries. In addition, under the Local Government Act, 1948, local authorities
may use part of the revenue from the rates for the encouragement of the arts. Local
education authorities also make grants to some schools of art, music and drama.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter in 1946.
It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Its main duties are to increase the accessibility of the fine arts to
the public, to improve the standard of execution in the fine arts, and to advise and
to co-operate with Government Departments, local authorities and other organiza¬
tions on any matter connected directly or indirectly with these objects. The corre¬
sponding body in Northern Ireland is CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of
Music and the Arts).
Unofficial institutions concerned with the promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, e.g., the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and
the Pilgrim Trust, and a large number of societies, associations and other organiza¬
tions concerned with separate aspects of the arts, some of which are mentioned
later in this chapter.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913, by the late Andrew
Carnegie. It was incorporated under Royal Charter in 1917. The Trust, which was
initially founded for ‘ the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the people
of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 25 life trustees, 6 trustees nominated by
the Corporation of Dunfermline and 3 trustees nominated by the Fife County
Council. Its cultural policies include the support of adult amateur activities in
music, drama and the visual arts. It also supports non-national museums. Grants
totalling approximately £19,853 were made for these purposes during the year
ended 31st December, 1956.
The Pilgrim Trust was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen Harkness, an
American citizen. The Trust, which has an income of about £150,000 a year, is
administered by a body of trustees who are empowered to make grants towards
any legally charitable object within the United Kingdom. In fact, the greater part
of the Trust’s income is at present being used to help to preserve the nation’s
heritage of architecture and history, and for the advancement of learning and the
arts. The grants made for these objects during 1956 amounted to £139,292.
VISUAL ARTS
There are at present a number of British painters and sculptors of international
repute as well as younger artists of great promise; and interest in their work and
that of their contemporaries overseas, as well as in that of British and foreign artists
of the past, is most marked in all sections of the community. This wider interest
in visual art has not stopped at appreciation. There is evidence of this fact in the
large numbers attending evening art classes, the growth of local art groups and
local exhibitions, and the support given to holiday painting schools.
425
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
The fine arts of painting and sculpture in Britain receive State support by grants
to national institutions and, indirectly, through grants made to the Arts Council,
to municipal art galleries and museums, and to local education authorities for art
schools and other means of promoting education in art.
In the year April 1956 to the end of March 1957 the Arts Council arranged 59
separate art exhibitions in Great Britain; 281 showings of these exhibitions were
given in 52 different centres. Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by
the British Council by means of exhibitions, the dissemination of reproductions and
photographs, lectures, and the provision of information and advice to inquirers
abroad and to visitors in Britain. In the year ended March 1957, 27 fine art exhi¬
bitions organized by the Council were shown in 33 countries. The Council was also
responsible for British participation in eight international exhibitions.
Museums and Art Galleries
There are in all about 900 museums and art galleries open to the public in the
United Kingdom, though many are only small collections or merely a few rooms
set aside in a public building for the display of local treasures.
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain between
them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic, archaeological,
scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one city. The British
Museum, which celebrated its bicentenary in 1953, has unparalleled collections of
archaeological and ethnographical material from every part of the world, in addi¬
tion to housing the national library of printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and
periodicals; its Department of Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the
widest extent and richness. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of
fine and applied art of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to
material, though since the war primary collections have been arranged to bring
together, by style, period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National
Gallery presents paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The I ate
Gallery embodies two collections: the British school from the eighteenth century
onwards, with a few earlier works, and modern foreign schools since 1850. Both
sections include modem sculpture. Frequent loan exhibitions are held m t e
Other important collections in London are at the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the London
Museum (reopened in Kensington Palace in 1951), and Hertford House, where
the famous Wallace Collection (furniture, armour, objets d’art and paintings,
mainly French of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) is housed.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration of the Victoria
and Albert Museum and the Science Museum.1 The other national institutions
have their own Boards of Trustees, but all receive Treasury grants.
There are five national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland the Royal
Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, and the Scottish
United Services Museum; and in Cardiff is the National Museum of Wales with
its branch at St. Fagans Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed. A
Northern Irish Folk Museum is proposed for Belfast. The Belfast Museum and
Art Gallery is municipally owned, but serves unofficially as a national institution
for the whole of Northern Ireland.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology an
natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local

learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some rich collector
in the past has bequeathed his treasures. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in
museums—the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, is the oldest in the
country and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a
notable collection of engravings, manuscripts and books bequeathed by its founder
on his death in 1861. Other universities have important collections, primarily for
teaching purposes but also open to the public. Other cities with important museums
and art galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool
(where part of the museum building destroyed in the war is now being rebuilt), j
Manchester, Norwich, Southampton, and York where the Castle Museum, with
its complete reconstruction of an eighteenth-century street of shops, offers a most 1
interesting historical display. In recent years there has been a notable development
of ‘period-house museums’, in which outstanding examples of the private resi¬
dences of former times have been taken over by national and municipal authorities
for this purpose, as at Temple Newsam, Leeds; Aston Hall, Birmingham; and the
Royal Pavilion, Brighton.
Temporary exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions
Bureau, and the Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, are
a regular feature of many museums.
The Museums Association, founded in 1889, is an independent organization to
which museums and art galleries and members of their staffs throughout the
country belong; there are also many overseas members. The Association serves as
the central body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters
relating to museum administration and practice, and as a training and examining
body for professional qualifications. It also produces directories, a monthly journal,
and other publications.
Financial assistance for improving the displays of the smaller museums is among
the functions of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has done much to
encourage the growth of the museum movement during the past thirty years, and
at present expends an average of £10,000 a year in this field.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy, which,
in summer, holds exhibitions of works by members and non-members and, in
winter, exhibitions usually devoted to national schools of painting; the Institute
of Contemporary Arts; the Royal Society of British Artists; the Royal Institute of
Oil Painters; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; the Royal Society of
Portrait Painters; and the London Group. Some of these societies, notably the
Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in London. There
are also an increasing number of amateur art societies throughout the United
Kingdom which hold local exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts
in a variety of ways. The Contemporary Art Society uses its members’ subscriptions
to buy modern works which it presents to the public galleries.
Exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the
year in the galleries of the art dealers of Bond Street and other parts of the West
End of London. The Whitechapel Art Gallery shows a series of exhibitions in the
East End of London; and the London County Council has shown an exhibition
of sculpture in one of its parks every third year since the second world war.
Art Education
There are 15 colleges of art in the United Kingdom, each serving a region, all
of which offer courses in most branches of art and a varying range of crafts; and
there are schools of art in nearly all the larger towns. In London the most notable
of these schools and colleges are the Royal College of Art (a national college) and
427
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
the Central School of Arts and Crafts of the London County Council, in both of
which the emphasis is on industrial design, and the Slade School of Fine Arts in
the University of London. At the Royal Academy Schools, founded in 1768, all
instruction is provided free by Royal Academicians.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history of art
are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg
Institute (also a part of London University) which provides facilities for research
on the character and history of the classical tradition.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school and the Society for
Education through Art encourages the purchase by schools of original works of
art.
Industrial Design
The Council of Industrial Design was set up in 1944 by the President of the
Board of Trade as a grant-aided body with the purpose of promoting the improve¬
ment of design in the products of British industry. The Council has 24 members,
a majority being prominent industrialists, and there is a separate Scottish Committee.
The Council runs a permanent exhibition, at the Design Centre, in the Hay-
market, London. This is a selective, changing display of well-designed British
consumer goods in current production. To supplement this display, an illustrated
record of good design, known as Design Review, is also maintained at the Centre.
In addition, the Council organizes conferences and courses, maintains a record of
designers, and a photographic and reference library on industrial design. It has an
education section and a retail section and publishes a monthly magazine, Design.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of Arts
(see p. 407), the Society of Industrial Artists, which is the representative pro¬
fessional body in Great Britain of designers engaged in industry and commerce,
and the Design and Industries Association (founded in 1914). The DIA is a volun¬
tary association of industrial companies, designers, and other bodies and individuals
interested in the promotion of good design in industry.
Architecture
The Government’s responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is exercised
on the one hand in encouraging the best and seeking to prevent the worst in new
building and, on the other, in preserving the best that has been inherited from the
Past- . .
The Government Departments chiefly concerned with domestic architecture are
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Department of Health or
Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Government,
which are responsible in their respective countries for approving the layout and
design of local authority housing schemes, and which issue reports and circu ars
setting standards for local authority housing. The Ministry of Housing and Local
Government also encourages high standards by offering, each year, medals for t e
best-designed houses. The Education Departments are responsible for the super¬
vision of building for the public education service. The Ministry of Works is the
Department concerned with the construction and maintenance of Government
buildings and also with the preservation of historic buildings and ancient monu¬
ments in Great Britain (see p. 397)- In Northern Ireland, responsibility for the
preservation of ancient buildings is vested in the Ministry of Finance. All these
departments have architects on their staffs.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
428
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions exist to
further the interests of architecture and the preservation of buildings of aesthetic
value or historic interest.
Several State-sponsored organizations are concerned with special aspects of
architecture. The Royal Fine Art Commission and the Royal Fine Art Commission
for Scotland, both bodies of experts appointed by Royal Warrant, advise Govern¬
ment Departments and other public and quasi-public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance. The National Buildings Record maintains a library
(open to the public for consultation) of photographs of English and Welsh archi¬
tecture and an index of architectural records in public and private possession. The
Royal Commissions on Ancient and Historical Monuments for England, for Wales
and Monmouthshire, and for Scotland, record in detail all ancient and historical
remains in their countries and publish a series of surveys, designed ultimately to
cover the whole of Great Britain. The Ancient Monuments Boards for England,
Scotland, and Wales, set up under the Ancient Monuments Acts, consider which
monuments should be listed in accordance with those Acts and advise the Minister
of Works on any questions concerning ancient monuments. The Historic Buildings
Councils for England, Scotland, and Wales, which were constituted under the
Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, advise the Minister on the
provision of grants towards the repair and maintenance of such buildings and their
contents (see p. 397)- An Historic Buildings Bureau finds new uses for unoccupied
historic buildings of outstanding interest.
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom is the
Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) which holds meetings at which papers
are read and discussed, publishes a Journal and holds exhibitions, promotes and
controls the training of architects through its Board of Architectural Education,
and has one of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world,
housing over 65,000 books, periodicals and drawings. There are also the Incor¬
porated Association of Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered
Architects and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. Other societies
include the Architectural Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of
societies interested in particular aspects of architecture, such as the Modular
Society.
Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group, which is a society
designed to awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save Georgian buildings
from destruction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the National
Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scot¬
land (see p. 398), which together own more than a hundred houses of historic or
architectural interest, many of which contain pictures and other works of art which
are on view to the public; and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, formed
in 1952, under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Canterbury. This Trust
aims to raise £4 million to supplement the efforts of parishes to put their churches
into good repair, and in four years had made grants to 669 churches and chapels.
Education in architecture is given at 19 schools of architecture recognized for
exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and Final Examinations and 6 schools of
architecture recognized for exemption from the Intermediate Examination only.
There are also 47 schools of art and technical institutions (10 full-time) with facili¬
ties for the instruction of intending architects, which prepare students for taking
externally the examinations of the RIBA. It is against the law for any person
to practise or carry out work under any name, style or title containing the
word ‘architect’ unless he or she is registered. The statutory body which
regulates registration is the Architects’ Registration Council of the United Kingdom.

RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
LITERATURE
A knowledge of literature is fostered in the United Kingdom by the schools,
colleges and universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taught
either as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject is
thereafter maintained by the libraries, by the very large number of private literary
societies (both national and local), by book reviews in the press, and on the radio,
and by the numerous periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature, ot
which the best-known critical weekly is the Times Literary Supplement. State
support for literature is given through the Arts Council, which assists poetry—
especially poetry readings—in Great Britain, and through the British Council,
which is active in encouraging a knowledge of English literature abroad. Recogni¬
tion of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary prizes, a number
of which are awarded annually, e.g., the two James Tait Black Memorial prizes
for biography and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young
writers of promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Library
Association Carnegie Medal for an outstanding book for children, and the Somerset
Maugham award for young writers.
Libraries
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (more
than 6 million printed books). The National Library of Scotland (nearly 2 mi ion
volumes) is in Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (more than 1 million
volumes). Together with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (over 2 million volumes)
and the Cambridge University Library (over 2 million volumes) these comprise the
‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive a copy of each new
book published in Britain: the British Museum Library must receive a copy, the
other libraries may claim one. , . .
Other great libraries are1: the London Library (the largest public subscription
library, 600,000 volumes); the University of London Central Library (650,000) ;
Edinburgh University Library (640,000); Glasgow University Library (440 000);
St. Andrews University Library (532,000); the John Rylands Library, Manchester
(500,000); the Science Museum Library (400,000); the Patent Office Library
(365,000); the Victoria and Albert Museum Art Library (300,000) ; the National
Library for the Blind (325,000 Braille and Moon types); the British Library of
Political and Economic Science (361,000); the British Museum (Natural History)
Library (200,000); the India Office Library (280,000); Queen’s University Library,
Belfast (200,000); the Royal Institute of International Affairs Library (94,ooo)>
the Royal Geographical Society Library (100,000); the Imperial Institute Library
(150000 items); the Public Record Office Library (which contains the National
Archives and the National Register of Archives, a register and summary of some
8,000 local and private collections of records); the Royal College of Music Libr y
(160,000); the British Drama League Library (100,000); the Library of the Ro>d
Institute of British Architects (65,000); the Royal Academy of Music Libr ry
(60,000); and the Central Music Library (60,000). The Arts Councd has founded
a reference library of modem English poetry, which is housed with the Natio
Book League.

BRITAIN*. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
An important feature of library services in Britain is the co-operation within
the closely knit network of libraries which greatly increases the value of the service.
Library co-operation is organized regionally in the first instance, through Regional
Library Bureaux, and is finally centralized in the National Central Library with
its widespread system of outlier libraries (public, university and special) giving
access to a total stock of 21 million books.
The public libraries of Britain maintain a service throughout the country,
administered by 573 public library authorities (county councils, county borough
councils, municipal borough councils and urban district councils). Together these
authorities provide more than 32,000 service points; they hold over 63 million
books and make more than 398 million loans a year. A feature of the service in
rural areas is the travelling van, which is an itinerant library.
In addition to lending books, music scores and gramophone records, and pro¬
viding special libraries for children, public libraries engage in many kinds of exten¬
sion activities, such as play readings, lectures, film shows, music circles and
co-operation in University Extension adult education.
The two principal organizations to which librarians belong are the Library
Association and the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
(ASLIB). The Library Association, with a membership of about 12,500, attempts
to unite librarians and governors of libraries throughout the world and, through
its many meetings, conferences, personal service and publications, including its
official journal The Library Association Record, to provide for their general and
specialized professional interests.
ASLIB, which is a documentation centre and is financed by the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research, operates in a more specialized field. One of its
activities, for example, is the maintenance of an index of translations, especially
from Russian and German, which have been or are being made in Britain.
Books
The output of new books in Britain amounts to over 13,000 new titles a year—in
1956, for example, British publishers issued a total of 19,107 separate titles, of
which only 5,302 were reprints or new editions. In that year, the annual figures for
new titles under literary subject headings were: bibliography and literary history,
220; biography, 441; essays, 129; fiction, 2,121; poetry and drama, 454.
Some classes of books are produced as Government publications by Her Majesty’s
Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organization in Britain; the great
majority of books, however, are produced by commercial publishers, including the
university presses, notably the Cambridge University Press and the Clarendon
Press (Oxford) which publish many outstanding learned works. The Clarendon
Press is part of the Oxford University Press, which also has a publishing depart¬
ment in London.
Leading organizations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production are the Publishers’ Association, the Booksellers’ Association, and the
Society of Authors.
Literary and Philological Societies and Institutions
Societies and institutions concerned with the promotion of literature in its various
forms include: the National Book League (12,500 members), which encourages the
reading of and an interest in books, and which holds exhibitions, including the
widely popular annual exhibitions of book design; the English Association (3,000
members), which aims at upholding the standard of English writing and speech;
43i
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
and the Royal Society of Literature (250 members and 250 Fellows), which is con¬
cerned with the advancement of literature. Both the Royal Society of Edinburgh
(790 Fellows), which promotes science and literature, and the British Academy,
which is an organization concerned with humanistic studies and has a section
dealing with literature and philology, receive grants from the Treasury.
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society (about 3,5°° adult and
800 junior members); by the annual National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held
in Wales, the origins of which date back to the seventh century; and by the Apollo
Society which, supported by the Arts Council, presents a number of poetry read¬
ings in which music as well as poetry forms part of the programme.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the Biblio¬
graphical Society, the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens Fellowship (about
10,000 members). . . -
There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book Society (10,000
members), which exist to distribute selected new books to their members. The
most recently established is the Poetry Book Society (780 members), which was
set up in 1954 under the auspices of the Arts Council.
drama
State patronage of the drama is expressed through the Arts Council, which
grants subsidies to certain theatrical managements operating on a non-profit-
making basis (i.e. using profits to finance future productions), provided that such
managements have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high
standards of practical competence; and through the British Council, which is
responsible for making the British theatre better known abroad by organizing and
sponsoring international tours by important companies, including the Old \ ic
Theatre Company and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company, and by send¬
ing overseas exhibitions of theatrical design and lecturers on drama. The Treasury
is empowered, under the National Theatre Act, i949, to support the scheme for
a national theatre by contributing £1 million to the cost of building and equipping
a theatre, in London, which would operate under public auspices.
Professional Theatre
The centre of the professional theatre is in London, where there are some 45
principal theatres and a number of suburban and Tittle’ theatres. These are let to
producing managements on a commercial basis for every type of theatrical enter¬
tainment. There are also theatres in Scotland, Northern Ireland and in the pro¬
vinces of England and Wales, which are served by productions touring either before
or after London presentation, by companies specially formed tor touring, and by
local repertory companies. ^
In addition to managements which rent theatres for limited or long runs, there
are a few companies which produce plays in theatres of their own. Among the
older and better known of these organizations are the Old Vic Theatre Company in
London and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company at Stratford-upon-
Avon, both of which are permanent companies. During 1956 there came into
existence the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre m Sloane
Square, London, which presents a series of contemporary plays. Local repertory
companies (some of which are assisted financially and otherwise by the Arts
Council or, in Northern Ireland, by CEMA) may have the use of their own estab¬
lished repertory theatres, e.g., the Bristol Old Vic Company at the historic Theatre
Royal in Bristol, or they may tour the various towns and villages in the locality,
432
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
playing from one to several nights in each place and using any building which can
be made suitable for the purpose. The English Children’s Theatre, a non-profit-
making organization, presents children’s plays in London and the provinces. The
Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park, London, has been used for many summer seasons
of repertory, mainly of Shakespeare and other poetic drama. The Ulster Group
Theatre in Belfast specializes in Irish drama. Inevitably, the work of repertory
companies varies in quality but, generally speaking, the standard of both produc¬
tion and acting is high; many of the leading dramatists, producers and actors in
the United Kingdom started their careers in repertory.
Theatre clubs for regular patrons are run in connection with some of these
company-owned theatres. In a few which sell seats only to club members, the
plays are not subject to the normal requirement that they must be passed by the
Lord Chamberlain1 before presentation.
The Theatres Act, 1843, which deals with the licensing of theatres and plays,
requires all new plays to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain, who may forbid
the presentation of any play ‘ for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or of
the public peace ’. The number of plays for which a licence is refused amounts to
little over one per cent.
Both in London and in the provinces, most managers and artists are members of
one or another of the professional organizations which exist to maintain the stan¬
dards of the professional theatre, to regulate the industry and to promote and safe¬
guard the welfare of those who work in it. Organizations of this kind include the
London Theatre Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West
End Managers, the Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory
Theatres, British Actors’ Equity (the actors’ trade union), and the League of
Dramatists. The trade union of theatre staffs is the National Association of
Theatrical and Kine Employees.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the history
and technique of the British theatre.
Amateur Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout the United Kingdom;
there are thousands of amateur dramatic societies. The movement is sponsored and
fostered by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special
organizations—the British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama
Associations, the Scottish Community Drama Association, and the Ulster Drama
League.
The British Drama League, which was founded in 1919, operates on a basis of
affiliation and individual membership. Its many services to its members include
the arrangement of courses, lectures and competitions in dramatic work; the pro¬
vision of an information bureau; and advice on many matters connected with the
stage, e.g., play-writing, production, stage management and the organization of
drama festivals. The work of the Standing Conference is mainly that of co-ordina¬
tion between the various bodies concerned in the amateur dramatic movement;
while the Scottish Community Drama Association fulfils, in Scotland, the functions
of both the League and the Conference and is supported by the Scottish Education
Department.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have famous dramatic societies, and
there are drama clubs and societies in many other universities and colleges.
1 The Lord Chamberlain, whose office dates from the fourteenth century, is the senior
officer of the Royal Household. His functions include the licensing of theatres in London
and certain towns, and the licensing of plays for public performance.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
433
Dramatic Training
Dramatic training is provided mainly in the large number of dramatic schools
and institutions of all kinds which have been established throughout the United
Kingdom. Among the most important of such institutions are the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art (which was founded in 1904 and is now grant-aided, and which
provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Central School of
Speech Training and Dramatic Art, the Rose Braford School, the London Academy
of Music and Dramatic Art, the Royal Ballet School (the former Sadler’s Wells
School) which provides a general education and training for the ballet, the Royal
Academy of Dancing, all of which are in or near London; and there are also the Old
Vic School in Bristol and the Northern Theatre School in Bradford.
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many of the schools and
youth clubs of Britain, and a varying degree of recognition is given to the subject
in the universities. Bristol University leads in this direction in that it has created a
Department of Drama offering a course which an Arts student may take as part of
his or her general degree.
FILMS
The British public, with an annual average of 22 attendances a head, possibly
visits the cinema more frequently than any other people in the world. Although
cinema attendance has been declining in recent years and 185 cinemas in Great
Britain closed in 1956, there are in 1957 over 4>300 cinemas in Great Britain with
a total of over 4 million seats, and another 150 cinemas in Northern Ireland.
The first cinematograph exhibition in Britain was given in 1896 and within ten
years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early ascendancy did not
survive the impact of the first world war and since 1914 British films have had to
contend with keen American competition. Legislation, first introduced in 1927 and
continued by the Cinematograph Films Acts of 1938 and 1948, has given some
assistance by means of the quota system, under which a certain proportion of
British films must be shown in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed
annually by Board of Trade Order, after consultation with the Cinematograph
Films Council, and is subject to confirmation by Parliament. For first feature films
it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950. The Cinematograph Films Act, 1957, renews
the quota provisions for a further ten years. .
During the second world war the British cinema re-emerged with new vitality
and began again to exert an important influence on film development by the pro¬
duction of many notable feature films depicting Britain’s ordeals and achievements
in the war. These films were based on the documentary technique which had been
developed since 1929 for the making of factual informative films sponsored by the
Government or by commercial organizations. British feature films in the post-war
years have been influenced by this trend, and realistic treatment is now a charac¬
teristic of British feature production, both in dramatic films and in the light-hearted
satirical comedies that have won acclaim in recent years.
The development of the film as an art is promoted bf the British film Institute,
founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant and is respon¬
sible to the Privy Council. The Institute encourages the making and showing of
good films and helps the public to appreciate good films. It administers the Nationa
Film Theatre in London and the National Film Archive, and maintains a library
of books on the film and an Information Service. The Institute also administers
grants for the encouragement of film appreciation and for the production of
experimental films.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The National Film Archive contains over 7,000 films, besides scripts, art
designs, posters and 120,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history
and the art of the film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or
technical interest; it holds a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes
which are unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality
of the films shown. Its new building, erected in 1957, will be the first permanent
national film theatre in the world.
The British Film Academy, founded in 1947, is a private organization, repre¬
sentative of senior film-makers, which exists to foster the making of creative films.
It provides a meeting ground for artists and technicians and gives annual awards
for films, for technical achievements and for film acting.
Financial Aid for Film Production
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and well-being, and needs adequate finan¬
cial backing combined with freedom for the film maker to experiment and to express
his own ideas. There is no State-owned film production unit in Britain, but the
National Film Finance Corporation, a statutory body set up in 1949, is empowered
to lend money for film production. Its members—a chairman, a managing director,
and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of Trade. Its funds (limited
by statute to £8 million) are provided, up to £6 million, by advances from the
Board of Trade; the remaining £2 million may be borrowed from non-Governmental
sources. The Corporation is financially concerned with about half the films being
made in British studios.
There is a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund. This levy
is quite separate from the Entertainments Duty which is a tax charged on
cinema admissions. The money raised by the levy is paid out as a percentage of
a film’s takings, so that the more successful a film is at the box office, the more it
receives from the fund. The fund was started in September 1950 on a non-statutory
basis as the British Film Production Fund, known as the Eady Fund. It was based
on a renewable agreement between the various trade associations, subject to Board
of Trade approval. When this agreement lapsed in October 1957, the voluntary
scheme was replaced by a statutory scheme with the same purpose. The Cinema¬
tograph Films Act, I957> gives the President of the Board of Trade powers to make
regulations governing the collection, by the Customs and Excise Department, of a
levy from exhibitors, and the distribution of the proceeds for the benefit of British
film production. A new body, the British Film Fund Agency, will undertake the
distribution.
Some 40 per cent of British first feature films are produced by the two large
amalgams, the Rank Organisation and the Associated British Picture Corporation,
which have companies for production, distribution and exhibition. There are
numerous companies (many of them only small) which produce short films.
Cinema Licensing and Film Censorship
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but, by virtue of
their power to grant licences, the local licensing authorities act as the final arbiters
and censors of films proposed for showing in their areas. There are over 700
licensing authorities; they are local authorities or, in some areas, magistrates. The
Cinematograph Act of 1909 required, for reasons of safety, that inflammable films
should be shown only on premises licensed for the purpose; it was subsequently
established that licensing authorities had the right to supervise the character of the
435
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
films exhibited. In judging the suitability of films for public showing, licensing
authorities rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of
Film Censors, to which are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended
for public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of the
cinema industry, which wished to ensure that a proper standard was maintained
in the films offered to the public. It consists of a president, a secretary, and seven
examiners. Members, who include three women, are appointed by the president
as representative of the general public unconnected with the industry. The presi¬
dent is elected by a trade committee and is usually a man prominent in public life.
The Board, which does not use any written code of censorship, may require cuts
to be made before it will grant a certificate to a film; more rarely, it will refuse a
certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed in one of three categories: ‘ U ’
(suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more suitable for adults than children) and
‘X’ (suitable only for adults). A child or young person under 16 years of age may
be admitted to a cinema showing an ‘A’ film only if accompanied by a responsible
adult, and may not be admitted on any condition if an ‘X’ film is being shown.
Children and the Cinema
The Cinematograph Act, 1952, which came into force in January 1956, extended
the scope of the 1909 Act and provided for the making of regulations by the Secre¬
tary of State for Home Affairs to protect the health and welfare of children in rela¬
tion to their attendance at film shows. Cinemas which give children’s shows require
a special licence from the licensing authority and the authority is able to impose
special conditions on such cinemas.
Children’s cinema clubs, providing special children’s programmes on Saturday
mornings, are widely organized by the cinema groups and have become very popu¬
lar. An important contribution to these programmes is made by the Childrens
Film Foundation which produces and distributes entertainment films specially
designed for children. The Foundation is a non-profit-making body set up by the
British film industry in 1951.
MUSIC, OPERA AND BALLET
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and orchestral
concerts, choral singing, music festivals, opera and ballet are important features of
British cultural life. . , , „
The British Council has done much to make British music and ballet companies
more widely known throughout the world. Tours of British orchestras, so oists an
opera and ballet companies are arranged, recordings of works by British composers
are sponsored, and libraries of British music (recorded and in printed score) are
maintained in 57 countries overseas. At the Council’s headquarters in London, a
central music reference library of music literature, scores an recor e music is
maintained for the use of visitors. Distinguished musicians from overseas are
invited to Britain as guests of the Council to gain some first-hand experience of
British music and musicians, and extensive arrangements are made to cover each
individual interest.
Music
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in all the large towns and
cities of Britain, some of which have well-known concert halls. In London, the
principal concert halls are the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank of the Thames
which was opened in I95i in connection with the Festival of Britain; the Royal
Albert Hall, Kensington; and Wigmore Hall, which is the premier recital centre.
436
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Symphony Orchestra, the
BBC Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic,
the Philharmonia, the Halle (Manchester), the Liverpool Philharmonic, the City
of Birmingham Orchestra, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish
National Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Orchestra. There are also the specialized
string and chamber orchestras such as the Boyd Neel Orchestra, the Jacques
Orchestra and the London Mozart Players; and a number of new orchestras which
have been formed during the past few years. Many of these orchestras receive
financial aid from the Arts Council, to help with the cost of maintaining ensembles, of
presenting new or unfamiliar works, and of improving standards generally. The City
of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by the Belfast Corporation and CEMA.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC Choral,
the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the
London Philharmonic Choir, and the Bach Choir. These and many other choral
societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works; most of
them, together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies and music
clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies, through which
they are supported with funds provided by the Arts Council.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in existence
for over 200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably in recent years, and
festivals of music and other arts are now held annually in many cities and towns
throughout the United Kingdom. They range from the famous Edinburgh Inter¬
national Festival of Music and Drama, which lasts three weeks and attracts many
thousands of visitors, to those, such as the Aldeburgh Festival, lasting a week or
less. Among the better known are the Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the
National Eisteddfod of Wales; the National Gaelic Mod held at a different place
in Scotland each year; the Cheltenham Festival, devoted to contemporary British
music; the York Mystery Plays and Festival; and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals
of choral music, which are held on a triennial basis. An annual international festival
of folk song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is increasing. It is encouraged by the work of
County Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference of Music Committees. The Rural
Music Schools Association is concerned with music-making by amateurs in country
districts; it brings together professional musicians, teachers, administrators and
amateurs.
Professional organizations, which look after the interests of music and musicians,
include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Com¬
posers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Specialized education in music is given at Colleges of Music, of which the most
prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in
London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish Academy in
Glasgow, all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are also the Trinity College of
Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Youth orchestras
are strongly encouraged, and children’s concerts, given by symphony orchestras
directed by prominent conductors, are a regular feature of the country’s musical
activities and have helped to develop among the youth of the community an appre¬
ciation of the world’s greatest music. The National Youth Orchestra, made up of
1 Some of these are voluntary committees and some are local education authority
sub-committees.

RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
the most promising members of school orchestras, is noted for its high standard of
performance.
Opera and Ballet
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, which is leased by the Government1 to the Covent Garden Opera Trust,
which was formed in 1944 to make the famous opera house the home of a national
opera and ballet, and which receives a Government grant through the Arts Council.
The Royal Opera House has its own resident opera company and ballet company
which give performances both in London and elsewhere. The opera company,
which numbers about 200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes an annual tour
of provincial centres. The ballet company, which in January 1957 was incorporated
with the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School to form the
Royal Ballet, has a high international reputation gained as the Sadler’s Wells Ballet
during its visits in recent years to Canada and the United States and its
European tours, arranged by the British Council.
Seasons of opera and ballet are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in
London; and at Glyndebourne in Sussex, an opera season, for which a company
is specially assembled, is held every year. Other opera companies include the Carl
Rosa, one of the oldest opera organizations in Britain; the English Opera Group,
formed in 1947, and noted for its performances of chamber operas by Benjamin
Britten; and Intimate Opera, which performs eighteenth and twentieth century
works for two or three characters in any hall available. The Arts Council manages
a small operatic group (Opera for All) which specializes in introducing opera to
audiences who hitherto have been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of
amateur opera clubs both in London and in the provinces, including the City Opera
Club (of London) and the Welsh National Opera Company, which is an amateur
society reinforced with professional soloists. Among the ballet companies are the
Ballet Rambert, Britain’s oldest ballet company, which has discovered many dis¬
tinguished dancers and choreographers, and the Festival Ballet.
The Royal (formerly Sadler’s Wells), the Arts Educational, and the Rambert
Ballet Training Schools are among several schools which have played an important
part in raising British ballet to its present high standard.
1 The Ministry of Works acquired a 42-year lease from Covent Garden Properties
Limited in 1949.
XIII. SOUND AND
TELEVISION BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
under powers conferred on the Postmaster-General by the Wireless Telegraphy
Acts, 1949-1955, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio communications,
except under licence. Users of sound and television receiving sets must obtain an
annual licence, which can be purchased from most post offices.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was created as a public corporation by Royal Charter
in 1927. Television services are provided by both the British Broadcasting Cor¬
poration and the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which was established
by the Television Act, 1954. Receiving licences are valid for the services of both
the BBC and the ITA.
The number of receiving licences current in the United Kingdom at the end of
July 1957 was 14,644,613, of which 7,055,702 were for sound broadcasting only,
and 7,269,748 for sound and television combined. The former costs £1 annually,
the latter £4, of which £1 is excise duty. One licence covers all receiving sets in a
household, but a separate licence (319,163 at end-July 1957) is required for sets
fitted in cars.
Broadcasting Authorities
When sound broadcasting began in the United Kingdom, it was decided in
Parliament that the Postmaster-General should grant only one licence for that
purpose at any one time; and the first licence (issued in 1922) was granted exclu¬
sively to a limited company (the British Broadcasting Company). The decision
to grant only one licence for broadcasting was maintained when the British Broad¬
casting Corporation (BBC) was formed to take over the functions of the limited
company; it was reaffirmed when, in 1937, the BBC’s second Charter was granted,
which covered the sound services and the first high definition public television
service in the world, inaugurated by the BBC in 1936; and it was upheld throughout
the second world war and during the post-war period until 1952.
During the war, public service television broadcasting was suspended, and trans¬
missions were not resumed until 1946. After resumption, however, they gained
rapidly both in technical efficiency and in popularity; and between 1949 and 1952
(when the BBC’s Charter was again due to be renewed) the Government instituted
a major review of sound and television broadcasting which aroused great interest
in Parliament, in the Press and among the ordinary public. After prolonged parlia¬
mentary and general discussion (during the course of which the first non-exclusive
broadcasting licence was granted to the BBC) it was decided by the Government that
the potential power of television was so great that it would be undesirable to leave
transmission services in this medium in the hands of a single authority, however
excellent. The Independent Television Authority was therefore established to pro¬
vide services additional to those of the BBC for an initial period of ten years; and
438
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
439
independent television transmissions began in 1955—the BBC’s monopoly in the
provision of sound broadcasting services remaining undisturbed.
Both the BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in so far as daily admini¬
stration and presentation of programmes are concerned. The Government, how¬
ever, retains ultimate control of the BBC; while the Postmaster-General, as the
responsible minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy.
The Postmaster-General may also issue directions to the Corporation on a number
of subjects, and may prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter. The
Government has similar powers of control over the activities of the ITA. Both
the BBC and the ITA are required to publish annual Reports and Accounts, which
are presented by the Postmaster-General to Parliament.
The BBC and the ITA both consult with the Postmaster-General as to the hours
of broadcasting. Television broadcasting is limited to 50 hours a week and eight
hours in any one day, with extensions for certain stated purposes, such as religious
broadcasts, outside broadcasts and Welsh language broadcasts. The authorities
may broadcast television programmes, within the prescribed maxima, during any
periods best suited to the needs of their audiences. ’I he BBC broadcasts in all four
of its sound services within an overall band of some 17^ hours out of the 24.
Organization and Finance
The BBC operates under the provisions of two documents, each granted for
limited periods at the end of which they may be renewed or amended: the Charter,
which prescribes the constitution, internal organization and objects of the Corpora¬
tion and contains certain financial provisions; and the Licence and Agreement
between the Corporation and the Postmaster-General, which deals mainly with
technical matters and details of finance, but also contains some important constitu¬
tional conditions. The operations of the ITA are governed by the provisions of the
Television Act, 1954, which formulate its constitution, its functions, its purpose
and the framework of its finances; and by the Licence (which contains technical
provisions) issued to it by the Postmaster-General in 1955 > f°r an ten-year
period.
The British Broadcasting Corporation
Under the current charter (which came into force in I952 an<^ expires in 1962)
the Corporation consists of nine governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman
and national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) each appointe
for a period of not more than five years on a part-time basis by the Sovereign in
Council. As a corporate body, the governors are responsible for the conduct of the
whole broadcasting operation, including the content and presentation of the P^°-
grammes in sound and television, and the provision and working of the insta a
tions and equipment necessary for originating and transmitting signals for general
reception in the form of sound or pictures or both. . .
In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Corporation ensures that its services
are used, in the words of the Charter, ‘as a means of disseminating information,
education and entertainment ’; it must pay heed to the requirements of the Licence
(e.g., it must allow the broadcasting of any announcement at the request ot a
Government Department, and it must strictly exclude commercial advertisements
in any form from its programmes); and it must refrain from formulating or a ow¬
ing the expression of editorial opinion, since to express such opinion would be to
depart from the rule of impartiality which the BBC is expected to observe in
current affairs and matters of public issue.
2F
440
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of councils,
established in accordance with the terms of the the Charter, e.g., the General
Advisory Council, which has been in existence, except for a break during the war
years, since 1934; the National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales,
which, under the chairmanship of the national governors for Scotland and Wales,
are responsible for the domestic sound services in those countries; and the Regional
Advisory Councils for the English regions and for Northern Ireland. There are
also a number of other councils and committees not specifically required by the
Charter, which have been established by the BBC to advise on particular matters,
e.g., religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting, music and agriculture.
The chief executive officer of the BBC is the Director-General, who is appointed
by the governors at their discretion and with whom they discuss all major matters
of policy and finance. Under the Director-General are six directors (the Chief
Assistant to the Director-General and the Directors of Sound Broadcasting, Tele¬
vision Broadcasting, External Broadcasting, Engineering, and Administration) who,
between them, cover the whole work of the Corporation, and who, with the Director-
General, constitute the Board of Management of the BBC. The number of staff
employed at 31st March, 1957, was 14,473 (including 769 part-time personnel).
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual grant from the Exchequer
related to revenue derived from the sale by the Post Office of wireless receiving
licences; (2) an annual grant-in-aid from the Exchequer mainly for the external
and other related services, i.e. the European Services, the Overseas Services, and
the Monitoring Service and (3) profits from BBC publications, chiefly the Radio
Times, which has a weekly sale of over 8 million copies and attracts a large adver¬
tising revenue. The gross revenue from the sale of licences for the year ended
31st March, 1957, amounted to £28,454,492. From this sum (under the terms of
an Agreement drawn up in 1954) the Government retained £2,750,000, and the
Post Office deducted the sum of £1,914, 284, which was equal to the actual expenses
it incurred in relation to broadcasting services, including collecting the licence fees,
investigating complaints of interference, and the cost of administration. The Cor¬
poration therefore received a net income from this source of £23,790,208. Net
revenue from publications amounted to £1,099,000, and grant-in-aid receipts for
the same period were £5,767,000, including £345,000 against capital expenditure.
A new Agreement, dated 1st February, 1957, provides that for the purposes of
home broadcasting (sound and television) the Postmaster-General is to pay to the
Corporation a sum equal to 87! per cent of the net licence revenue (i.e. the gross
licence revenue less normal deductions by the Post Office) for a period of three
years, which began on 1st April, 1957; and during the remainder of the term of
the licence, such sum as the Treasury may authorize. Under this Agreement, as
in previous agreements, additional sums may be paid to the Corporation if, on
application by the BBC to the Postmaster-General, the Treasury is satisfied that
the income of the Corporation is insufficient for the adequate conduct of home
broadcasting during any portion of the term of the Licence.
The Independent Television Authority
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and eight ordinary members (three of whom have special responsibility for Scot¬
land, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland severally) appointed on a
part-time salaried basis by the Postmaster-General from among persons who have
distinguished themselves in various professions and careers. The Authority owns
and operates the transmitting system, but the production studios and equipment
are owned, and the actual programmes are provided by programme companies
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
441
under contract, who pay the Authority for the right to present programmes, which
may include advertisements. The Authority is, however, required, under provi¬
sions of the Television Act, to satisfy itself that the programmes maintain certain
standards—e.g., it must ensure that they do not offend against good taste or decency,
that they are balanced in their subject matter, that they preserve due impartiality
in presenting matters of industrial or political controversy, and that the news is
reported accurately. The Authority therefore has controlling and regulatory powers
of a wide and important character in regard to programmes and advertisements,
as well as the task of choosing the programme contractors and drawing up the
contracts under which they are to operate.
In the discharge of its duties, the Authority is advised by three statutory com¬
mittees: the Advertising Advisory Committee; the Religious Advisory Committee;
and the Children’s Advisory Committee. The Authority has power to appoint
other advisory committees, if and when it considers this to be necessary.
The chief executive officer of the IT A is the Director-General. T here is also a
Deputy Director-General, and a headquarters staff covering all technical, admini¬
strative, clerical, typing and office services, which numbered 60 at 30th April, 1957-
Staff has also been recruited for the transmitting stations and for regional offices in
the midlands and the north, bringing the total number of ITA staff to some 150.
The programme companies under contract with the ITA are: Associated-
Rediffusion Limited; Associated Television Limited; ABC Television Limited,
Granada TV Network Limited; Scottish Television Limited; Television, Wales
and the West, Limited; and a group formed by the Rank Organisation, Associated
Newspapers and the Amalgamated Press. A common news service is provided by
Independent Television News Limited. A Standing Consultative Committee, com¬
posed of two representatives of the ITA and a representative of each of the Pro"
gramme companies, provides consultative machinery between the Authority an
the companies on matters affecting the companies as a whole. There is also a Tele¬
vision Programme Contractors Association, designed to further the collective
interests of the companies with such outside bodies as trade unions and sporting
organizations, and generally to ensure that they speak as far as possible with one
voice on public issues connected with television broadcasting policy.
The finance of the ITA is drawn from payments made to it by the programme
companies which, in the year i955-56, amounted to £423,499- In addition,
advances (limited to £1 million during the first year of the Authority’s existence
and to a total of £2 million in all during the first five years) may be made by the
Postmaster-General with the consent of the Treasury for the purpose of paying
initial expenses and for providing the ITA with working capital. At end-Decem er
1956, only £550,000 had been loaned to the Authority under this head. There is
also provision in the Television Act for an annual Exchequer grant, not exceeding
£750,000, to be made to the Authority, but mainly because of the general eco¬
nomic situation in the United Kingdom, the grant was not forthcoming during the
years i955—56 and 1956-57- An Exchequer grant, amounting to £100,000, ow
ever, is to be made available to the Authority in the year i957“58 f°r the provision
of programmes designed to improve the balance of the material transmitte , it is
possible that it will not be necessary to use this grant.
Sound Broadcasting
The BBC operates four domestic sound broadcasting services from 55 trans¬
mitting stations, and two main groups of external broadcasting services from 39
high power, high frequency transmitters in the United Kingdom and at T ebrau
in Johore. Until recently, the domestic sound services were broadcast solely on
442
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the long and medium wavelengths allocated to the United Kingdom under the
Copenhagen Agreement of 1948, which was implemented in 1950. However,
the growth in the number of European broadcasting stations so increased inter¬
ference on these wavelengths that, in 1955, the BBC began to establish a network
of very high frequency (VHF) transmitters, twelve of which are already in opera¬
tion. Plans for the building of four more such stations, to bring 96 per cent of the
population within range of sound radio without interference, have been approved
by the Postmaster-General. These additional stations will be brought into opera¬
tion during 1958.
There are 145 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 54 are in
London and 91 at various centres in the regional areas. The external services use
25 London studios.
Domestic Services
The domestic sound services, consisting of the Home Service, the Light Pro¬
gramme, the Third Programme, and Network 3, have recently been replanned,
both individually and in relation to each other, to cater for the varying tastes of the
listening public in accordance with the results of a review carried out by the BBC
early in 1957.
The Home Service, which occupies some seventeen hours a day, is designed
for those who wish to listen with serious attention both to entertainment and
to information. It contains a wide range of musical programmes, the principal
news and information broadcasts, important discussions on current affairs,
party political broadcasts, religious broadcasts and schools broadcasting (see
page 372). It is also the vehicle for regional broadcasting, which is the generic
term for services specially compiled for listeners in Scotland, Northern Ire¬
land, Wales, the north of England, the midlands and the west of England. All
these services carry items from the basic Home Service together with pro¬
grammes produced within the region; and the Welsh Service also broadcasts
a daily bi-lingual service.
The Light Programme, which occupies some seventeen hours a day, is intended
for those who wish to enjoy relaxation and distraction in the least demanding
form. Its output includes variety programmes of all kinds, including pro¬
grammes of dance music and light music, in which the main emphasis is
placed on the quality of popular appeal. The Light Programme also contains
some news and information broadcasts.
The Third Programme, which occupies some three hours a day, is the medium
for music, drama, talks and features designed for the intellectual listener of
cultivated tastes and interests. The programme has an international flavour
in that many of the plays presented are translations of European drama or by
American authors, concerts or operas are often relayed direct from foreign
countries, and many of the talks are about foreign political thought and cul¬
tural activities in countries overseas.
In addition to these three services, Network 5—an innovation—occupies some
two hours each evening providing programmes of specialized interest, mainly
programmes of the spoken word.
Each of the domestic sound services has its own characteristics, but the Home
Service and the Light Programme are planned together and are synchronized for
a part of each day, while the Third Programme is co-ordinated with the other two,
so far as is practicable, to ensure the widest possible choice of programmes for
listeners.
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
443
External Services
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link
of culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United King¬
dom and those in all other parts of the world; to present events of world-wide
importance with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British opinion and
the British way of life. They are heard in English and in 43 other languages through¬
out the world for a total, between them, of about 80 hours a day.
Up to September 1957, the services were divided into1:
The European Services, which consist of five regional services conducted
mainly in the languages of the countries to which they are directed, and an
English service directed to the whole of Europe.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe and
comprise the General Overseas Service (started as the Empire Service in 1932)
with its world-wide audience of English-speaking listeners, and a number of
regional services in English and 25 other languages. The General Overseas
Service pays special attention to its audiences in the Commonwealth, to
British Forces and to British communities overseas and gives a complete
programme service of 21 i hours every day (shortly to be increased to 24
hours daily), including news bulletins, talks, music, light entertainment, reli¬
gious services and sport. The regional services include the African, Caribbean,
and Colonial Services; the North American, Pacific and South African Ser¬
vices; the Eastern Service for the Arab countries and for Ceylon, India, Persia,
Israel and Pakistan; the Far Eastern Service; the Latin American Service; and
‘London Calling Asia’, a programme in English for South Asia, South-East
Asia, and the Far East.
The external broadcasting services also include the Transcription Services, which
record some 800 BBC programmes a year and make them available to broadcasting
organizations in all parts of the world; 'English by Radio' lessons, with explana¬
tions in 36 languages, which reach an audience of several millions by direct trans¬
mission from London, by relays and by transcription recordings ; and the Monitor¬
ing Service, which reports foreign broadcasts in more than 40 languages and works
under a reciprocal agreement with its American counterpart as regards momtore
material from the Far East and other areas inaudible in the United Kingdom.
The selection of the countries to which the external broadcasting services are to
be directed, and the time on the air to be allotted to each, rests with the Govern¬
ment Departments concerned with overseas relations, but the content of the broad¬
casts is entirely the responsibility of the BBC. ^ ... ^
The BBC maintains offices for its representatives in Berlin, Beirut, Delhi, New
York, Ottawa, Paris, Singapore and Sydney, to encourage local interest in the
BBC and to provide the BBC with advice and help concerning programmes,
whether for home listeners about that area or for overseas listeners in that area;
to promote good relations with the local broadcasting organizations, and to keep
the BBC informed about local broadcasting and other developments of interest
The BBC has regular relations with the broadcasting organizations in nearlY a11
parts of the world. Relations with these broadcasting organizations are handled by

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Television Broadcasting
In 1936, the BBC launched the world’s first public television service. By end-
1957, this service was being transmitted from 18 stations and was available to over
96 per cent of the population (see map, p. 445).
The BBC television service transmits just under 50 hours of programmes a week,
with permitted extensions (see p. 439). In the course of a year, the service broad¬
casts more than 4,000 items on a national network, made up of studio productions,
outside broadcasts, films, and relays from the continent of Europe.
BBC studio productions come mainly from seven studios in London (five at
Lime Grove and two at Hammersmith) and from the London Television Theatre.
Regional contributions to the national network come from studios at Manchester,
Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow and Bristol. The television film department of the
BBC is housed at the recently acquired Ealing film studios; and Television News
and newsreel programmes originate from a specially equipped studio at Alexandra
Palace. Outside broadcasting (which during the year 1955-56 transmitted some 850
programmes, providing nearly a quarter of the total BBC television output) not
only covers most parts of the United Kingdom with its mobile units, presenting
programmes both of national and of specifically regional interest, but also brings
scenes of events in Europe to viewers in the United Kingdom and to viewers on
European networks (see p. 447)-
The first regular IT A service was inaugurated in September 1955 by a programme
transmission from the ITA London station at Beaulieu Heights, Croydon. By end-
1957, programmes were also being transmitted for between 7 and 8 hours daily
from the London station, from a station near Lichfield covering the midlands area,
from two stations in the northern area—Winter Hill and Emley Moor—and from
stations at Black Hill in Scotland and at St. Hilary in South Wales, making the
service available to over 70 per cent of the population. By the end of 1958, pro¬
grammes will also be transmitted from stations in Newcastle and the Isle of Wight
(see map, p. 445); and it is estimated that, by the end of 1959, independent tele¬
vision will be within the reach of about 90 per cent of the population.
Arrangements have been made by the ITA for one programme company or
group to provide the whole week’s programme at the Scottish, Welsh and Isle of
Wight stations. At the Authority’s other stations, certain broadcasting periods
during each week are allocated to each programme company. This latter arrange¬
ment encourages versatility, which is also furthered by a system of inter-regional
vision and sound links, which permits the exchange of programmes between
different parts of the country.
Television programmes in general include programmes of music, drama, variety
and light entertainment, demonstration and documentary programmes, sports pro¬
grammes, religious programmes, programmes of special interest to women and
children and regular news programmes. In addition, both the BBC and the ITA
started a service of educational broadcasting for schools during 1957. The BBC
programme is produced in conjunction with the School Broadcasting Council.
Advertising is altogether excluded from the television programmes of the BBC,
as from their sound programmes. The ITA may permit the broadcasting of adver¬
tisements (on which the programme companies depend for their revenue) provided
that such broadcasting complies with the relevant provisions in the Television Act,
namely, that there should be no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all
advertisements should be clearly distinguishable as such and recognizably separate
from the rest of the programme, and that the amount of time given to advertising
should not be so great as to detract from the value of the programmes as a medium

of entertainment, instruction and information. The IT A has also agreed rules with
the Postmaster-General about certain classes of broadcasts (including, in particular,
religious services) in which advertisements may not be inserted and, on the advice
of the Advertising Advisory Committee, has drawn up certain ‘ principles for tele¬
vision advertising ’ with a view to the exclusion of misleading advertisements from
the programmes broadcast by the Authority. The cost of inserting advertisements
in the ITA service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the programme companies
for advertising time.
Wire Broadcasting
Wire broadcasting—a system whereby radio programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers—began in the
United Kingdom in 1925 as a private venture and remains in the hands of private
enterprise. Wire broadcasting companies operate under licence from the Postmaster-
General. They are not allowed to originate programmes of their own, and their
function is to distribute programmes from general broadcasting stations. A specified
minimum of their programme material must be taken from BBC sources. Sub¬
scribers to wire broadcasting services must have ordinary broadcasting receiving
licences. There are at present about 400 wire broadcasting services, of which about
70 give television service and the remainder sound-only service. The number of
subscribers is just over one million, including about 50,000 who receive television
services.
Audience Research
Audience research, as conducted by the BBC, is carried on by interviewing, each
day, some 4,000 people (a sample or cross-section of the public) to ascertain what
programmes they have heard or viewed on the preceding day, and by means of
Listening and Viewing Panels, the members of which are volunteers, who are pre¬
pared to answer questions about the programmes they normally hear or see. Trends
in public taste, which cannot be discovered by an examination of the results of
interviews and of the reports of the panels, are the concern of a special section of
the BBC’s Audience Research Department, which also carries out general surveys.
Audience research is carried out on behalf of independent television by three
independent research organizations.
Scientific Research
Research into technical problems of broadcasting is carried out by the scientific
and engineering staffs of the BBC, the ITA, and the Post Office. Subjects of par¬
ticular interest during recent years have been acoustics, the propagation of radio
waves, and the design of transmitting aerials for frequency modulated sound
broadcasting and for television.
A major item of work, still in progress during 1957, is the investigation of
systems of colour television. There have been a number of experimental trans¬
missions by the BBC, carried out in conjunction with the Television Advisory
Committee (set up in 1952 to advise the Postmaster-General), which have been
received in colour on specially built receiving sets and, on the system used in the
BBC’s experimental transmissions, in monochrome, on ordinary receivers of the
type now in general use. The final choice of a colour television system will rest with
the Postmaster-General; but, in spite of the progress made, the Television Advi¬
sory Committee is not yet ready to make a recommendation, and the introduction
of regular colour programmes cannot be expected for a number of years.
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
447
International Co-operation
Britain’s main contribution to international co-operation in the field of sound
and television broadcasting is represented by its membership of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialized agency respon¬
sible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication services
(including sound and television), for the allocation and registration of all radio
frequencies, and (through its International Radio Consultative Committee) for the
promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical radio problems.
Other contributions include the provision of experts to assist under-developed
foreign countries (through ITU participation in the United Nations Expanded
Programme of Technical Assistance).
The BBC is a member of the European Broadcasting Union; and it participates
in the exchange of sound radio programmes arranged by the member countries
of the Western European Union, as well as in the network of European television
programmes (Eurovision). A permanent television link between London and the
Continent to facilitate programme exchanges on this network is being constructed
by the Post Office. The first section of the link was completed in 1955 ; it is expected
that the second section—a two-way link across the English Channel—will be com¬
pleted in 1958. In the meantime, a temporary link is being used and, during 1956
and 1957, selected programmes from abroad were regularly shown in the BBC
television services with the participation, on occasion, of as many as 14 networks.
The programme contractors of the IT A may also make use of this link with the
Continent in the near future. r 1
Close links are maintained with the broadcasting organizations of the Common¬
wealth countries overseas and with those of the United States of America. In
March 1957, a British Commonwealth International Newsfilm Agency was formed
(under the aegis of the British Commonwealth International Newsfilm Agency
Trust, established by the BBC, the Rank Organisation, the Canadian Broadcast¬
ing Corporation and the Australian Broadcasting Commission) to provide a service
of international news on film for subscribers anywhere in the world, who operate
television services or produce cinematograph newsreels, or who might require
newsreels for other purposes.
XIV. THE PRESS
The British Press caters for all political views, different levels of education and a
wide range of interests. It is free from Government censorship and interference.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the world.
It has been estimated (by UNESCO) that for every i ,000 inhabitants of the United
Kingdom 609 copies of daily papers are sold every day. Next comes Sweden with
506 per 1,000 inhabitants. Circulation figures of individual newspapers are propor¬
tionately high. The Sunday News of the World, which reached a circulation of over
8 million copies, and the average circulation of which has recently (January to end-
June 1957) been 7,241,396, holds the world’s record for the circulation of a news¬
paper1 ; and seven of the daily newspapers have circulations in the millions. These
high figures are largely explained by the fact that the London morning papers have
‘ national ’ circulations, i.e. they are distributed throughout the British Isles, being
available on the day of publication everywhere except in a few outlying islands.
Britain is, however, less well served in the size of newspapers because of the
shortage of newsprint due to the fact that 50 per cent has to be imported and the
remaining 50 per cent made from imported raw material and so the expenditure of
foreign exchange, especially dollars, is involved. This has meant restriction of
supplies in recent years when the balance of payments has been under pressure.
But there has been some improvement: from an average of four to six pages in the
war and immediate post-war period, daily papers rose to an average of 8 to 12 pages
in 1956. Supplies of newsprint rose from about 650,000 tons in 1953 to 930,000
tons in 1956. The Government ceased to control deliveries of newsprint to the press
and other users in December 1956, when the industry took over responsibility for
distribution of supplies.
Prices of daily newspapers vary from 2 Jd. (for the majority of papers) to 4d. (for
The Times).
According to The Newspaper Press Directory2 there are some 150 daily and Sun¬
day newspapers: 16 London mornings, 3 London evenings, n London Sundays;
19 mornings, 65 evenings and 3 Sundays in England outside London; 1 morning
and 3 evenings in Wales; 7 mornings, 8 evenings and 2 Sundays in Scotland; 3
mornings and 1 evening in Northern Ireland; 1 Isle of Man daily; and 1 morning
and 2 evenings in the Channel Islands.
There are over 1,300 weekly papers which are published in Greater London and
almost every sizable town in the rest of the country. These papers deal mainly with
news of interest to the region where they are sold. There are also the sporting papers,
papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident in Britain,
and religious papers.
1The only higher circulation is that of the BBC’s weekly, Radio Times, which averaged
a sale of over 8J million copies per issue for the year 1956.
2 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the 1957
edition of The Newspaper Press Directory, published early in 1957.

In 1947, a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into the
finance, control, management and ownership of the British Press. Its report was
issued in June 1949 {Cmd. 7700) and has been recognized as a comprehensive and
authoritative analysis. Among other recommendations it suggested the establish¬
ment of a General Council of the Press and this was set up in 1953 (see p. 455).
The Commission found that the British Press ‘is completely independent of
outside financial interests and that its policy is the policy of those that conduct it’;
there was evidence that the direct influence of advertisers on policy was ‘ negligible ’.
After studying management and ownership, the Commission concluded that ‘there
is nothing approaching monopoly in the Press as a whole, or ... in any class of
newspaper’.
Ownership
As Table 39 shows, several companies or groups own a number of newspapers.
The five largest press groups are: Associated Newspapers Limited, which, with
four London papers, owns through subsidiary companies linked under the manage¬
ment of NorthclifiFe Newspapers Group Limited a total of eleven dailies, nine
weeklies and one Sunday; Kemsley Newspapers Limited, which owns eleven
dailies, seven weeklies, and four Sundays; Westminster Press Group, which con¬
trols nine dailies and 38 weeklies; Provincial Newspapers Limited, which owns
four dailies and 20 weeklies; and the Harmsworth Group, which runs four dailies
and ten weeklies in the West country.
Groups also exist in the periodical press; among the best known are the Amalga¬
mated Press, which publishes 51 general, women’s and children’s papers (the
affiliated Iliffe and Sons having 33 trade, technical and specialized journals);
THE PRESS
451
Odhams Press, which (in addition to two newspapers) publishes about 18 periodi¬
cals, including some with very high circulations; George Newnes and C. Arthur
Pearson Limited, which publishes 25 periodicals (not including technical and
trade journals, of which the Temple Press, a subsidiary, issues 14) besides tech¬
nical books and papers for many branches of industry; Hulton Press Limited,
which publishes fewer titles but whose magazines have very large circulations; and
the Thomson-Leng group, the largest publishers of magazines in Scotland (see
P-453)-
Certain newspapers and periodicals are controlled by trustees whose aim is to
preserve the character and traditions of the paper and prevent control from falling
into unsuitable hands. Various forms of trust govern the direction of The Times,
Manchester Guardian, News Chronicle and Star, Observer, Economist and Spectator.
The ‘ National ’ Press
Nine morning papers with headquarters in London, and one in Manchester,
are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the British Isles, and there are
11 ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 39). In addition, the leading Scottish papers
(see below) circulate widely, and certain specialized daily papers also have a circula¬
tion not limited by region, e.g., The Financial Times (circulation 82,212). The three
London evening papers each have affiliations with one of the national dailies, but
they draw their readership very largely from people living within fifty miles of
London.
Provincial Newspapers
The provincial newspapers, numbering nearly a hundred morning or evening
dailies and Sunday papers and nearly 1,000 weeklies, provide the general and local
news expected by readers whose daily life and interests are known to, and shared
by, the newspaper staff. Some 60 provincial papers still in existence were founded
before 1800; the oldest being Berrow’s Worcester Journal, dating dack to 1709-
With a few exceptions (e.g., Yorkshire Post, Newcastle Journal, Northern Echo,
Sheffield Telegraph, Western Mail) they reflect no definite political tendency. The
total circulation of the dailies is estimated at about 9 million and of the weekhes
at about 12 million. The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly
than the national daily, is a valuable medium for national and local advertising.
London suburban weeklies, of which there are about 90, are closer to the pro¬
vincial weeklies than to the national dailies in readership and appeal.
Ownership of the provincial press is varied: it includes individual owners, two
or more partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper com
panics owning between one and half a dozen papers, or press groups controlling a
chain of newspapers in different parts of the country.
Scotland
Scotland has seven morning, eight evening and two Sunday newspapers. The
Glasgow Herald, founded in 1783, and The Scotsman, founded in 1817, and a
daily since 1855, published in Edinburgh, are among the organs influencing
serious opinion in Great Britain. The circulation of the former is 75,721 and of the
latter 56,227 (average figures January to end-June 1957)- Other morning papers
are The Daily Record and Mail, The Bulletin (a picture paper), The Courier and
Advertiser, and The Press and Journal (and Scottish editions of the Daily Express
and Daily Mail). Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen are the centres of
publication. Evening papers include the Edinburgh Evening News and Evening Dis¬
patch, Glasgow’s Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee s Evening Telegraph
452
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, and the Paisley Daily Express and the
Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, Scottish Sunday
Express, and the Sunday Post.
Among the weekly papers are the Weekly Scotsman, the Aberdeen Journal, and
The People s Journal, which also circulate outside Scotland; in all there are about
120 weekly papers published in Scottish towns.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has three morning papers and one evening paper, all printed
in Belfast: they are Belfast News Letter, Northern Whig, Irish News and Belfast
Telegraph. In addition to three newspapers in Londonderry which are each pub¬
lished three times a week, there are 43 weekly papers. There is also a sporting
paper, Ireland's Saturday Night, published each Saturday afternoon (Belfast). The
majority are published by individual companies and all the counties have good
coverage of local papers. There are no Sunday newspapers.
Wales
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, a Kemsley newspaper, is
printed and published in Cardiff; it has a circulation of 90,504, mainly in the
southern half of Wales. In North Wales, the Liverpool Daily Post gives wide
coverage to events in the area. Evening papers published in Wales are the South
Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales
Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and Liverpool
Express and to a smaller extent by evening papers published in Manchester, the
Manchester Evening News and the Manchester Evening Chronicle.
Since October i954> a special Welsh edition of the Empire News and Sunday
Chronicle has been printed in Cardiff. Other national Sunday papers carry columns
of news on Welsh affairs.
The weekly press includes 48 weekly papers in English, some of them carrying
articles in Welsh; nine bilingual papers; and twelve papers in Welsh, of which five
are denominational papers.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands have one morning paper {Guernsey Star), two evening
papers, one twice-weekly and two weeklies. The Isle of Man has one daily, a special
weekly edition of which is published on Saturday, and four other weeklies.
Periodicals
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. A salient
feature of the last twenty-five years has been the development of periodicals with a
mass appeal and the growth of the trade and technical press. There are over 3,500
periodical publications: general magazines with circulations ranging up to over
a million; women s magazines, which also have large circulations; numerous pub¬
lications for children; religious periodicals of various denominations; magazines
dealing with sports, hobbies, fiction and humour; periodicals specializing in
various subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the professions,
and the arts; the large body of trade and technical publications whose circulations
are not confined to the United Kingdom; and lastly, the journals of learned
societies, trade unions, business houses, regiments, universities, colleges, schools,
and other associations.
THE PRESS
453
At the high circulation end of the scale are the popular periodicals, such as
Illustrated, John Bull, Tit-Bits, Reveille, and Week-End-, several of these have circu¬
lations of a million or more. Three women’s weeklies {Woman, Woman’s Own and
Woman’s Weekly) and one women’s monthly {W'oman and Home) also have circula¬
tions in the millions.
Of considerable influence, although their circulations are only in the tens of
thousands, are the weeklies dealing with political, social and economic affairs:
The Economist, which covers topics of the day from a far wider angle than its title
would indicate and is politically independent; The New Statesman and Nation,
a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political
tendency; The Spectator, which covers much the same subjects and is non-party;
Time and Tide, which has a right-wing tendency; Tribune, with a left-wing but
strongly anti-communist bias; and Truth, which is extreme right wing in its political
outlook. Other papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands are the illus¬
trated weeklies such as The Illustrated London News, The Sphere, The Field, and
Country Life, while Punch is the leading humour periodical. The readership of all
these weeklies is greater than is apparent from their circulation figures, since they
are widely read in libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, generally speaking, appeal to the more serious
type of reader, particularly the literary and political journals and those specializing
in international and Commonwealth affairs. . 7 ,
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish Field,
Scotland's Magazine, The Scots Magazine (founded 1779) and Scotland-, and two
weeklies devoted to farming interests, Farming News and The Scottish Farmer.
Among literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood s, published in
Edinburgh. Popular magazines are numerous: the Thomson-Leng group of Dun¬
dee alone distributes about 10 million copies of weeklies in the British Isles and
abroad. . r •
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover farming,
the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., a world agency with some 40 offices abroad and correspondents
in almost all the world’s capitals, which distributes foreign and Commonwealth
news to British newspapers and foreign and British news to over 3,000 papers out¬
side Britain. It is owned by the British Press (through the Press Association and
the Newspaper Proprietors’ Association) and two Commonwealth news agencies,
the Australian Associated Press and the New Zealand Press Association. All pro ts
are used to develop the service.
Press Association Ltd., which distributes home news. It is owned by British
provincial newspapers. All profits are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd., a public company which distributes home
news to British papers and other subscribers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news.
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of the United Press of
America.
There are besides some 60 United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign
454
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
agencies and news services with offices in London, specializing in some aspects
of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Training for Journalism
Until recently, and this therefore applies to most newspapermen working today,
journalists were, broadly, of two classes: those who entered newspaper offices on
leaving school and worked their way up, learning by experience; and university
graduates who held some of the specialized posts, such as correspondents abroad
or on special subjects, leader-writers and editorial office staff. The second class has
always been comparatively small. The Kemsley Newspaper Group made provision
for combining instruction with the practice of journalism, and courses in journalism
were organized by the London Polytechnic, and by King’s College, London (until
the outbreak of war in 1939).
In 1952 an agreement was reached for a more comprehensive plan for the training
and education of junior journalists in newspaper offices. A National Council for
the Training of Journalists, on which are representatives of the principal press
organizations, administers the scheme, which is based on the voluntary co-operation
of newspaper offices. Examinations are taken at two levels, the lower being a general
proficiency test which may be taken only after three years of active journalism, the
higher, a diploma, which is awarded after further examination and submission of a
thesis.
Press Institutions
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organized. On the
employers’ side, the most important organizations are the Newspaper Proprietors’
Association, whose members are proprietors of London (national) daily and Sunday
newspapers, the Newspaper Society, whose members are proprietors of provincial
daily and weekly newspapers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society, the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors’ Association, and
the Periodical Proprietors’ Association, whose membership embraces the indepen¬
dent publishers of trade and technical publications and general magazines. On the
employees’ side there are the Institute of Journalists (loj)—the National Associa¬
tion of Journalists until 1889—incorporated by Royal Charter in 1890, and the
National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907. The National Union of
Journalists has a membership of about 14,000 working journalists; editors who
have powers of dismissal are excluded from full membership but may be associate
members. The Institute of Journalists, which has a membership of some 2,700,
admits editors. Free-lance journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper
or group of papers but send contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ
or loj. The aims of these organizations are the improvement of the economic status
of journalists, the promotion of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of
the status of the Press and its editorial staffs.
The aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are, inter alia, to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors,
to protect the rights and freedom of the Press, and to improve the education and
training of junior journalists: the Guild has over 300 members.
The largest of other organizations directly connected with the Press is the
National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA), which has
a varied membership connected with the production of newspapers and periodicals;
in addition to the groups indicated by the title of the society, its membership
includes clerical workers, dispatch hands and similar personnel. The largest of the
Printers’ Unions concerned is the London Typographical Society.
THE PRESS
455
The General Council of the Press
Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Press, a Press
Council representative of the various Press organizations was set up in 1953. Its
aims are:
to preserve the established freedom of the British Press;
to maintain the character of the British Press in accordance with the highest
professional and commercial standards;
to keep under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of informa¬
tion of public interest and importance;
to promote and encourage methods of recruitment, education and training of
journalists;
to promote a proper functional relation among all sections of the profession;
to promote technical and other research;
to study developments in the British Press w'hich may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; and
to publish periodical reports recording its own work and reviewing from time
to time the various developments in the British Press and the factors
affecting them.
The Council consists of eight editorial representatives, four nominees of the
National Union of Journalists, three nominees of the Institute of Journalists, and
ten managerial representatives.
The Press and the Law
The Press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say what
it likes provided it does not transgress the law; and in general it enjoys very great
liberty of comment on matters of public interest. There are no special press laws
(other than those relating to such matters as the registration of newspapers), but
requirements which affect the Press occur in a variety of Acts of Parliament; for
example, the admission of the Press to meetings of local authorities is regulated by
the Local Government Acts and restrictions on the reporting of domestic proceed¬
ings and proceedings against juveniles are imposed by legislation governing pro¬
cedure in the law courts.
In particular, the Press must comply with the copyright laws and with the laws
against the publication of matters protected by the Official Secrets Acts, with the
laws of seditious libel, blasphemous and obscene libel, and defamation, with the
laws for the protection of children from publications which might do them moral
harm,1 and against fraudulent advertising, against breach of Parliamentary privi¬
lege, and against ‘contempt of court’—publication of anything affecting a case
before the courts which might tend to influence the result of the trial, or of com¬
ment on court proceedings which might tend to prejudice their reputation for
justice.
Public prosecutions of the Press for offences against these laws are infrequent,
the majority of such legal actions as do take place are brought by private individuals
seeking to protect their own interests, for example, against libel. In any legal action
the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as well
as the author of the article, can all be held responsible.
