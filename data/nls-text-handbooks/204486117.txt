Foreword
Britain 2001 is the 52nd edition of an official
annual reference book that was first published
in the 1940s. Since 1997 it has been produced
by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Drawing on a wide range of official and other
authoritative sources, Britain 2001 provides a
factual and up-to-date overview of the United
Kingdom, while also covering the main
aspects of current government policy. It is a
widely used work of reference, both in the
United Kingdom itself, and overseas, where it
is an important element of the information
service provided by British diplomatic posts.
The term ‘Britain’ is sometimes used as a
short way of expressing the full title of the
country: the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland (or, more simply again,
the United Kingdom or the UK). ‘Great
Britain’ comprises England, Wales and
Scotland only. The adjectives ‘British’ and
‘UK’ are used interchangeably in this
publication and cover the whole of the United
Kingdom. As far as possible, the book applies
to the UK as a whole, as the title suggests.
However, sometimes the information given
refers to just: Great Britain; England and
Wales; or, in some instances, England,
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland alone.
The 52nd edition has more charts and
tables than ever before, and 40 colour pages
including some new and redrawn maps. The
text is 285,000 words long and has been fully
updated and revised. Every effort is made to
ensure that the information given in Britain
2001 is accurate at the time of going to press.
The text is generally based on information
available up to the end of August 2000.
The five Parts of Britain 2001 align with
their equivalents in another ONS publication,
the Annual Abstract of Statistics, so that the
two books can be consulted as complementary
volumes, painting a picture of the UK in
words and figures. Readers who are interested
in more detailed information about regions
within the UK can find up-to-date statistics in
another ONS publication, Regional Trends.
Sources
To help the reader seeking further
information, at the end of each chapter there is
a brief further reading section, which lists the
main statistical publications and other
important documents, such as recent White
Papers. A selection of websites is included at
the end of most chapters. The main
government websites are included in the entry
for Government Departments and Agencies in
Appendix 1.
ONS issues a number of important
statistical publications, many of which have
been used in the compilation of Britain 2001,

In compiling Britain 2001, information
about particular companies has been taken
from company reports and news releases, or
from other publicly available sources. No
information about individual companies has
vii

been taken from returns submitted in response
to ONS statistical inquiries. Very strict
arrangements operate within ONS to ensure
that such data remain confidential.
Acknowledgments
Britain 2001 has been compiled with the full
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all
the people from these organisations who have
taken so much time and care to ensure that the
book’s high standards of accuracy have been
maintained. Their contributions and
comments have been extremely valuable.
The book was researched, written and
edited by a combination of in-house authors
and freelances. The main in-house team
comprised Jil Matheson, John King, Derek
Tomhn, David Harper, Conor Shipsey,
Christine Lillistone, Nina Mill, Dave Sharp,
Carol Summerfield, Victoria Jackson, Jackie
Jackson, Alistair Dent and John
Chrzczonowicz. The freelance writers were
Henry Langley (who also contributed to the
production of the book), Richard German
(who also compiled the index), John Collis and
Oliver Metcalf. Picture research and design of
colour sections were undertaken by Frances
Riddelle. Freelance design work, including all
diagrams, most colour and black and white
maps, and layout of colour sections, was done
by Ray Martin. Jane Howard, Jole Cosgrove
and Rosemary Hamilton proofread the text.
The cover was designed by The Stationery
Office.

out in the National Statistics Code of Practice. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to
ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference.
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
1 Introduction
Physical Features 1 Population 2
Channel Islands and Isle of Man 1 Historical Outline 3
Climate and Wildlife 2
The recent establishment of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly
for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly is bringing about the most
significant change in the constitution in the United Kingdom since its
formation in 1801.1 In addition, eight new Regional Development Agencies and
the London Development Agency have been set up in England.
Physical Features
The United Kingdom (UK) constitutes the
greater part of the British Isles. The largest of
the islands is Great Britain, which comprises
England, Scotland and Wales. The next
largest comprises Northern Ireland, which is
part of the UK, and the Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large island
chains known as the Inner and Outer
Hebrides, and to the north east of the Scottish
mainland are the Orkney and Shetland
Islands. All these, along with the Isle of
Wight, Anglesey and the Isles of Scilly, have
administrative ties with the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel
Islands between Great Britain and France are
largely self-governing, and are not part of the
UK. The UK is one of the 15 member states
of the European Union (EU).
1 When the UK was the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland. The Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic)
was created in 1922, leaving Northern Ireland in the Union.
The devolution of political power is discussed in greater
detail in chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
With an area of about 243,000 sq km
(93,000 sq miles), excluding inland water, the
UK is just under 1,000 km (about 600 miles)
from the south coast to the extreme north of
Scotland and just under 500 km (around 300
miles) across at the widest point.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and
remained subject to the English Crown after
the loss of mainland Normandy to the French
in 1204. The Isle of Man was under the
nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266,
and eventually came under the direct
administration of the British Crown in 1765,
when it was bought for £70,000. Its
parliament, ‘Tynwald’, was established more
than 1,000 years ago and is the oldest
legislature in continuous existence in the
world. Today the territories have their own
legislative assemblies and systems of law, and
their own taxation systems. The British
1
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Government is responsible for their
international relations and external defence.
The relationship of the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man with the EU is limited to
trading rights only. Rules on customs matters
apply to the Islands under the same conditions
as they apply to the UK. However, the free
movement of people and services within the
EU as a whole only extends to the Islanders if
they have close ties with the UK, although they
do still enjoy their traditional rights in the UK.
Climate and Wildlife
The climate in the United Kingdom is
generally mild and temperate. Prevailing
winds are south-westerly and the weather
from day to day is mainly influenced by
depressions and their associated fronts moving
eastwards across the Atlantic, punctuated by
settled, fine, anticyclonic periods of a few days
to weeks. In general, there are few extremes of
temperature; it rarely rises above 32°C (90°F)
or falls below -10°C (14°F).
Average annual rainfall is more than 1,600
mm (over 60 inches) in the mountainous areas
of the west and north but less than 800 mm
(30 inches) over central and eastern parts.
Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the
year but, on average, March to June are the
driest months and September to January the
wettest. During May, June and July (the
months of longest daylight) the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five hours in
northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight. During the months of shortest
daylight (November, December and January)
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of
an hour a day in northern Scotland and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
The UK is home to a great variety of
wildlife, with an estimated 30,000 animal
species, as well as marine and microscopic life;
about 2,800 species of‘higher’ plants; and
many thousands of mosses, fungi and algae.
However, as elsewhere in the world, urban
development, changes in farming methods and
other factors have put pressure on a number of
species and plants. Action is being taken to
halt the decline of species (see chapter 20),
while the Millennium Seed Bank Project (see
p. 446) is aiming to collect and conserve seeds

Population
The population of the UK increased from 38.2
million in 1901 to 59.5 million in 1999 (see
Table 1.1). Official projections, based on mid-
1998 population estimates, forecast that the
population will reach nearly 60 million by
2001 and 61.8 million by 2011.

statistics for 1999 are given in Table 1.2 for

]: INTRODUCTION
The Census of Population was first conducted
in 1801 and it has been held every ten years
ever since, with one exception, 1941.
The next Census is due to take place on
29 April 2001. For the first time it will be a
resident-based count, so that people will be
enumerated at the address where they are
usually resident rather than where they are
present on Census night. Questions in the
Census cover a variety of topics, such as for
residents, name, sex and date of birth;
marital status; country of birth; ethnic
group; usual address one year previously;
qualifications; and a range of questions
connected with work. For households,
questions include the type and tenure of
accommodation, availability of bath and toilet
and of central heating, and number of cars or
vans owned or available. New questions
include those on religion (see p. 235), general
health, the provision of unpaid personal care
and the lowest floor level of accommodation
(although this has previously been asked in
Scotland).

Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a Celtic
original. Although in the prehistoric timescale
the Celts were relatively late arrivals in the
British Isles, only with them does Britain
emerge into recorded history. The term
‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to

distinguish the early inhabitants of the British
Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in 55
and 54 BC, contact between Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of AD 43. Roman rule was gradually
extended from south-east England to include
Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of Scotland.
The final Roman withdrawal in 409 followed a
period of increasing disorder during which the
island began to be raided by Angles, Saxons
and Jutes from northern Europe. It is from the
Angles that the name ‘England’ derives. The
raids turned into settlement and a number of
small English kingdoms were established. The
Britons maintained an independent existence in
the areas now known as Wales and Cornwall.
Among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms more
powerful ones emerged, claiming overlordship
of the whole of England, first in the north
(Northumbria), then in the midlands (Mercia)
and finally in the south (Wessex). However,
further raids and settlement by the Vikings
from Scandinavia occurred, although in the
10th century the Wessex dynasty defeated the
invading Danes and established a wide-ranging
authority in England. In 1066 England was
invaded by the Normans (see p. 7), who then
settled along with others from France.
Dates of some of the main events in Britain’s

England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland regions
in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moors) and in the South West (Bodmin Moor, Exmoor, Dartmoor and the
Mendip Hills). The greatest concentrations of population are in London and
the South East, South and West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside,
the West Midlands, and conurbations in the north-east on the rivers Tyne and
Tees. England’s population is expected to rise from 50.2 million in 2001 to 53.7
million in 2021.
Early History
The name ‘England’ is derived from the Angles,
one of the Germanic tribes which established
monarchies in lowland Britain in the 5th
century, after the final withdrawal of the
Romans in 409. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms
were initially fairly small and numerous, but
gradually larger entities emerged. Eventually
Wessex came to dominate, following its leading
role in resisting the Danish invasions of the 9th
century. Athelstan (who reigned from 924 to
939) used the title of‘King of all Britain’, and
from 954 there was a single Kingdom of
England. The present Royal Family is
descended from the old royal house of
Wessex—a connection seen in June 1999 when
the Queen’s youngest son, Prince Edward, was
created Earl of Wessex on his marriage.
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings and became King William I. Many
Normans and others from France came to
settle; French became the language of the
nobility for the next three centuries; and the
legal and social structures were influenced by
those prevailing across the Channel.
When Henry II, originally from Anjou, was
king (1154-89), his ‘Angevin empire’ stretched
from the river Tweed on the Scottish border,
down through much of France to the Pyrenees.
However, almost all the English Crown’s
possessions in France, after alternating periods
of expansion and contraction, were finally lost
during the late Middle Ages.
England and Wales were integrated
administratively and legally in 1536-42 during
the reign of Henry VIII, and the union of
England and Scotland took place in 1707,
when Queen Anne was Sovereign.
Government
In contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, England has no separate elected

national body exclusively responsible for its
central administration. Instead a number of
government departments look after England’s
day-to-day administrative affairs (see
Appendix 1) and a network of nine
Government Offices for the Regions (GOs—
see p. 11) is responsible for the
implementation of several government
programmes in the regions.
There are 529 English parliamentary
constituencies represented in the House of
Commons. After the General Election of May
1997, England had 328 Labour Members of
Parliament (MPs), 165 Conservative, 34 Liberal
Democrat, one held by the Speaker and one
independent.1 By August 2000 there had been
nine by-elections in English constituencies, with
the political party that had been representing
the constituency retaining the seat in all but one
case, Romsey, in Hampshire, which the Liberal
Democrats gained from the Conservatives.
Conservative support tends to be strongest in
suburban and rural areas, and the party has a
large number of parliamentary seats in the
southern half of England. The Labour Party has
tended in the past to derive its main support
from the big cities and areas associated with
traditional industry, but it won many seats in
the last General Election that had previously
been considered safe Conservative
constituencies. The Liberal Democrats, who are
traditionally strong in the South West, now
have nearly a third of their 35 English seats in
Greater London and the South East.
Local government is administered in many
areas through a two-tier system of county and
district councils. However, there are also a
number of single-tier, or unitary, authorities
—especially in the larger cities, and since July
2000 the capital has been run by the new
Greater London Authority (see p. 63).
England elects 71 representatives (MEPs)
to the European Parliament (see pp. 69-70).
1 The Speaker of the House of Commons, who presides
over the debates there (see p. 43), traditionally does not
vote along party lines and so is not counted towards the
strength of the party for which he or she was originally
elected. The independent MP is the former journalist Martin
Bell, who represents Tatton in Cheshire. In April 2000 the
Labour MP Ken Livingstone gave up his Party’s Whip and
now sits in the House of Commons without party affiliation.
In the June 1999 election, the Conservatives
won 33 seats, Labour 24, the Liberal
Democrats nine, the UK Independence Party
three and the Green Party two.
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions known
as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on the other,
parliamentary and European Community
legislation (‘statute law’). In the formulation of
common law since the Norman Conquest, great
reliance has been placed on precedent. Equity
law—law outside the scope of the common law
or statute law—derives from the practice of
petitioning the Lord Chancellor in cases not
covered by common law.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church at
the time of the Reformation in the early 16th
century, is the Established Church (that is, the
official religion of England). The Sovereign
must always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops (see p. 237).
London
In May 2000, Londoners voted for a directly
elected Mayor for the capital, and a separately
elected assembly of 25 members.2 Subsequent
elections will take place every four years. The
Mayor and Assembly form the Greater
London Authority (GLA), the first elected
London-wide body since the Greater London
Council was abolished in 1986. The GLA
assumed its responsibilities in July 2000; at the
same time, four other administrative bodies
came into being and are accountable to it: a
new Metropolitan Police Authority; the
London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority; Transport for London; and the
London Development Agency, one of nine
regional agencies covering the whole of
England (see p. 394).
2 Of the 25 members, 14 represent constituencies covering
two or more London boroughs; the rest are ‘London-wide
Members’ divided among the political parties according to
their share of the vote for these 11 seats (see p. 10). The
new arrangements do not affect the continuance of the
separate post of Lord Mayor of London (first established in
1191), whose role is restricted to the City of London—the
financial ‘Square Mile’ at the heart of the capital.

BRI TAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Mayor and Assembly for London—
Election Results, May 2000
Mayor
Londoners chose the Member of Parliament
Ken Livingstone, standing as an
Independent candidate, as their first directly
elected Mayor in May 2000.
Elections were held under the
supplementary vote system, where voters
mark both their first and second choices. If no
candidate receives more than 50 per cent of
first choices, only the two leading candidates
remain in contention and second votes for
these are added in to give an overall winner.
After the first count, the results were:
Party Number of % of
votes cast votes cast
Independent 667,877 39.0
Conservative 464,434 27.1
Labour 223,884 13.1
Liberal Democrats 203,452 11.9
Others 154,515 8.9
After second choice votes were added to
those first cast for the leading two
candidates, the Independent had a total of
776,427 votes (58 per cent) and the
Conservative 564,137 (42 per cent). rI he
Independent candidate was duly elected,
with a majority of 212,290 votes. From an
electorate of 5,093,464 the turnout was
1,714,162 (33.7 per cent).
Assembly
For the purpose of electing the Assembly,
London was divided into 14 constituencies
whose members were elected on a 1 first-
past-the-post’ basis. A further 11 seats were
allocated on a ‘top-up’ basis, where votes
were counted across London and shared
among the political parties in proportion to
the votes each party received.
The results for the Assembly were:
Party Number of Number of Total
constituency top-up
seats seats
Labour 6 3
Conservative 8 1
Liberal Democrats - 4
Green - 3 3
Initially occupying offices near the Houses
of Parliament, the GLA will eventually move
to a new building being constructed on a
previously developed site between London
Bridge and Tower Bridge, on the south bank
of the river Thames.
The Regions of England
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) were
launched in eight English regions in April
1999. The ninth, in London, followed in July
2000 on the establishment of the GLA. RDAs
aim to provide co-ordinated regional economic
development and regeneration, reduce the
economic imbalances which exist within and
between regions and enable the English
regions to improve their competitiveness.
In April 2000 the Government established
a Regional Co-ordination Unit, thus
implementing a key conclusion from a Cabinet
Office Performance and Innovation Unit
report—Reaching Out: The Role of Central
Government at Regional and Local Level.
The main functions of the new unit, which
brings together the interests of a range of
departments, are to:
• co-ordinate the delivery of central
Government’s regional initiatives,
including those affecting local areas;
• promote the use of GOs by Whitehall
departments;
• encourage better working between the
GOs and other regional and local
partners; and
• manage the shared functions of the GOs.
The economic performance of the nine
English regions (see map opposite), and
subregions within them, varies quite
considerably. For example, Inner London has
had the highest level of gross domestic
product (GDP) per head in the European
Union (EU) for a number of years, even
10

though it also contains some of the worst
pockets of deprivation in the UK. Under the
new Objective 1 status for EU funding that
came into force in January 2000 (see p. 396),
three areas of England—Merseyside, South
Yorkshire, and Cornwall and the Isles of
Scilly—qualified for funding from 2000 to
2006. According to the latest figures, household
disposable income per head in 1998 was above
the England average in London, the South East
and East; and the same three regions had the
highest gross hourly earnings for full-time
employees in 1999. The North East had the
lowest household disposable income and GDP
per head in 1998, as well as the lowest average
hourly earnings in 1999.
Some of the consequences of economic
success in the wealthier English regions are
higher residential and industrial property
prices, higher rental costs for offices and higher
volumes of traffic. As people working in
London tend to commute from further afield
than those in other cities, average journey times
to work are far longer in London than
elsewhere, ranging from 30 minutes in Outer
London to 55 minutes into Central London,
compared with an average in Great Britain of
just 25 minutes. In autumn 1998 the number of
people entering Central London between 7.00
a.m. and 10.00 a.m. on each working day was
nearly 1.1 million, a 3 per cent increase on the
previous year. Public transport is used by 78
per cent of those working in Central London,
compared with the average of 13 per cent for
Great Britain as a whole.
The Labour Force Survey for March to May
2000 showed that 75.4 per cent of people of
working age in England were in employment,
compared with 74.6 per cent in the UK as a
whole. Comparable rates for unemployment
were 5.4 per cent and 5.6 per cent respectively.
Regional Development Agencies
RDAs are accountable through ministers to
Parliament. Each RDA has a board of 13 or 14
members, including the chairman, and on each
board a majority of members has business
experience. The boards also include local
councillors, and members with expertise in the
fields of education, rural affairs, the voluntary
sector and trade union issues. RDAs have been
allocated some £1.2 billion of programme
spending for 2000-01; this is scheduled to rise
to £1.7 billion by 2003—04. Their initiatives are
also expected to attract private finance.
From April 2002, the RDAs’ funding
programmes will be drawn together to allow
them greater flexibility in allocating their
resources.
Rural Areas
There are over 16,500 rural towns, villages
and hamlets in England with populations of
10,000 or fewer.3 According to this definition,
one in five people live in a rural area. Over
three-quarters of rural settlements have
populations of under 500.
Car ownership is greater in rural
households (83 per cent) than nationally (70
per cent), but the countryside often lacks
services that urban dwellers take for granted.

recent years is a notable example. Another is
the comparative lack of public transport
serving country areas. In 1998 the
Government allocated an extra £150 million
over three years to improve rural transport in
the UK as a whole. A further £10 million a
year for the next two years was announced in
the 1999 Budget. This extra funding has led to
the creation of 1,800 new or improved rural
bus services in England.
The Environment
Despite its high population density and degree
of urbanisation, England has many unspoilt
rural and coastal areas. There are eight
National Parks (including the Norfolk and
Suffolk Broads), nine forest parks, 37
designated Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty, 22 Environmentally Sensitive Areas,
over 200 country parks recognised by the
Countryside Agency, and more than 1,540 km
(960 miles) of designated heritage coastline. At
the end of March 2000, there were 202
National Nature Reserves, 635 Local Nature
Reserves and 4,088 Sites of Special Scientific
Interest. (See also chapter 20.)
Culture
London and the other large cities have a
wealth of cultural centres, including major art
galleries, renowned museums, theatres, ballet
and opera houses, and concert halls. Many
theatres outside London are used for touring
by the national theatre, dance and opera
companies. Popular culture also thrives in
England, as elsewhere in Britain: there are
numerous kinds of pop music, theatre styles
such as pantomime and musicals, jazz festivals
and performances by comedians. Safari,
wildlife and theme parks all offer family
activities and entertainment. A proportion of
the proceeds from the National Lottery (see
p. 117) is allocated to arts projects.
Many regions and towns have associations
with great English writers, artists and
musicians: such as Stratford-upon-Avon
(William Shakespeare), the Lake District
(William Wordsworth), Stoke-on-Trent
(Arnold Bennett), Haworth (the Bronte
sisters) and Dorset (4 homas Hardy); Essex
and Suffolk (John Constable) and Salford
(L. S. Lowry); and Worcestershire (Edward
Elgar), Aldeburgh (Benjamin Britten) and
Liverpool (The Beatles).

Northern Ireland is, at its nearest point, only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It
has a 488-km (303-mile) border with the Irish Republic. About half of its
population of 1.7 million people live in the eastern coastal region, the centre of
which is the capital, Belfast.
In December 1999 the Westminster Parliament devolved power to the Northern
Ireland Assembly and its Executive Committee of Ministers (although the
Assembly was briefly suspended in early 2000). Devolution followed endorsement
of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement by the people of Northern Ireland in a
referendum held in May 1998. The North/South Ministerial Council,
North/South Implementation Bodies, British-Irish Council and British-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference also became fully functioning institutions when
devolution took place.
The Northern Ireland Continuous Household
Survey (CHS)1 reported in the late 1990s that
54 per cent of the population regarded
themselves as Protestants and 42 per cent as
Roman Catholics. Most of the Protestants are
descendants of Scots or English settlers who
crossed to north-eastern Ireland. Northern
Ireland has a younger population, with
proportionately more children and fewer
pensioners, than any other region in the UK.
History
During the 10th century Ireland was dominated
by the Vikings. In 1169 Henry II of England
1 Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency: CHS
sample 1995-96 to 1997-98.
invaded Ireland, having been granted its
overlordship by the English Pope Adrian IV,
who was anxious to bring the Irish Church into
full obedience to Rome. Although a large part of
the country came under the control of Anglo-
Norman nobles, little direct authority was
exercised from England during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents.
The main area of resistance was the northern
province of Ulster. After the collapse of this
resistance in 1607 and the flight of its leaders,
Protestant immigrants from Scotland and
England settled in Ulster.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further uprisings in Ireland, which were

crushed by Oliver Cromwell. More fighting
took place after the overthrow of the Roman
Catholic James II in 1688. During the Battle
of the Boyne in 1690 the forces of James II,
who was trying to regain the throne, starting
in Ireland, were defeated by those of the
Protestant William of Orange (William III).
Throughout most of the 18th century there
was uneasy peace. In 1782 the Irish Parliament
(dating from medieval times) was given
legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
Crown. The Parliament, however, represented
only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, and
the Roman Catholic majority was excluded
from it. Following the abortive rebellion led
by Wolfe Tone’s United Irishmen movement
in 1798, Ireland was unified with Great

Britain under the 1800 Act of Union. The
Irish Parliament was abolished in 1801 and
Irish members sat in both Houses of the
Westminster Parliament.
The Irish question was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century. In 1886 the Liberal Government
introduced a Home Rule Bill designed to give
a new Irish Parliament devolved authority
over most internal matters while Britain
maintained control over foreign and defence
policy. This failed as did a second Bill
introduced in 1893.
The issue returned to the political agenda
in 1910 because the Liberal Government was
dependent for its political survival on support
from the pro-Home Rule Irish Parliamentary
Party. The controversy intensified as unionists
and nationalists in Ireland formed private
armies. In 1914 Home Rule was approved in
the Government of Ireland Act.
Implementation, however, was suspended by
the outbreak of the First World War.
A nationalist rising in Dublin in 1916 was
suppressed and its leaders executed. Two
years later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won
a large majority of the Irish seats in the general
election to the Westminster Parliament. Its
members refused to attend the House of
Commons and, instead, formed the Dail
Eireann in Dublin. A nationalist guerrilla
force called the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
began operations against the British
administration in 1919.
In 1920 the Government of Ireland Act
provided for separate Parliaments in Northern
and Southern Ireland, subordinate to
Westminster. The Act was implemented in
Northern Ireland in 1921, giving six of the
nine counties of the province of Ulster their
own Parliament with powers to deal with
internal affairs. However, the Act proved
unacceptable in the South, and in 1922,
following negotiations between the British
Government and Sinn Fein, which led to the
Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the 26 counties of
15
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Southern Ireland left the UK to become the
Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic).
From 1921 until 1972 Northern Ireland
had its own Parliament in which the
Unionists, primarily representing the
Protestant community, held a permanent
majority and formed the regional government.
The nationalist minority resented this
persistent domination and their effective
exclusion from political office and influence.
Between the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
civil rights movement and responses to it led
to serious inter-communal rioting. This led to
the introduction in 1969 of British Army
support for the police.
Because of increased terrorism and inter-
communal violence, the British Government
took over direct responsibility for law and
order in 1972. The Northern Ireland Unionist
Government resigned in protest at this
decision, the regional government was
abolished, and direct rule from Westminster
began. A Secretary of State was appointed
with a seat in the UK Cabinet and with overall
responsibility for the government of the
Province.
Political Change
The system of direct rule was never intended
to be permanent. Over the years, successive
British and Irish Governments have worked
closely together to bring peace to Northern
Ireland, recognising the need for new political
arrangements acceptable to both communities
in the Province.
In 1985, an Anglo-Irish Agreement
provided a new basis for relations between the
UK and the Irish Republic, creating an
Intergovernmental Conference in which to
discuss issues such as improved cross-border
co-operation and security. During the early
1990s, the British Government continued
bilateral talks with the Northern Ireland
parties and separately with the Irish
Government on matters of mutual interest
under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference.
In 1993 the British and Irish Governments
signed the Downing Street Declaration,
setting out their views on how a future
settlement might be achieved and restating the
fundamental principle that any constitutional
change would require the consent of a
majority of people in Northern Ireland.
Following the British General Election in
May 1997, the new Government confirmed its
intention of making the talks process as
inclusive as possible and maintained that any
agreement reached would have to have the
broad support of the parties representing each
of the main communities.
Multi-party talks held in Belfast in April
1998 concluded with what became known as
the ‘Good Friday Agreement’. Legislation was
passed at Westminster authorising a
referendum on the settlement in Northern
Ireland and permitting elections to a new
Northern Ireland Assembly. The Irish
Parliament also considered the Agreement and
passed legislation authorising a concurrent
referendum in the Irish Republic. In May
1998 referendums were held in both parts of
Ireland, and the Agreement received a clear
endorsement. Northern Ireland voted 71.1 per
cent in favour and 28.8 per cent against, while
in the Irish Republic the result was 94.3 per
cent and 5.6 per cent respectively.
A new Northern Ireland Assembly of 108
members was elected by proportional
representation (single transferable vote) in
June 1998 and met for the first time the
following month (see p. 17). Legislation to
implement the whole settlement, and formally
institute devolved administrative powers, was
introduced in the Westminster Parliament in
July 1998 and received Royal Assent in
November that year. The Northern Ireland
Act 1998 is intended to give legal effect to the
Good Friday Agreement. It sets out the
principle of consent to change in
constitutional status and makes the detailed
provision necessary for the future
administration of Northern Ireland, and new
arrangements on human rights and equality.
In December 1999, power was devolved by
the Westminster Parliament to the Northern
Ireland Assembly and its Executive
Committee of Ministers. At the same time the
North/South Ministerial Council,
North/South Implementation Bodies, British-
Irish Council and British-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference became fully
functioning institutions. However, in
16
3: NORTHERN IRELAND
February 2000, following publication of the
report of the Independent International
Commission on Decommissioning, the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
suspended the operations of the Assembly and
the institutions, owing to a lack of substantive
progress being made on decommissioning of
illegally held arms. After further talks between
all parties, a political settlement was reached
and devolved powers were restored to the
Assembly and the power-sharing institutions
in May 2000.
Government
Following devolution, the Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland remains responsible for
Northern Ireland Office matters not devolved
to the Assembly. These include matters such
as policing, security policy, prisons and
criminal justice. The Secretary of State
represents Northern Ireland interests in the
UK Cabinet.
Northern Ireland elects 18 Members of
Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons
and, by proportional representation, three of
the 87 UK representatives to the European
Parliament.

The Province’s 26 local government district
councils have limited executive functions. The
councils nominate locally elected
representatives to sit as members of the
various statutory bodies set up to administer
regional services, such as education and
libraries, health and personal social services,
drainage and fire services.
The Northern Ireland Assembly
The Assembly meets in Parliament Buildings
at Stormont, Belfast and is the prime source of
authority for all devolved responsibilities. It
has full legislative and executive authority,
which means it has the power to make laws
and take decisions on all the functions of the
new Northern Ireland Departments (see
p. 18).
At its first meeting in July 1998, the
Assembly elected, on a cross-community
basis, a First Minister and a Deputy First
Minister and appointed ten Ministers with
responsibility for the new Northern Ireland
Departments. Together, these 12 Ministers
make up the Executive Committee, which
meets to discuss and agree on issues which cut
across the responsibilities of two or more
Ministers. Its role is to prioritise executive
business and recommend a common position
where necessary.

The Executive’s main function is to plan
each year, and review as necessary, a
programme of government with an agreed
budget. This is subject to approval by the
Assembly, after scrutiny in Assembly
Committees, on a cross-community basis.
The Assembly has ten Statutory
Committees. Membership of Committees is in
broad proportion to party strengths in the
Assembly to ensure that the opportunity of
Committee places is available to all Members.
Each Committee has a scrutiny, policy
development and consultation role in relation
to its Department and a role in the initiation of
legislation.

Intergovernmental Dialogue
The North/South Ministerial Council brings
together those with executive responsibilities
in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government
to work on matters of mutual interest. The
Council meets on a regular basis to develop
consultation, co-operation and action on an
all-island and cross-border basis.
Six new North/South Implementation
Bodies, established by international agreement
18
3: NORTHERN IRELAND
between the British and Irish Governments,
came into effect in December 1999; their role is
to implement policies agreed by Ministers in
the North/South Ministerial Council. The new
bodies are: the Food Safety Promotion Board;
the Trade and Business Development Body;
the Special European Union Programmes
Body; the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights
Commission (dealing with marine matters); and
the North/South Language Body.
The British-Irish Council has been set up to
promote and develop good relationships among
the peoples of the United Kingdom and
Ireland. It comprises representatives of the
British and Irish Governments, the Northern
Ireland Assembly, the National Assembly for
Wales and the Scottish Parliament, and
delegates from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, who come together to address issues of
mutual interest. As a priority, the Council has
decided to examine and develop policies for co¬
operation on drugs, social exclusion, the
environment and transport. Other areas for
discussion will include agriculture, tourism,
culture, health, education, approaches to EU
issues, links between cities, towns and local
districts, sporting activity, and minority and
lesser used languages.
The British-Irish Intergovernmental
Conference replaces the Anglo-Irish
Intergovernmental Council and the
Intergovernmental Conference established
under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Its role
is to promote bilateral co-operation on matters of
mutual interest between the two governments.
A Civic Forum, consisting of 60 members
representative of the business, trade union,
voluntary and other sectors of the Northern
Ireland community, is to be established to act
as a consultative mechanism on social,
economic and cultural matters.
Human Rights and Equality
As in the rest of the United Kingdom, the
European Convention on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms will become
enshrined into Northern Ireland domestic law
when the Human Rights Act comes into force
in October 2000.
A commitment to the protection of human
rights and the promotion of equality was
central to the Good Friday Agreement. The
Northern Ireland Act 1998, which followed the
Agreement, established a new Equality
Commission and a Human Rights Commission.
The Act also strengthened the existing equality
legislation by imposing a new statutory equality
duty on all public authorities, requiring them to
be alert to the need to promote equal
opportunities and good community relations.
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
The Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission was created to advise government
and the Northern Ireland Assembly on human
rights issues, particularly on the need for
legislation to protect human rights. As part of
this work, the Commission has launched a
major consultative exercise on the scope for a
special Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.
Equality Commission for Northern Ireland
The Equality Commission was formed
following the amalgamation of the four former
equality bodies (which were responsible for
fair employment, equal opportunities, racial
equality and disability issues) in a move to
streamline the monitoring of equality issues in
Northern Ireland. As well as taking over the
work of its predecessors, the Commission is
responsible for enforcing the new statutory
equality duty.
The Parades Commission
The Parades Commission has full statutory
powers to help implement the Public
Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 over
contentious parades in Northern Ireland. In
the absence of local agreement on contentious
parades, the Commission may make legally
binding determinations, such as imposing
route conditions. The Commission imposed
route conditions on 152 such parades in the
year to 31 March 2000 out of a total of 3,403.
The vast majority of parades each year are
organised by the Protestant/Unionist
community, especially the ‘Loyal Orders’.
Most take place during the six months from
around Easter to the end of September.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Victims of Violence Commission
The Victims of Violence Commission looks at
possible ways of providing greater recognition
of the suffering felt by victims of violence
arising from the events of the last 30 years.
Following its report in May 1998, the
Government has announced a number of
support measures for victims, including an
independent review of criminal injuries
compensation arrangements.
Security Policy
The authorities have exceptional powers to
deal with and prevent terrorist activities,
including special powers of arrest for those
suspected of certain serious terrorist offences,
non-jury courts to try terrorist offences (see
p. 230) and the banning of terrorist
organisations (see p. 215).
Under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act
1998, a new office of Police Ombudsman was
established to provide an independent means
of impartially investigating complaints against
police officers in Northern Ireland and to react
to incidents perceived to be in the public
interest, even if no individual complaint has
been made. The Police Ombudsman designate
is expected to exercise full responsibilities
towards the end of 2000.
Policing and Justice
During 1999 an independent Policing
Commission under the chairmanship of the last
Governor of Hong Kong and former Northern
Ireland Minister, Chris Patten, reviewed the
future policing needs in Northern Ireland. The
Patten Commission was set up under the terms
of the Good Friday Agreement and it
published its report in September 1999. As a
result of its recommendations, the Government
brought forward the Police (Northern Ireland)
Bill, which, when enacted, would, among other
things:
• enhance accountability through a new
Policing Board;
9 create new district policing partnerships
to enhance local accountability;
• redress the severe religious imbalance in
the service between Protestants and
Catholics; and
• implement a new name and badge for the
Service.
In parallel with the work of the Patten
Commission, the Government carried out a
wide-ranging review of the criminal justice
system in Northern Ireland. The review
consulted political parties, interested bodies,
organisations and individuals, and published
its recommendations in March 2000. These
recommendations are subject to further
consultation.
The Economy
Throughout the 1990s the Northern Ireland
economy performed well. Employment grew
throughout the decade and unemployment has
declined since 1993. However, the Labour
Force Survey for March to May 2000 showed
that 64.9 per cent of those people of working
age in Northern Ireland were in employment,
compared with 74.6 per cent in the UK as a
whole. Comparable rates for unemployment
were 7.0 per cent and 5.6 per cent
respectively.
A substantial increase in new inward
investment in growth industries such as
computer software, telecommunications and
network services contributed to the 2,500 new
jobs generated by the Industrial Development
Board in 1999—2000.
Northern Ireland’s economic strategy has
been reviewed to take account of changing
needs by a largely private sector-led steering
group which drew on the input of 18 working
groups. The steering group report Strategy
2010—has been presented to the Northern
Ireland Assembly for its consideration.
The public expenditure allocation within
the Northern Ireland Executive’s
responsibility for 2000-01 is £5.3 billion.
Economic Assistance
In 1986 the British and Irish Governments
established the International Fund for Ireland.
Some three-quarters of the fund is spent in
Northern Ireland, the rest going to border
20

areas in the Irish Republic. Programmes cover
business enterprise, tourism, community
relations, urban development, agriculture and
rural development. Donors include the United
States, Canada, New Zealand and the
European Union. 1 he Berlin EU summit at
the end of March 1999 agreed a Special
Programme for Northern Ireland in support of
peace worth about £260 million between the
years 2000 and 2004. It also confirmed the
renewal for three years of EU support of
approximately £10 million a year for the
International Fund for Ireland.
Including funding from the new Special
Programme, Northern Ireland will receive
around £900 million under the EU Structural
Funds Programmes for the period 2000-06
(see p. 396). The priority areas eligible for
funding under the Community Support
Framework (CSF), which has been agreed
with the European Commission, are peace and
reconciliation; economic growth and renewal;
employment, human resource development
and social inclusion; balanced regional, urban
and rural development; and North/South and
wider co-operation. An indicative allocation of
7.5 per cent of the funds in the Northern
Ireland CSF has been set aside for North-
South co-operation.
The Irish Language
In July 1998 a statutory duty was placed on
the education authorities in Northern Ireland
to encourage and facilitate Irish-medium
education. In August 2000 there were eight
grant-aided schools teaching 1,423 primary
and secondary school pupils (out of a total of
334,000 in Northern Ireland) in Irish as the
first language. In addition, there were 13
independent schools teaching a further 284
pupils.
A new branch within the Northern Ireland
Civil Service has been established to develop
policy on linguistic diversity. Estimates
suggest that around 142,000 people in
Northern Ireland have some ability to use
Irish as a means of communication, either
orally or in writing. A cross-border
implementation body has been set up with
responsibility for promoting the Irish languagi
and facilitating and encouraging its use.

Scotland has a population of just over 5 million people, three-quarters of whom
live in the central lowlands. Its chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital), Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Dundee. The country contains large areas of unspoilt and wild
landscape, and many of the UK’s mountains, including its highest peak, Ben
Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft). , ,,
Scotland’s first Parliament for almost 300 years was officially opened by
Queen in July 1999. The Scottish Executive, headed by the First Minister, is
responsible for governing day-to-day Scottish affairs.
the
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain,
what is now Scotland was mainly inhabited by
the Piets. Despite a long campaign, Roman
rule never permanently extended to most of
Scotland. In the sixth century, the Scots from
Ireland settled in what is now Argyll, giving
their name to the present-day Scotland.
War between the kingdoms of England and
Scotland was frequent in the Middle Ages.
Despite reverses such as the defeat of William
Wallace’s uprising in 1298, Robert the Bruce’s
victory over Edward II of England at
Bannockburn in 1314 ensured the survival of a
separate kingdom of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded in
1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even so,
England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century, apart
from an enforced period of unification under
Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s, until in 1707
the English and Scottish Parliaments agreed
on a single Parliament for Great Britain.
Population
Scotland’s population has changed relatively
little in the last 50 years. In June 1999 the
estimated population was 5.1 million (see
Table 4.1), compared with 5.2 million in 1971
and 5.1 million in 1951. Population density
averages 66 people per sq km, the lowest
density in the UK.
Scottish Parliament and Executive
The Scotland Act 1998 provided the necessary
statutory framework to establish a Scottish
Parliament and Executive, which the majority
of Scottish people had endorsed by
referendum held in September 1997. Of those
who voted in the referendum, 74 per cent
supported the devolution proposition, and, on
a second question—whether to give the new

Parliament tax-varying powers—64 per cent
of voters were in favour.
In May 1999, 129 Members of the Scottish
Parliament (MSPs) were elected for a fixed
four-year term: 73 MSPs for single-member
constituencies and 56 MSPs representing
eight regions, based on the European
parliamentary constituencies, each with seven
members. The latter were allocated so that
each party’s overall share of seats in the
Parliament, including the constituency seats,
reflected its share of the regional vote. Under
the ‘additional member system’ of
proportional representation (PR), each elector
had two votes: one for a constituency MSP
and a ‘regional’ vote for a registered political
party or an individual independent candidate.
The Labour Party, which has traditionally
done well in elections in Scotland, is the largest
single party (see Table 4.2), with 55 MSPs, in
52 of the 73 constituency seats, including nearly
all those in central Scotland. The Scottish
National Party is the second largest party, with
35 MSPs. In the election, most of its seats came
from the ‘top-up’ PR system, as did all the 18
seats won by the Conservative Party, the third
largest party in the Parliament, although the
latter subsequently won its first constituency
seat in a by-election, taking the seat from the
Labour Party.
Responsibilities
The Scottish Parliament’s responsibilities
include health; education and training; local
government; housing; economic development;
many aspects of home affairs and civil and
criminal law; transport; the environment;
agriculture, fisheries and forestry; and sport
and the arts. In these areas, the Scottish
Parliament is able to amend or repeal existing
Acts of Parliament and to pass new legislation.
Responsibility for a number of other issues,
including overseas affairs, defence and
national security, overall economic and
monetary policy, employment legislation and
social security, remains with the UK
Government and Parliament as ‘reserved’
matters under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act
1998. The position of Secretary of State for
Scotland, with a seat in the Cabinet, continues
and carries responsibility for representing
Scottish interests within the UK Government
through the Scotland Office.
The Scottish Executive is responsible for
all public bodies whose functions and services

Work has begun on the production of a
Gaelic Dictionary of Procedural Terms to
be used in the Scottish Parliament, local
authorities and other key institutions in
Scotland. It will enable Gaelic to be more
easily used as a language of public debate
and administration, establishing a standard
terminology which can be adapted and
refined as necessary on a continuing basis.
Financial assistance for the project has
come from the Scottish Executive,
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the
Gaelic Language Promotion Trust and the
Gaelic Society of Inverness. The
dictionary is expected to be ready for use
early in 2001.
have been devolved and is accountable to the
Scottish Parliament for them. It also has an
input into bodies such as the Forestry
Commission (see p. 466), which operate in
Scotland and elsewhere in the UK.
At present, the Parliament meets at the
General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh’s Old
Town. A new permanent site for the
Parliament is planned at Holyrood, at the
other end of the Royal Mile—a street in the
historic centre of Edinburgh and the location
of Parliament House where the last Scottish
Parliament met from 1640 to 1707. The new
building is expected to be completed by the
end of 2002.
The Scottish Executive is headed by a First
Minister, normally the leader of the party able
to command majority support in the
Parliament. Following the 1999 election, the
Executive is being run by a partnership
between Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
with the latter having two seats in the Cabinet,
including that of Deputy First Minister. The
Cabinet comprises 11 positions:
• First Minister;
• Deputy First Minister and Minister for
Justice;
• Minister for Communities;
• Minister for Transport and the
Environment;
• Minister for Health and Community
Care;
• Minister for Rural Affairs;
• Minister for Children and Education;
• Lord Advocate;
• Minister for Parliament;
• Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning; and
• Minister for Finance.
Finance
The Scottish Parliament has a budget of ^16.9
billion in 2000—01, which is allocated, through
the Secretary of State for Scotland, by the UK
Parliament. Once the amount of the budget
has been determined, the Scottish Parliament
is free to allocate resources across the
expenditure programmes.
The Parliament has the power to increase or
decrease the basic rate of income tax—22 pence
in the pound—by a maximum of 3 pence.
Liability to tax is based on residence: a person
is considered resident if he or she is a UK
resident for tax purposes and either spends 50
per cent or more of the tax year in Scotland or
has his or her only or principal home there.
The Parliament is responsible for determining
the form of local taxation and, if it wishes, is able
to alter both the council tax and business rates.
Spending
The Budget Act 2000—an Act of the Scottish
Parliament—gave statutory authority to the
Scottish Executive to spend money out of the
Scottish Consolidated Fund in the financial
year 2000—01. It set out the purposes for
which financial resources can be used and the
maximum amounts which can be used for each
of the Executive’s spending programmes.
Priorities for spending include:
• the provision of nursery places for all
four year olds and progress towards a
target of places for all three year olds;
• £16 million to establish class sizes of 30
or under for primary school children
under the age of seven;
• £29 million to increase enrolments in
further education institutions;
25
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
• NHS Direct (see p. 189), more one-stop •
clinics, and electronic appointment
booking systems;
• the establishment of a Drug Enforcement
Agency;
• a new domestic violence fund to improve
a range of services including more refuge
spaces;
• proposals for two National Parks;
• improvements to living conditions of
low-income householders, especially
pensioners;
• five major trunk road schemes, with a •
total capital cost of £140 million over
three years; and
• £30 million spending from the Public
Transport Fund including the
Edinburgh cross rail project and bus
priority corridors in Glasgow.
The Economy
In the last 50 years the economy has moved
away from the traditional industries of coal,
steel and shipbuilding, with the establishment
of the offshore oil and gas industry, growth in
services and, more recently, developments in
high-technology industries, such as chemicals,
electronic engineering and information
technology. Manufacturing remains important,
and Scotland’s manufacturing exports were
provisionally estimated at £18.5 billion in 1999.
Notable features of the Scottish economy
include:
• Electronics. Scotland has one of the
biggest concentrations of the electronics
industry in Western Europe, employing
about 42,500 workers in 1997. Electrical
and instrument engineering exports were
provisionally worth £10 billion in 1999,
54 per cent of Scotland’s manufacturing
exports.
• Oil and gas. Offshore oil and gas
production has made a significant
contribution to the Scottish economy in
the last 30 years. Many of the UK’s 125
offshore oilfields are located to the east of
Shetland, Orkney or the east coast of
Scotland (see map at the back of the book).
Whisky. Whisky continues to be one of
Scotland’s most important industries.
There are 100 whisky distilleries in
operation, mostly in the north-east.
Whisky exports dominate exports by the
drinks industry, which were provisionally
valued at £1.5 billion in 1999.
Tourism. Tourism is a major industry,
supporting about 161,000 jobs. In 1999
expenditure by tourists in Scotland was
valued at £2.5 billion; there were 12.4
million tourist trips, including those
originating in Scotland.
Financial services. Funds managed by
financial institutions in Scotland were
worth some £277 billion in 1999, of
which £103.8 billion were in long-term
life insurance funds and £93.9 billion in
pension funds. Several financial
institutions are based in Scotland,
including insurance companies, fund
managers, unit trusts and investment
trusts. There are four Scottish-based
clearing banks, which have limited rights
to issue their own banknotes.
• Forestry. Scotland accounts for just under
half of the UK’s timber production. In the
last ten years there has been significant
international and local investment in
wood-based panel production and in pulp
and paper processing.
• Fishing. Fishing remains significant,
particularly in the north-east and the
Highlands and Islands. In 1999, Scotland
accounted for 69 per cent by weight and
61 per cent by value of the fish landed
in the UK by British vessels. Fish
farming, particularly of salmon, has
become much more important, and
Scotland produces the largest amount of
farmed salmon in the EU. However,
some fish farms have recently been
affected by a viral disease, Infectious
Salmon Anaemia, and measures are being
taken to eradicate it.
Support for industry and commerce is
managed by two bodies: Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see
p. 395). Inward investment is encouraged by
Locate in Scotland, a joint operation between
26
4: SCOTLAND
the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise.
In 1999-2000, 91 inward investment projects
were recorded, which are expected to lead to
investment of £650 million and the creation or
safeguarding of over 19,000 jobs.
The Labour Force Survey for March to
May 2000 showed that 72.3 per cent of those
people of working age in Scotland were in
employment, compared with 74.6 per cent in
the UK as a whole. Comparable rates for
unemployment were 7.6 per cent and 5.6 per
cent respectively.
Legal System
The principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system (see p. 226) differ in many respects
from those of England and Wales. These
differences stem, in part, from the adoption of
elements from medieval canon law and selective
borrowing from other European legal systems,
based on Roman law, during the 16th century.
Preservation of Scots law and the Scottish
Courts was provided for in the 1707 Treaty of
Union. In addition to separate courts and a
separate legal profession, Scotland has its own
prosecution, prison and police services.
Education and Culture
The Scottish education system has a number
of distinctive features (see chapter 10),
including a separate system of examinations
and differences in the curriculum. A new
system of courses and awards for education
after 16, ‘Higher Still’, started to be phased in
from August 1999, and is expected to be fully
implemented in 2003. Record numbers of
students are entering post-compulsory
education—about 546,000 students were

adults with incapacity—some of the most
vulnerable members of society.
enrolled in vocational, further or higher
education in 1998-99.
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin,
is spoken by some 70,000 people, many of
whom live in the Hebrides. The Scottish
Executive is providing £12.5 million to
support Gaelic in 2000-01. Broadcasting is the
largest single area, accounting for £8.5
million. In 1999-2000 there were 1,831
children in Gaelic-medium education in 59
primary schools and 232 pupils in 13
secondary schools. Extra resources are being
allocated to supporting Gaelic education and
cultural organisations. (See also box on p. 25.)
The annual Edinburgh Festival is one of
the world’s leading cultural events. Held in
August and September, it brings about £100
million into the Scottish economy each year,
and the International Festival, Jazz Festival,
Festival Fringe, Book Festival, Film Festival
and Military Tattoo combine to make the
Edinburgh Festival the largest arts festival in
the UK. Scotland possesses several major
collections of the fine and applied arts, such as
the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in
Edinburgh. A new Museum of Scotland has
been built in Edinburgh to house the National
Museums’ Scottish Collection.

Wales (or Cymru in the Welsh language) has a population of 2.9 million people,
about two-thirds of whom live in the southern valleys and the lower-lying
coastal areas. The chief urban centres are the capital, Cardiff (with a
population of 324,000), Swansea and Newport in the south and Wrexham in the
north. Much of Wales is hilly or mountainous with the highest peak being \r
Wyddfa (Snowdon) at 1,085 m (3,560 ft).
In July 1999 the National Assembly for Wales, set up to give the Welsh people
greater control over their own affairs, took on virtually all the functions
formerly exercised by the Welsh Office and the Secretary of State for Wales.
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule (see p. 4),
Wales remained a Celtic stronghold, although
during Norman times often under the
influence of England. In 1282 Edward I
completed a successful campaign to bring
Wales under English rule. T he great castles
that he built in north Wales remain among the
UK’s finest historic monuments. Edward I’s
eldest son—later Edward II—was born at
Caernarfon in 1284 and was created Prince of
Wales. The title has been given to the eldest
son of successive reigning monarchs ever
since.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
culminated in the unsuccessful rising led by
Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542
united England and Wales administratively,
politically and legally.
National Assembly for Wales
In a referendum held in May 1997,
government proposals for devolution in Wales
were endorsed by a narrow majority of the
Welsh people—50.3 per cent of those who
voted were in favour and 49.7 per cent were
against. The Government of Wales Act 1998
subsequentlv provided the necessary statutory
framework to establish a National Assembly
for Wales.
Electors had two votes in the first elections
to the Assembly, which took place in May
1999: one for a candidate in their local
constituency and one for a party list. The
Assembly comprises 60 members: 40 from
local constituencies (covering the same areas
as those for Welsh seats in the House of
Commons) and 20 elected by the additional
member system of proportional representation
from electoral regions—four for each of the
five former European parliamentary
constituencies in Wales.

The Labour Party has traditionally had
strong support in Wales. It has the largest
number of seats in the Assembly (see Table
5.2)—although in the election it did not obtain
an overall majority. Since October 2000 it has
run the Assembly in partnership with the
Liberal Democrats.
Responsibilities
In July 1999 the Assembly took over most of
the functions formerly held by the Secretary
of State for Wales. These include
responsibilities for economic development;
agriculture, forestry, fisheries and food;
education and training; industry; local
government; health and personal social
services; housing; the environment; planning;
transport and roads; arts, culture and the
Welsh language; ancient monuments and
historic buildings; and sport and recreation.
Its budget for 2000—01 is £8 billion.
Foreign affairs, defence, taxation, overall
economic policy, social security and
broadcasting are the main functions for which
responsibility has remained with the
Government in London. The office of
Secretary of State for Wales continues,
although his or her functions have changed
considerably. The post holder retains a seat in
the Cabinet and has responsibility for primary
legislation, bidding for the Assembly’s budget
and representing Welsh interests in the
Westminster Parliament. As part of the UK,
Wales retains full constituency representation
in the Parliament in London.
30
5: WALES
The Assembly has powers to make
secondary legislation (see p. 49) to meet
distinctive Welsh circumstances. It is based in
Cardiff Bay, initially meeting in a temporary
chamber until an adjacent new Chamber and
associated facilities are opened in 2003.
The First Secretary heads the Assembly
and in February 2000 he appointed a Cabinet
of eight Assembly Secretaries. Their
responsibilities are:
• local government and housing;
• education (of children up to age 16);
• health and social services;
• post-16 education and training, Welsh
language and culture;
• agriculture and rural development;
• environment (incorporating transport
and planning);
• trefnydd (business secretary); and
• finance.
The First Secretary is currently responsible
for economic development, industry and
European matters.
The Assembly is responsible for a number
of public bodies. The organisations with the
largest expenditure are:
• the Higher Education Funding Council
for Wales (with planned gross
expenditure in 2000-01 of £293 million);
• the Welsh Development Agency (WDA,
see p. 355) (£179 million); and
• the Further Education Funding Council
for Wales (£213 million).
Local Government
The 22 unitary authorities (see map opposite)
have collective responsibility for spending
over a third of the Assembly’s budget. The
National Assembly has a responsibility for
setting the framework of policy and of
A Better Wales—The Assembly Cabinet’s 10-
year Strategy for Improving the Quality of Life
in Wales
In January 2000, the Assembly Cabinet
published its strategic plan for improving life
in Wales: A Better Wales. The ten-year
strategy is built round five key areas:
opportunities for learning; a stronger
economy; better health and wellbeing;
quality of life; and better, simpler
government.
As well as the long-term aims, A Better
Wales set out more than 100 targets for
achievement by the end of the current
Assembly (2003), and the actions needed to
achieve them. Among these targets are:
• no infant classes with more than 30
pupils, by September 2001;
• fewer than one-third of pupils leaving
school without a qualification;
• at least seven out of eight adults having
qualifications;
• a 10 per cent increase in the number of
Welsh exporting companies;
• 40,000 net additional jobs;
• at least 50 per cent of Welsh
companies using electronic commerce
(e-commerce);
• a 5 per cent increase in the number of
jobs in dairy, lamb and beef processing;
• 1 million more tourism trips;
• a cut in the death rate for breast
cancer and in the rate at which
invasive cervical cancer occurs;
• better management of hospital waiting
times, within 12 months;
• a rail strategy for Wales, including
better north-south links;
• a new, more co-ordinated approach to
improving the most disadvantaged
Welsh communities;
• a higher profile for Welsh culture,
language, arts and sport;
• savings of at least £80 million through
a more modern approach by the
public sector to buying goods and
services; and
• fairer funding arrangements for local
government and the National Health
Service.
31
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
secondary legislation within which local
government operates. It also has a
responsibility to ensure that local decision¬
making reflects the requirements of the law
and, where appropriate, priorities determined
by the National Assembly. Measures to
modernise local authority management
structures, strengthen local democracy and
improve local financial accountability were
contained in the Local Government Act 2000,
which the Assembly will implement in Wales.
A Partnership Council has been set up
comprising elected representatives of all
sectors of local government (including
representatives of the National Parks, police
and fire authorities and community councils)
and the National Assembly. It will enable local
government to advise the National Assembly
on all aspects of its functions, make
representations to the National Assembly and
assist in the preparation of guidance and
advice to councils.
Welsh Language
In 1997, 21 per cent of the population in
private households said that they spoke Welsh.
In much of the rural north and west, Welsh
remains the first language.
Welsh is now more widely used for official
purposes, and is treated equally with English in
the work of the Assembly. It is also quite
extensively used in broadcasting, while most
road signs are bilingual. Welsh-medium
education in schools is encouraged. Welsh is
taught—as a first or second language—to most
pupils between the ages of 5 and 16, and from
September 2000 will be taught to all pupils in
this age group. In addition, other subjects are
taught in Welsh in about 500 schools, in both
the primary and secondary sectors.
The National Assembly has assumed the
main responsibility for enhancing Welsh
culture and developing greater use of the
Welsh language. The Welsh Language Act
1993 established the principle that, in public
business and the administration of justice in
Wales, Welsh and English should have equal
treatment. The Welsh Language Board aims
to promote and facilitate the use of the Welsh
language; in 2000-01 its gross expenditure will
be £6 million.
Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the Welsh economy, which
traditionally used to be based on coal and
steel. Wales now has a more diverse range of
manufacturing industries, including many at
the forefront of technology, and a growing
number involved in e-commerce. However,
the steel industry remains important, and
crude steel production in Wales was around
6.1 million tonnes in 1998, accounting for 42
per cent of UK steel output.
The Labour Force Survey for March to
May 2000 showed that 69.7 per cent of people
of working age in Wales were in employment,
compared with 74.6 per cent in the UK as a
whole. Comparable rates for unemployment
were 6.5 per cent and 5.6 per cent
respectively. As part of the Better Wales
strategic plan (see p. 31), the National
Assembly has set a target for an additional
40,000 jobs to be created in Wales before the
end of its first term of office (2003).
Manufacturing accounts for 28 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales, well
above the UK average. Wales is an important
centre for consumer and office electronics,
automotive components, chemicals and
materials, aerospace, and food and drink.
Around 30,500 people are employed in the
optical and electrical industries, and 11,900 in
the automotive components sector. In the service
sector, tourism and leisure services are
significant—estimates indicate that about 9.8
million tourist trips were made to Wales in
1998—while call centre activity is becoming
more important and prevalent.
A key feature of the economy has been the
volume of investment from overseas
companies and from elsewhere in the UK.
Since 1983, over 2,000 inward investment
projects have been recorded in Wales,
bringing in a total investment of £13.2 billion
and promising the creation and safeguarding
of nearly 204,000 jobs. Overseas-owned
manufacturing companies in Wales employ in
excess of 75,000 people.
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA)
has been given broader functions and powers,
so that it is now better placed to contribute to
economic regeneration across the whole of
Wales. Increased resources are being provided
32
5: WALES
to support business development, and a new
Entrepreneurship Action Plan for Wales is
being co-ordinated by the WDA, to develop a
stronger business culture.
Environment
Wales has a rich and diverse natural heritage.
About one-quarter is designated as a National
Park or Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
(see p. 315). As well as three National Parks—
Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the
Pembrokeshire Coast—and five Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, there are two
national trails, 36 country parks and large
stretches of heritage coast. There are also 62
National Nature Reserves, over 900 Sites of
Special Scientific Interest and a number of
internationally important nature conservation
sites in Wales. For example, 44 sites are
proposed for designation as Special Areas of
Conservation under the European Community
(EC) Habitat Directive, 13 Special Protection
Areas are classified under the EC Wild Birds
Directive, and ten wetlands of international
importance are designated under the Ramsar
Convention (see p. 320). There are six
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (see p. 459),
representing about 25 per cent of the land in
Wales, while a new scheme, Tir Gofal,
introduced in 1999—2000, replaced most of the
current agri-environment schemes. Tir Gofal
aims to encourage agricultural practices that
will help to protect and enhance the landscape
and wildlife of the Welsh countryside.
The quality of bathing waters on the
coastline of Wales has reached an all-time
record for compliance with European
standards. National standards for river quality
in Wales showed that nearly 99 per cent of
rivers were classified as ‘good’ or ‘fair’ in 1999.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature has a long tradition and can
claim to be one of the oldest in Europe. The
Welsh people have strong musical traditions
and Wales is well known for its choral singing,
while both the Welsh National Opera and the
BBC National Orchestra of Wales have
international reputations. Special festivals,
known as eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh
literature and music. The largest is the annual
Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Artists from all over
the world come to Llangollen for the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod. The
biennial ‘Cardiff Singer of the World’
competition has established itself as one of the
world’s leading singing competitions.
The National Museums and Galleries of
Wales include the Museum of Welsh Life at
St Fagans, near Cardiff; and the recently
rebuilt Welsh Slate Museum at Llanberis.
The main building in Cardiff contains many
paintings by Welsh artists, including Augustus
John, Gwen John and Kyffyn Williams as well
as a representative collection of other
important artistic works. A new Industrial and
Maritime Museum is to be built in Swansea.
The National Library of Wales at
Aberystwyth contains over 4 million books.
An active local press includes several Welsh
and English language publications. The fourth
television broadcaster, Sianel Pedwar Cymru
(S4C), has recently been broadcasting in Welsh
for 12 hours a day on its new digital channel.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. Wales staged the final of the
Rugby World Cup in November 1999 at the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

Britain’s system of parliamentary government is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual evolution over many centuries. The
Monarchy itself can be traced back for more than a thousand years, while
Parliament is one of the oldest representative assemblies in the world. The
present Government is engaging in a wide-ranging programme to decentralise
power, open up government, reform Parliament and increase individual rights.
A Scottish Parliament, a National Assembly for Wales and a Northern Ireland
Assembly have taken up their devolved powers to govern their own domestic
affairs. In May 2000 elections were held for a Mayor and Assembly for London
and the new Greater London Authority came into being in July. The first stage of
reforming the House of Lords has taken place and proposals have been made to
hold a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons.
The Constitution
The United Kingdom does not have a
constitution set out in any single document.
Instead its constitution is made up of statute
law, common law and conventions.'
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement, so it is
adaptable to changing political conditions.
The UK Parliament is the legislature and the
supreme authority. The executive consists of:
the Government—the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for policies; government
1 Conventions are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as indispensable to the
working of government.
departments and agencies, responsible for
national administration; devolved
administrations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland; local authorities, responsible
for many local services; public corporations,
responsible for operating particular nationalised
industries; independent bodies responsible for
regulating the privatised industries; and other
bodies subject to ministerial control.
The judiciary (see chapter 14) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
Origins of Government
The United Kingdom comprises England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each
with its own distinct culture and history.
34
6: GOVERNMENT
England was united as a kingdom over a
thousand years ago, and Wales became part of
the kingdom during the reign of King Henry
VIII (see p. 28). The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynasdcally united in 1603, and
in 1707 legislation passed in the two countries
provided for the establishment of a single
Parliament of Great Britain with supreme
authority both in England and Wales, and in
Scotland (see p. 22).
Ireland had links with the kingdom of
England since the 13th century, and in 1801 the
creation of the United Kingdom was completed
by a union joining the Irish Parliament to that of
Great Britain (see p. 15). In 1922 Southern
Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became an
entirely separate and self-governing country.
The six counties of Northern Ireland had been
given their own subordinate Parliament in 1920,
and voted to remain within the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Parliament and
assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland are
now operational (see below), the UK
Parliament in Westminster still has an elected
chamber comprising members from English,
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish
constituencies. It therefore represents people
sharing very varied backgrounds and traditions,
and retains ultimate authority for government
and law-making in the UK (see p. 47).
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Affairs
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland have different systems of law, different
judiciaries, different education systems and
different systems of local government.
Following devolution, the powers of the
Secretaries of State for Scotland, for Wales
and for Northern Ireland have been greatly
reduced and now the main functions of these
Cabinet members are to ensure that the
reserved interests of the parts of the UK they
represent are recognised and promoted in
central government and that the devolution
settlements work satisfactorily.
Background to Devolution
Referendums held in Scotland and Wales in
1997 endorsed proposals to devolve power
from Parliament at Westminster to a Scottish
Parliament (see p. 22) and a National
Assembly for Wales (see p. 28). Legislation
was passed in 1998 to establish these bodies,
and elections were held in May 1999.
The Scottish Parliament has law-making
powers, including defined and limited
financial authority to vary tax revenue. It has
taken democratic control over most of the
responsibilities formerly exercised by The
Scottish Office, including health, education,
justice, local transport, agriculture and the
environment. The National Assembly for
Wales exercises democratic control over the
former Welsh Office functions. It has
secondary legislative powers and can reform
and control the Welsh public bodies for which
it is responsible. The National Assembly is
responsible for a similar range of policy areas
as the Scottish Parliament. The main
difference is that justice matters in Wales
remain the responsibility of the UK
Government.
A comprehensive agreement on a political
settlement for Northern Ireland—the Good
Friday Agreement—was reached in 1998.
Following a referendum endorsing the
Agreement, elections to a new Northern
Ireland Assembly were held in June that year.
The Assembly first assumed its powers in
December 1999, although it was temporarily
suspended between February and May 2000
(see p. 17). The responsibilities of the
Executive Committee cover similar areas as
those in Scotland. However, legislation on
justice matters needs the consent of the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
The responsibilities of the UK
Government over economic and monetary
policy, employment, overseas affairs,
defence and national security remain
unchanged.
Human Rights
The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the
European Convention on Human Rights into
domestic law, enabling the British courts to
deal with these issues and not just the
European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg (see chapter 14).

The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. Queen Elizabeth II is herself
directly descended from King Egbert, who
united England under his rule in 829. The
only interruption in the history of the
Monarchy was the republic, which lasted from
1649 to 1660.
The Queen’s title in the UK is: ‘Elizabeth
the Second, by the Grace of God of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
36
6: GOVERNMENT
Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the Monarchy is in the
UK, the Queen is also Sovereign of a number of
Commonwealth countries.2 In each of these the
Queen is represented by a Governor-General,
appointed by her on the advice of the ministers
of the country concerned and completely
independent of the British Government.
In UK Overseas Territories (see p. 75) the
Queen is usually represented by governors,
who are responsible to the British
Government for the administration of the
countries concerned.
Succession, Accession and Coronation
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved. Sons of the Sovereign still have
precedence over daughters in succeeding to the
throne. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen Regnant, and has the same powers as a
king. The consort of a king takes her husband’s
rank and style, becoming Queen. The
constitution does not give any special rank or
privileges to the husband of a Queen Regnant.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700, only
Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia, the
Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James
I of England and VI of Scotland), are eligible to
succeed. The order of succession can be altered
only by common consent of the countries of the
Commonwealth of which the Monarch is
Sovereign.
2 The other Commonwealth states of which the Queen is
Sovereign are: Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; The
Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Canada; Grenada; Jamaica;
New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; St Kitts and Nevis; St
Lucia; St Vincent and the Grenadines; Solomon Islands;
and Tuvalu.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as
soon as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed at
an Accession Council, to which all members of
the Privy Council (see p. 39) are summoned.
Members of the House of Lords (see p. 41), the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen and other leading
citizens of the City of London are also invited.
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey in
London, in the presence of representatives of
the Houses of Parliament and of all the major
public organisations in the UK. The Prime
Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations and representatives of
other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is
head of the executive, an integral part of the
legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. As a result of
a long process of evolution, during which the
Monarchy’s absolute power has been
progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the
advice of her government ministers. The UK
is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in
the name of the Queen.
Within this framework the Queen still takes
part in some important acts of government.
These include summoning, proroguing
(discontinuing until the next session without
dissolution) and dissolving Parliament; and
giving Royal Assent to Bills passed by
Parliament. The Queen formally appoints
important office holders, including the Prime
Minister and other government ministers (see
p. 53), judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, diplomats, bishops and some other
senior clergy of the Church of England. She is
also involved in pardoning people wrongly
convicted of crimes; and in conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours.3 In
3 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on
tne advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the
Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
37
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
international affairs the Queen, as Head of
State, has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign states, to conclude
treaties and to annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now performed
by government ministers, who are responsible
to Parliament and can be questioned about
particular policies. It is not necessary to have
Parliament’s authority to exercise these
prerogative powers, although Parliament may
restrict or abolish such rights.
The Queen holds Privy Council meetings
(see p. 39), gives audiences to her ministers
and officials in the UK and overseas, receives
accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She is
consulted on many aspects of national life, and
must show complete impartiality.
The law provides for a regent to be
appointed to perform the royal functions if the
monarch is totally incapacitated. The regent
would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those, in order of succession to
the throne, aged 18 or over. In the event of her
partial incapacity or absence abroad, the
Queen may delegate certain royal functions to
the Counsellors of State (her husband the
Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in
line of succession, and the Queen Mother).
However, Counsellors of State may not
dissolve Parliament (except on the Queen’s
instructions) or create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremony has always been associated with the
British monarchy, and many traditional
ceremonies continue to take place. Royal
marriages and funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
or head of state visits the UK and investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland and Cardiff Castle
in Wales to bestow honours.
Each year the Queen and other members of
the Royal Family visit many parts of the UK.
They are also closely involved in the work of
many charities. For example, the Prince of
Wales is actively involved in The Prince’s
Trust, set up to encourage small firms and
self-employment in inner cities, while the
Princess Royal is President of the Save the
Children Fund. The Queen pays state visits to
foreign governments, accompanied by the
Duke of Edinburgh. She also tours the other
countries of the Commonwealth.
Royal Income and Expenditure
The expenditure arising from the Queen’s
official duties is met by a payment from public
funds known as the Civil List, and by
government departments which meet the cost
of, for example, royal travel (£16 million in
1999-2000) and the upkeep of the royal
palaces and media and information services
(£8.5 million in 1999-2000). In return, the
Queen has surrendered the hereditary
revenues to the Government (£133 million in
1999-2000).
In July 2000 a Royal Trustees’ Report
recommended that Civil List payments should
remain at the 1991 level of £7.9 million a year
for a further ten years from 2001. About
three-quarters of the Queen’s Civil List
provision is required to meet the cost of staff.
Under the Civil List, the Queen Mother and
the Duke of Edinburgh receive annual
parliamentary allowances (together amounting
to £1 million) to enable them to carry out their
public duties. The Prince of Wales does not
receive a parliamentary annuity, since as Duke
of Cornwall he is entitled to the annual net
revenues of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall.
The Queen’s private expenditure as
Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which
is financed mainly from the revenues of the
Duchy of Lancaster;4 her expenditure as a
private individual is met from her own
personal resources.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid
income tax on all personal income and on that
part of the Privy Purse income which is used
4 The Duchy of Lancaster is a landed estate which has
been held in trust for the Sovereign since 1399. It is kept
quite apart from his or her other possessions and is
separately administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster.

for private purposes. The Queen also pays tax
on any realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. In line with these
changes, the Prince of Wales pays income tax
on the income from the Duchy of Cornwall so
far as it is used for private purposes.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the King’s Court,
which assisted the Norman monarchs in
running the government. As the system of
Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, however, much of the role of the
Privy Council was assumed by the Cabinet
(which is still, technically, a committee of
Privy Counsellors), although the Council
retained certain executive functions. Some
government departments originated as
committees of the Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is as a mechanism through which
ministers advise the Queen on the approval of
Orders in Council (which are made under
prerogative powers, such as Orders approving
the grant of Royal Charters of incorporation;
and under statutory powers, which enact
subordinate legislation). Responsibility for
each Order, however, rests with the minister
responsible for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she is present at
the meeting where approval is given.
It is also through the Privy Council that
ministers advise the Sovereign on the issue of
royal proclamations, such as those summoning
or dissolving Parliament. Ministers, as ‘Lords
of the Privy Council’, also have their own
statutory responsibilities, which are
independent of the powers of the Sovereign in
Council. These include supervising the
registration authorities of the medical and
allied professions.
There are about 500 Privy Counsellors at
any one time since appointment as a Privy
Counsellor is for life. Members consist of all
members of the Cabinet, other senior
politicians, senior judges and some
appointments from the Commonwealth. It is
only members of the government of the day,
however, who play any part in its policy work.
Membership is accorded by the Sovereign on
recommendation of the Prime Minister; Privy
Counsellors are entitled to be styled ‘Right
Honourable’.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees which normally comprise those
ministers with the relevant policy interest.
These include prerogative committees, such as
those dealing with legislation from the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and with
petitions for charters of incorporation.
Committees may also be provided for by
statute, such as those for the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge and the Scottish
universities. Except for the Judicial
Committee, membership is confined to
members of the current administration.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is primarily the final court of appeal
from courts in UK Overseas Territories and
those Commonwealth countries which
retained this avenue of appeal after
independence. The Committee also hears
appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, and from the disciplinary and health
committees of the medical and allied
professions. It is also the Supreme Court for
determining cases which bear on the powers
and actions of the devolved administrations It
has a limited jurisdiction to hear certain
ecclesiastical appeals. The members of the
Judicial Committee include the Lord
Chancellor, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
other Privy Counsellors who hold or have held
high judicial office and certain judges from the
Commonwealth.
The secretariat of the Privy Council is the
Privy Council Office, a government
department of which the President of the
Council, a Cabinet minister, is in charge.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of their
39
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
own revenue. If extra resources were needed for
an emergency, such as a war, the Sovereign
would seek to persuade his barons in the Great
Council—a gathering of leading men which met
several times a year—to grant aid. During the
13th century several English kings found the
private revenues and baronial aids insufficient to
meet the expenses of government. They
therefore summoned not only the great feudal
magnates but also representatives of counties,
cities and towns, primarily to get their assent to
extraordinary taxation. In this way the Great
Council came to include those who were
summoned by name (those who, broadly
speaking, were to form the House of Lords) and
those who were representatives of
communities—the Commons. The two parts,
together with the Sovereign, became known as
‘Parliament’ (the term originally meant a
meeting ior parley or discussion).
Over the course of time the Commons began
to realise the strength of its position. By the
middle of the 14th century the formula had
appeared which in substance was the same as
that used nowadays in voting supplies to the
Crown—that is, money to the Government—
namely, ‘by the Commons with the advice of the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal’. In 1407 Henry
IV pledged that henceforth all money grants
should be approved by the House of Commons
before being considered by the Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent ol his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions, the
Commons gained the right to submit
collective petitions. During the 15th century
they gained the right to participate in giving
their requests—their ‘Bills’—the form of law.
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century led to
Parliament securing its position as the
supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Sovereign, the House of
Lords and the elected House of Commons—
are constituted on different principles. They
meet together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the State Opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Sovereign to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Sovereign is given as a matter of course.
Parliament can legislate for the UK as a
whole, and retains the powers to legislate for
any parts of it separately. It has, however,
undertaken not to legislate on devolved
matters without the agreement of the devolved
legislatures. Under devolution, it retains
responsibility for ‘reserved matters’ in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (see
p. 35) under the Acts of Parliament which set
up the administrations in these parts of the
UK. In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man, which are Crown dependencies and not
part of the UK, legislation on domestic
matters normally takes the form of laws
enacted by Island legislatures, but UK laws
are sometimes extended to the Islands, with
their agreement, for example in areas such as
immigration and broadcasting.
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases, subject to the UK’s
obligations as a member of the European
Union (EU—see p. 69). It can make or change
law, and overturn established conventions or
turn them into law. It can even prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without
consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The House
of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and during the 20th century the
House of Lords increasingly recognised the
supremacy of the elected chamber. The
system of party government helps to ensure
that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
40
6: GOVERNMENT
• to provide (by voting for taxation) the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is
also informed before important international
treaties and agreements are ratified. The
making of treaties is, however, a royal
prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice General Elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by legislation
in rare circumstances such as the two world
wars. Dissolution of Parliament and writs for a
General Election are ordered by the Sovereign
on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Westminster Parliament is
divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for
one year—normally beginning and ending in
October or November. There are
‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at
Christmas, Easter and the late Spring Bank
Holiday, and during a long summer break
usually starting in late July. The average
number of ‘sitting’ days in a session is about
168 in the House of Commons and about 154
in the House of Lords.5 At the start of each
session the Sovereign’s speech to Parliament
outlines the Government’s policies and
proposed legislative programme. Each session
is ended by prorogation. Parliament then
‘stands prorogued’ for a few days until the
new session opens. Prorogation brings to an
end nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been

unless the Opposition has agreed they may be
carried over to complete their passage the
following session.
The House of Lords
Reform
The Government has begun a step-by-step
reform of the House of Lords aimed at making
the second chamber more representative of
British society at the start of the 21st century.
As a first step, the Government has:
• reduced the number of hereditary peers
who have the right to sit and vote in the
second chamber from over 750 to 92 (see
p. 42); and
• reformed arrangements for the
nomination of life peers, including
setting up an independent Appointments
Commission; this is an advisory non-
departmental public body with two main
functions: to make recommendations for
non-party peers and to vet for propriety
all nominations for peerages, including
those from the political parties.
In January 2000 the Royal Commission on
the Reform of the House of Lords (chaired by
Lord Wakeham) published its report A Home for
the Future. The report rejected calls for a wholly
elected upper chamber and recommended a
reformed house of around 550 people with:
• a significant minority of regional
members, chosen to reflect the views of
regional electorates;
• representatives drawn from all sectors of
society;
• a statutory minimum proportion (30 per
cent) of women and of men;
• fair representation for members of ethnic
minority groups; and
• a broader range of religious
representation.

The present Lords Temporal consist of:
• 92 hereditary peers, who were selected to
sit in the transitional chamber by ballot
from among the membership of the
former House of Lords;
• life peers created to assist the House in its
judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or Taw
lords’);6 and
• all other life peers.
In December 1999 there were 105 women
peers, and 27 Taw lords’ (created under the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876).
Life peerages are created by the Sovereign on
the advice of the Prime Minister. From autumn
2000, the interim Appointments Commission
will have initial responsibility in respect of those
people who offer useful advice but do not wish
to be involved in party politics. Such peerages
are usually granted in recognition of service in
politics or other walks of public life or because
one of the political parties wishes to have the
recipient in the House of Lords.
Three main political parties are represented
in the transitional House of Lords; the number
of peers eligible to sit and declaring party
allegiance at July 2000 is shown in Table 6.1.

Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack7 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
In the Lord Chancellor’s absence, his place is
taken by a deputy.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk of
the Parliaments is responsible for the records of
proceedings of the House of Lords and for the
text of Acts of Parliament. The postholder is the
accounting officer for the House, and is in
charge of its administrative staff, known as the
Parliament Office. The Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod, usually known simply as ‘Black
Rod’, is responsible for security,
accommodation and services in the House of
Lords’ part of the Palace of Westminster.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see p. 43) and
consists of 659 Members of Parliament (MPs).
In June 2000 there were 122 women MPs and
nine MPs from ethnic minorities. Of the 659
seats, 529 are for England, 40 for Wales, 72 for

Scotland, and 18 for Northern Ireland. The
number of Scottish seats is being reviewed in
the light of the powers now devolved to the
Scottish Parliament (see chapter 4).
General Elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign. When an MP
dies or resigns,8 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £48,371 (from April 2000)
and an office costs allowance (from April
2000) of up to £51,572. Other allowances
include travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial
members, subsistence allowances and
allowances for second homes. (For ministers’
salaries see p. 54.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is
the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over
the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who act as Deputy Speakers. They
are elected by the House on the nomination of
the Government but are drawn from the
Opposition as well as the government party.
They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity (when
deputising for the Speaker). Responsibility for
the administration of the House rests with the
House of Commons Commission, a statutory
body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker on
the House’s privileges and procedures. The
Clerk’s other responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
certain orders of the House. The postholder is
also the official housekeeper of the Commons’

part of the building, and is responsible for
security. Other officers serve the House in the
Library, the Department of the Official
Report (Hansard), the Finance and
Administration Department, and the
Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes the UK is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. To ensure
that constituency electorates are kept roughly
equal, four permanent Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions, one each for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, keep constituencies under review.
They recommend any adjustment of seats that
may seem necessary in the light of population
movements or other changes. Reviews are
conducted every eight to 12 years. The
recommendations in the Commissions’ last
general reviews were approved by Parliament
in 1995. The Parliamentary Boundary
Commission for England has begun a general
review and aims to produce its report at the
end of 2005.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and citizens of the
Irish Republic resident in the UK, may vote in
parliamentary elections provided they are:
• aged 18 or over;
• included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency; and
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote.
People not entitled to vote include people
under 18, members of the House of Lords,
foreign nationals (other than Commonwealth
citizens or citizens of the Irish Republic),
some patients detained under mental health
legislation, sentenced prisoners and people
convicted within the previous five years of
corrupt or illegal election practices. Members
of the armed forces, Crown servants and staff
of the British Council employed overseas
(together with their wives or husbands if
accompanying them) may be registered for an
43
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
address in the constituency where they would
live but for their service. British citizens living
abroad may apply to register as electors for a
period of up to 20 years after they have left
the UK.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors who
cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station on polling
day—for example, electors away on holiday—
may apply for an absent vote at a particular
election. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work or because
they have moved to a new area may apply for
an absent vote. People entitled to an absent
vote may vote by post or by proxy, although
postal ballot papers cannot be sent to
addresses outside the UK.
Voting is not compulsory; 71.5 per cent of a
total electorate of 44.2 million people voted in
the General Election in May 1997. The simple
majority system of voting is currently used.
Candidates are elected if they have more votes
than any of the other candidates (although not
necessarily an absolute majority over all other
candidates). The Government proposes to
hold a referendum on the voting system for
the House of Commons.
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people who have been sentenced to more than
one year’s imprisonment; clergy of the Church
of England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers;
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975.
A candidate’s nomination for election must
be proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors. Candidates do
not have to be backed by a political party. A
candidate must also deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5 per cent or
more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a general election campaign is £4,965 plus
4.2 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 5.6 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. Higher limits have been
set for by-elections in order to reflect the fact
that they are often regarded as tests of national
opinion in the period between General
Elections. The maximum sum is £19,863 plus
16.9 pence for each elector in borough seats,
and 22.2 pence for each elector in county
seats. A candidate may post an election
communication to each elector in the
constituency free of charge. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory
maximum.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
constitution. The present system depends upon
the existence of organised political parties, each
of which presents its policies to the electorate
for approval; in practice most candidates in
elections, and almost all winning candidates,
belong to one of the main parties. A system of
voluntary registration for political parties in the
UK was introduced in 1998. Registration is
necessary for the proportional representation
electoral systems which involve ‘lists’ of
candidates, used in elections to the Scottish
Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales
and, for the first time nationally in June 1999,
for electing UK members to the European
Parliament (see p. 69). Registration helps
prevent the use of misleading descriptions on
ballot papers at election, since only candidates
representing a registered political party are
permitted to have the name and emblem of the
party printed on the ballot paper.
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-
party system has existed in Britain. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, whose origins
go back to the 18th century, or the Labour
44
6: GOVERNMENT
Party, which emerged in the last decade of the
19th century, has held power. The Liberal
Democrats were formed in 1988 when the
Liberal Party, which also traced its origins to
the 18th century, merged with the Social
Democratic Party, formed in 1981. Other
parties include two national parties, Plaid
Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the
Scottish National Party (founded in 1934).
Northern Ireland has a number of parties.
They include the Ulster Unionist Party,
formed in the early part of the 20th century; the
Democratic Unionist Party, founded in 1971 by
a group which broke away from the Ulster
Unionists; the Social Democratic and Labour
Party, founded in 1970; and Sinn Fein.9
Since 1945 eight General Elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and seven
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a General
Election, or which has the support of a
majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is
asked by the Sovereign to form a government.
About 100 of its members in the House of
Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet—see p. 55) on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The largest
minority party becomes the official Opposition,
with its own leader and ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons with
their supporters (‘the backbenchers’) sitting
behind them. Similar arrangements for the
parties apply to the House of Lords; however,
a significant number of Lords do not wish to
be associated with any political party, and sit
on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA.

parties. Depending on the relative strengths of
the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of
policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to Government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances of
winning the next General Election.
The detailed arrangements of government
business are settled, under the direction of the
Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two
Houses, by the Government Chief Whips of
each House in consultation with the
Opposition Chief Whips. The Chief Whips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often
referred to when the question of finding time
for a particular item of business is discussed.
The Leaders of the two Houses are
responsible for enabling the Houses to debate
matters about which they are concerned.
Parliamentary party control is exercised by
the Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party (usually by the
Leader). Their duties include keeping
members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of backbench
members. Party discipline tends to be less
strong in the Lords than in the Commons,
since peers have less hope of high office and
no need of party support in elections.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Financial Assistance to Parties
The Government plans to make party funding
more open, control spending on elections and
ensure the fair conduct of referendums. In
December 1999, it introduced the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill which
contains provision for:
• a registration scheme to bring parties
under specified funding controls;
• a requirement on parties to disclose the
source and amount of donations above
£5,000;
• a ban on the acceptance of donations
made from outside the UK;
• national spending limits on parties
determined by the number of
constituencies and/or regions contested
in an election—in a General Election, a
party with candidates in all 659 seats
could spend up to £19.77 million;
• a framework for the fair conduct of
referendums; and
• a new Electoral Commission to supervise
the financial restrictions on parties and
oversee referendums—it would also take
over the functions of the Boundary
Commissions and the Local Government
Commission for England, and have broad
responsibility for electoral law, provide
guidance on party political broadcasts
and promote understanding of electoral
and political matters.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent, partly codified by each House
in its Standing Orders. The system of debate
is similar in both Houses. Every subject starts
off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
After debate, in which each member (except
the mover of the motion) may speak only once,
the motion may be withdrawn: if it is not, the
Speaker or Chairman ‘puts the question’
whether to agree with the motion or not. The
question may be decided without voting, or by
a simple majority vote. The main difference in
procedure between the two Houses is that the
Speaker or Chairman in the Lords has no
powers of order; instead such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House,
which is sometimes interpreted by the Leader
of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House and
must guard against the abuse of procedure and
protect minority rights. The Speaker has
discretion on whether to allow a motion to end
discussion so that a matter may be put to the
vote, and has powers to put a stop to irrelevance
and repetition in debate. In cases of grave
disorder the Speaker can adjourn or suspend the
sitting. The Speaker may order members who
have broken the rules of behaviour of the House
to leave the Chamber or can initiate their
suspension for a number of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In a
tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote
(usually to maintain the status quo), without
expressing an opinion on the merits of the
question. Voting procedure in the House of
Lords is broadly similar, although the Lord
Chancellor may vote but does not have a
casting vote.
Modernisation of the House of Commons
A Select Committee on Modernisation of the
House of Commons, set up in 1997, made
several recommendations for modernising the
legislative process, most of which have now
been implemented. Among them are:
• measures to improve the examination of
proposed legislation, including a system
for publishing Bills in draft and the
setting up of ad hoc House of Commons
or joint Committees to conduct pre¬
legislative scrutiny;
• the experimental use of another
chamber—Westminster Hall, formally
known as the Grand Committee Room—
mainly for adjournment debates and
debates on Green Papers and other
consultative documents issued by the
Government;
• reformed procedures for the scrutiny of
European legislation;
• abolishing old-fashioned customs, such
as giving preference to hearing Privy
46
6: GOVERNMENT
Counsellors in debates and the rule
preventing MPs from quoting from
speeches made in the Lords;
• experimenting with the hours during
which the House sits; and
• carrying over, in defined circumstances,
public Bills from one session to the next.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-financial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must
declare it when speaking in the House or in
Committee and must indicate it when giving
notice of a question or motion. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other members, ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest. MPs cannot advocate matters in the
House which are related to the source of any
personal financial interest.
The House of Lords also has a Register of
Interests, on lines similar to that for MPs. It,
too, is open to public inspection.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards was created in 1995, following
recommendations of the Committee on
Standards in Public Life (see p. 59). The
Commissioner, who is independent of
government, can advise MPs on matters of
standards, and conduct a preliminary
investigation into complaints about alleged
breaches of the rules by Members. The
Commissioner reports to the House of
Commons Select Committee on Standards
and Privileges.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (transcribed
in Hansard, the Official Report) are published
daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of
the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a number
of former members of both Houses, are
available to the public through the House of
Lords Record Office. A wide range of
information on all aspects of the workings of
Parliament can be found on the Houses of
Parliament website.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television and
radio, either live or, more usually, in recorded
or edited form. Complete coverage is available
on cable and satellite television and the
‘webcasting’ of Parliament is currently being
considered.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation made by ministers and
others under powers given to them by Act (see
p. 49). While the interpretation of the law
undergoes constant refinement in the courts
(see p. 210), changes to statute law are made
by Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as individual
local authorities) or the rights of individuals
(such as certain proposals relating to railways,
roads and harbours) are known as Private
Bills, and are subject to a special form of
parliamentary procedure. Bills which change
the general law and which constitute the more
significant part of the parliamentary legislative
process are Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government minister or by an
ordinary (‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member or
peer. Most Public Bills that become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
Bills introduced by other MPs or Lords are
known as ‘Private Members’ Bills’.
The main Bills which constitute the
Government’s legislative programme are
announced in the Queen’s Speech at the State
Opening of Parliament, which usually takes
place in November, and the Bills themselves
are introduced into one or other of the Houses
over the succeeding weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
47
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
interested in the subject, and with interest and
pressure groups seeking to promote specific
causes. ‘White Papers’, which are government
statements of policy, often contain proposals for
legislative changes; these may be debated in
Parliament before a Bill is introduced. As part
of the process of modernising procedures (see
p. 46), some Bills are now published in draft for
pre-legislative scrutiny before beginning their
passage through Parliament. The Government
may also publish consultation papers,
sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, setting out
proposals which are still taking shape and
seeking comments from the public.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
matters are almost invariably introduced in the
Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
restricted. The Parliament Acts also provide
for a Bill to be passed by the Commons
without consent of the Lords in certain (very
rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the
Bill is considered, without debate, to have
been read for a first time and is printed. After
an interval, which may be between one day
and several weeks, a Government Bill will
receive its second reading debate, during
which the general principles of the Bill are
discussed.
If it obtains a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill will normally be submitted
to a standing committee (see p. 50) for detailed
examination and amendment. In the Lords,
the committee stage usually takes place on the
floor of the House, and this procedure may
also be followed in the Commons if that
House so decides (usually in cases where there
is a need to pass the Bill quickly or where it
raises matters of constitutional importance).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of
the House, during which further amendments
may be made. In the Commons, the report
stage is usually followed immediately by the
third reading debate, when the Bill is reviewed
in its final form. In the Lords, the third
reading debate usually takes place on a
different day; a Bill may be further amended
at third reading.
After passing its third reading in one House,
a Bill is sent to the other House, where it passes
through all its stages once more and where it is,
more often than not, further amended.
Amendments made by the second House must
be agreed by the first, or a compromise
reached, before a Bill can go for Royal Assent.
In the Commons the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. There
are special procedures for Public Bills which
consolidate existing legislation.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and becomes an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been
refused since 1707. In the 1998—99 session 35
Public Bills were enacted.
Limitations on the Power oj the Lords
Most Government Bills introduced and
passed in the Lords go through the Commons
without difficulty, but a Lords Bill which was
unacceptable to the Commons would not
become law. The Lords, on the other hand, do
not generally prevent Bills insisted upon by
the Commons from becoming law, though
they will often amend them and return them
to the Commons for further consideration.
By convention, the Lords pass Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure
without amendment. A Bill that deals only
with taxation or expenditure must become law
within one month of being sent to the Lords,
whether or not the Lords agree to it, unless the
Commons directs otherwise. If no agreement is
reached between the two Houses on a non-
financial Commons Bill, the Lords can delay the
Bill for a period which, in practice, amounts to
at least 13 months. Following this the Bill may
48
6: GOVERNMENT
be submitted to the Queen for Royal Assent,
provided it has been passed a second time by the
Commons. I here is one important exception:
any Bill to lengthen the life of a Parliament
requires the full assent of both Houses.
The limits to the power of the Lords are
based on the belief that nowadays the main
legislative function of the non-elected House is
to act as a chamber of revision, complementing
but not rivalling the elected House.
Private Members ’ Bills
Early in each session backbench members of the
Commons ballot (draw lots) for the opportunity
to introduce a Bill on one of the Fridays during
the session when such Bills have precedence
over government business. The First 20
members whose names are drawn win this
privilege, but it does not guarantee that their
Bills will pass into law. Members may also
present a Bill on any day without debate, while
on most Tuesdays and Wednesdays on which
the Commons is sitting there is also an
opportunity to seek leave to present a Bill under
the ‘ten minute rule’. This provides an
opportunity for a brief speech by the member
proposing the Bill (and by one who opposes it).
In most sessions some become law (eight in
the 1998-99 session). Private Members’ Bills
do not often call for the expenditure of public
money; but if they do they cannot proceed to
committee stage unless the Government
decides to provide the necessary money. Peers
may introduce Private Members’ Bills in the
House of Lords at any time. A Private
Member’s Bill passed by one House will not
proceed in the other unless taken up by a
member of that House.
Private and Hybrid Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to Public
Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. Hybrid Bills are Public Bills
which may affect private rights, for example,
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill, which was
passed in 1996. As with Private Bills, the
passage of Hybrid Bills through Parliament is
governed by special procedures which allow
those affected to put their case.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation (usually in
the form of‘statutory instruments’). To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to
the executive might undermine the authority
of Parliament or to the devolved legislatures,
such powers are normally delegated only to
authorities directly accountable to Parliament.
Moreover, Acts of Parliament which delegate
such powers usually provide for some measure
of direct parliamentary control over proposed
delegated legislation, by giving Parliament the
opportunity to affirm or annul it. Certain Acts
also require that organisations affected must
be consulted before rules and orders can be
made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House as a whole. In the Lords, debates on
statutory instruments take place on the floor
of the House. The House of Lords has
appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the
appropriateness of the powers to make
secondary legislation in Bills.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a Committee of the Whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or Peer may speak
only once on each motion does not apply in
committee.
49
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee considers the
Bill clause by clause, and may amend it before
reporting it back to the House. Ordinary
standing committees do not have names but
are referred to simply as Standing Committee
A, B, C, and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as
possible that in the House as a whole. The
standing committees currently still include
two Scottish standing committees, and the
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Grand
Committees.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish MPs (and may be convened
anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principle of
any Scottish Bill at the second and third reading
stages, where such a Bill has been referred to the
Committee by the House for that purpose. It
also debates other matters concerning Scotland.
In addition, its business includes questions
tabled for oral answer, ministerial statements
and other debates, including those on statutory
instruments referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, consisting
of all 40 Welsh MPs and up to five others who
may be added from time to time, considers
Bills referred to it at second reading stage,
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and other matters relating
exclusively to Wales.
The Northern Ireland Grand Committee
considers Bills at the second and third stages,
takes oral questions and ministerial
statements, and debates matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland. It includes all
sitting Northern Ireland MPs and up to 25
others as nominated by the committee of
selection. The Belfast Agreement envisages a
continuing role for the Northern Ireland
Grand and Select Committees to scrutinise
the responsibilities of the Secretary of State.
There is a Standing Committee on
Regional Affairs, consisting of all Members
sitting for constituencies in England, plus up
to five others. It was revived in April 2000.
There are also standing committees to
debate proposed European legislation, and to
scrutinise statutory instruments and draft
statutory instruments brought forward by the
Government.
In the Lords, various sorts of committees
on Bills may be used instead of, or as well as, a
Committee of the Whole House. Such
committees include Public Bill Committees,
Special Public Bill Committees, Grand
Committees, Select Committees and Scottish
Select Committees.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of enquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases their
recommendations invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the
House. A select committee may be appointed
for a Parliament, or for a session, or for as long
as it takes to complete its task. To help
Parliament with the control of the executive
by examining aspects of public policy,
expenditure and administration, 16
committees, established by the House of
Commons, examine the work of the main
government departments and their associated
public bodies. The Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work
of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
Environmental Audit Committee was set up in
1997 (see p. 306). The committees are
constituted on a basis which is in approximate
proportion to party strength in the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, Standards
and Privileges, and European Legislation.
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
Each House has a select committee to keep
it informed of EU developments, and to
enable it to scrutinise and debate EU policies
and proposals, while three Commons standing
committees debate specific European
legislative proposals. Ministers also make
regular statements about EU business.
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
50
6: GOVERNMENT
committees may question ministers, civil
servants, and interested bodies and
individuals. Through hearings and published
reports, they bring before Parliament and the
public an extensive body of fact and informed
opinion on many issues, and build up
considerable expertise in their subjects of
inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees: on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. Ad hoc committees may also be
set up to consider particular issues (or,
sometimes, a particular Bill), and ‘domestic’
committees—as in the Commons—cover the
internal workings of the House.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills10 and
statutory instruments (see p. 49). The two
Houses may also agree to set up joint select
committees on other subjects.
Unofficial Party Committees
The Parliamentary Labour Party comprises all
members of the party in both Houses. When
the Labour Party is in office, a parliamentary
committee, half of whose members are elected
and half of whom are government
representatives, acts as a channel of
communication between the Government and
its backbenchers in both Houses. When the
party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in the
House of Commons. When the Conservative
Party is in office, ministers attend its meetings
by invitation and not by right. When the party
10 A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts
into one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
is in opposition, the whole membership of the
party may attend meetings. The leader
appoints a consultative committee, which acts
as the party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
In addition to the system of scrutiny by select
committees, both Houses offer a number of
opportunities for the examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and
the Government’s own backbenchers. In the
House of Commons, the opportunities include:
• Question Time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s
Question Time takes place for half an
hour every Wednesday when the House
is sitting. Parliamentary Questions are
one means of seeking information about
the Government’s intentions. They are
also a way of raising grievances brought
to MPs’ notice by constituents. MPs may
also put questions to ministers for written
answer; the questions and answers are
published in Hansard. There are about
60,000 questions every year.
• Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the
House to raise constituency cases or
matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end
of the business of the day, and
opportunities for several adjournment
debates on Wednesday mornings. Since
November 1999, under experimental
measures to modernise and reform
parliamentary procedures, a second
chamber, Westminster Hall, has also
been widely used for adjournment
debates. In addition, an MP wishing to
discuss a ‘specific and important matter
that should have urgent consideration’
may, at the end of Question Time, seek
leave to move the adjournment of the
House. On the very few occasions when
leave is obtained, the matter is debated
for three hours in what is known as an
emergency debate, usually on the
following day.
51
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
• Early day motions (EDMs) provide a
further opportunity for backbench MPs
to express their views on particular
issues. A number of EDMs are tabled
each sitting day; they are very rarely
debated but can be useful in gauging the
degree of support for the topic by the
number of signatures of other MPs which
the motion attracts.
• Opposition days (21 in the 1998-99
session) when the Opposition can choose
subjects for debate. Of these days, 17
were at the disposal of the Leader of the
Opposition and four at the disposal of the
second largest opposition party.
• Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government
expenditure, chosen by the Liaison
Committee (a select committee largely
made up of select committee chairmen,
which considers general matters relating
to the work of select committees).
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the
debate on the Queen’s Speech at the
beginning of each session; during debates
on motions of censure for which the
Government provides time; and during
debates on the Government’s legislative
and other proposals.
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
Question Time, during debates and by means
of questions for written answer.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
public expenditure, are to authorise the raising
of taxes and duties, and the various objects of
expenditure and the sum to be spent on each.
Parliament also has to satisfy itself that the
sums granted are spent only for the purposes
which it intended. No payment out of the
central government’s public funds can be
made, and no taxation or loans authorised,
except by Act of Parliament. However, limited
interim payments can be made from the
Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the raising
of revenue. The legislation is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement (see p. 389). Scrutiny of public
expenditure is carried out by House of
Commons select committees (see p. 50).
Forcing the Government to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House of
Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of‘no confidence’. The
Government must also resign if the House
rejects a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has
declared it a ‘matter of confidence’ or if the
House refuses to vote the money required for
the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Ombudsman—officially
known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—investigates complaints from
members of the public (referred through MPs)
alleging that they have suffered injustice
arising from maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a select committee of the House
of Commons. The Ombudsman’s jurisdiction
covers central government departments and
agencies and a large number of non-
departmental public bodies (NDPBs). He or
she cannot investigate complaints about
government policy, the content of legislation
or relations with other countries.
In making investigations, the
Commissioner has access to all departmental
papers, and has powers to summon those from
whom he wishes to take evidence. When an
investigation is completed, he sends a report
with his findings to the MP who referred the
complaint (with a copy for the complainant).
When a complaint is justified, the
Ombudsman normally recommends that the
department or other body provides redress
(which can include a financial remedy for the
complainant in appropriate cases). There is no
52
6: GOVERNMENT
appeal against the Ombudsman’s decision. He
submits an annual report to Parliament, and
publishes selected cases twice a year.
The Ombudsman received 1,612 new
complaints in 1999-2000 (an increase of 7 per
cent over the previous year). He settled 1,601
complaints and completed 313 full
investigations. Complaints against the
Department of Social Security accounted for
47 per cent of the total received.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
investigates complaints arising from breaches
of the Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information (see p. 58).
Separate arrangements for a Scottish
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
and a Welsh Administration Ombudsman have
been set up to deal with complaints about the
Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for
Wales and devolved public bodies. Complaints
to the Scottish Commissioner are referred
through Members of the Scottish Parliament;
complaints to the Welsh Administration
Ombudsman can be made direct.
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
collectively to each House and to its staff and
individually to each member. They include
freedom of speech; first call on the attendance
of its members, who are therefore free from
arrest in civil actions and exempt from serving
on juries, or being compelled to attend court
as witnesses; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the rights of
the House to control its own proceedings (so
that it is able, for instance, to exclude
‘strangers’11 if it wishes); to decide upon legal
disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to
punish for breach of its privileges and for
contempt. Parliament has the right to punish
anybody, inside or outside the House, who
commits a breach of privilege—that is, offends
against the rights of the House.
11 All those who are not members or officials of either
House.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the Commons. The
law of privilege has been examined by a Joint
Committee of both Houses of Parliament,
which published its report in March 1999.
The committee’s main recommendation was
to call for a Parliamentary Privileges Act
codifying parliamentary privilege as a whole
and explaining its relevance, both to MPs and
to the electorate as a whole.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the conduct of national
affairs. The Prime Minister is appointed by the
Queen, and all other ministers are appointed by
the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister. Most ministers are members of the
Commons, although the Government is also
fully represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
I he composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s unique
position of authority derives from majority
support in the House of Commons and from
the power to appoint and dismiss ministers.
By modern convention, the Prime Minister
always sits in the Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet (see p. 55), is responsible for
allocating functions among ministers and
informs the Queen at regular meetings of the
general business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
Church of England archbishops, bishops and
certain deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’; senior judges, such as the
53
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Lord Chief Justice; Privy Counsellors; and
Lord-Lieutenants. He or she also
recommends certain civil appointments, such
as Lord High Commissioner to the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland (after
consultation with the First Minister), The
Poet Laureate, The Constable of the Tower
(of London), and some university posts; and
appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the BBC (British
Broadcasting Corporation), as well as various
royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (pensions for people
who have achieved eminence in the arts or
science and are in financial need).
The Prime Minister’s Office supports him
in his role as head of government. This
includes policy advice, tracking the delivery of
government commitments and initiatives, and
effective communications to Parliament, the
media and the public.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’,
or may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the President of the Council, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are thus available to perform any
duties the Prime Minister may wish to give
them. In the present administration, for
example, the President of the Council is
Leader of the House of Commons, and the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is
Minister for the Cabinet Office.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental functions
and the head of the judiciary (see p. 211). The
three Law Officers of the Crown advising the
UK Government are the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General (for England and
Wales) and the Advocate-General for
Scotland.
Other Ministers
Ministers of State are middle-ranking
ministers. They normally have specific
responsibilities, and are sometimes given titles
which reflect these functions, for example,
‘Minister for School Standards’ and ‘Minister
for Small Business and E-Commerce’.
The most junior ministers are
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State (or,
where the senior minister is not a Secretary of
State, simply Parliamentary Secretaries).
They may be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons (from April 2000) range from
.£26,053 a year for junior ministers to £66,172
for Cabinet ministers. In the House of Lords
salaries range from £57,244 for junior ministers
to £85,983 for Cabinet ministers. The Prime
Minister is entitled to a salary of £110,287.12
The Lord Chancellor receives £167,760.
In addition to their ministerial salaries,
ministers in the Commons, including the
Prime Minister, receive a full parliamentary
salary of £48,371 a year in recognition of their
constituency responsibilities and can claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs.
The Leader of the Opposition in the
Commons receives a salary of £60,659 (and
also the full parliamentary salary of £48,371);
two Opposition whips in the Commons and
the Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive additional salaries.
12 The present Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues
have declined the full salary to which they are entitled; the
Prime Minister draws instead a salary of £64,580, while
Cabinet ministers in the Commons draw £48,516 and in the
Lords £72,729.
54
6: GOVERNMENT
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by the
Prime Minister and may include both
departmental and non-departmental
ministers. The Cabinet reconciles ministers’
individual responsibilities with their
collective responsibilities as members of the
Government. It is the ultimate arbiter of all
government policy.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential, although after 30
years Cabinet papers may be made available
for inspection in the Public Record Office at
Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets weekly
during parliamentary sittings, and less
often when Parliament is not sitting. Cabinet
Committees relieve the pressure on Cabinet
itself by settling business in a smaller forum
or at a lower level, when possible, or at least
by clarifying issues and defining points of
disagreement. Committees enable decisions
to be fully considered by those ministers
most closely concerned in a way that
ensures that the Government as a whole can
be expected to accept responsibility for
them. They act by implied devolution of
authority from the Cabinet and their
decisions therefore have the same formal
status as decisions by the full Cabinet.
There are Cabinet Committees dealing, for
example, with defence and overseas policy,
economic policy, home and social affairs, the
environment, and local government. A new
committee set up by the present Government,
the Joint Consultative Committee, became the
first to involve politicians from a party outside
the Government—the Liberal Democrats.
The Committee considers constitutional
issues.
The membership and terms of reference of
all ministerial Cabinet Committees are
published. Where appropriate, the Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior Cabinet Office
officials attend meetings of the Cabinet and its
Committees.
The Cabinet Office
1 he Cabinet Office, together with HM
Treasury and the Prime Minister’s Office, is
at the centre of the UK Government.
The Secretary of the Cabinet (a civil
servant who reports directly to the Prime
Minister) manages the Cabinet Secretariats,
which serve ministers collectively in the
conduct of Cabinet business and in the co¬
ordination of policy at the highest level. Since
1983, the Cabinet Secretary has had the
additional role of Head of the Home Civil
Service.
The current Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster is a Cabinet minister with the title
Minister for the Cabinet Office and has
ministerial responsibility for all parts of the
Cabinet Office except the Cabinet
Secretariats.
The Cabinet Office is responsible for
current policies to:
• modernise and simplify government so
that it works more effectively for the
benefit of the people;
• implement a government programme to
improve the accessibility and quality of
public services; and
• provide the central strategic management
of the Civil Service.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
own departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that all ministers unanimously support
government policy once it has been settled.
The policy of departmental ministers must be
consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. Once the Government’s policy on
a matter has been decided, each minister is
expected to support it or resign. On rare
occasions, ministers have been allowed free
votes in Parliament on important issues of
principle or conscience.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
55
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
they have a duty to Parliament to account, and
to be held to account, for the policies,
decisions and actions of their departments and
agencies.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
many issues cross departmental boundaries and
require agreement between different ministers.
Proposals require consideration by Cabinet or a
Cabinet Committee where the issue is one that
raises major policy concerns, is likely to lead to
significant public comment or criticism, or
where the departmental ministers concerned
have been unable to agree.
On taking up office ministers must
generally resign directorships in private and
public companies, and must ensure that there
is no conflict between their public duties and
private interests. Detailed guidance on
handling Ministers’ financial interests is set
out in the Ministerial Code.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy and for advising ministers.
They are staffed by politically impartial civil
servants and generally receive their funds out
of money provided by Parliament. They often
work alongside local authorities, non-
departmental public bodies, and other
government-sponsored organisations.
The structure and functions of
departments sometimes change to meet the
needs of major changes in policy. A change of
Government does not necessarily affect the
functions of departments.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers the
UK as a whole. Other departments, such as
the Department of Social Security, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others again, such as the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions (DETR), are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. (For
changes in responsibilities associated with
devolution, see chapters 3, 4 and 5.)
The nine Government Offices for the
Regions in England (see pp. 10-11) are
responsible for administering some of the
main programmes of the DEI R, the
Department of Trade and Industry, and the
Department for Education and Employment.
They also link these where appropriate to the
programmes of other departments, some of
which have seconded staff to the Government
Offices. Some departments or agencies which
have direct contact with the public throughout
the country also have local offices.
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
were formally launched in eight English
regions in April 1999. The ninth, in London,
followed in July 2000 when the new Greater
London Authority took up its full powers and
responsibilities. The RDAs are designed to
provide co-ordinated regional economic
development and regeneration, and help the
English regions to improve their
competitiveness relative to their European
counterparts.
Voluntary regional chambers have been
established in each region. The chambers
provide a mechanism through which the
RDAs can consult on their proposals and give
an account of their activities.
Most departments are headed by ministers.
However, some are non-ministerial
departments headed by a permanent office
holder and ministers with other duties are
accountable for them to Parliament. For
example, the Secretary of State for Education
and Employment accounts to Parliament for
the work of the Office for Standards in
Education (OFSTED). OFSTED is headed
by HM Chief Inspector of Schools in
England, who is largely independent of the
Secretary of State.
The functions of the main government
departments and agencies are set out in
Appendix 1, pp. 533-42.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
A non-departmental public body (NDPB or
‘quango’) is a national or regional public body,
operating independently of ministers, but for
which ministers are ultimately accountable.
There are two main categories of NDPB:
• Executive NDPBs are those with
executive, administrative, commercial or
56
6: GOVERNMENT
regulatory functions. They are typically
engaged in a wide variety of activities and
are established in a number of different
ways. Executive NDPBs carry out
prescribed functions within a
government framework but the degree of
operational independence varies.
Examples include the Arts Council of
England, the Environment Agency and
the Health and Safety Executive.
• Advisory NDPBs are those set up by
ministers to advise them and their
departments on particular matters.
Examples include the Committee on
Standards in Public Life and the Low
Pay Commission. Some Royal
Commissions are also classified as
advisory NDPBs.
Other categories of NDPB include certain
tribunals and boards of visitors to penal
establishments.
There are currently over 1,000 NDPBs in
the UK. A list of all NDPBs is held centrally
by the Cabinet Office and is issued annually in
the publication Public Bodies. An electronic
directory of NDPBs is also maintained on the
Cabinet Office website (www.cabinet-
office.gov.uk/quango).
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman and
other staff in the Prime Minister’s Press
Office have direct contact with the
parliamentary press through regular meetings
with the Lobby correspondents. The Lobby
correspondents are a group of political
journalists with the special privilege of access
to the Lobby of the House of Commons,
where they can talk privately to government
ministers and other members of the House.
The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman is
the accepted channel through which
information about parliamentary business is
passed to the media.
Modernising Government
The Modernising Government White Paper
published in March 1999 set out key policies
and principles underpinning the
Government’s long-term programme of
reform to modernise public services based on
five key commitments:
• developing policies to achieve lasting
results rather than reacting to short-term
pressures;
• delivering public services to meet the
needs of citizens, rather than for the
convenience of service providers;
• providing efficient, high-quality public
services;
• ‘information age’ government using new
technology to meet the needs of citizens
and business; and
• valuing those who work in the public
service.
New public service agreements (PSAs) with
government departments (see p. 403) provide
a way of measuring and monitoring the
effective implementation of these
commitments. The Government has
implemented a number of measures which aim
to improve public services. These include:
• the establishment of the Centre for
Management and Policy Studies and the
Central Government National Training
Organisation which together are
responsible for strengthening policy¬
making and Civil Service-wide training
and development;
• electronic delivery of services—33 per
cent of services are now available
electronically and a 100 per cent target
has been set for the year 2005; and
• a reform programme to create a more
open, diverse and professional Civil
Service.
Open Government
The Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information commits
government departments, agencies and
executive public bodies within the jurisdiction
of the Parliamentary Ombudsman to volunteer
information, such as facts and analysis behind
major policy decisions, and to answer requests
for information.
57
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
National Statistics
A new independent national statistical
service came into being in June 2000.
National Statistics provides an accurate, up-
to-date, comprehensive and meaningful
picture of the UK economy and society to
support the formulation and monitoring of
economic and social policies by government
at all levels. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer is the Minister for National
Statistics and is responsible for appointing
the chairman and members of the new
Statistics Commission, and the new post of
National Statistician. The new Statistics
Commission is an independent, non¬
executive advisory body, operating in a
transparent and open way and producing an
annual report to be laid before Parliament.
Among its key responsibilities are:
• representing the views of users and
suppliers in commenting on the
National Statistics work programme;
• advising ministers of areas of
widespread concern about the quality
of official statistics;
• commenting on the application of a
new Code of Practice (see below) and
other procedures designed to promote
statistical integrity; and
• reviewing the need for statistical
legislation, reporting back to the
Minister for National Statistics after
two years.
The new National Statistician is the
Head of National Statistics, Head of the
Government Statistical Service, Director
of the Office for National Statistics and the
UK Government’s chief professional
adviser on statistical matters. The
postholder has professional responsibility
for the quality of the outputs comprising
National Statistics and maintains and
publishes a National Statistics Code of
Practice to help achieve this.
One of the key changes under National
Statistics is that all on-line data is now
made available free of charge to non-
profit-making end users.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman (see p. 52)
offers an independent appeals mechanism for
those seeking information under the Code
who are dissatisfied with the response to their
enquiry and with the results of any internal
review of the original decision. Complaints to
the Parliamentary Ombudsman must be
referred through an MP.
Freedom of Information
As part of its commitment to greater openness
in the public sector and involving people more
in decisions which affect their lives, the
Government, following wide consultation,
introduced into Parliament a Freedom of
Information Bill in November 1999.
The Bill is intended to supersede the non-
statutory Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information, creating a statutory
right of access to recorded information held by
public authorities. It also aims to weight the
scales decisively in favour of openness and
preserve confidentiality only where disclosure
would be against the public interest.
The main provisions of the Bill are:
• a right of wide general access, subject to
clearly defined exemptions and
conditions;
• a requirement to consider discretionary
disclosure in the public interest even
when an exemption applies;
• a duty to publish information; and
• powers of enforcement through an
independent information commissioner
and Information Tribunal.
There would also be a requirement
imposed on:
• police forces to give out information
about the conduct of inquiries (provided
it does not prejudice law enforcement);
• schools to explain how they apply their
admissions criteria;
• health authorities to provide details of
how they allocate resources between
different treatments;
• the Prison Service to provide information
on the performance of different prison
regimes;
58
6: GOVERNMENT
• hospitals and general practitioners to
explain how they prioritise their waiting
lists; and
• National Health Service (NHS) Trusts
and health authorities to provide
information on the administrative
procedures that govern their private
finance initiatives.
Service First
Launched in 1998 as part of the drive to
modernise government, Service First defines
the principles of good public service delivery,
including: setting clear standards of service;
consultation with users; a well-publicised and
easy-to-use complaints procedure; and closer
working with other providers to ensure better
services which are simple to use and well
co-ordinated.
Service First applies to all public services,
at both national and local level, and to those
privatised utilities retaining a monopoly
element. In support of the programme, a range
of guides has been produced covering issues
such as drawing up a charter, consultation,
and complaints handling. Other key elements
of the programme include:
• the Charter Mark Award Scheme, which
rewards excellence in delivering public
services;
• The People’s Panel, which consists of
5,000 members of the public randomly
selected from across the UK, to provide
views on public service delivery from a
cross-section of the population; and
• Better Government for Older People, which
aims to improve public services for older
people by better meeting their needs,
listening to their views, and recognising
their contribution to society.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
This Committee was set up in 1994 against a
background of increasing public concern
about standards in many areas of public life.
The Committee’s standing terms of reference
are ‘to examine current concerns about
standards of conduct of all holders of public
office, including arrangements relating to
financial and commercial activities, and make
recommendations as to any changes in present
arrangements which might be required to
ensure the highest standards of propriety in
public life’.
The Committee has published six reports.
The first, in 1995, led to the appointment of a
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
(see p. 52) and a Commissioner for Public
Appointments (see p. 60).
Reports in 1996 and 1997 examined
standards of conduct in local public spending
bodies and conduct in local government, and
called for a radical change in the ethical
framework within which local government
operates. A proposal was made for a new
criminal offence of misuse of public office.
In 1997 the Prime Minister gave the
Committee additional terms of reference to
review the funding of political parties. The
Committee’s report, published in 1998, called
for a new regulatory regime, overseen by an
independent Election Commission, for political
party funding in the UK. Legislation to make
party funding more transparent and to control
spending on elections was introduced in
December 1999 under the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Bill which is still
before Parliament (see p. 46).
In January 2000, the Committee published
its latest report—Reinforcing Standards—
which was the first major review of public
sector ethics since the Committee produced its
initial report in 1995. It concluded that,
although the process of raising standards has
been a success, more still needs to be done.
The recommendations of the new report
called for changes to the rules covering:
• Members of Parliament and disciplinary
procedures—by introducing proposed
legislation on the criminal law of bribery
to remove any uncertainty regarding the
scope of this statutory offence and by
holding disciplinary proceedings of the
House of Commons in public (though
not broadcasting them);
• ministers—by amending the Ministerial
Code to make it clear that a minister,
having had the advice of his or her
Permanent Secretary on potential
59
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
conflicts of interest, must take full
responsibility for any subsequent
decision;
• civil servants including special advisers—by
ensuring that training and induction of
staff appointed on secondments or short¬
term contracts includes examination of
ethical issues within the public sector and
by limiting the total number of special
advisers that can be appointed within
Government;
• lobbying of government by outside
interests—by strengthening current
guidance on lobbying and self-regulation
by lobbyists;
• sponsorship—by disclosing in
departmental annual reports, and to the
public on request, details, including the
value received, of sponsorship of
government activities by the private and
voluntary sectors; and
• government task forces—by establishing an
agreed definition of a task force which,
among other things, should specify that it
must operate within a time frame of not
more than two years, otherwise it should
be disbanded or reclassified as an
advisory NDPB.
The rules relating to appointments to
NDPBs and NHS bodies were also
scrutinised. The Government responded to
Reinforcing Standards in July 2000, accepting
the majority of recommendations.
In April 2000 the Committee published a
consultation paper on standards of conduct in
the House of Lords. A report is expected to be
published before the end of 2000.
Commissioner for Public Appointments
The Commissioner for Public Appointments
is independent of government and is
responsible for monitoring, regulating and
auditing approximately 12,500 ministerial
appointments to a range of public bodies
including NDPBs, public corporations,
nationalised industries, NHS Trusts and
utility regulators. The Commissioner has
issued a Code of Practice which encompasses
the seven principles to be applied to these
appointments—ministerial responsibility,
merit, independent scrutiny, equal
opportunities, probity, openness and
transparency, and proportionality.
Civil Service Commissioners
The Civil Service Commissioners are
responsible for upholding the fundamental
principle, in the context of recruitment to the
Civil Service, that selection should be on
merit on the basis of fair and open
competition. The Commissioners, who are
independent of government, produce a
mandatory Recruitment Code and audit the
recruitment policies and practices of
departments and agencies to ensure
compliance. They are also responsible for
approving appointments through external
recruitment to the Senior Civil Service, and
for hearing and determining appeals in cases
of concern about propriety and conscience
under the Civil Service Code.
The Civil Service
The constitutional and practical role of the
Civil Service is to assist the duly constituted
Government of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Executive or the National Assembly
for Wales in formulating their policies,
carrying out decisions and administering
public services for which they are responsible.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown; in
effect this means the Government of the
United Kingdom, the Scottish Executive and
the National Assembly for Wales. The
executive powers of the Crown are generally
exercised by ministers of the Crown, Scottish
ministers and secretaries of the National
Assembly for Wales, who are in turn
answerable to the appropriate Parliament or
Assembly. The Civil Service as such has no
separate constitutional personality or
responsibility. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the minister or
Assembly secretary in charge of the
department in which he or she is serving. A
change of minister, for whatever reason, does
not involve a change of staff.
60
6: GOVERNMENT
Cabinet ministers may appoint a maximum
of two special advisers. All appointments are
approved by the Prime Minister. (There are
about 79 such advisers in the present
administration.) The advisers are paid from
public funds. Their appointments come to an
end when the Government’s term of office
finishes, or when the appointing minister
leaves the Government or moves to another
appointment.
The Civil Service Code, introduced in
1996, is a concise statement of the role and
responsibilities of civil servants. It was revised
in May 1999 to take account of devolution.
The Code includes an independent line of
appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on
alleged breaches of the Code.
Civil servants constitute about 2 per cent of
the working population in employment, and
about 10 per cent of all public sector
employees. The number of permanent civil
servants fell from 751,000 in 1976 to 460,000
in April 1999 (a decrease of 39 per cent).
These figures include the Senior Civil
Service, which comprises around 3,000 of the
most senior managers and policy advisers.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in providing services to the public. These
include paying benefits and pensions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, issuing
driving licences, and providing services to
industry and agriculture. A further quarter are
employed in the Ministry of Defence and its
agencies. The rest are divided between central
administrative and policy duties; support
services; and largely financially self-
supporting services, for instance, those
provided by the Royal Mint. Four-fifths of
civil servants work outside London.
Approximately 13,000 civil servants work in
the Scottish Executive and 2,500 in the
National Assembly for Wales.
Northern Ireland Civil Service
The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) is
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain,
and has its own Civil Service Commission.
There were about 25,000 civil servants in the
NICS in June 2000. There is a degree of
mobility between the NICS and the Home
Civil Service.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 3,000 people, provides staff for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO—see
p. 92) in London and at British diplomatic
missions abroad.
Terms and conditions of service are
comparable, but take into account the special
demands of the Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. Home civil
servants, members of the armed forces and
individuals from the private sector may also
serve in the FCO and at overseas posts on loan
or attachment.
Equality and Diversity
The Civil Service aims to create a culture in
which the different skills, experience and
expertise that individuals bring are valued and
used. Its equal opportunities policy states that
there must be no unfair discrimination on the
basis of age, disability, gender, marital status,
sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality,
ethnic or national origin or (in Northern
Ireland) community background. The Civil
Service is committed to achieving greater
diversity, particularly at senior levels, where
women, people from ethnic minorities
and those with disabilities are still
under-represented.
In April 1999, the overall proportion of
women in the Civil Service was 51 per cent;
ethnic minority representation was 5.6 per
cent, compared with 5.5 per cent in the
economically active population; and at least
3.6 per cent of staff employed were disabled.
Progress is monitored and reported on
regularly by the Cabinet Office.
Central Management
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service lies with the
Prime Minister as Minister for the Civil
Service, supported by the Cabinet Office led by
the Head of the Home Civil Service through
his chairmanship of the Civil Service
Management Board. (The function of official
Head of the Home Civil Service is combined
with that of Secretary of the Cabinet.) The
61
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Cabinet Office oversees the central framework
for management of the Civil Service. Day-to-
day responsibility for a wide range of terms and
conditions has been delegated to departments
and agencies, the Scottish Executive and the
National Assembly for Wales.
Executive Agencies
Executive agencies were introduced to deliver
government services more efficiently and
effectively within available resources for the
benefit of taxpayers, customers and staff. This
involved setting up, as far as was practicable,
separate units or agencies to perform the
executive functions of government. Agencies
remain part of the Civil Service, but under the
terms of individual framework documents they
enjoy greater delegation of financial, pay and
personnel matters. Agencies are headed by chief
executives who are normally directly
accountable to ministers but are personally
responsible for day-to-day operations. A chief
executive’s pay is normally performance-
related.
No organisation carrying out a government
function can become an agency until the ‘prior
options’ of abolition, privatisation and
contracting out have been considered and
ruled out. These ‘prior options’ are
reconsidered when agencies are reviewed,
normally after five years of operation.
Local Government
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities can do only what they are
empowered to do by Acts of Parliament, but
their functions are far-reaching. Some are
mandatory, which means that the authority
must do what is required by law; others are
discretionary, allowing an authority to provide
services if it wishes. In certain cases, ministers
have powers to secure a degree of uniformity
in standards in order to safeguard public
health or to protect the rights of individual
citizens. Where local authorities exceed the
statutory powers conferred on them, they are
deemed to be acting outside the law and can
be challenged in court.
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the DETR.
However, other departments, such as the
Department for Education and Employment,
the Department of Health and the Home
Office, are also concerned with various local
government functions. In Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland local authorities now deal
mainly with the devolved Parliament and
Assemblies.
Reform of Local Government Structure
A major reform of local government took place
in 1974 in England and Wales and in 1975 in
Scotland. This created two main tiers of local
authority throughout England and Wales:
counties and the smaller districts. Local
government in London had been reorganised
along the same lines in 1965. In Scotland
functions were allocated to regions and districts
on the mainland; single-tier authorities were
introduced for the three Islands areas. In
Northern Ireland changes were made in 1973
which replaced the two-tier county council and
urban/rural council system with a single-tier
district council system.
The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England.
Most of their functions were transferred to the
London boroughs and metropolitan district
councils respectively in 1986 (see below).
Recent Changes
Further restructuring of local government
later took place in non-metropolitan England
and in Scotland and Wales. In 1992 the Local
Government Commission was established to
review the structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England
and to undertake periodic electoral reviews. In
its structural reviews of local government in
non-metropolitan England, the Commission
considered whether the two-tier structure
should be replaced by single-tier (‘unitary’)
authorities in each area; for the most part it
recommended the retention of two-tier
government, but suggested unitary authorities
for some areas, especially the larger cities.
62
6: GOVERNMENT
Parliament approved reorganisation in 25
counties, creating a total of 46 new unitary
councils (see map on p. 8). Implementation
was completed in 1998.
In Scotland 29 new unitary councils
replaced the previous system of nine regional
and 53 district councils in 1996; the three
Islands councils remained in being. In Wales
22 unitary authorities replaced the previous
eight county councils and 37 district councils,
again in 1996.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Greater London
Greater London is made up of the 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, each with a
council responsible for a number of key local
services in its area. However, they work
closely with the new Greater London
Authority (GLA) on a range of London-wide
issues, such as transport, economic
development, strategic development and the
environment.
English Metropolitan County Areas
The six metropolitan county areas—Tyne and
Wear, West Midlands, Merseyside, Greater
Manchester, West Yorkshire and South
Yorkshire—have 36 district councils, but no
county councils. The district councils are
responsible for all services apart from those
which require a statutory authority over areas
wider than the individual boroughs and
districts—namely, waste disposal (in certain
areas); the fire services, including civil defence;
and public transport. These are run by joint
authorities composed of elected councillors
nominated by the borough or district councils.
English Non-metropolitan Counties
Before the recent reforms, local government in
England—outside Greater London and the
metropolitan areas—was divided into counties
and sub-divided into districts. All the counties
and districts had locally elected councils with
separate functions. County councils provided
large-scale services, while district councils were
A Mayor and Assembly for London
In May 2000 Londoners voted for a directly
elected Mayor and a separately elected
Assembly for London. The resulting
Greater London Authority took up its full
powers and responsibilities in July 2000—
the first time the capital city has had a
strategic authority since the Greater London
Council (GLC) was abolished in 1986.
Future elections, again using a system of
proportional representation, will take place
every four years.
Fourteen new constituencies cover the
whole of Greater London, each providing
one member, and a further 11 ‘London-
wide’ members are allocated to ensure that
the overall distribution of seats reflects the
proportion of votes cast for each party.
The Mayor’s primary role is to represent
and promote London and, after
consultation, to devise London-wide
strategies for transport, planning, culture
and the environment. He or she controls two
new transport and economic bodies—
Transport for London (TIL) and the
London Development Agency (LDA)—and
appoints their members. In addition, a new
Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) and
London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority (LFEPA) have been established,
to whose boards the Mayor appoints
members of the Assembly. He or she sets a
budget for all four new bodies and for the
GLA.
The 25-member Assembly’s prime duty is
to hold the Mayor to account on London’s
behalf. It will scrutinise all of the Mayor’s
activities, the activities of the two new
authorities (MPA and LFEPA) and the bodies
responsible for transport and economic
development (TfL and LDA). The Assembly
has a key role in setting the GLA’s budget,
working closely with the Mayor on strategic
priorities. The Mayor is obliged to consider
its proposals and ultimately the Assembly may
agree or amend the Mayor’s budget.
63
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
responsible for the more local ones. These
arrangements are broadly continuing in areas
where two-tier local government remains.
County councils are responsible for transport,
planning, highways, traffic regulation,
education, consumer protection, refuse disposal,
the fire service, libraries and the personal social
services. District councils are responsible for
environmental health, housing, decisions on
most local planning applications, and refuse
collection. Both tiers of local authority have
powers to provide facilities such as museums, art
galleries and parks; arrangements depend on
local agreement. In areas where the new unitary
authorities have been set up, county and district
level functions have merged.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 10,000 parish councils or
meetings provide and manage local facilities such
as allotments and village halls, and act as agents
for other district council functions. They also
provide a forum for discussion of local issues.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
In Scotland the 32 single-tier councils are
responsible for the full range of local
government services. In Wales the 22 single¬
tier councils have similar functions, except
that fire services are provided by three
combined fire authorities. In addition, about
750 community councils in Wales have
functions similar to those of the parish
councils in England (see above); in Scotland
community councils exist to represent the
views of their local communities to local
authorities and other public bodies in the area.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are
responsible for delivering services to their
local communities.
Fire Services in the UK
Every part of the UK is covered by a local
authority fire service. Each of the 64 fire
authorities must by law make provision for
firefighting and maintain a brigade to meet
efficiently all normal firefighting
requirements. Each fire authority appoints a
Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
who exercises day-to-day control from brigade
headquarters. The fire services in England
and Wales employ some 50,000 staff and
spend around £1.5 billion each year. In 1999
local authority fire brigades attended about
935,000 fires or false alarms in the UK.
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
In England and Wales each council elects its
presiding officer annually. Some districts have
the ceremonial title of borough, or city, both
granted by royal authority. In boroughs and
cities the presiding officer is normally known
as the Mayor. In the City of London and
certain large cities, he or she is known as the
Lord Mayor. In Scotland the presiding officer
of the council of each of the four cities—
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and
Glasgow—is called the Lord Provost.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England, borough councils
in London, and about two-thirds of non¬
metropolitan district councils are elected in
their entirety every four years. In the
remaining districts (including all metropolitan
districts) one-third of the councillors are
elected in each of the three years when county
council elections are not held. Unitary
authorities in non-metropolitan districts and
London boroughs have a pattern of elections
similar to that in metropolitan districts.
In Scotland whole council elections are
held every three years, with the next elections
due in 2002. In Wales whole council elections
are held every fourth year, with the next due
in 2003.
County, district and unitary authority
councillors are paid a basic allowance but may
also be entitled to additional allowances and
expenses for attending meetings or taking on
special responsibilities.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in the UK provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• a citizen of the UK or of another
Commonwealth country, or of the Irish
Republic, or a citizen of a member state
of the EU;
64
6: GOVERNMENT
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote;
and
• on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must be
resident in the council area on the qualifying
date.
Candidates
Most candidates at local government elections
stand as representatives of a national political
party, although some stand as independents.
Candidates must be British citizens, other
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of a
member state of the EU, and aged 21 or over.
In addition, they must also either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the relevant local authority; or
• have occupied (as owner or tenant) land
or premises in that area during the whole
of the preceding 12 months; or
• have had their main place of work in the
area throughout this 12-month period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Areas and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland are
divided into wards, returning one councillor
or more. In Scotland the unitary councils are
divided into wards and in Wales into electoral
divisions; each returns one councillor or more.
Parishes (in England) and communities (in
Wales) may be divided into wards, returning
at least one councillor.
The procedure for local government voting
in Great Britain is broadly similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
district councils are elected by proportional
representation on the grounds that it allows
for the representation of sizeable minorities.
The electoral arrangements of local
authorities in England are kept under review
by the Local Government Commission (see
p. 62), and in Wales and Scotland by the Local
Government Boundary Commissions. Under
legislation passed in 1997, electoral arrangements
in England and Wales for parishes and
communities can be reviewed by local councils.
Provision of Local Services
In recent years, there has been a move away
from direct service provision, to a greater use
of private contractors, and an increase in what
is often called the ‘enabling’ role. Local
authorities now carry out many functions in
partnership with both public and private
organisations.
The Government considers that councils
should not be forced to put their services out
to tender, but equally it sees no reason why a
service should be delivered directly if more
efficient means are available elsewhere. The
Local Government Act 1999 therefore places a
duty on local authorities to achieve best value.
The Best Value programme aims to
encourage local accountability and involve
local communities in deciding the quality,
level and cost of local services. Local
authorities are expected to set themselves
challenging targets for the improvement of
services following regular reviews of their
performance. Local people may see how well
their authority is performing through the
publication of annual performance plans.
The Government of Wales Act requires the
National Assembly to set up a Partnership
Council to oversee relations between the
Assembly and local government. A
Commission to establish effective relations
between local government and the new
Scottish Parliament has been set up (see
chapter 4).
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
The Local Government Act 2000 requires local
authorities to implement new decision-taking
structures, including the option of a directly
elected mayor. These arrangements will replace
the traditional committee system of decision¬
taking for most council functions. In most
65
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
authorities the arrangements will be based on
one of three executive frameworks: a mayor and
cabinet; a council leader and cabinet; or a
mayor and council manager. Within these
options local authorities will have considerable
flexibility to adopt a constitution which reflects
local circumstances. Small shire district
councils with a population of fewer than 85,000
will, in addition to executive arrangements,
have the option of reforming their existing
committee system.
All new constitutions will be required to
incorporate rigorous arrangements for review
and scrutiny of councils’ policies and decisions
made.
Some decisions, such as the adoption of
policies and the budget, will be reserved for
the full council, but most of those relating to
the implementation of policy will be for the
executive. The executive will also be
responsible for preparing the policies and
budget to propose to the council.
Decisions may be taken by the executive
collectively, individual members of the
executive, committees of the executive or
officers of the authority. The executive will
also be able to delegate decision-making to
area committees and to enter into partnership
arrangements with other authorities.
The new arrangements will ensure that
people know who in the council is responsible
for taking decisions, how they can make their
input into decision-making and how to hold
decision-makers to account. In authorities
where there is a directly elected mayor, he or
she will have a strong mandate from local
people to deliver a programme of policies.
Public Access
Under the Local Government Act 2000, the
public (including the press) will be admitted
to meetings of the executive where key
decisions are being discussed. They will also
have access to agendas, reports and minutes of
meetings and certain background papers.
Local authorities will also have to publish a
Forward Plan setting out the decisions that
will be taken over the coming months. Local
authorities may exclude the public from
meetings and withhold papers only in limited
circumstances.
Employees
About 2 million people13 are employed by local
authorities in the UK. These include school
teachers, police, firefighters and other non-
manual and manual workers. Education is the
largest service with 800,000 full-time
equivalent jobs. Councils are individually
responsible, within certain national legislative
requirements, for deciding the structure of
their workforces.
Senior staff appointments are usually made
by the elected councillors. More junior
appointments are made by heads of
departments. Pay and conditions of school
teachers are set by the Secretary of State for
Education and Employment, after receiving
recommendations from the School Teachers’
Pay Review Body. Police pay is determined by
a formula tied to median private sector non-
manual pay settlements. Other pay and
conditions of service are usually a matter for
each council, although firefighters’ pay
increases are informed by a formula tied to the
upper quartile of male manual workers’
earnings. For other workers, most authorities
follow the scales recommended as a result of
national negotiation between authorities and
trade unions.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25 per cent of public spending. In
1999-2000 expenditure by local authorities in
the UK was about £81.2 billion. Current
expenditure amounted to £72.9 billion; capital
expenditure, net of capital receipts, was £5.3
billion; and debt interest £3.7 billion. Local
government capital expenditure is financed
primarily by borrowing within limits set by
central government and from capital receipts
from the disposal of land and buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the council tax (see chapter
24), which meets about 20 per cent of their
revenue expenditure. Their spending is,
however, financed primarily by grants from
central government and by the redistribution

rate, a property tax levied on businesses and
other non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate and business rates.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be
audited by independent auditors appointed by
the Audit Commission in England and Wales,
or in Scotland by the Accounts Commission
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland this role is
exercised by the chief local government
auditor. Local electors have a right to inspect
the accounts to be audited. They may also ask
questions and lodge objections with the
auditor.
Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to resolve
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public will often ask their own
councillor for help in this. Local authorities
must also appoint a monitoring officer, whose
duties include ensuring that the local authority
acts lawfully in the conduct of its business.
Complaints of alleged local government
maladministration leading to injustice may be
investigated by independent Commissions for
Local Administration, often known as ‘the
Local Ombudsman service’. There are three
Local Government Ombudsmen in England,
and one each in Wales and Scotland. A report
is issued on each complaint fully investigated
and, if injustice caused by maladministration
is found, the Local Ombudsman normally
proposes a remedy. The council must consider
the report and reply to it. In 1999-2000 the
Local Government Ombudsmen for England
received 17,555 complaints, 11 per cent more
than in 1998-99.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence the decision-making of
67
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Parliament and Government, to the benefit of
their members and the causes they support.
There is a huge range of groups, covering
politics, business, employment, consumer
affairs, ethnic minorities, aid to developing
countries, foreign relations, education, culture,
defence, religion, sport, transport, social
welfare, animal welfare and the environment.
Some have over a million members; others only
a few dozen. Some exert pressure on a number
of different issues; others are concerned with a
single issue. Some have come to play a
recognised role in the way the UK is governed;
others seek influence through radical protest.
Pressure groups operating at a national level
may influence how the UK is governed. Their
actions may simply highlight a particular
problem or their membership may indicate
broad representation in a specific field.
Ministers have a duty to give fair consideration
and due weight to informed and impartial
advice from civil servants, so pressure groups
often seek to inform civil servants and thus
influence the advice given to ministers.
Consultation to gain the consent and co¬
operation of as wide a range of organisations as
possible and to ensure the smooth operation of
laws and regulations is an important principle
in the way government in the UK works.
In some instances a department is under a
legal obligation to consult interested groups.
The Government has a duty to consult
organised interests, providing the pressure
groups involved have a broad enough
membership for them to represent a majority
view, and that they observe confidentiality
about their discussions with the department.
Members of pressure groups often have direct
expertise and an awareness of what is
practicable, and so can offer useful advice to
the Government in forming policy or drafting
legislation. The contacts between civil
servants and pressure group representatives
may be relatively informal—by letter or
telephone—or more formal, through
involvement in working parties or by giving
evidence to committees of inquiry.
Pressure Groups and Parliament
Lobbying—the practice of approaching MPs
or peers, persuading them to act on behalf of a
cause, and enabling them to do so by
providing advice and information—has
substantially increased in recent years. A
common pressure group tactic is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP
about an issue—for example, the plight of
political prisoners in particular countries—in
order to raise awareness and persuade the MP
to support the cause.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs and
peers sympathetic to their cause, and to brief
them when issues affecting the group are
raised in Parliament. In July 1998 the
Government issued guidance to civil servants
who come into contact with groups and people
outside the Government.
Public relations and political consultancy
firms also specialise in lobbying Parliament
and Government. Such firms are employed by
pressure groups—as well as by British and
overseas companies and organisations—to
monitor parliamentary business, and to
promote their clients’ interests where they are
affected by legislation and debate.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may exert influence include:
• suggesting to MPs or peers subjects for
Private Members’ Bills (see p. 49); many
pressure groups have ready-drafted bills
waiting to be sponsored;
• approaching MPs or peers to ask
Parliamentary Questions as a means of
gaining information from the
Government and of drawing public
attention to an issue;
• suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 52) and suggesting to
peers subjects for debates; and
• orchestrating public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action.
68
6: GOVERNMENT
The UK in the
European Union
As a member of the European Union, the UK
is bound by the various types of European
Community (EC) legislation and wider policies
(for policies, see chapter 7). Almost all UK
government departments are involved in EU-
wide business, and European legislation is an
increasingly important element of government.
The Community enacts legislation which is
binding on the national governments of the 15
member states or, in certain circumstances, on
individuals and companies within those states.
British government ministers take part in the
discussions and decision-making, and the final
decision is taken collectively by all the
member states.
The UK Representative Office (UKREP),
based in Brussels, conducts most of the
negotiations on behalf of the UK
Government. The devolved administrations of
Scotland and Wales are also represented by
UKREP. In October 1999 a new office
specifically aimed at helping to promote
Scotland’s interests within the EU opened in
Brussels; an office fulfilling the same role for
Wales opened in May 2000.
There are three legislative bodies:
The Council of the European Union is
the main decision-making body. Member
states are represented by the ministers
appropriate to the subject under discussion.
When, for instance, education matters are
being discussed, the UK’s Secretary of State
for Education and Employment attends with
his or her European counterparts. The
Presidency of the Council changes at six-
monthly intervals and rotates in turn among
the 15 member states of the Union.
Phe European Council, which is not a
legislative body and which usually meets twice
a year, comprises the heads of State or
Government accompanied by their foreign
ministers and the President of the European
Commission and one other Commissioner. The
Council defines general political guidelines.
The European Commission is the
executive body. It implements the Council’s
decisions, initiates legislation and ensures that
member states put it into effect. Each of the 20
Commissioners, who are drawn from all
member states (there are two from the UK), is
responsible for a specific policy area, for
example, education, transport or agriculture.
The Commissioners are entirely independent
of their countries, and serve the EU as a whole.
The European Parliament, which plays
an increasingly important role in the
legislative process, has 626 directly elected
members (MEPs), including 87 from the UK.
The Parliament is consulted about major
decisions and has substantial shared power
with the Council of the European Union over
the EC budget. In areas of legislation, its role
varies between consultation, where it can
influence but does not have the final say in the
content of legislation; the co-operation and
assent procedures, where its influence is
greater; and co-decision (introduced by the
Maastricht Treaty and extended in the
Amsterdam Treaty—see chapter 7), where a
proposal requires the agreement of both the
Council and the European Parliament.
Elections to the Parliament take place every
five years, most recently in June 1999. In the
UK, these were held under a proportional
voting system,14 bringing the country in line
with the other member states.
The European Parliament meets in full
session in Strasbourg for about one week every
month, although its committee work normally
takes place in Brussels.
EC legislation is issued in some areas
jointly by the Council of the European Union
and the European Parliament, by the Council
in other areas, or by the Commission under
delegated powers. It consists of Regulations,
Directives and Decisions.
• Regulations are directly applicable in all
member states, and have the force of law
14 The regional list system is used for England, Scotland
and Wales, under which an elector may cast his or her vote
for a party list of candidates. England is divided into nine
regions while Scotland and Wales each constitute one
region. These 11 regions each return between four and 11
MEPs, depending on the size of the electorate of each
region. Northern Ireland, which also constitutes one region,
continues to use the single transferable vote system to
return its three MEPs.
69
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
without the need for implementing
further measures;
• Directives are equally binding as to the
result to be achieved but allow each
member state to choose the form and
method of implementation; and
• Decisions, like Regulations, do not
normally need national implementing
legislation. They are binding on those to
whom they are addressed.
Other EU Institutions
Each member state provides one of the judges
to serve in the European Court of Justice,
which is the final authority on all aspects of
Community law. Its rulings must be applied
by member states, and fines can be imposed
on those failing to do so. The Court is assisted
by a Court of First Instance, which handles
certain cases brought by individuals and
companies. The UK is also represented on the

British Council 93
As a democratic country with global foreign policy interests and an economy
heavily dependent on international trade and investment, the United Kingdom
supports the maintenance of an open and stable international order.
Membership of the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), the
Commonwealth, NATO, the Western European Union (WEU) and other major
international organisations remains central to this objective.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
United Nations
The UK is a founder member of the UN and
one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, along with China, France,
Russia and the United States. It supports the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter,
including the maintenance of international
peace and security, the development of
friendly relations among nations, the
achievement of international co-operation on
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
issues, and the protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms. In 2000 the UK was
the sixth largest contributor to the UN regular
budget, the fifth largest contributor to
peacekeeping operations (see p. 85), and one
of the largest voluntary contributors to UN
funds, programmes and agencies. In order to
enhance the UN’s effectiveness, the UK is
continuing to press for modernisation of the
organisation, including the implementation of
management and budgetary proposals
recommended by the UN Secretary General.
European Union
The UK is a member of the EU (see also
pp. 69 and 77-82), which promotes social and
economic progress, a common foreign and
security policy, European citizenship and
police and judicial co-operation in criminal
matters. The other 14 EU member nations are
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain and Sweden.
The Commonwealth
There are 54 members of the Commonwealth,
including the UK. It is a voluntary association
of independent states, nearly all of which were
once British territories, and includes almost
one in three people in the world. The
71
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia,
the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Cameroon,
Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji,1 The
Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India,
Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi,
Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Pakistan,2 Papua New Guinea, St
Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri
Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad
and Tobago, Tuvalu,3 Uganda, United
Kingdom, Vanuatu, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The Queen is head of the Commonwealth
and is head of state in the UK and 15 other
member countries. The Commonwealth
Secretariat, based in London, is the main
agency for multilateral communication
between member governments on matters
relevant to the Commonwealth as a whole.
The Secretariat promotes consultation and co¬
operation, disseminates information, and helps
host governments to organise Heads of
Government Meetings, ministerial meetings
and other conferences. It administers
assistance programmes agreed at these
meetings, including the Commonwealth Fund
for Technical Co-operation, which provides
advisory services and training to
Commonwealth developing countries.
Heads of Government Meetings are held
biennially, most recently in Durban, South
Africa, in November 1999. The next will take
place in Brisbane, Australia, in 2001.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is central to UK
defence policy (see p. 96). NATO’s functions
are to:
1 Fiji was suspended from the councils of the
Commonwealth in June 2000 following a declaration of
martial law by the Fiji military in response to an internal
security crisis.
2 Pakistan was suspended from the councils of the
Commonwealth in October 1999 following a military coup.
3 Tuvalu is a ‘special’ member, entitled to take part in all
Commonwealth activities, with the exception of the biennial
Commonwealth Pleads of Government Meetings.
• help provide security and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area;
• provide a transatlantic forum for member
states to consult on issues of common
concern;
• deter and defend against any threat to the
territory of any NATO member state;
• contribute to crisis management and
conflict prevention on a case-by-case
basis; and
• promote partnership, co-operation and
dialogue with other countries in the
Euro-Atlantic area.
Each of the 19 member states—Belgium,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United
Kingdom and the United States—has a
permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland joined the
Alliance as full members in 1999. The main
decision-taking body is the North Atlantic
Council. It meets at least twice a year at
foreign minister level, and weekly at the level
of permanent representatives. Defence
ministers also meet at least twice a year.
Western European Union
The UK is a full member of the WEU, which
provides a forum for co-operation and
consultation on defence and security issues for
European nations. The WEU’s other full
members are Belgium, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain. The Czech Republic,
Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland and
Turkey are associate members; Austria,
Denmark, Finland, the Irish Republic and
Sweden are observers. ‘Associate partnership’
has been extended to seven Central European
and Baltic states.
EU heads of Government agreed at the
Cologne European Council in June 1999 that
the EU should itself be given responsibility for
many of the military crisis management
activities previously the remit of the WEU
(see also p. 81).

The Group of Eight
The UK is part of the Group of Eight (G8)
leading industrialised countries. The other
members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia (included as a full member from
1998, although the other countries continue to
function as the G7 for some discussions) and
the United States. The G8 is an informal
group with no secretariat. Its Presidency
rotates each year among the members, the key
meeting being an annual summit of heads of
government. Originally formed in 1975 (as the
G7) to discuss economic issues, the G8 agenda
now includes a wide range of foreign affairs
and international issues such as terrorism,
nuclear safety, the environment, UN reform
and development assistance. Heads of state or
government agree a communique issued at the
end of summits which commits each country
to co-ordinate individual action towards
common goals.
The G8 summit meeting in July 2000,
hosted by the Japanese Government in
Okinawa, focused on development issues,
including debt relief and health; information
technology (IT); drugs and crime; and conflict
prevention.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The UK participates in the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
which is a pan-European organisation
comprising 55 states. All states participate on
an equal basis, and decisions are taken by
consensus. The OSCE is based in Vienna,
where the UK has a permanent delegation.
The main areas of work are:
• early warning and prevention of potential
conflicts through field missions and
diplomacy and the work of the OSCE
High Commissioner on National
Minorities;
• observing elections and providing advice
on human rights, democracy and law,
and media;
• post-conflict rehabilitation, including
civil society development; and
• promoting security through arms control
and military confidence-building.
Council of Europe
The UK is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European
state accepting parliamentary democracy and
the protection of fundamental human rights
and the rule of law. There are 41 full member
states. ‘Special guest status’ has been granted
to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina. One of the Council’s main
achievements is its adoption of the European
Convention on Human Rights in 1950 (see
P- 211).
Other International Bodies
The UK belongs to many other international
bodies, including: the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), which regulates the international
financial system and provides credit for
member countries facing balance-of-payments
difficulties; the World Bank, which provides
loans to finance economic and social projects
in developing countries; the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), which promotes economic growth,
support for less developed countries and
worldwide trade expansion; and the World
Trade Organisation (WTO—see p. 421).
Other organisations to which Britain belongs
or extends support include the regional
development banks in Africa, the Caribbean,
Latin America and Asia, and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
OVERSEAS TERRITORIES
The UK’s Overseas Territories have a
combined population of nearly 180,000. The
territories are listed on p. 76. Most have
considerable self-government, with their own
legislatures. Governors appointed by the
Queen are responsible for external affairs,
internal security and defence. Most domestic
matters are delegated to locally elected
governments and legislatures. Ultimate
responsibility for government rests with the
UK. The British Indian Ocean Territory, the
British Antarctic Territory, and South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have
non-resident Commissioners, not Governors.
The UK aims to provide the Overseas

7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Territories with security and political stability,
ensure efficient and honest government, and
help them achieve economic and social
advancement. None of the territories has
expressed a desire for independence from
the UK.
In 1999 the British Government published
a White Paper, Partnership for Progress and
Prosperity, which proposed offering British
citizenship to all those residents of the
Overseas Territories who do not already have
it and who wish to take it up.4 Preparation of
the necessary parliamentary legislation is
currently under consideration.
Offshore financial service industries are of
major importance in several of the Territories.
The UK Government’s policy is to ensure that
international standards of regulation are met in
the Territories and that effective steps are taken
to combat financial crime and regulatory abuse.
The Territories are also required to abide by
the same standards of human rights and good
governance to which the UK subscribes.
A new Overseas Territories Department
within the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(FCO) provides a single focus and direct point
of contact with the UK Government, although
Gibraltar, because of its EU status, is dealt
with primarily by the FCO’s European
Departments. The Department for
International Development (DFID—see
p. 90) has also set up an Overseas Territories
Unit, which administers aid to Anguilla, the
British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, the Turks
and Caicos Islands, St Helena (and its
dependencies) and Pitcairn. A new Overseas
Territories Consultative Council, comprising
the Chief Minister or equivalent from each
territory and British Ministers (and chaired by
the relevant FCO minister), convened its first
annual meeting in October 1999.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina. The UK
4 The offer of right of abode is on a non-reciprocal basis, as
the territories do not have the capacity to absorb
uncontrolled numbers of new residents. The UK
Government’s decision on this follows the precedent set by
Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands whose existing right of
abode is also non-reciprocal.
Government does not accept the Argentine
claim and is committed to defending the
Islanders’ right to live under a government of
their own choice. This right of self-
determination is enshrined in the 1985
Falkland Islands Constitution.
The UK and Argentina, while sticking to
their respective positions on sovereignty,
maintain diplomatic relations and continue to
discuss their common interests in the South
Atlantic region, such as fisheries conservation
and the exploitation of oil reserves.
Gibraltar
Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in perpetuity
under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht but has long
sought its return. However, the UK is
committed to the principle, set out in the
preamble to the 1969 Gibraltar Constitution,
that it will never enter into arrangements
under which the people of Gibraltar would
pass under the sovereignty of another state
against their freely and democratically
expressed wishes.
Gibraltar has an elected House of
Assembly, and responsibility for a wide range
of ‘defined domestic matters’ is devolved to
elected local ministers. The territory is within
the EU, as part of the United Kingdom
member state, although it is outside the
common customs system and does not
participate in the Common Agricultural or
Fisheries Policies or the EU’s value added tax
arrangements. The people of Gibraltar have
been declared UK nationals for EU purposes.
In April 2000 the UK and Spain, with the
support of the Government of Gibraltar,
announced agreement on various issues
concerning Gibraltar’s participation in EU
measures.
EUROPEAN UNION POLICY
In 1998 the British Prime Minister called for a
‘step change’ in the UK’s relations with the
rest of Europe, to form stronger links with the
EU and applicant countries. The aims of this
initiative are to maximise British influence in
Europe by building bilateral alliances with EU
member states and the applicants. Since then
officials and ministers from all government
77
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
departments have extended their contacts with
their European counterparts and agreed a
series of joint initiatives.
The Treaties
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent further conflict and establish lasting
peace and stability.
Rome Treaty
The 1957 Rome Treaty, establishing the
European Community, defined its aims as the
harmonious development of economic
activities, a continuous and balanced economic
expansion and an accelerated rise in the
standard of living. These objectives were to be
achieved by the creation of a common internal
market, including the elimination of customs
duties between member states, free movement
of goods, people, services and capital, and the
elimination of distortions in competition
within this market. These aims were
reaffirmed by the 1986 Single European Act,
which agreed measures to complete the single
market (see p. 79). The UK joined the
European Community in 1973.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of the UK and
the other member states in international trade
negotiations. The Commission negotiates on a
mandate agreed by the European Council.
(For further information on overseas trade, see
chapter 25.)
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments, including moves towards
economic and monetary union (see below). It
established the EU, which comprises the
European Community and intergovernmental
arrangements for a Common Foreign and
Security Policy (CFSP—see p. 81) and for
increased co-operation on justice and home
affairs policy issues (see p. 82). It also
enshrined in the Treaty the principle of
subsidiarity under which, in areas where the
Community and member states share
competence, action should be taken at European
level only if its objectives cannot be achieved by
member states acting alone and can be better
achieved by the Community. In addition, the
Treaty introduced the concept of EU citizenship
as a supplement to national citizenship.
Amsterdam Treaty
In 1996 an intergovernmental conference was
convened to consider further treaty
amendments. This resulted in the Amsterdam
Treaty, which entered into force in 1999, and
provides for:
• the Council to take action to combat
discrimination on the basis of gender,
race, religion, sexual orientation,
disability or age;
• more co-ordination by member states of
measures designed to cut unemployment;
• integration of the social chapter (see
p. 80) into the Treaty, following its
adoption by the UK;
• new mechanisms to improve the co¬
ordination and effectiveness of the
CFSP;
• an increase in the areas subject to co¬
decision between the Council of
Ministers and European Parliament, and
simplification of the co-decision
procedure (see p. 69);
• a binding protocol on subsidiarity; and
• measures to enhance openness in the EU
institutions.
Treaty Ratification
Any amendments to the Treaties must be
agreed unanimously and must then be ratified
by each member state according to its own
constitutional procedures. In the UK, Treaty
ratifications must be approved by Parliament
before they can come into force.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged the
achievement of economic and monetary union
78
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
in preparatory stages, culminating with the
adoption on 1 January 1999 of a single
currency (the euro). In May 1998 a meeting of
EU heads of state and government agreed that
11 of the 15 EU member states (excluding the
UK, Denmark, Greece and Sweden) would
take part in the single currency from its launch
date. It also agreed the establishment of the
European Central Bank (ECB) from June
1998.
On 1 January 1999 conversion rates
between currencies of qualifying countries and
the euro were legally fixed. The euro became
the legal currency in those countries and the
ECB assumed responsibility for formulating
the monetary policy of the euro area. Since no
euro banknotes or coins will be available until
1 January 2002, national currencies will
continue to exist in parallel to the euro and
national banknotes and coins will be used for
all cash transactions.
The European Council meeting in Santa
Maria da Feira (Portugal) in June 2000
confirmed Greece’s entry into the euro zone
from 1 January 2001. The UK Government’s
policy towards joining the single currency is
described in chapter 23 (see p. 387).
Enlargement
Enlargement of the EU—to include those
European nations sharing its democratic
values and aims, which are functioning market
economies, able to compete in the EU and to
take on the obligations of membership—is a
key policy objective for the Union. In 1998 an
accession process with the applicant states was
launched, and formal negotiations started with
Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus
and the Czech Republic. At the European
Council meeting in Helsinki in December
1999, the EU agreed to invite six other
countries—Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,
Romania and Slovakia—to open accession
negotiations (which were launched in
February 2000), and also recognised Turkey’s
candidature for membership.
The EU is preparing institutional changes
to take account of enlargement. In March 1999
the Berlin European council agreed the EU’s
budgetary arrangements for the period
2000-06 (see below), including making
financial provision for the first new member
states to join the Union in that period.
Following a decision at the Cologne European
Council in June 1999, an intergovernmental
conference to decide the institutional changes
necessary for enlargement began in February
2000. These changes include the number of
Commissioners in an enlarged Union, the
weighting of votes in the Council and a review
of the issues which might be decided by
qualified majority voting. The
intergovernmental conference should be
concluded by December 2000.
European Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of levies
on agricultural imports from non-member
countries, customs duties, the proceeds of
value added tax receipts and contributions
from member states based on gross national
product (GNP).
In March 1999 the European Council
agreed on budgetary amendments. The ‘own
resources’ system for financing the EU
maintains the current ceiling of 1.27 per cent
of GNP; but, progressively from 2001, more
revenue will be raised from contributions
linked to GNP and less from VAT receipts
and customs payments. It was also agreed that
the UK’s annual budget rebate (in place since
1984, and without which the British net
contribution would be far greater than that
justified by its share of Community GNP)
would remain.
Single Market
The single market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and
capital within the EU, came into effect in 1993
(see also p. 420). Largely complete in legislative
terms, it covers, among other benefits, the
removal of customs barriers, the liberalisation
of capital movements, the opening of public
procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications.
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, which came into force in 1994,
most of the EU single market measures have
been extended to Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein. EEA member states comprise
79
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
the world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
40 per cent of all global trade.
Agriculture, Fisheries and the
Environment
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is concerned
with the conservation and management of
fishery resources. See chapter 27 for further
details of these policies, and of the UK’s
support for CAP reform (agreement on which
was reached by EU member states in 1999).
Environmental considerations are
integrated into all areas of EU policymaking.
See chapter 20 for more information about EU
environmental protection measures.
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
The economic and social disparities within the
EU are considerable, and will become more
evident with further enlargement. To address
the problem of regional imbalances there are a
number of Structural Funds designed to
promote economic development in
underdeveloped regions and regenerate
regions affected by industrial decline (see also
p. 396)
Infrastructure projects and industrial
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the unemployed
and young people. The Guidance Section of
the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund supports agricultural
restructuring and some rural development
measures. The Financial Instrument of
Fisheries Guidance promotes the
modernisation of the fishing industry. A
Cohesion Fund, set up under the Maastricht
Treaty, provides financial help to reduce
disparities between EU members’ economies.
Other initiatives promote new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of traditional industries, such as
steel, coal and shipbuilding.
New funding levels for the Structural and
Cohesion Funds in the period 2002-06 were
agreed by the European Council in 1999.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at competitive
interest rates to public and private capital
investment projects.
Employment and Social Affairs
The UK accepted the social chapter (a
separate protocol to the Maastricht Treaty) in
1997 and agreed to implement the measures
already adopted under it by the other 14
member states. Each year since 1997 EU
member states have agreed guidelines to shape
their national employment policies and
published national action plans to show
progress towards implementation. This
process forms part of the European
Employment Pact, approved by the European
Council in June 1999. The pact involves three
long-term interlinked processes aimed at:
• co-ordination of economic policy and
improved interaction between wage
developments and monetary, budget and
fiscal policy, in order to preserve non¬
inflationary growth;
• greater efficiency of the labour markets
by improving employability,
entrepreneurship, adaptability of
businesses and employees, and equal
opportunities; and
• structural reform and modernisation to
improve innovative capacity and
efficiency of the labour market and the
markets in goods, services and capital.
For details of EU education and youth
programmes see chapter 10 (p. 140).
Research and Development
EU spending on research and development
(R&D) plays an increasingly important role in
enabling Europe to maintain the science and
technology base necessary to remain
competitive in world markets. Research
collaboration among member states is

promoted mainly through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities
and setting out the level of funding. The
Government encourages UK companies and
organisations to participate in collaborative
R&D with European partners (see p. 438).
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The intergovernmental CFSP came into being
in 1993 with the entry into force of the
Maastricht Treaty. It provides for EU
member states to agree unanimously common
policies and/or joint actions on a wide range
of international issues.
The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced
several changes to make the policy more
effective, including the appointment of a High
Representative to help with the formulation,
preparation and presentation of CFSP policy
decisions, and the establishment of a Policy
Planning and Early Warning Unit in the
Council Secretariat to sharpen the preparation
and focus of CFSP decisions. The Amsterdam
Treaty preserves the principle that all policy
should be decided by unanimity, but states
that decisions implementing common
strategies, which are themselves agreed by
unanimity, will be by qualified majority
voting. A member country may prevent a vote
being taken by qualified majority voting for
‘important and stated reasons of national
policy’. Also, a member state may abstain and
stand aside from an EU decision/action when
its interests are not affected.
Common European Security and Defence Policy
In 1998 the UK launched an initiative to
strengthen the EU’s capacity to respond to
crises, on the basis that, if the Union is to play
a coherent and effective political role, this
needs to be underpinned by a credible
European military capability. The initiative
envisaged that the EU should have the
capacity for autonomous action, backed up by
appropriate military forces, the means to
decide to use them and a readiness to do so, in
order to respond to international crises
without prejudice to actions by NATO (which
would remain the foundation of collective
Economic Reform
In March 2000 the Portuguese
Presidency hosted a special European
Council in Lisbon on Economic Reform,
Employment and Social Inclusion.
Member states agreed the UK’s proposal
that the EU should set itself the target of
becoming, by 2010, the most
competitive and dynamic knowledge-
based economy in the world, capable of
sustainable economic growth with more
and better jobs and greater social
cohesion. The objectives of the strategy
include:
• expanding access to the Internet
and e-commerce;
• improving the internal market in
services, updating public
procurement rules, and reducing
state aids;
• improving co-ordination of national
R&D programmes, and adopting by
the end of 2001 a Community
patent;
• removing barriers to small business
growth;5
• promoting education, training and
employability, giving higher
priority to lifelong learning and
basic IT skills;
• combating social exclusion and
poverty through priority actions
targeting specific groups (such as
minorities or the disabled); and
• modernising social protection
systems (in particular, pensions).
security). Hitherto the EU had looked to the
WEU to carry out such military crisis
management activity on its behalf.
This approach has been endorsed by the
European Council which, at the summit in
Helsinki in December 1999, agreed to set up a

rapid intervention force, numbering 50,000-
60,000 personnel to deal with conflict
prevention and the military and civilian aspects
of crisis management, by 2003. The European
Council in June 2000 agreed detailed
arrangements for co-operation between the EU
and NATO, in particular the basis for
participation in European crisis management
by the six members of NATO which are
European countries but not EU members.
Justice and Home Affairs
The Maastricht Treaty established
intergovernmental arrangements for increased
co-operation among EU states on justice and
home affairs issues. These issues include visa,
asylum, immigration and other policies related
to free movement of people, and police,
customs and judicial co-operation in criminal
matters (including co-operation through
EUROPOL—see p. 90). This is a growing
aspect of EU work and, since the entry into
force of the Amsterdam Treaty, has both
Community-based and intergovernmental-
based areas of co-operation. A protocol
annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty recognises
the UK’s right to exercise its own frontier
controls.
REGIONAL RELATIONS
Central and Eastern Europe and
Central Asia
European Security
The European security situation has been
transformed over the last decade. In 1990 the
UK and its NATO allies, together with
former (Communist) Warsaw Pact states, set
up the North Atlantic Co-operation Council
to promote co-operation and understanding.
In 1994 the Alliance invited the non-NATO
states in Central and Eastern Europe and
Central Asia to join a Partnership for Peace
programme, a form of association which,
among other things, enlists the Partners’
assistance in peacekeeping operations. In 1997,
the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council was set
up to develop closer political and military
links between NATO countries and
non-members.
The UK played a significant role in
negotiations leading to:
• the 1997 Founding Act between NATO
member states and Russia, introducing
new mechanisms for a close and
permanent relationship;6
• a NATO-Ukraine Charter for a
Distinctive Partnership, also signed in
1997; and
• the accession to NATO, in March 1999,
of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland.
Economic Help
The UK and other Western countries
continue to help deal with the economic
problems following the fall of Communism,
and to promote the development of market
economies. The IMF provides support for
stabilisation programmes and the World Bank
finance for structural reform to nearly all
countries in the region. This is further
bolstered by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development’s
investments and its role in facilitating
additional private investment. The EU’s
PHARE scheme7 is primarily devoted to
aiding Central European countries in the
process of reform and development of their
infrastructure. Countries of the former Soviet
Union (excluding Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania) and Mongolia receive help through
a parallel programme (TACIS),8 which
concentrates on democratisation, financial
services, transport, energy (including nuclear
safety) and public administration reform. The
UK’s Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD) provides insurance cover for
exporters to a number of these countries.
6 Relations between Russia and NATO were undermined in
1999 over Russia’s opposition to the Alliance’s military action
against Serbia over developments in Kosovo (see p. 87).
Steps to re-establish ties were agreed in February 2000.

7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Association and Co-operation Agreements
The EU has strengthened relations with
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia by signing Europe
(Association) Agreements with them. The
agreements provide an institutional framework
to support the process of integration, and
anticipate accession of these countries to the
EU when they are able to assume the
obligations of membership (see p. 79).
EU Partnership and Co-operation
Agreements are in force with Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. A Trade
and Co-operation Agreement with Albania
and a Co-operation Agreement with
Macedonia are in force. The purpose of these
agreements is to reduce trade barriers, develop
wide-ranging co-operation and increase
political dialogue.
The EU plans to develop closer links
through Stabilisation and Association
Agreements with states in south-eastern
Europe, providing that they meet the EU’s
conditions on democracy, electoral and media
reform, and respect for human rights.
Middle East
Arab-Israe/i Peace Process
The UK supported the breakthrough in the
Middle East peace process in 1993, when Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation
(PLO) agreed to mutual recognition and
signed a Declaration of Principles on interim
self-government for the Palestinians in Israeli-
held territories occupied in 1967. The first
stage of the Declaration was implemented in
1994, when the Palestinians adopted self-
government in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho
area. A peace treaty between Israel and Jordan
was also signed in that year. The UK has
continued to encourage peace negotiations
between Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
In 1995 Israel and the PLO reached an
agreement providing for a phased Israeli troop
withdrawal from occupied Palestinian areas of
the West Bank and for elections to a new
Palestinian Council with legislative and
executive powers. The UK took part in the
international observation of the Palestinian
elections in 1996 co-ordinated by the EU.
Progress in the process since then has been
far from smooth, with frequent disruptions
over political and security concerns. The UK
has sought to complement the mediation
efforts of the United States, based on the
conviction that a lasting resolution must both
protect Israel’s security and provide a just
exchange of land for peace; and, with its EU
partners, it has reaffirmed the Palestinian
right to self-determination including the
option of statehood.
The Government expressed deep concern
over the serious escalation of violence between
Israelis and Palestinians which erupted from
late September 2000.
Iraq
The UK condemned Iraq’s invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and supported all UN
Security Council resolutions designed to force
Iraqi withdrawal and restore international
legality. Because of Iraq’s failure to withdraw,
its forces were expelled in 1991 by an
international coalition led by the United
States, the UK, France and Saudi Arabia,
acting under a UN mandate.
UN sanctions against Iraq, imposed at that
time, still remain in force (although with
substantial humanitarian exemptions), because
Iraq has failed persistently to comply with the
relevant Security Council resolutions,
particularly relating to the supervision of the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
In December 1999 the UK drafted and co¬
sponsored a further Security Council
resolution creating the UN Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (as
the successor organisation to the former UN
Special Commission on Iraq, or UNSCOM).
The same resolution lifted the ceiling on Iraq’s
oil exports and expanded the humanitarian
programme for Iraq.
UK and US warplanes continue to patrol
‘no-fly’ zones over southern and northern
Iraq, established after the war in 1991 to
protect the Shia minority in southern Iraq and
the Kurdish population in the north against
attacks by Iraqi regime forces.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Mediterranean
The UK and other EU member states are
developing, on the basis of the Barcelona
Declaration of 1995, closer links with 12
southern Mediterranean partners with the aim
of promoting peace and prosperity in the
region. Libya has also been invited to sign up
to the Declaration. Association Agreements
covering political dialogue, free trade and co¬
operation in a number of areas are already in
force with several Mediterranean countries.
Asia-Pacific Region
The UK has well-established relations with
Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, many
South East Asian nations, Australia and New
Zealand, and has defence links with some
countries in the region. British commercial
activity has developed through increased trade
and investment and the setting up of business
councils, joint commissions or industrial co¬
operation agreements. The UK is also taking
advantage of increased opportunities for English
language teaching, co-operation in science and
technology, and educational exchanges.
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process
was inaugurated in 1996. ASEM is intended to
foster closer economic and political ties
between EU countries and Brunei, China,
Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand
and Vietnam. The third ASEM conference
was hosted in Seoul by the Government of the
Republic of Korea in October 2000.
The UK and its EU and G8 partners
continue to encourage India and Pakistan to
join international nuclear non-proliferation
regimes (see p. 87) and reduce bilateral tension
over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
In 1998 Britain rejoined the South Pacific
Commission, having withdrawn from
membership in 1995. The Commission
provides technical advice and assistance to its
Pacific Island members, with which the UK
has long-standing and Commonwealth ties.
Hong Kong ■
In 1997 the UK returned Hong Kong to
Chinese sovereignty under the provisions of
the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which
guarantees that Hong Kong’s way of life,
including its rights and freedoms, will remain
unchanged for 50 years from the handover. As
set out in the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong is
a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China. The SAR Government enjoys a high
degree of autonomy, except in foreign affairs
and defence, which are the responsibility of
the Chinese Government in Beijing.
The UK is represented in Hong Kong by
one of the largest British diplomatic posts in
the world. It continues to have responsibilities
towards Hong Kong and the 3.5 million
British passport holders living there. Hong
Kong is the UK’s second largest export
market in Asia.
The Americas
The British Government considers that the
close transatlantic links between the UK, the
United States and Canada remain essential to
guarantee the security and prosperity of
Europe and North America.
The UK and the US co-operate very closely
on nuclear, defence and intelligence matters. As
founding members of NATO, Britain and the
US are deeply involved in Western defence
arrangements and, as permanent members of
the UN Security Council, work closely
together on major international issues. In
addition, there are important economic links.
The US is the UK’s largest trading partner—
UK exports of goods and services in 1999
amounted to £39.8 billion. Also, the UK and
US are each other’s biggest source of inward
investment—in 1998 UK investment in the US
represented 18.6 per cent of total foreign direct
investment, while 16 per cent of total US
overseas investment (41 per cent of US
investment in Europe) was in the UK.
Strong political and economic links are
maintained with Canada, with which the UK
shares membership of the Commonwealth,
NATO and other key international
organisations. The UK is the fourth largest
supplier of goods and services to Canada and
the second largest source of inward investment
(after the US).
Important British connections with Latin
America date from the participation of British

volunteers in the wars of independence in the
early 19th century. Greater democracy and
freer market economies in the region have
enabled Britain to strengthen its relations with
Latin America. The UK is now one of the
largest investors in the region after the United
States. The first summit of EU, Latin
American and Caribbean heads of state and
government (representing 48 countries) was
held in Rio de Janeiro at the end of June 1999,
with the aim of building a strategic
partnership between the two regions based
around a political, economic and cultural
dialogue. Progress towards this end will be
reviewed at the next summit in Spain in 2002.
The first UK/Caribbean Forum, held in
1998 in Nassau, Bahamas, marked the
beginning of a new longer-term process of co¬
operation between the UK and the countries
of the region. The second meeting, hosted by
the British Government, in London in May
2000, agreed initiatives to encourage new
investment in the Caribbean region, and to
promote educational and judicial links.
Africa
The UK Government is giving political and
practical support to efforts to prevent or end
African conflicts; promoting trade, reducing
debt and supporting development for lasting
prosperity; and supporting African
governments, organisations and individuals
espousing the principles of democracy,
accountability, the rule of law and human
rights. The first EU-Africa summit was held
in Cairo, Egypt, in April 2000.
Since the abolition of apartheid and the
election of an African National Congress
government in 1994, South Africa’s relations
with the UK have broadened into areas
ranging from development assistance to
military advice, and from sporting links to
scientific co-operation. There has also been a
steady flow of state and ministerial visits to
and from South Africa. The UK is South
Africa’s largest single trading partner, and
largest foreign investor. Both countries are
committed to build on this relationship by
promoting the further expansion of bilateral
trade and investment. A trade, development
and co-operation agreement between the EU
and South Africa was signed in October 1999,
providing for the creation of a free trade area
and for further substantial development
assistance from the EU.
PEACEKEEPING
The UN is the principal body responsible for
the maintenance of international peace and
security. In mid-2000 there were some 31,000
troops, military observers and police officers
from 85 nations deployed to 18 peacekeeping
operations around the world.
Britain and UN Peacekeeping
In 1999 the UK was the fifth largest
contributor to the UN’s peacekeeping costs,
meeting 6 per cent of the £750 million total.
The UK also provided manpower for UN-led
or UN-authorised operations in Kosovo
(troop numbers peaking at 11,000), Bosnia
(some 2,400) and East Timor (250); plus 194
police officers on loan in those three areas, and
15 military observers in Sierra Leone (see
p. 86); together with some 340 troops and
military observers in Cyprus, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Kuwait and Georgia.
Cyprus
The UK has a contingent of 306 troops in the
UN Force in Cyprus, established in 1964 to
help prevent the recurrence of fighting
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since
the hostilities of 1974, when Turkish forces
occupied the northern part of the island, the
Force has been responsible for monitoring the
ceasefire and control of a buffer zone between
the two communities.
Iraq/Kuwait
In 1991, UN Security Council Resolution 687
established a demilitarised zone extending 10
km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter
violations of the boundary and to observe
hostile or potentially hostile actions. The UK,
with the other permanent members of the

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Sierra Leone
In May 2000 there was a serious
deterioration in the security situation in
war-torn Sierra Leone, as several hundred
members of the UN peacekeeping mission
there were taken hostage by rebel forces of
the Revolutionary United Front. In
response, the UK Government rapidly
deployed to Sierra Leone around 600
British soldiers from the Parachute
Regiment, supported by a Royal Navy
amphibious group including 600 Royal
Marines. Their objectives were to evacuate
entitled personnel and to secure the main
airport near the capital, Freetown, while
the UN forces were built up. Having
achieved these aims, the British force was
withdrawn in June, although the UK
Government announced that a UK-led
international military advisory and training
team would be sent to help create new,
effective armed forces for Sierra Leone. In
preparation for this, short-term British
training teams were deployed from mid-
June to provide intensive infantry training
for new recruits. The UK has been the
largest donor to the peace process in Sierra
Leone, having committed about £70
million from the development budget.
At the end of August 2000, 11 British
training team members were taken hostage
by a rebel militia group. They were
rescued on 10 September when British
forces stormed the militia camp, killing
around 25 and suffering one fatality of
their own.
Security Council, contributes 11 personnel to
the UN Iraq/Kuwait observer mission
(UNIKOM).
Bosnia and Herzegovina
The UK supports the establishment of a
peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and is helping to implement
the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. The
Stabilisation Force (SFOR), around 21,000-
strong in mid-2000, comprises troops from
NATO nations and other contributing
countries, including Russia and a number of
other Partnership for Peace members (see
p. 82). The UK contributes some 2,200 troops
to SFOR. In addition, 80 UK police officers
are with the UN International Police Task
Force in Bosnia.
The main task of SFOR is to ensure
continuing compliance with the military
aspects of the Dayton Agreement, including
monitoring the actions of the armed forces
within the territory and inspecting weapon
sites. It also provides broad support to the
main organisations responsible for the civil
aspects of the Agreement, including the Office
of the High Representative, the International
Police Task Force, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, the OSCE and
the UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although the Dayton military requirements
have largely been met, many of the civil
aspects have yet to be fully implemented.
The UK is assisting the International
Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, which was
set up to try those indicted for war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. With other SFOR
contributors, British forces have detained
several of those indicted. As well as
contributing to the funding of the Tribunal,
the UK provides staff, information and
forensic science expertise.
The UK has committed to spend over £21
million in humanitarian and reconstruction aid
in 1999-2002; it also contributes through the
EU, OSCE and UN.
Georgia
The UK contributes seven military personnel
to the UN Observer Mission in Georgia,
which was established in 1993. Its mandate
includes monitoring a ceasefire between
Georgian government troops and rebels in the
Georgian region of Abkhazia.
Kosovo
From early 1998 there was increasing
international concern over the deteriorating
situation in the province of Kosovo in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY—
comprising Serbia and Montenegro) and its
implications for regional stability in
86
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
south-eastern Europe. Excessive repression by
Serbian security forces against the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population,
and terrorism by Kosovo Albanian extremists,
prompted widespread condemnation and calls
for a peaceful solution based on the territorial
integrity of the FRY and autonomy for Kosovo.
The situation worsened significantly at the
beginning of 1999. The Rambouillet peace
conference, held in Paris, broke up in mid-
March with the refusal of the Yugoslav
delegation to accept the settlement proposals.
Later that month the UK and other NATO
countries began intensive air operations
against targets in the FRY in pursuit of a
resolution to the Kosovo crisis.
In June 1999 the Yugoslav Parliament and
Government accepted peace terms presented
by special EU and Russian envoys. These
entailed the withdrawal of Serbian security
forces from Kosovo and deployment of an
international security presence (with NATO
participation at its core), enabling the return of
displaced persons and refugees to their homes.
With the subsequent authorisation of the UN, a
multinational force (KFOR—including around
10,000 British troops) began deploying into
Kosovo to begin the task of restoring peace to
the province. About 3,500 British troops were
still stationed in Kosovo in mid-2000, operating
in co-operation with the UN-led civilian
administration which is helping to establish
self-government in the province.
As well as military support, the UK has
contributed £68 million in humanitarian and
emergency assistance since January 1999, and
has pledged a further £22.5 million to alleviate
the consequences of the Kosovo crisis.
ARMS CONTROL
Because of the global reach of modern weapons,
the UK has a clear national interest in
preventing proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and promoting international control.
Weapons of Mass Destruction
Nuclear Weapons
The main instrument for controlling nuclear
weapons is the 1968 Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT), to which the British Government is
committed. The UK helped secure its
indefinite extension in 1995, and participated
in the sixth NPT review conference held in
New York in April-May 2000.
The UK was also involved in the
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), which it signed in 1996 and
ratified in 1998. The CTBT, with its
permanent verification system, will come into
force when it has been ratified by 44 named
states. The British Government is pressing for
negotiation of a treaty banning future
production of fissile material for use in nuclear
weapons.
While large nuclear arsenals and risks of
proliferation remain, the Government
considers that the UK’s minimum nuclear
deterrent (see p. 99) remains a necessary and
continuing element of British security.
Biological Weapons
The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
provides for a worldwide ban on such
weapons, but there are no effective compliance
mechanisms. The UK and its EU partners are
continuing to press in international
negotiations to strengthen the Convention
with a Protocol containing measures to
improve compliance and transparency,
including mandatory declarations of key
facilities and challenge inspections.
Chemical Weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which came into force in 1997, provides for a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. The
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons is responsible for verification.
During the negotiations the UK contributed
to drawing up effective verification provisions.
All the necessary British legislation is in place
to license the production, possession and use
of the most toxic chemicals and to implement
the Convention’s trade controls.
Conventional Armed Forces
The UK continues to work with its NATO
partners and other European countries to
87
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
develop and improve agreements to enhance
stability in Europe in the light of the changed
security environment. The main agreements
reached are:
• the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CFE) Treaty (signed originally in 1990
and revised at an OSCE summit in
November 1999),9 which limits the
numbers of heavy weapons in the countries
of NATO and the former Warsaw Pact,
and includes a verification regime. The
CFE Treaty is widely regarded as a
linchpin of European security;
• the Vienna Document, developed under
the auspices of the OSCE, which is a
politically binding agreement by 54 states
on the promotion of stability and
openness on military matters in Europe;
it contains a wide range of confidence-
and security-building measures, and
verification arrangements; and
• the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which
provides for the overflight and
photography of the entire territory of the
27 participating states to monitor their
military capabilities and activities. 1 he
Treaty, which is being provisionally
applied, requires ratification by Russia
for entry into force.
The UN Register of Conventional Arms,
which came into effect in 1992, is intended to
allow greater transparency in international
transfers of conventional arms and to help
identify excessive arms build-ups in any one
country or region.
Landmines
The UK signed the Ottawa Convention
banning the use, production, trade, transfer

anti-personnel mines by October 1999. It has a
programme to support humanitarian demining
activities, which is focused on helping affected
countries develop the capacity to clear
landmines and improving the co-ordination of
international demining resources.
Export Controls
The UK participates in all of the international
control regimes which govern the export of
conventional arms, technology associated with
weapons of mass destruction and ‘dual-use’
goods (those having a legitimate civil use as
well as a potential military application).
In July 1997 the British Government issued
new criteria for assessing licence applications
for arms exports, one of which is that licences
will not be granted if there is a clearly
identifiable risk that weapons might be used
for internal repression or international
aggression. At the same time it banned the
export of certain equipment for which there is
clear evidence that it has been used for torture
or other abuses; it also declared its
commitment to preventing British companies
from manufacturing, selling or procuring such
equipment and to pressing for a global ban.
In 1998 EU member states agreed on a Code
of Conduct on Arms Exports. It includes a
mechanism whereby before any member state
grants a licence which has been denied by
another member state for an essentially
identical transaction, it must first consult the
member state which issued the denial.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The UK Government has stated its
commitment to working for improvements in
human rights standards across the world and,
in July 2000, published its third annual human
rights report describing the activities and
initiatives pursued during the previous year.
The £5 million Human Rights Project Fund,
launched in 1998, provides flexible and direct
financial assistance for grassroots human
rights projects around the world. The UK has
also supported the establishment of a strong
International Criminal Court to try cases of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes. The Government signed the Court’s
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Statute in November 1998 and hopes to be
among the first 60 states to ratify it.
International Conventions
United Nations
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter. Expressions
of concern about human rights do not,
therefore, constitute interference in the
internal affairs of another state.
The UK Government promotes the
standards set out in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which was adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948. Since this is
not a legally binding document, the General
Assembly adopted two international covenants
on human rights in 1966, placing legal
obligations on those states ratifying or
acceding to them. The covenants came into
force in 1976, the UK ratifying both in the
same year. One covenant deals with economic,
social and cultural rights and the other with
civil and political rights. Other international
instruments to which the UK is a party
include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• the rights of the child;
• torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
• the prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery; and
• the status of refugees.
Council of Europe
The UK is also bound by the Council of
Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
(ECHR), which covers areas such as:
• the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
• the right to marry and have a family;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
• freedom of expression, including
freedom of the press;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
• the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment.
The rights and obligations of the ECHR are
being enshrined in UK law upon the
implementation of the Human Rights Act
1998 in October 2000 (see p. 211).
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (in Warsaw)
promotes participating states’ adherence to
commitments on human rights, democracy
and the rule of law, and takes a lead in
monitoring elections within the OSCE area.
The Office provides a forum for expert
exchanges on the building of democratic
institutions and the holding of elections in
participating states. It also provides expertise
and training on human rights, constitutional
and legal matters, and promotes practical
measures to strengthen civil administration.
CRIME AND TERRORISM
The UK supports international efforts to
combat illegal drugs, working with producer
and transit countries, especially those where
drug production and trafficking represent a
direct threat to the UK. Over 50 drug liaison
officers are stationed in UK missions in key
countries, in co-operation with the host
authorities. Working with its EU partners, the
UK is helping Latin American, Caribbean and
Central Asian states to stem the transit of
drugs across their territories. The UK is also
involved in the United Nations drug control
structure, and is one of the largest
contributors to the UN International Drug
Control Programme. It also participated in the
negotiation of the EU drugs strategy for
2000—04, which was endorsed by the
European Council in December 1999.
The UK contributes to international efforts
to counter financial crime, for example
89
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
through its membership of the Financial
Action Task Force against money laundering,
and its support for regional anti-money
laundering groups.
Together with its EU partners, the UK is
confronting serious and organised
international crime through, for example, the
establishment of the European Police Office
(EUROPOL) to support investigations and
operations conducted by national law
enforcement agencies. EUROPOL powers
and duties are set out in the EUROPOL
Convention, which entered into force in 1998.
EU member states also belong to the
International Criminal Police Organisation
(INTERPOL). UK liaison with INTERPOL
is provided by the National Criminal
Intelligence Service (see p. 217).
The British Government has stressed its
condemnation of all terrorist acts, its
opposition to concessions to terrorist demands
and its commitment to ensuring that terrorists
do not benefit from their acts. It works
bilaterally with other like-minded
governments, and multilaterally through the
UN, EU and G8, to promote closer
international co-ordination against terrorism.
The UK is party to a series of international
counter-terrorism conventions agreed since
1963. It signed the most recent—the
International Convention for the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism—in January
2000, and the British Government hopes to
ratify it in 2001.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The UK Government’s development policy is
focused on achieving the international
development targets agreed by the world’s
governments at UN conferences in the 1990s,
particularly the goal of lifting 1 billion people
out of‘abject’ poverty by 2015. This involves
action in key areas such as debt relief,
sustained growth, and support for developing
country governments committed to poverty
reduction.
UK official development assistance will rise
to 0.33 per cent of GNP in 2003—04. In line
with this, the budget for the Department for
International Development (DFID) will
increase by 6.2 per cent to almost £3.6 billion
in 2003-04, the highest ever level in real
terms.
Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods
The UK is promoting broad-based economic
growth in poorer countries, while also trying
to ensure that poor people can participate in,
and benefit from, such growth. The intention
is to stimulate trade and private investment,
both domestic and foreign.
The DFID also promotes regulation of
utilities and financial markets to ensure fair
competition and to prevent exploitation of
market power. Well-regulated banks, credit
co-operatives and stock markets boost
domestic savings and promote private sector
investment. Development assistance is
provided at the national level in support of
economic reform programmes, including the
reform of public expenditure and taxation.
Poor people’s access to land, resources and
markets is particularly significant for growth,
equity and poverty reduction. The DFID is
encouraging land reform, including security of
land tenure, in South Asia and Africa, and is
supporting rural transport projects to improve
access to markets in Mozambique, Nepal and
Vietnam. It is also aiming to improve training
in business and vocational skills, appropriate
technologies and market information.
Debt Relief
The UK advocates action to address the debt
burdens of the poorest, most indebted
countries. Very high levels of unpayable debt
constrain the ability of countries to tackle
poverty effectively. In 1999 the British
Government backed the revision of the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt
initiative so that it provides wider and faster
relief to countries committed to poverty
reduction. Twenty HIPC countries are
expected to receive relief by the end of 2000.
All aid debts owed to the UK by the
poorest countries have already been cancelled.
In December 1999 the Government
announced that it would provide full debt
relief on the remaining ECGD (see p. 425)
debt for countries when they qualified for the
HIPC initiative.

Good Governance and Human Rights
The DFID considers that effective
governance is necessary for eliminating
poverty, and is targeting issues such as
democratic accountability (bringing poor
people into the democratic process);
fundamental freedoms (including rights to
education, health and an adequate livelihood);
the tackling of corruption; better revenue and
public finance management; access to
improved public services; and personal safety
and security in the community with access to
justice.
Women’s Empowerment
An estimated 70 per cent of the world’s poor
are women and girls. Removing gender
discrimination and supporting measures to
improve women’s equality are fundamental to
reducing poverty. A priority in UK assistance
is the promotion of women’s basic education,
together with policies aimed at breaking down
inequalities between women and men in
economic, political, social and cultural life.
The proportion of DFID spending
Source: Department for International Development
commitments aimed at gender equality
doubled from 23 per cent in 1994—95 to 46 per
cent in 1998-99.
Education
About 113 million children around the world
do not go to school and many others drop out
before attaining useful levels of basic
education. Almost 900 million adults are
illiterate, two-thirds of them being women.
DFID resources are being focused on basic
and primary education. Over three-quarters of
UK current commitments to education—
which exceed £800 million—are now in this
area; two-thirds of these are concentrated in
11 of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan
Africa and South Asia.
The UK is working with other
governments to widen access to schools
(particularly for girls), to improve the quality
of education offered, and to keep children in
school for the whole primary cycle. Another
priority is the establishment of training in
work-related skills. The DFID’s Skills for
Development Programmes are providing £25
million to this end.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Health
DFID aid is focusing on:
• tackling the priority diseases of the
poorest, and strengthening access to care,
services and products;
• efficient health systems;
• a more effective global response to
HIV/AIDS;
• a healthier and safer physical and social
environment; and
• social sector policies that will affect
positively health and fertility.
The DFID also works with UN
organisations to help meet international
targets on issues such as safer pregnancy, child
survival, contraception and other reproduction
health services, and HIV/AIDS.
The Environment
The UK aims to support sustainable
livelihoods of poor people through
community-based approaches and national
action promoting more secure access to
natural resources and the better management
of common property resources such as
forests, land, fresh water and fisheries. It also
aims to improve access by poor people to
energy, water, transport, communications and
shelter, through infrastructure development
and the encouragement of private sector
investment.
The UK is helping countries to set up their
own national strategies for sustainable
development and to meet their commitments
under the multilateral environmental
agreements for climate change, biodiversity,
desertification and the depletion of the ozone
layer.
The Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
and the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal
Protocol (MFMP) support developing countries
and countries with economies in transition in
Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia to
meet the additional costs of their commitments
under the multilateral environmental
agreements. Since their inception, the UK has
committed £215 million to the GEF and US
$95 million to the MFMP.
Conflict Reduction and Humanitarian
Assistance
Violent conflict is one of the biggest barriers
to development in many of the world’s poorest
countries. Of the 40 poorest countries, 24 are
either in the midst of armed conflict or have
only recently emerged from it. The DFID’s
objectives are to reduce the tensions that lead
to conflict, limit the means of waging warfare,
and provide the humanitarian assistance and
support needed to help societies cope and
eventually rebuild.
In helping to deal with disasters, the UK’s
aims are not only to save lives through the
provision of financial, material and technical
assistance, but also to rebuild communities
and livelihoods, and to make countries less
vulnerable to future hazards. The DFID
provides humanitarian assistance through
governments, UN agencies, the Red Cross,
non-governmental organisations and, when
necessary, through direct service delivery.
During 1999 and the first half of 2000 the
UK responded to a number of natural
disasters, including flooding in Mozambique
and India, earthquakes in Turkey and
droughts in Asia and Africa. Humanitarian
responses have also been made to the effects of
conflict in Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra
Leone.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of foreign policy. It is headed by
the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,
who is responsible for the work of the F CO and
the Diplomatic Service (see p. 61). Diplomatic,
consular and commercial relations are
maintained with 184 countries (compared with
136 in 1968), and the UK has 223 diplomatic
posts worldwide. British diplomatic missions
also employ some 7,840 locally engaged staff.
Staff overseas deal with political, commercial
and economic work; entry clearance to the UK
and consular work; aid administration; and
information and other activities, such as culture,
science and technology.
92
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
The FCO’s executive agency, Wilton Park
International Conference Centre in West
Sussex, contributes to the solution of
international problems by organising
conferences in the UK, attended by
politicians, business people, academics and
other professionals from all over the world.
An important function of the FCO is to
promote understanding of British foreign
policies and to project an up-to-date image of
the UK worldwide, beyond the reaches of
government-to-government diplomacy. Key
elements of FCO-funded public
communication work include:
• publications, television and radio
programmes, the FCO and Planet Britain
websites (www.fco.gov.uk and
www.planet-britain.org), and various
other information initiatives;
• scholarship schemes for overseas
students (see p. 141) and programmes for
influential foreign visitors;
• the BBC World Service (see p. 270); and
• the British Council (see below).
The FCO is also developing a network of
Internet-based information kiosks, placed in
strategic locations around the world, to provide
interactive access to British government services
and information about the UK.
The London Radio Service and British
Satellite News, both funded by the FCO, are
used extensively by overseas radio and
television broadcasters to supplement their
news coverage.
Other Departments
Several other government departments are
closely involved with foreign policy issues.
The DFID administers the UK’s
development aid programmes. The Ministry
of Defence maintains military liaison with the
UK’s NATO and other allies. The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has
an important influence on international trade
policy and commercial relations with other
countries, including EU member states. The
joint work of the FCO and DTI in support of
British trade and investment overseas is co¬
ordinated through British Trade International
(see p. 424). HM Treasury is involved in
British international economic policy and is
responsible for the UK’s relations with the
World Bank and other international financial
institutions.
BRITISH COUNCIL
The British Council is the UK’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas. Its
purpose is to promote a wider knowledge of
the UK and the English language and to
encourage cultural, scientific, technological
and educational co-operation between the UK
and other countries. Its work also supports the
FCO’s objective of increasing respect and
goodwill for the UK. The Council:
• helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in the UK;
• enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaches English and promotes its use;
• provides library and information services;
• supports legal reform overseas and works
to enhance the protection of human
rights;
• promotes scientific and technical
training, research collaboration and
exchanges; and
• encourages appreciation of British arts
and literature.
The Council works in 243 towns and cities
in 110 countries. It runs 222 libraries and
information centres, which have about 370,000
members borrowing 8.9 million books, videos
and tapes each year. Each year the Council co-
funds around 700 science collaborations and
administers over 625,000 British professional
and academic examinations. In addition, it
manages or supports 3,000 events each year
with its international partners in the fields of
the performing arts, film and television, visual
arts, literature and design. The Council is
financed partly by a grant from the FCO and
partly by income from revenue-earning
activities, such as English language teaching,
the administration of examinations, and
bilateral and international aid contract work.
Some of the training and education
93
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
programmes organised by the Council as part
of the British aid programme receive funding
from the DFID.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by
British experts, encourages cultural exchange
visits, and organises academic interchange
between British universities and colleges and
those in other countries.
The British aid programme has helped
fund certain Council programmes, such as:
• recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
• secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
• organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The British Council’s Central Bureau for
International Education and Training aims to
raise standards in UK education and training
through international partnership and
exchange. This is achieved by the promotion
of international mobility, vocational training
and development, linking and exchange
programmes, lifelong learning and
multilateral partnerships. The Bureau is
government-funded and is the UK national
agency for many EU education and training
programmes.

The purpose of the UK’s armed forces is to defend the country and its people,
the Overseas Territories and British interests both at home and abroad. The
UK is a member of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), and its
armed forces assist in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations throughout
the world.
UK SECURITY
Strategic Defence Review
In 1998 the Government published a
comprehensive Strategic Defence Review,
which reassessed the UK’s security interests
and defence needs, and considered how the
roles, missions and capabilities of the armed
forces should be adjusted to meet the new
strategic realities. The Review concluded that
there was no immediate or direct military
threat to the UK or its Overseas Territories,
but the end of the Cold War had introduced
instability and uncertainty. There remained
the potential threat of the proliferation of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
organised crime and the break-up of existing
states with attendant ethnic and religious
conflict. In the new security environment, the
Review concluded that Britain needs to have
the capability to send highly trained and well-
equipped forces very quickly around the
world to prevent or contain crises; and that it
should plan to be able to carry out either two
medium-scale deployments (one of which
could involve war-fighting) at the same time
(similar to the size of the British contributions
to NATO operations in Bosnia and Kosovo),
or one large-scale deployment.
The planned changes outlined in the
Review are also designed to reinforce the
UK’s contribution to international security
through NATO, the European Union (EU)
and the Western European Union (WEU—
see p. 72), and through other international
organisations such as the United Nations
(UN—see p. 71) and the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE—see p. 75).
Defence Missions
The Review redefined the defence missions
which underpin the UK’s defence planning.
These are:
• peacetime security;
• security of the Overseas Territories;
• defence diplomacy;
• support to wider British interests;
95
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
• peace support and humanitarian
operations;
• responding to regional conflicts both
inside and outside the NATO area; and
• responding to strategic attack on NATO.
Defence White Paper 1999
The Government published a Defence White
Paper in December 1999 in which it examined
whether the assumptions about the strategic
context and the longer-term defence
requirements set out in the Strategic Defence
Review still held good. The Review had
recognised that in the post-Cold War world
the strategic environment would increasingly
be altered by the arrival of new and often
unexpected operational challenges. The
Government believes that this judgment has
been confirmed, with British armed forces
conducting a range of operations across the
world, some at short notice. Between May
1997 and August 2000, 39 operations were
planned and co-ordinated.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
The UK is a founding member of NATO,
membership of which is the cornerstone of
British defence policy and most of the UK’s
forces are assigned to it. The Alliance
embodies the transatlantic relationship that
links North America and Europe in a unique
defence and security partnership. The number
of members was increased to 19 with the
accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland in March 1999. The Alliance expects
to invite other European states to join the
organisation as and when the inclusion of
these countries would serve the political
strategic interests of the Alliance and also
enhance security and stability in Europe.
Adaptation of NATO
NATO’s initiatives are intended to adapt the
organisation to the changed security
environment in Europe. The Partnership for
Peace programme, aimed at enhancing both
political consultation and practical military co¬
operation between NATO and Partner states,
and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council,
which provides the framework for co-operation
between NATO and its Partner countries
(including former members of the Warsaw
Pact), are key to the development of the new
security relationship between NATO and other
countries in Europe. The 1999 Washington
summit approved new measures that will
increase the ability of Partner countries to
operate effectively in NATO-led crisis
management operations. These include greater
involvement of the 27 non-NATO states in the
political consultation and decision-making
process and in the operational planning and
command arrangements. NATO is also
committed to the sustained development of its
relationship with Russia and Ukraine, following
the historic agreements signed in 1997 that laid
down unprecedented levels of consultation and
co-operation.
NATO is also undergoing a period of
internal adaptation, including the
development of the European Security and
Defence Identity (under which NATO assets
and capabilities could be made available for
EU- or WEU-led operations), a major review
of the military command structure and the
implementation of the Combined Joint 1 ask
Force concept. At the Washington summit the
allies approved an updated strategic concept
for NATO to reflect the changed political
environment and the launch of an initiative to
improve its defence capability to ensure the
effectiveness of future multinational
operations in all Alliance missions.
EUROPEAN DEFENCE
While NATO remains the foundation of
Britain’s security and defence policy, the
Government believes that operations such as
in Bosnia and Kosovo (see p. 86) have
demonstrated that Europe needs to be able to
make both a stronger and more coherent
contribution to the Alliance and improve the
collective capability to undertake EU-led crisis
management operations where NATO as a
whole is not engaged. At the Helsinki
European Council in December 1999, on the
basis of proposals developed by the UK, Italy
and France (see also p. 81), EU member states
committed themselves to modernising their
96
8: DEFENCE
armed forces such that by 2003 they would
have a pool of deployed units from which a
force up to corps levels (50,000 to 60,000
personnel, together with appropriate air and
naval elements) could be assembled for a
particular crisis management operation. This
force would be sustainable for at least a year.
DEFENCE TASKS
The UK and its Overseas Territories
The armed forces are responsible for
safeguarding Britain’s territory, airspace and
territorial waters. They also provide for the
security and reinforcement of the Overseas
Territories and support for the civil authorities
in both the UK and the Overseas Territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy aims to ensure the integrity
of the UK’s territorial waters and the
protection of its rights and interests in the
surrounding seas, and of British interests
around the world. The maintenance of a 24-
hour, year-round presence in waters around
the British Isles provides reassurance to
merchant shipping, as well as security of the
seas. The RAF also contributes to maritime
requirements, for instance through the
Nimrod force, which provides air surveillance
of surface vessels and submarines.
Land Defence
The British Army aims to provide, through
either the deployment of the whole or
appropriate elements of its available forces,
the capability to defend the UK and its
Overseas Territories. In addition, the Army
is committed to tasks such as providing
military aid to support humanitarian
operations, responding to regional conflict
outside the NATO area and contributing
forces to counter a strategic attack on NATO.
Air Defence
Air defence of the UK and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the Air Surveillance and Control System
(ASACS) supplemented by the NATO
Airborne Early Warning Force, to which the
RAF contributes six aircraft. The RAF also
provides five squadrons of Tornado F3 air
defence aircraft, supported by tanker aircraft
and, in wartime, an additional F3 squadron.
Royal Navy air defence destroyers can also be
linked to the ASACS, providing radar and
electronic warfare coverage and surface-to-air
missiles. Ground-launched Rapier missiles
defend the main RAF bases. Naval aircraft
also contribute to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
The UK maintains garrisons in Gibraltar, the
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus, the Falkland
Islands and Brunei. Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities for
NATO in the western Mediterranean, while
Cyprus provides strategic communications
facilities as well as a base for operations in the
eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The
garrison on the Falkland Islands is a tangible
demonstration of the Government’s
commitment to uphold the right of the
islanders to determine their own future (see
p. 77). The garrison in Brunei is maintained at
the request of the Brunei Government. In
addition, a jungle warfare training unit is
maintained in Belize.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces provide support to the Royal
Ulster Constabulary (RUC—see p. 216) in
maintaining law and order and countering
terrorism. The number of units deployed to the
Province at any one time is dependent on the
prevailing security situation. The Royal Navy
patrols territorial waters around Northern
Ireland and its inland waterways in order to
deter and intercept the movement of terrorist
weapons. The Royal Marines provide troops to
meet Navy and Army commitments, while the
RAF provides elements of the RAF Regiment
and Chinook, Wessex and Puma helicopters.
Other Tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
97
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
• military assistance to civil ministries, for
example in maintaining the essentials of
life in the community, providing fishery
protection duties and helping in the fight
against drugs;
• military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies; and
• military search and rescue.
Britain and its NATO Allies
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO and are available for WEU and
peacekeeping operations. Permanent
contributions are made to NATO’s Immediate
Reaction and Rapid Reaction Forces in the
Atlantic, the English Channel and the
Mediterranean. The UK also contributes to
NATO’s Maritime Augmentation Forces,
which are held at the lowest state of readiness
and in peacetime comprise ships mainly in
routine refit or maintenance.
The main components of the Fleet available
to NATO are:
• three aircraft carriers operating Joint
Force Harrier aircraft (see p. 99) and Sea
King anti-submarine helicopters;
• 32 destroyers and frigates, and 22 mine
counter-measure vessels;
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines;
and
• amphibious forces, including a
commando brigade, two assault ships and
a helicopter carrier.
For information on Britain’s independent
nuclear deterrent see p. 99.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
component of NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Forces. Capable of deploying up to four
NATO divisions, the ARRC is commanded by
a British general, and some 55,000 British
regular troops are assigned to it. Britain also
provides two of the ten divisions available to
the Corps—an armoured division of three
armoured brigades stationed in Germany, and
a division of three mechanised brigades based
in Britain. An air-mobile brigade, assigned to
one of the Corps’ multinational divisions, is
also sited in the UK.
Air Forces
The RAF contributes to NATO’s Immediate
and Rapid Reaction Forces. Around 100
aircraft and 40 helicopters are allocated to
them. Tornado F3, Harrier and Jaguar
aircraft, and Rapier surface-to-air missiles
form part of the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe’s Immediate Reaction Force, while
Harrier, Jaguar and Tornado GR1/4 aircraft
provide offensive support and tactical
reconnaissance for the Rapid Reaction Force.
Chinook and Puma helicopters supply troop
airlift facilities for the ARRC or other
deployed land forces. The RAF provides
Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and search
and rescue helicopters. The three Tornado
GR1 squadrons stationed in Germany will be
redeployed to the UK by 2002. Two Harrier
offensive support squadrons were withdrawn
from Germany to the UK in 1999.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks to promote the UK’s wider
security interests may be undertaken by
British forces unilaterally or multilaterally
under UN, NATO, EU and WEU auspices.
Contingents are deployed on UN operations
in Cyprus, Georgia, East Timor, Bosnia,
Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of
Congo and on the Iraq/Kuwait border. Over
Iraq (see p. 83), Tornado GR1/4s and
Jaguars, supported by VC-lOs, are policing
the no-fly zones to ensure that Iraq does not
resume repression of minorities and that it
does not threaten its neighbours. The Royal
Navy is deployed to the Gulf to enforce UN
sanctions against Iraq. A substantial British
contingent is deployed in Kosovo to help
implement a peace agreement following the
conclusion of air operations over the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999 (see p. 87).
The number of operations against
trafficking in illicit drugs has increased in
recent years, for example in the Caribbean,
98
8: DEFENCE
where a Royal Navy destroyer or frigate works
closely with the authorities of the United
States, the Overseas Territories and the
Regional Security System to combat drug
trafficking. Although primary responsibility
for this task rests with the local law
enforcement agencies or other government
departments, the armed forces assist where
they can do so without detriment to the
performance of their other military tasks.
In the past three years, British troops have
taken part in international evacuation or
humanitarian relief operations in Rwanda,
Somalia, Angola, Eritrea, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone,
Mozambique, East Timor, the Caribbean and
Central America.
NUCLEAR FORCES
Although the Trident submarine force is
retained, the UK and other members of
NATO have radically reduced their reliance
Defence diplomacy—the use of defence
assets to build and promote stability and
assist in the development of democratically
accountable armed forces—is an
established mission in UK defence
planning. British service personnel and
civilians working in defence are involved
in a range of non-operational activities
including;
• help in verifying arms control
agreements (see p. 87);
• outreach programmes of bilateral
assistance and co-operation with
Russia and other countries in Central
and Eastern Europe, Africa and
Central Asia in areas such as English
language training, advice on the
management of defence training and
short-term military training teams to
assist in modernising and reforming
armed forces; and
• training of some 4,000 military and
civilian students from over 100
countries each year at UK defence
establishments.
on nuclear weapons.The UK is committed to
pressing for progress in the negotiations
towards mutual, balanced and verifiable
reductions in nuclear weapons (see p. 87).
When satisfied that verified progress has been
made towards the goal of global elimination of
nuclear weapons, the Government has said
that it will ensure that the British nuclear
weapons are included in the talks.
The Government undertook a fundamental
re-examination of all aspects of Britain’s
nuclear posture in the Strategic Defence
Review and concluded that fewer than 200
operationally available nuclear warheads were
needed—a reduction of one-third. As a result,
the UK now has only one Trident submarine
on patrol at a time. It carries a reduced load of
up to 48 warheads compared with the previous
announced ceiling of 96. The submarine’s
missiles are not targeted and it is normally at
several days’ ‘notice to fire’.
FORCE STRUCTURES AND
CAPABILITIES
To achieve its policy objectives, the UK needs
forces with a high degree of mobility, at
sufficient readiness and with a clear sense of
purpose, for combat operations, conflict
prevention, crisis management and
humanitarian activities. These forces must
therefore be flexible and able to undertake the
full range of military tasks.
Measures to increase a joint-service
approach to defence, outlined in the strategic
review, have led to the establishment of:
• Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, a pool of
deployable forces (including 50 warships
and support vessels, four army brigades
and 100 combat aircraft), able to carry
out a range of short-notice missions from
war-fighting to peacekeeping operations,
and to provide a first stage of a larger
deployment;
• Joint Force Harrier, a joint command of
Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft
able to operate from aircraft carriers or
land bases;
• a new helicopter command of some 350
battlefield helicopters—Navy commando
helicopters, Army helicopters (including
99
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Apache attack helicopters when they
enter service from 2001) and RAF
support helicopters;
• a joint nuclear, biological and chemical
defence regiment; and
• a joint doctrine and concepts centre for
the development of defence doctrine.
These initiatives should aim to improve
the Services’ ability to work together
efficiently and effectively and to project power
to potential troublespots and crises. As well as
addressing the equipment requirements for
the Services (see p. 101), the Review sought to
improve the way they are supported. Such
measures include:
• a Defence Logistics Organisation, under
a new post of Chief of Defence Logistics,
covering all three Services;
• the establishment of two logistic lines of
communication, each with a Joint Force
Logistic Component Fleadquarters which
will each be able to provide support to an
operation of the type conducted in Bosnia
and in Kosovo; and
• the restructuring of the management and
organisation of the Defence Medical
Services (including closer integration
with the National Health Service) and a
commitment to spend £140 million more
on medical support to deployed forces in
the period to March 2002.
Royal Navy
The focus for the Navy will continue to move
from large-scale open-ocean warfare to force
projection and offshore operations in
conjunction with the other Services, based on:
• two new large aircraft carriers, capable of
operating up to 50 aircraft and helicopters,
which will enter service from 2012;
• a force of 32 destroyers and frigates, with
the Type 42 destroyer being replaced by
the Type 45 from 2008, and an increased
number of mine counter-measure ships
(22); and
• ten hunter-killer submarines, each able to
fire Tomahawk land-attack missiles by
2008.
Army
Among measures aimed at improving
mobility, firepower and the projection of
forces are:
• an increase in the number of armoured
or mechanised brigades from five to six
through the conversion of the airborne
brigade to a mechanised brigade;
• the creation of a new, powerful air
assault brigade (combining two battalions
of the Parachute Regiment), together
with the new Westland Apache attack
helicopter;
• the creation of an additional armoured
reconnaissance regiment from an existing
armoured regiment, which will be
brought back from Germany;
• converting the tank regiments from eight
units to six larger ones, with significantly
more personnel and tanks; and
• increasing the operational utility of the
Territorial Army (TA—see p. 102).
RAF
The emphasis of the new plans is on the
ability to deploy appropriate types of aircraft
rapidly to crises. Measures include:
• the procurement of new air-to-air, anti¬
armour and air-to-surface missiles for
Tornado, Harrier and Eurofighter
aircraft;
• improving the capability of the Nimrod
reconnaissance aircraft to support both
peacekeeping and war-fighting
operations; and
• modernising the strategic airlift
capability of the air transport fleet, in the
short term by the leasing of four Boeing
C-17 aircraft and, later in the decade, by
the acquisition of a planned 25 Airbus
A400M aircraft.
DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
Modern equipment is essential if one of the
key aims of Britain’s force restructuring
programme is to be achieved, namely that of
100
8: DEFENCE
increasing the flexibility and mobility of the
armed forces.
Improvements for the Royal Navy
equipment programme include:
• the introduction of the fourth Trident
submarine and the building of the
Astute-class attack submarines;
• new aircraft, replacing the current Sea
Harriers, for the two new aircraft carriers;
• a modernised destroyer and frigate fleet,
including the introduction of the
Type 45 destroyer which will deploy an
anti-air missile system developed with
France and Italy;
• new amphibious shipping to strengthen
the amphibious force; and
• the Merlin anti-submarine helicopter.
The Army front line is being strengthened
by:
• the introduction of the Challenger 2 main
battle tank;
• Westland Apache attack helicopters
equipped with new anti-tank missiles;
• improved Rapier and new Starstreak air
defence missiles;
• new bridging equipment to increase
mobility and flexibility; and
• a range of advanced surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance equipment.
Improvements for the RAF include:
• upgrading the Tornado GR1 fleet;
• upgrading the Jaguar aircraft until it is
replaced, together with the Tornado F3
aircraft, by the Eurofighter;
• new Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft;
• orders for new air-launched missiles and
guided bombs; and
• the introduction of EH 101 and additional
Chinook support helicopters and of
improved Hercules aircraft.
Defence Procurement
Some ^10 billion is spent each year on
military equipment, including the
procurement of spares and associated costs.
When assessing options, consideration is given
to the initial costs of a project and to those
necessary to support it throughout its service
life. Competition for contracts takes place
wherever possible. Among the measures to
improve the procuring of defence equipment,
identified by the Strategic Defence Review’s
‘smart procurement’ initiative, are the
introduction of integrated teams, including
representatives from industry, to control a
project throughout its life. Equipment is to be
acquired incrementally, with the basic
equipment entering into service quickly and
then being upgraded as technology improves.
All defence projects are run on ‘smart
procurement’ lines. The involvement of the
private sector through the Public-Private
Partnerships (see p. 405) is a major element of
procurement strategy: under this policy,
capital investment with a value of some £\
billion is being undertaken.
International Procurement Collaboration
The UK is a member of NATO’s Conference
of National Armaments Directors, which
promotes equipment collaboration between
NATO nations, and in the WEU’s Western
European Armaments Group, which is the
main European forum for the discussion of
armaments matters. The UK is also a founder
member of OCCAR, an armament co¬
operation organisation formed with France,
Germany and Italy for managing joint
procurement activities. Current collaborative
programmes in which the UK participates
include:
• development of the Eurofighter (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
• a maritime anti-air missile system
(France and Italy);
• a battlefield radar system (France and
Germany);
• the EH101 helicopter (Italy);
• a multi-role armoured vehicle (France
and Germany); and
• the large transport Airbus A400M
aircraft (Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Turkey).

Commissioned Ranks
Commissions in the armed services, either by
promotion from the ranks or by direct entry
based on educational and other qualifications,
are granted for short, medium and long terms.
All three Services have schemes for school,
university and college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Commando Training Centre,
Lympstone; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities. Courses
of higher training for officers, emphasising the
joint approach to the tactical and operational
levels of conflict, are provided at the Joint
Services Command and Staff College.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks
vary widely in length and terms of service.
Subject to a minimum period, entrants may
leave at any time, giving 18 months’ notice (12
months for certain engagements). Discharge
may also be granted on compassionate or
medical grounds.
In addition to their basic training, non¬
commissioned personnel receive
supplementary specialist training throughout
their careers. Study for educational
qualifications is encouraged and service trade
and technical training leads to nationally
recognised qualifications. New vocational
training and educational initiatives to improve
recruitment and retention were announced in
the Strategic Defence Review. The Army
Foundation College offers a 42-week course
combining military training and the
opportunity to acquire national qualifications.
The course is intended to attract high-quality
recruits who will go on to fill senior posts in
front-line roles.
Reserve Forces
The reserve forces serve alongside the regular
forces and are integral to the ability to expand
the Services in times of crises. For example,
under the current commitment, around 10 per
cent of UK forces in Bosnia are reservists at any
one time. In particular, reserves can provide
skills and units not available or required in
peacetime. The reserves include former
members of the regular armed forces liable for
service in an emergency (regular reserve) and
volunteer reserves, recruited directly from the
civilian community—the Royal Naval Reserve,
the Royal Marines Reserve, the TA and the
Royal Auxiliary Air Force.
The main contribution of reserves—both
individuals and formed units—is to support
regular forces in clearly identifiable and
worthwhile roles. This requires their full
integration into regular formations and ready
availability for service, where necessary
through selective compulsory call-out during
situations short of a direct threat to the UK.
Reserves should also be able to serve in peace
support operations. A new Reserve Training
Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell near
Nottingham—another Strategic Review
initiative—has been set up for this purpose.
Under the Review, Royal Naval and RAF
volunteer reserve numbers will increase, and,
while the strength of the TA has been reduced
from 56,000 to 41,200, it is more closely
integrated with the Regular Army.
ADMINISTRATION
The Defence Budget
The defence budget for 2000-01 is £22.8
billion, rising to £23.4 billion in 2001-02,
102
8: DEFENCE
£24 billion in 2002—03 and ^24.8 billion in
2003-04. This represents the first planned
increase in real terms in the defence budget
since the mid-1980s. The Ministry of Defence
believes that this will allow it to build on the
measures outlined in the Strategic Review,
while also taking into account the lessons
learned from recent operations and other
priorities such as the retention of personnel.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence is both a
Department of State and the highest-level
military headquarters. The Secretary of State
for Defence is responsible for the formulation
and conduct of defence policy and for
providing the means by which it is conducted.
Three junior ministers support the Secretary
of State and have responsibilities for
operational and policy issues for all armed
services; defence equipment procurement,
collaboration and research; and defence estate,
environmental and public services
respectively.
Ministers are in turn supported by two key
officials: the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)
and the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) of
State. The CDS is the professional head of the
armed forces and the principal military
adviser to the Secretary of State and the
Government. The PUS is the Government’s
principal civilian adviser on defence and has
primary responsibility for policy, finance and
administration of the department. The PUS is
also personally accountable to Parliament for
the expenditure of all public money voted for
defence purposes.
A number of senior-level committees
underpin the management of defence:
• the Defence Council, the highest
departmental committee with a range of
powers vested in it. Chaired by the
Secretary of State, it provides the formal
legal basis for the conduct of defence;
• the Defence Management Board, which
provides senior-level leadership and
strategic management of defence and is
chaired mainly by the PUS; and
• the Chiefs of Staff Committee, chaired
by the CDS and the forum in which
collective military advice is given to the
Secretary of State and the Government.
An integrated civilian and military staff
supports ministers, senior officials and top-
level committees in the day-to-day
management of defence. The department is
divided into a number of budget areas
responsible for the major functions of the
ministry. These include the operational and
personnel arms of each Service; the new
Defence Logistics Organisation, which
brought together the separate service logistic
areas into a single integrated logistic
organisation; and the Defence Procurement
Agency, which is responsible for the
acquisition and support of defence equipment.
A large proportion of the Ministry of
Defence’s support activities are undertaken by
defence agencies.

The population of the United Kingdom is rising, partly due to increases in life
expectancy and partly as a result of net inward migration. The number of older
people has grown and is projected to continue to do so. The proportion of lone
parent households with dependent children has increased considerably since
the 1960s, as has the number of people living alone. Women have contributed
heavily to the growth of the labour force and have increased their presence
among those in power, politics and decision-making. Holidays abroad are now
commonplace and communication has been accelerated globally by television,
telephone and the Internet.
POPULATION PROFILE
The population of the UK in mid-1999 was
estimated to be less than 59.5 million, the
second largest in the European Union (EU).
The majority of people (about 84 per cent)
lived in England, with Northern Ireland having
the smallest population of the four countries at
1.7 million (3 per cent). The population density
in England is the highest, with about 381
inhabitants per square kilometre.
The population of the UK has increased by
just over half since the beginning of the 20th
century. Mid-1998-based projections suggest
that it will rise to over 63.5 million by 2021.
Longer-term projections suggest the
population will peak around 2036 and then
gradually start to fall.
Age and Gender
The UK has an ageing population. The
proportion of the population aged 65 and over
has increased from one person in 20 in 1901 to
just over one in six in 1999. Projections
suggest that the population will become
gradually older with the median age expected
to rise from just over 37 years in 1998 to
nearly 42 years by 2021. In 1999 there were
1.4 million more children aged under 16 than
people of pensionable age. Mid-1998-based
projections suggest that by 2008 the
population of pensionable age will exceed the
number of children.
Although more boys are born each year
than girls, in 1999 there were about 900,000
more women in the UK than men. Men
outnumbered women in the younger age
groups, until around the age of 50 the
numbers of men and women were about equal.
Above this age women increasingly
outnumbered men, and there were nearly four
times the number of women as men aged 90
and over. In 1999 there were around 8,000
centenarians in the UK, with more than eight
women to every man. While the numbers are
104
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
still very small, the rate of increase recently
has been large—about 7 per cent a year—and
the number has roughly doubled every decade
since 1950. Population projections suggest
that by 2036 there could be nearly 50,000
centenarians in the UK.
Births
In 1999 there were about 700,000 live births in
the UK, representing 11.8 live births per
1,000 population. Almost 39 per cent of all
births occurred outside marriage, around five
times the level in 1966. Most of the increase in
births outside marriage since the late 1980s
has been in births registered jointly by both
parents living at the same address, many of
whom are cohabiting couples. In 1999 about
eight in ten births outside marriage in England
and Wales were jointly registered by both
parents; three-quarters of these were to
parents living at the same address.
Mortality
Life expectancy in the UK is increasing by
around two years every decade for men and
around one-and-a-half years for women. At
birth the expectation of life is now
approaching 75 years for males and 80 years
for females.
There were about 629,000 deaths in the UK
in 1999, a death rate of 10.6 per 1,000
population. There was a decline in mortality
rates at most ages during the 20th century,
particularly among children. Rising standards
of living and developments in medical
technology are among the factors that have
contributed to improvements in mortality. The
infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under
one year old per 1,000 live births) was 6.3 for
boys and 5.0 for girls in 1999. In general, in all
age groups death rates are higher for men than
women, and this helps to explain the gender
imbalance among the older population.
Changes in the causes of death have
accompanied this improvement in mortality.
Sharp peaks in mortality occurred around the
First World War, when deaths were mainly
due to respiratory and infectious diseases.
Such diseases now account for a relatively
small proportion of all deaths. They have been
overtaken by causes such as cancer and
circulatory diseases which are much less
responsive to modern preventive and curative
medicine and whose incidence is concentrated
at older ages.
HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES
The number of households in Great Britain
has risen, from 16.3 million in 1961 to 23.9
million in 1998, as the population has increased
at the same time as average household size has
fallen. These changes are linked to the rapid
increase in the number of one-person
households, which now comprise nearly one in
three of all households, more than double the
proportion in 1961. The proportion of lone
parent households with dependent children
has increased threefold since 1961, while over
the same period there has been a decline in the
proportion of households consisting of a couple
with dependent children. In 1998-99 just over
one in ten people in private households lived
alone, while seven in ten people were in a
household headed by a couple.
Marriage, Divorce and Cohabitation
In 1998 there were just under 305,000
marriages in the UK, one of the lowest
numbers in the 20th century. The increasing
prevalence of cohabitation helps to explain this
decline. Of the marriages that took place in
1998, about 180,000 were first marriages for
both partners, less than half the number in the
peak year of 1970. A significant proportion of
marriages—slightly over two in five—
represent remarriages for one or both partners.
The civil wedding ceremony was introduced in
1837. Since 1993 civil ceremonies have
outnumbered religious ones, and by 1998 three
in five weddings in Great Britain were
conducted with civil ceremonies. More first
marriages have a religious than a civil
ceremony, while for second and subsequent
marriages civil ceremonies outnumber
religious ones by four to one. In addition, in
recent years there has been a growing trend
towards getting married abroad.
Although there has been a long-term rise in
the number of divorces in the UK, in recent

years the increase appears to have levelled off,
with the number granted in 1998—160,000—
being below the peak of 1993. The divorce rate
for both men and women in England and Wales
fell to 12.9 per 1,000 married people in 1998,
the lowest rate since 1989. The divorce rate in
Scotland is lower than in England and Wales.
Cohabitation has become increasingly
common in the last two decades. It is
estimated that in 1996 there were nearly 1.6
million cohabiting couples in England and
Wales. The proportion of all non-married
women aged 18 to 49 who were cohabiting in
Great Britain more than doubled in the 20
years to 1998-99, from 11 per cent to 29 per
cent. The latest available, 1996-based,
projections suggest that the trend towards
increasing cohabitation will continue in the
future, although the overall proportion of
people living in couples is expected to fall.
Family Formation
In general, fertility rates for older women
have increased since the early 1980s while
those for younger women have declined.
Women in their late twenties have the
highest fertility rates—in 1999 there were 98
births per 1,000 women aged 25 to 29. The
fertility rate for those aged 35 to 39 has risen
fastest, nearly doubling between 1981 and
1999 to 39 births per 1,000 women in this age
group, although it still remains lower than in
1961. This delay in childbearing may be
related to increased female participation in
education and the labour market.
The average completed family size has
fallen from a recent peak of nearly 2.5 children
per woman for women born in the mid-1930s
and will inevitably fall below two children per
woman for women born around 1960.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s fertility fell
below the level needed for long-term natural
replacement of the population. Average
completed family size is expected to decline
and level off at 1.8 children per woman for
women born after 1970.

their parental home to study, work or set up
their own home. During the second half of the
20th century there was a movement of
population from the coal, shipbuilding and
steel industry areas in the north of England
and Wales to the south of England and the
Midlands.
International Migration
In 1998 an estimated 178,000 more people
migrated to the UK than from the UK. This
was the highest on record and nearly double the
figures for 1997 (92,000) and for 1996 (93,000).
The net gain of foreign citizens in 1998 was a
record 181,000 migrants and more of the net
inflow was from the Old Commonwealth and
the EU than in previous years.
Immigration into the UK is largely
governed by the Immigration Act 1971 and
the Immigration Rules made under it. The
Rules set out the requirements to be met by
those who are subject to immigration control
and seek entry to, or leave to remain in, the
UK. The 1971 Act has been amended by
subsequent legislation, including the
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The
implementation of the 1999 Act has started
and will continue throughout 2000-01. Its
major provisions include:
• modernising the immigration control with
the aim of helping it to deal with
increasing passenger traffic and make
enforcement of the control more effective;
• introducing measures to tackle
clandestine entry, including a new civil
penalty for drivers of lorries and other
vehicles found to contain clandestine
107
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
entrants, and strengthening the carriers’
liability regime;
• replacing the existing multiple rights of
appeal with a single, comprehensive right
of appeal, and enhancing the role of the
Immigration Appeal Tribunal;
• creating new arrangements to support
asylum seekers who are considered to be
in genuine need, involving a new national
system, separate from the main benefits
system. Accommodation will be provided
on a ‘no choice’ basis, with other support
generally being provided in kind;
• strengthening enforcement of the
immigration control by extending powers
of immigration officers, extending and
strengthening the existing immigration
offences of deception and facilitation, and
extending fingerprint powers; and
• providing greater safeguards for those
who are detained, including putting the
management and operation of detention
centres on a statutory footing.
In implementing the Act, priority has been
given to the provisions relating to the new
asylum support arrangements, and to the civil
penalty for carrying clandestine entrants. The
phased implementation of both began in April
2000. The single, comprehensive right of
appeal is due to be introduced in October 2000
to coincide with the implementation of the
Human Rights Act 1998 (see p. 211).
The 1999 Act also places a duty on
registration officers to report to the Home
Office those marriages suspected of having
been arranged for the purpose of evading
immigration controls. The purpose of these
measures is to prevent the abuse of the
immigration system by those who are
prepared to enter into marriage simply as a
means to obtain settlement in the UK.
In 1999 some 97,000 people were accepted
for settlement, 27,000 more than in 1998.
When analysed by nationality there were
substantial increases in acceptances from
elsewhere in Europe and from Africa (see
Table 9.2). Consequently, Africa, which
accounted for nearly 30 per cent of total
acceptances in 1999, replaced the Indian sub¬
continent as the leading region, followed by
the rest of Asia and then Europe.
The 1999 Act also introduced changes to
the Marriage Act 1949. These changes are
due to come into effect from 1 January
2001 and consist of:
• a common 15-day notice procedure
(which may only be waived in
exceptional circumstances on
application to the Registrar-General);
• a requirement for both parties to the
marriage to personally give notice of
their intention to marry, including a
declaration of their nationality; and
• powers for registration officers to
request evidence of name, age,
marital status and nationality from
couples underpinned by a power to
refuse to give authority for the
marriage when a registration officer is
not satisfied that a person is free,
legally, to contract the marriage.
Under the Immigration Rules, nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial
entities must obtain a visa before they can
enter the UK. Other nationals subject to
immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or settle in the UK.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest or other specified
British diplomatic post in a person’s home
country.
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU member states plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may
work in the UK without restriction. Provided
they are working or able to support themselves
financially, EEA nationals have a right to
reside in the UK.
Asylum
The UK has a tradition of granting protection
to those in need, and is a signatory to the 1951
United Nations Convention, and Protocol,
relating to the Status of Refugees. These
provide that refugees lawfully resident should
enjoy treatment at least as favourable as that
accorded to the indigenous population. In the

late 1980s the total started to rise dramatically
from around 4,000 a year during 1985 to 1988
to 44,800 in 1991, and reached a record 71,000
in 1999, 54 per cent more than in 1998. The
main nationalities applying for asylum in the
UK in 1999 were people from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (16 per cent), Somalia
(11 per cent), Sri Lanka (7 per cent),
Afghanistan (6 per cent) and Turkey (4 per
cent). In the first six months of 2000,
applications for asylum averaged 6,145 a
month. This was 22 per cent higher than in
the same period a year earlier. An average of
570 applications a month were received from
people from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia between January and June 2000; an
average of 500 applications a month were from
Sri Lanka and 440 from China.
In the UK an estimated 32,300 asylum
decisions were made in 1999, of which around
36 per cent were grants of asylum, double the
proportion in 1998. Most failed asylum
seekers continued to appeal against their
refusal decision. Nearly 19,500 appeals were
determined by independent adjudicators in
1999, and only 5,280 (27 per cent) were
successful.
On 3 April 2000 the National Asylum
Support Service took over responsibility for
the provision of support for those asylum
seekers who are destitute. The new
arrangements apply to those seeking asylum on
or after this date. Support will be provided
until the asylum claim is finally decided. Those
granted refugee status or who are allowed to
remain exceptionally on humanitarian grounds
are entitled to claim public funds.
Support under this new system is provided
principally in kind, with vouchers issued to
enable asylum seekers to obtain essential living
needs. Where accommodation is provided this
is on a no choice basis and dispersal will be
throughout the UK.
NATIONAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS
Citizenship
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with the UK;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (now known as ‘Overseas
Territories’—see p. 75); and
109
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the UK and Colonies who did
not acquire either of the other
citizenships when the 1981 Act came into
force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in the UK if his or her
mother or, if legitimate, father is a British
citizen or is settled in the UK. A child
adopted in the UK by a British citizen is also a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in the UK is generally a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the
citizenship of a child born abroad to a British
citizen in Crown service, certain related
services, or in service under an EU institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in the UK who do
not automatically acquire such
citizenship at birth, or who have been
born abroad to a parent who is a citizen
by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in the UK, except for people
from Gibraltar who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens connected with the
Falkland Islands;
• by registration for certain women who
are, or have previously been, married to
men who served in the defence of Hong
Kong during the Second World War;
• by registration for certain British
nationals who are ordinarily resident in
Hong Kong; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required to
have a sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh
or Scottish Gaelic; they must in addition
intend to have their main home in the UK or
be employed by the Crown, or by an
international organisation of which the UK is
a member, or by a company or association
established in the UK.
In 1999 around 55,000 people were granted
British citizenship in the UK; 4,000
applications were refused. A little over one in
four of all successful applications were from
citizens of Indian subcontinent countries, with
Africa accounting for almost one in four and
the rest of Asia representing about one in five.
Ethnic Groups
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in the UK, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities. The Irish have long
formed a large section of the population.
Jewish refugees who came to the UK towards
the end of the 19th century and in the 1930s
were followed by other European refugees
after 1945. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and Indian subcontinent dates
principally from the 1950s and 1960s, when
the Government encouraged immigration as a
means of addressing labour shortages, while
many people of South Asian descent entered
the UK as refugees from Kenya, Malawi or
Uganda in the 1960s and 1970s.
Analysis of the Labour Force Survey by the
Office for National Statistics has found that in
1999-2000, almost 4 million people in Great
Britain described themselves as belonging to a
non-White ethnic group, about one person in
15. In general, these groups tend to have a
younger age profile than the White population,
reflecting past immigration and fertility
patterns. The Bangladeshi group has the
youngest age structure: 41 per cent of
Bangladeshis were under the age of 16 in
1999-2000, compared with 20 per cent of
people in the White group.
The 1991 Census revealed that members of
minority ethnic groups were heavily
concentrated in the most populous areas of
110
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
England, with relatively small numbers in
Scotland and Wales. Over half lived in the
South East of England. The highest
concentration was in the London borough of
Brent, where nearly 45 per cent of the local
population were from non-White groups.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the Black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made in some respects over the last 20
years in tackling racial disadvantage in the
UK. For example, young people from some
non-White ethnic groups are leading the way
for participation in education. At the age of
16, young people from ethnic minority groups
are more likely to be in full-time education
than their White counterparts. For example,
in 1998, 91 per cent of Indian, and 82 per cent
of Black, 16 year olds were in full-time
education, compared with 67 per cent of
White people of the same age.
Furthermore, many individuals have
achieved distinction in their careers and in
public life, and the proportion of ethnic
minority members occupying professional and
managerial positions is increasing. In July
2000 there were nine Members of the House
of Commons from ethnic minority groups.
The Home Office has overall responsibility
within the Government for race equality
policy and the legislation that is in place to
help achieve that. Economic, environmental,
educational and health programmes of central
government and local authorities exist to
combat disadvantage. There are also special
allocations that channel extra resources into
specific projects including, for example, the
provision of specialist teachers for children
needing English language tuition. The
Government promotes equal opportunities
through training programmes, including
provision for unemployed people who need
training in English as a second language.
Race Relations Legislation
The Race Relations Act 1976, which applies to
Great Britain, makes it unlawful for anybody

to discriminate on racial grounds in relation to
employment, training and education, the
provision of goods, facilities and services, the
provision of housing and certain other
specified activities. It provides for individuals
who have been discriminated against to bring
proceedings and claim damages in
employment tribunals (in employment and
training cases) or designated county courts.
Parallel legislation was introduced in Northern
Ireland in 1997.
The Race Relations (Amendment) Bill,
currently before Parliament, would, if enacted,
outlaw discrimination in public authority
functions not previously covered by the 1976
Act. This would mean that law enforcement,
whether by the police, local authorities or tax
inspectors, would for the first time be subject
to race discrimination laws. Certain public
appointments and the termination and terms
and conditions of public appointments would
also be subject for the first time to race
discrimination laws, as would the
111
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
implementation of government policies and
services. The Bill would also place a general
duty on public authorities to work towards the
elimination of unlawful discrimination and
promote equality of opportunity and good
relations between people of different racial
groups. The general duty would be supported
by specific duties to be set out in regulations
and they would be enforceable by the
Commission for Racial Equality. The
Commission would also be empowered to
provide guidance in the form of statutory
Codes of Practice.
It is a criminal offence to incite racial
hatred under the provisions of the Public
Order Act 1986. In order to protect ethnic
minority communities from intimidation, the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (see p. 214)
created new offences of racial harassment and
racially motivated violence. It also introduced
court orders which prohibit named individuals
from harassing the community, including
racially motivated harassment. In addition,
measures are being introduced as a result of
the inquiry into the murder of Stephen
Lawrence (see p. 219).
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE),
established by the 1976 Act, is a publicly
funded independent organisation working in
Great Britain with both the public and private
sectors to provide advice about the Race
Relations Act, and how to tackle racial
discrimination and promote racial equality. It
also aims to help individuals with complaints
about racial discrimination; in 1999-2000
about 11,000 people called the CRE for advice
on such matters, and 1,563 applications were
made for assistance with cases. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important campaigning and educational role,
and has issued codes of practice on
employment and housing. The CRE can also
undertake or fund research. A Commission for
Racial Equality for Northern Ireland was
established in 1997, with similar powers. In
October 1999 this was merged into the
Equality Commission Northern Ireland,
which also covers other grounds of unlawful
discrimination.
The CRE supports the work of around 100
racial equality councils. These are autonomous
voluntary bodies set up in most areas to
promote equality of opportunity and good
relations at the local level. The Commission
helps to pay the salaries of officers employed
by the racial equality councils, most of which
also receive funds from their local authorities.
It also gives grants to ethnic minority self-help
groups and to other projects run by, or for the
benefit of, ethnic minority communities.
Language
English is the main language spoken in the
UK, and is also one of the most widely used in
the world. Estimates suggest that 310 million
people speak it as their first language, with a
similar number speaking it as a second
language. It is an official language in a large
number of overseas countries, and is widely
used internationally as the main language for
purposes such as air traffic control,
international maritime communications and
academic gatherings.
Modern English derives primarily from one
of the dialects of Old English (or Anglo-
Saxon), itself made up of several Western
Germanic dialects taken to Britain in the early
5th century. However, it has been very greatly
influenced by other languages, particularly
Latin and, following the Norman conquest, by
French—the language of court, government
and the nobility for many years after 1066.
The re-emergence of English as the standard
language of England was marked by events
such as the Statute of Pleading in 1362, which
laid down that English was to replace French
as the language of law. The 14th century saw
the first major English literature since Anglo-
Saxon days, with works such as Piers Plowman
by William Langland and the Canterbury Tales
by Geoffrey Chaucer. However, there
remained great regional variations in the
language, and spellings were not always
standardised.
Following the introduction of the printing
press to England by William Caxton in the late
15th century, there was a considerable
flowering of English literature in the 16th and
112
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
early 17th centuries. William Shakespeare,
Edmund Spenser and Christopher Marlowe
produced work that is still famous today,
while Cranmer’s prayerbook and the
Authorised (‘King James’) Version of the
Bible also date from this period. About this
time, too, translations of Latin, Italian and
other European works into English vastly
expanded the English language. The work of
early lexicographers, of whom the most
famous was Samuel Johnson (1709-84), led to
greater standardisation in matters such as
spelling.
ECONOMIC CHANGES
Marked improvements in the UK’s standard
of living took place during the 20th century.
The average annual growth of the economy as
measured by gross domestic product (GDP) in
volume terms was 2.5 per cent between 1951
and 1999. Within the UK GDP per head
varies. In 1998 it was highest in London, at
over £16,200 per head, followed by the South
East and East. Northern Ireland had the
lowest regional GDP per head, at £9,400,
followed by the North East and Wales. In
1998 GDP per head in London and the South
East, relative to the UK average, each rose by
about 2 percentage points, while it fell or
remained about the same in all other regions.
Income and Wealth
Real household disposable income per head
doubled between 1971 and 1999. At the same
time the gap between those on high and low
incomes grew, especially during the 1980s,
although the gap stabilised in the 1990s. Lone
parents tend to be over-represented among
those on low incomes. In 1997-98, 43 per cent
of lone parent families were in the bottom fifth
of the income distribution.
Wages and salaries remain the main source
of household income for most people,
although the proportion they contribute has
declined, from 52 per cent in 1987 to 49 per
cent in 1999. Occupational pensions have
become an increasingly important source of
income for pensioners. Although average
benefit income has grown in real terms, the
proportion of income from benefits has fallen,
particularly among those who have retired
recently. The proportion of recently retired
pensioners’ income from occupational
pensions was 28 per cent in 1997-98.
The tax and benefit system redistributes
income from households on high incomes to
those on lower incomes. Households make
payments through direct and indirect taxes,
and social security contributions, while
benefits are received through both cash
payments and provision of benefits in-kind,
such as the National Health Service.
Households with high incomes tend to pay
more in taxes than they receive in income,
while those on low incomes benefit more than
they are taxed. The average original income of
the top fifth of households—£51,000—is 17
times the average of the bottom fifth—£2,900.
Benefits and, to a lesser extent, taxes reduce
this inequality so that the ratio for final
income is four to one. The types of household
that tend to be net beneficiaries from the
redistribution of taxes and benefits include
lone parent families, families with three or
more children, and retired households. Wealth
continues to be much more unequally
distributed than income, with the most
wealthy 10 per cent of the population owning
half the total marketable wealth of the
household sector in 1996.
Social Exclusion
Social exclusion is the term given to what can
happen when individuals or areas suffer from a
combination of linked problems, such as
unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor
housing, bad health and family breakdown. A
Social Exclusion Unit was set up in the
Cabinet Office in 1997 to co-ordinate and
improve government action to reduce social
exclusion in England. There is close liaison
with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
devolved administrations which have their own
strategies for tackling social exclusion. So far
the Unit has produced reports on truancy and
school exclusion, rough sleeping, poor
neighbourhoods, teenage pregnancy and 16 to
18 year olds not in employment, education or
training. Actions are being implemented across
all departments to deal with the problems
identified in the reports.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
SOCIAL TRENDS
Women and Men
Employment and Income
The economic and domestic lives of women
changed considerably in the 20th century.
Women took an increasingly important role in
the labour market. In 1971, 91 per cent of
men of working age, compared with 56 per
cent of women, were economically active in
the UK. By 2000 women’s activity rates had
increased to 73 per cent of women of working
age, while men’s activity rates slowly declined
in the 1980s and 1990s to 85 per cent in 2000.
The increase in the female labour force
during the 20th century came mainly from a
strong rise in the participation of married
women. By spring 2000, 75 per cent of
married or cohabiting women were
economically active.
Despite the growth in female employment
in recent years, women and men still tend to
work in different occupations. Women
employees outnumber men in clerical and
secretarial occupations by nearly three to one
while there are more than twice as many men
as women managers and administrators.
However, in recent years there has been some
erosion of the traditional gender differences—
the proportion of managers and
administrators who were women increased
from 30 per cent in spring 1991 to 33 per cent
in spring 2000.
The average individual income of men was
higher than that of women in all age bands in
1996-97, largely because of their higher levels
of earnings, self-employment income and their
longer hours of working. The gap between
male and female earnings has been closing but
the differential remains, with female full-time
employees earning around four-fifths of the
corresponding male hourly rate. The ‘pay gap’
increases with age. In addition, men are more
likely than women to have certain investments
such as pensions.
Public Policy
In March 2000 there were a record 122 women
MPs in the Westminster Parliament,
representing 19 per cent of the total number of
seats, although this remains below the EU
average of 25 per cent for lower houses.
Women account for 37 per cent of the
Members of the Scottish Parliament, 40 per
cent of the Welsh Assembly and 13 per cent of
the members of the Legislative Assembly in
Northern Ireland. In September 2000 four
women sat in the UK Cabinet, including the
Leader of the House of Lords, who is also the
Minister for Women. She chairs the Cabinet
Sub-committee on Women’s Issues. Support is
provided by the Women’s Unit in the Cabinet
Office. In 1999 the Women’s Unit carried out a
consultation exercise, Listening to Women, to
compile an audit of what matters to women in
the UK. The Government is also seeking to
improve communications with women’s
organisations. Following a government review
in 1998, the Women’s National Commission
(an advisory body) was restructured with the
aim of improving its representativeness,
responsiveness and influence: some 200
women’s organisations have registered as
partners, including both small grassroots
organisations and large national ones.
In Scotland, three out of 11 Cabinet
ministers are women and the Scottish
Executive has established an Equality Unit to
take forward its work on equality.
The Government is working to ensure that
the perspective of women is automatically
taken into account in the development of
government policies. It is also encouraging the
development of‘family-friendly’ employment
policies and practices (see chapter 11).
Measures include:
• the Working Families Tax Credit (see
p. 176);
• introducing the national minimum wage
to improve the pay of low paid workers,
the majority of whom are women;
• extending maternity leave and improving
maternity pay for low paid workers and
the self-employed;
• facilitating a financial industry action
group, within the Financial Services
Authority, with the aim of improving
financial services for women;
• increasing the availability, affordability
and quality of childcare through the
National Childcare Strategy and the
114
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Childcare Tax Credit to help families on
low incomes; and
• giving help through the New Deal
programmes for lone parents, partners of
the unemployed and the over 50s (see
p. 152).
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes
discrimination between men and women
unlawful, with certain limited exceptions, in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services, and protects complainants and their
supporters from victimisation. Discrimination
against married people and discriminatory job
recruitment advertisements are also unlawful.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with
men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, work which is rated as
equivalent, or work which is of equal value.
Parallel legislation on sex discrimination and
equal pay applies in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC), an independent statutory body, has
the duties of working towards the elimination
of sex discrimination; promoting equality of
opportunity between women and men;
promoting equality of opportunity in the fields
of employment and vocational training for
people who intend to undergo, are undergoing
or who have undergone gender reassignment;
and keeping under review the working of, and
proposing amendments to, the Sex
Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act. It
provides advice to individuals and in some
cases provides legal representation for
individuals to bring sex discrimination and
equal pay claims. The EOC runs an ‘Equality
Exchange’, with around 700 members, which
enables employers to exchange information on
good practice. Further details of the
Government’s equal opportunities policies
may be found in chapter 6, p. 61.
The Voluntary and Community Sector
Across the UK many thousands of voluntary
and community organisations exist, ranging
from national bodies to small local groups.
Serving the community through volunteering
is a long-established tradition in the UK. One
in five adults interviewed in the 1998 survey
of British Social Attitudes said that they had
taken part in unpaid charitable work in the
previous year and one in eight said they had
done unpaid voluntary work for religious or
church-related activities. Many volunteers are
involved in work which improves the quality
of life in their local communities, or give their
time to help organise events or groups in areas
as diverse as social welfare, education, sport,
heritage, the environment and the arts.
The Government is keen to encourage
productive partnerships between the statutory
and voluntary sectors and also wants to see a
greater public involvement in community life.
An Active Community Unit has been
established in the Home Office to encourage
this, raise the profile of the voluntary and
community sector within government and
across society, and co-ordinate the work of
government departments in this area.
In order to provide a general framework for
enhanced relationships between government and
the voluntary and community sector, ‘Compacts’
have been drawn up in all four countries of the
UK in consultation with the sector, taking
account of the distinct traditions of voluntary
activity in each constituent nation. Monitoring
the implementation and progress of the
Compacts within government has been assigned
to a ministerial group. Other public bodies and
local government are being encouraged to adopt
or adapt Compacts for use locally. As part of the
Compact for England, in May 2000 two Codes
of Good Practice were published: the Code on
Funding which aims to improve the funding
relationship between the Government and the
voluntary and community sector and the Code
on Consultation and Policy Appraisal which
aims to improve the way in which the
Government consults the sector. Further codes
on volunteering, community groups, and Black
and other minority ethnic voluntary and
community organisations will follow.

department, is responsible for the registration,
monitoring and support of organisations that
are charitable in law. The Commission does not
make grants. At the end of 1999 there were
about 163,000 ‘main’ charities registered with
the Commission, that is excluding subsidiaries
or branches of other charities. The charitable
sector is a major part of the economy. The
combined annual income of these ‘main’
charities registered with the Charity
Commission for England and Wales in 1999
was just over £23 billion. The majority of these
organisations had a recorded annual income of
under £10,000; these represent nearly three-
quarters of registered charities but less than 2
per cent of the total income. The financial
wealth of registered charities, measured by
annual income, is concentrated in a few very
large charities. The Commission gives advice to
trustees of charities on their administration,
and has a statutory responsibility to ensure that
charities make effective use of their resources.
Recent legislation has strengthened the
Commissioners’ powers to investigate and
supervise charities. These include newr
measures to protect charities and donors from
bogus fund-raisers and a new framework for
charity accounts and reports.
Funding
Voluntary organisations may receive income
from several sources, including:
• central and local government grants;
• contributions from individuals,
businesses and trusts;
• earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
• fees from central and local government
for those services which are provided on
a contractual basis.
The introduction of the National Lottery
(see p. 117) has given charities and voluntary
organisations the opportunity to secure
substantial new funding for projects across a
range of activities.
CAF (Charities Aid Foundation) is a
registered charity that works to increase
resources for the voluntary sector in the UK
and overseas. As well as providing services
that are both charitable and financial, CAF
undertakes a comprehensive programme of
research and publishing, and is established as a
leading source of information on all aspects of
the sector.
Another valuable source of revenue for
charities is through tax relief and tax
exemptions. The Gift Aid scheme provides
tax relief on single cash donations, while
under the Payroll Giving scheme, employees
can make tax-free donations to charity from
their earnings. In March 2000 the Budget
included a number of measures to encourage
donations to charity (see p. 407).

9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
National Lottery
National lotteries have existed in Britain
intermittently since 1569. Since the National
Lottery was launched in 1994 most people in
Britain have played it. It currently comprises a
twice weekly draw, a weekly draw and
scratchcard games.
Tickets or scratchcards are available from
over 35,000 retail outlets. Camelot Group pic,
a private sector consortium, has the franchise
to run the Lottery until the end of September
2001. In the 1998-99 Family Expenditure
Survey 56 per cent of households reported
participating in the Saturday or Wednesday
night lottery draws during the two-week
diary-keeping period following interview.
Those households that played spent an
average of £3.80 a week on the Lottery in
1998-99.
Of every pound spent on the National
Lottery, around 28 pence goes to good causes.
By the beginning of April 2000 some £9.0
billion had been raised for good causes and
over 57,000 awards for £7.7 billion had been
made. By October 2001 the amount raised for
good causes is expected to have reached at
least £11.4 billion, around £2.4 billion more
than originally forecast. Almost three-quarters
of the awards have been for less than £50,000.
Lottery money was originally shared equally
among five good causes—sport, charities, the
arts, heritage and projects to mark the year
2000 and the beginning of the third
millennium. The National Lottery Act 1998
provided for a sixth good cause covering
education, health and environment projects:
the New Opportunities Fund. In the past
grants have been awarded to several large
prestigious projects but recently the number
of awards going to small projects has doubled.
The Awards for All scheme, run jointly by
lottery distributors in England and Scotland,
offers small grants of between £500 and
£5,000 to small local groups to support arts,
sport, heritage, charitable and other
community activities. The scheme will
continue until at least 2002.
A five-person National Lottery
Commission regulates the Lottery. Its duties
are to protect players’ interests, to ensure the
Lottery is run with propriety, and—subject to
satisfying those two criteria—to maximise the
amount raised for good causes. It will also
select the next Lottery operator and is able to
appoint a not-for-profit operator.
Leisure Trends
The most common leisure activities are home-
based, or social, such as visiting relatives or
friends. Television viewing is by far the most
popular leisure pastime, with average viewing
time for all people aged four and over being
around 25 hours a week. Nearly all households
have one television set or more, and almost
nine in ten have a video recorder. In 1998-99,
13 per cent of households in the UK
subscribed to satellite television while 9 per
cent subscribed to cable television. Despite the
increasing number of television channels in
recent years, the proportion of people
listening to the radio has remained fairly
stable, with about nine in ten adults reporting
listening in the four weeks prior to interview.
Listening to music is another popular
activity. Purchases of compact discs (CDs)
have risen very rapidly to 176 million in 1998
when they represented 84 per cent of all
album sales. The proportion of households
with a CD player grew from 15 per cent in
1989 to 68 per cent in 1998-99.
Other popular pursuits include reading, do-
it-yourself home improvements, gardening and
going out for a meal, for a drink or to the
cinema. Eating out has increased in popularity.
In 1999 British people spent, on average, £5.63
per person per week on food (excluding
alcohol) eaten outside the home. This is
reflected in the increase of 2,000 between 1996
and 1999 in the numbers of restaurants and
takeaway shops operating in the UK.
Nowadays ‘fast food’ outlets—selling, for
example, hamburgers, pizza, chicken and the
traditional fish and chips—are widespread in
the UK’s high streets. In restaurants one can
eat food from many other countries—Chinese,
Indian, Italian and French are among the most
widely available cuisines. Sandwich bars and
coffee shops are common, especially in towns
and cities.
Car ownership increased steadily from
three out of ten households in Great Britain in
the early 1960s to seven out of ten households

in 1999. Whereas the proportion of
households with one car changed little from
the end of the 1960s, the proportion with two
or more cars grew from 2 per cent in the early
1960s to 27 per cent in 1999.
Technological Change
People in Britain are continually expanding
their access to, and use of, modern
communication technology for both leisure
and business purposes. Two items of
technology that have become increasingly
common for leisure and business use are
mobile telephones (see p. 376) and computers.
In 1998-99 a quarter of households in the UK
owned at least one mobile telephone. The
number of households owning home
computers in the UK has also increased
considerably, from just under one in six
households in 1986 to a third in 1998-99. In
the first quarter of 2000, 25 per cent of
households had access at home to the Internet,
compared with an average of 19 per cent in
1999-2000. By July 2000, 45 per cent of adults
in Great Britain had accessed the Internet at
some time, the equivalent of 20.4 million
adults. Men were more likely to have ever
used the Internet than women. The
proportion steadily decreased with age—from
69 per cent of all 16 to 24 year olds to 6 per
cent of those aged 75 and over. Although there

is a range of technology available, virtually all
those—98 per cent—who used the Internet
for personal use had done so mostly or
exclusively using a computer. Among those
who had accessed the Internet, seven in ten
adults had done so from their own home.
Holidays
In 1998, 56 million holidays of four nights or
more were taken by residents of Great Britain,
36 per cent more than in 1971. The number of
holidays taken in Great Britain has been
broadly stable over the last decade while the
number taken abroad has grown. Spain
remained the most popular holiday destination
abroad in 1998, followed by France. The
United States was the third most popular

destination and the most popular non-
European destination. Among adult residents
of Great Britain who spent their holiday (of
four nights or more) in Great Britain in 1998,
the West Country was by far the most popular
destination, accounting for over a quarter of
such holidays. Scotland and southern England
were the next most popular destinations.

Education and Training after 16 133
All children in the United Kingdom are required by law to receive full-time
education. After the age of 16, education is no longer compulsory and young
people have a range of options. About 70 per cent of young people stay on in
full-time education, either at school or at further education colleges. Around
10 per cent of 16 year old school leavers go into work and the remainder are
guaranteed a place on government training programmes. In 1998-99 in England
and Wales around 285,000 young people were in government work-based
training. In Scotland, there were 38,400 young people in work-based training
(including 13,900 Modern Apprenticeships) in 1999-2000. Nearly a third of all
young people enter higher education.
In recent years, much emphasis has been placed on the concept of iifelong
learning’. In England learning targets exist for 11 and 16 year olds, young
people aged 19 and 21, as well as for adults. Statistics show that both young
people and adults are becoming increasingly more qualified.
ADMINISTRATION
Government responsibility for education in
the UK rests with the Department for
Education and Employment (DfEE) in
England, the National Assembly for Wales,
the Department of Education and the
Department of Higher and Further
Education, Training and Employment in the
Northern Ireland Executive, and in Scotland
the Scottish Executive Education Department
is responsible for primary and secondary
education while the Scottish Executive
Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department
has responsibility for lifelong learning and for
further and higher education.
State schools in England and Wales are
maintained by local government education
authorities, or LEAs (the separate category of
grant-maintained status having been ended
from September 1999). Nearly all publicly
maintained schools in Scotland are education
authority schools, there being only two self-
governing state schools. In Northern Ireland
five education and library boards own, manage
and run all controlled schools; they also fund
most voluntary schools (see p. 125).
The education service in Great Britain is
financed in the same way as other local
government services (see chapter 6, p. 62),
with education authorities providing funds to
schools largely on the basis of pupil numbers.
In Northern Ireland the costs of the education
and library boards are met by the Northern
Ireland Executive. There are also resources
allocated to education authorities in England,
120
10: EDUCATION
Wales and Scotland for specific purposes,
such as training to improve school
performance in literacy and numeracy or
support for information technology.
Planned spending on education in the UK
as a proportion of gross domestic product
in 2000-01 is 4.8 per cent. In July 2000 the
Government announced that total
expenditure on education in the UK would
rise by 6.6 per cent a year in real terms
between 1999-2000 and 2003-04 to just
under £58 billion.
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive full-time education, at school
or elsewhere, between the ages of five and 16
in England, Scotland and Wales and four and
16 in Northern Ireland. About 93 per cent of
pupils receive free education from public
funds, while the others attend independent
schools financed by fees paid by parents.
Pre-School Education
The expansion of education for children under
the age of five is one of the more striking
changes in education. In 1970-71 around 20
per cent of three and four year olds in the UK
attended schools; by 1999-2000 this had risen
to 64 per cent.
England and Wales
There has been a major expansion of pre¬
school education in recent years with a stated
aim that all children should begin school with
a basic foundation in literacy and numeracy.
Targets have been set to:
• ensure that there are enough early
education places, at least part-time, for
all four year olds in England and Wales
whose parents want one; and
• increase the percentage of three year olds
with free nursery education places in
England from 34 per cent in January
1997 to 100 per cent by 2004.

Total spending on funding early education
places has risen from £1 billion in 1996-97 to
£1-6 billion in 2000—01. To realise universal
provision for three year olds, it will rise to £2
billion in 2003—04.
The National Childcare Strategy was
launched in 1998 with an aim to address the
need for good quality affordable childcare for
children up to the age of 14, and up to the age
of 16 for children with special needs. By
March 1999, 65,700 new childcare places had
been created.
Sure Start
Sure Start is a programme which
complements the National Childcare Strategy
by supporting the development of local
projects for children under four years of age
and their families in many of the most
disadvantaged areas in the country. It is
intended that all families living in Sure Start
areas should have access to a co-ordinated set
of services which include: support for good
quality play, learning and childcare
experiences for children; primary and
community healthcare and advice about
childcare, health and development, and family
health; and outreach and home visiting. By
summer 2000 almost 100 programmes were
providing help and support for children under
four years of age.
121
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Scotland
The Scottish Executive has set a number of
targets, including:
• the provision of a nursery place for every
three year old whose parents want it;
• the training of 5,000 new childcare workers;
• the expansion of support through family
centres and mobile outreach services for
at least 5,000 additional children;
• the provision (by 2003) of out-of-school
care places for 100,000 children;
• support for 60 New Community Schools;
and
• recruitment of 1,000 new teachers and
5,000 classroom assistants.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland compulsory schooling
begins at the age of four. Annual pre-school
education development plans are drawn up for
each education and library board area and
annual childcare plans are drawn up for each
health and social services board area. A phased
expansion programme aims to increase the
proportion of children in their final pre-school
year who experience free pre-school education
from 45 per cent in 1997-98 to 85 per cent by
2001-02 .
Primary Schools
England and Wales
Compulsory education starts in infant schools
or primary school infant departments; at the
age of seven, pupils transfer to separate junior
schools or move to the primary school junior
departments. In addition, there are some first
schools which cater for ages from five to eight,
nine or ten. They are the first stage of a three-
tier (first, middle and secondary) school
system. The usual age for transfer from
primary to secondary school is 11.
Scotland
Primary education is defined by law in
Scotland as education that is appropriate for
children who have not attained the age of 12
years. Primary schools are organised by
classes, by age, from primary 1 to primary 7.
All primary school classes contain both boys
and girls and cover the full range of abilities.
There is no selection or streaming by ability
and children are automatically moved by age
from one class to the next.
Northern Ireland
All children are required to attend primary
school, for seven years, from the beginning of
the school year following their fourth
birthday. At age 11 pupils have the option of
sitting a transfer test prior to transfer from
primary to secondary level education.
Class Sizes
There has been a recent trend to smaller
primary class-sizes, particularly in infant
classes. All LEAs and governing bodies in
England and Wales are required by law to
ensure all classes for five, six and seven year
olds have 30 pupils or fewer by September
2001. In 1999-2000, 10 per cent of classes at
Key Stage 1 in Great Britain had more than 30
pupils, compared with 31 per cent at Key Stage
2. Regional differences are evident: around 40
per cent of primary school Key Stage 2 classes
in the South West, the North West and the
East Midlands contained more than 30 pupils,
compared with just 12 per cent in Northern
Ireland and 15 per cent in Scotland.
Secondary Schools
England and Wales
Over 87 per cent of state secondary pupils in
England and all state secondary pupils in Wales
attend comprehensive schools. These largely
take pupils without reference to ability or
aptitude, providing a wide range of secondary
education for all or most of the children in a
district. Schools include those taking the 11 to
18 age-range, middle schools (8 to 14), and
schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16. The
number of pupils attending non-maintained
schools in England and Wales in 1998—99 was
122
10: EDUCATION
587,000. Non-maintained schools are run by
voluntary bodies, and include independent
schools and non-maintained special schools.
Scotland
Scottish state secondary education is non-
selective and nearly all secondary schools
cover ages 12 to 18. Pupils are admitted
without reference to ability or aptitude. In
1999-2000 around 314,000 pupils were in
publicly funded secondary schools and a
further 18,000 attended private schools.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland secondary education is
organised largely along selective lines, with
grammar schools admitting pupils on the basis
of tests in English, mathematics and science.
In 1999—2000 around 62,000 pupils attended
grammar schools (40 per cent of all secondary
pupils), and over 92,000 attended non¬
grammar secondary schools of which over
7,000 pupils attended integrated schools. In
1999-2000 there were 16 integrated secondary
schools, compared with nine in 1995-96.
City Technology Colleges and City
Academies
There are 15 City Technology Colleges
(CTCs) situated in English cities. These
schools, which are state-funded independent
schools run by private sponsors, operate
outside the normal local government
framework. They provide free education for
11 to 16 year olds in inner city areas with a
curriculum which focuses on science,
mathematics and technology.
From September 2001 the first City
Academies will open. These will also be publicly
funded independent schools involving sponsors
from the private and voluntary sectors. They
will be specialist schools which will replace
either seriously failing schools or schools with
poor GCSE1 results, or will be established
where there is an unmet demand for places.
1 General Certificate of Secondary Education (see p. 127).
Specialist Schools
The specialist schools programme in England
was launched in 1993. Specialist schools are
state secondary schools specialising in
technology, science and mathematics; modern
foreign languages; sport; or the arts—in
addition to providing the full National
Curriculum (see p. 126). Any maintained
secondary or special school catering for
secondary age pupils in England can apply for
designation.
By September 2000 there were over 530
specialist schools in 130 local education
authorities across all parts of England,
including 312 technology colleges, 99 language
colleges, 67 sports colleges, and 57 arts
colleges. Some specialist schools are located in
Education Action Zones and some are also
Beacon Schools (see p. 129). As part of this
approach, schools work in partnership with
local primary and other secondary schools and
their wider communities to share the benefits
of their additional resources and expertise.
Independent Schools
Independent schools providing full-time
education for five or more pupils of
compulsory school age must register by law
with the appropriate government department
and are subject to inspection. There are
approximately 2,400 independent schools in
the UK educating over 600,000 pupils.
Under the Music and Ballet Schools
Scheme, the Government gives income-related
help with fees to over 750 pupils (mainly
boarding) at five specialist music schools, three
ballet schools and for 80 choristers attending
any of the 35 cathedral choir schools. Some
1,200 children attend the music and ballet
schools. Choir schools educate over 14,000
pupils, 900 of them being choristers.
School Management
England and Wales
The School Standards and Framework Act
1998 established a new framework for school
organisation which took effect from
September 1999. There are three mainstream

categories—foundation, community and
voluntary schools. There are 13,712
community schools, 7,059 voluntary schools
and 854 foundation schools, giving a total of
21,625 maintained schools. Community
schools consist of former county schools
(owned and funded by LEAs); foundation
schools include many of the former grant-
maintained schools; and the voluntary
category includes former voluntary schools,
plus some former grant-maintained schools
with a religious character. About 7,000
voluntary and foundation schools have a
religious character. All state schools work in
partnership with, and receive recurrent
funding from, LEAs, managing their own
budgets and staffing. Schools continue to be
run by governing bodies, comprising parent,
school staff, LEA and local community
representation.
LEAs and school governing bodies
responsible for admissions are expected to
work with headteachers, the Churches and
others in local forums to co-ordinate
admission arrangements, taking account of
statutory Codes of Practice issued in 1999. In
England, disagreements on school
organisation and school admissions are
referred to an independent Adjudicator
(although disputes about religious or
denominational admission criteria are referred
to the Secretary of State for Education and
Employment for determination). In Wales, the
National Assembly decides in all cases of
disagreement. Admission authorities are no
longer allowed to introduce selection by
ability, unless it is for sixth form admission or
is fair banding testing to ensure that pupils of
all abilities are admitted, and that no one level
of ability is over- or under-represented.
Where existing partial selection by ability is
challenged, the Adjudicator (in Wales the
National Assembly) decides whether it should
continue. In England, local parents are
allowed to petition for a ballot and (if
sufficient numbers locally wish it) to vote on
whether to keep selective admission
arrangements in the case of the 164 designated
grammar schools which select pupils by high
ability. One such ballot, which resulted in a
vote for no change, has been held so far. The
governing bodies of grammar schools may also
publish statutory proposals to cease to be
selective but none has done so to date.
Scotland
Nearly all schools in Scotland are education
authority schools, which are financed by the
authorities and central government. The
headteacher of each school is responsible for
decision-making on at least 83 per cent of
school level expenditure. School Boards are
currently established in around three-quarters
of education authority schools. Boards consist
of parents and teachers (both elected) and
members co-opted from the local community.
School Boards have a duty to promote contact
between parents, the school and the
community, and have certain specific
responsibilities, such as involvement in the
procedures for the appointment of senior staff
and the community use of school premises.
They may also take on further executive
functions by delegation from their education
authority.
A small number of grant-aided schools,
mainly in the special sector, are run by boards
of managers who also receive central
government grants.

10: EDUCATION
Northern Ireland
The main categories and numbers2 of schools
supported by public funds are:
• controlled schools—656 are managed by
education and library boards through
boards of governors;
• voluntary maintained schools—552 are
managed by boards of governors
consisting of members nominated by
trustees (mainly Roman Catholic), along
with representatives of parents, teachers
and education and library boards;
• voluntary grammar schools—73 schools
are managed by boards of governors; and
• grant-maintained/controlled integrated
schools—43 schools, the former funded
by the Department of Education but
managed by boards of governors, while
the latter are funded by education and
library boards—the aim of these schools is
to provide education for Roman Catholic
and Protestant children together.
All publicly financed schools are managed
by boards of governors, which include elected
parents and teachers among their members.
Virtually all schools have delegated budgets
under which school governors decide
spending priorities.
All schools must be open to pupils of all
religions. However, most Roman Catholic
pupils attend Catholic maintained schools or
Catholic voluntary grammar schools, and most
Protestant children are enrolled at controlled
schools or non-denominational voluntary
grammar schools. The Government has a
statutory duty to encourage integrated
education as a way of breaking down sectarian
barriers. Existing controlled, grant-maintained
and voluntary grammar schools can apply to
become integrated following a majority vote
by parents. In 1999-2000 there were 43
integrated schools: 16 post-primary integrated
schools and 27 primary.
2 The numbers include nursery schools, primary schools,
post-primary schools, preparatory departments of grammar
schools and special schools.

Information for Parents and Parental
Involvement
England and Wales
Parents have a statutory right to information
about schools, to express a preference for a
school for their child, and there is an appeal
system if their choices are not met.
Information includes:
• National performance tables, published
annually, showing the latest public
examination results, vocational
qualification results and rates of absence
on a school-by-school basis; and for
primary schools, the National
Curriculum assessment results at Key
Stage 2 (see p. 126).
• Each maintained school must publish an
annual prospectus for parents and
prospective parents. This must include a
summary of the school’s National
Curriculum assessment results, a
summary of its public examination
results and vocational qualification
results (if applicable) and attendance
rates.
125
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Parents must be given a written annual
report on their child’s achievements
containing details about progress in all
subjects and activities; attendance record;
results of National Curriculum assessments
and public examinations including
comparative results of pupils of the same age
in the school and nationally; and arrangements
for discussing pupils’ reports with teachers.
Parents are entitled to see or be provided
with a copy of their child’s pupil record within
15 school days of making a written request.
Unless there is a court order preventing it, all
parents have a right to participate in decisions
about their child’s education.
Home/school agreements set out schools’,
pupils’ and parents’ responsibilities and are a
statutory requirement for all maintained schools.
Before adopting or revising an agreement, a
school’s governing body must consult all
registered parents of pupils. Agreements should
cover expectations about the standard of
education that the school will provide, regular
and punctual attendance, discipline and
behaviour, homework and the information
schools and parents will give to one another.
Scotland
Parents have a right of choice of school for their
children, within certain limits. Information is
published for parents on school costs,
examination results, pupil attendance and
absence, and the destinations of school leavers.
Schools are required to provide parents with
information about their children’s attainment in
each subject, teachers’ comments on their
progress, and details about steps to build on
success or overcome difficulties.
Northern Ireland
The system of reporting to parents is broadly
similar to that in England and Wales.
School Curriculum
England and Wales
The subjects taught to children between the
ages of five and 16 in state schools are to a
large extent determined by the National
Curriculum, which has four Key Stages (see
Table 10.3). At each of the stages the core
subjects of English (and in Wales, Welsh),
mathematics, science, technology, physical
education, and religious education are taught.
History, geography, art and music are also
compulsory subjects in the earlier stages of the
curriculum. A modern foreign language is
added to the curriculum at Key Stages 3 and
4. For Key Stage 4 the study of history,
geography, art and music becomes optional; in
Wales a modern foreign language is optional at
Key Stage 4. Other subjects, such as drama,
dance, and classical languages, remain on the
curriculum, but the teaching of them is
optional, depending on the resources of
individual schools.
The National Curriculum also contains
general requirements for each subject and, for
each Key Stage, programmes of study
outlining what pupils should be taught, as well
as attainment targets setting out expected
standards of pupils’ performance.
In England, revisions to the National
Curriculum took effect in August 2000 and
includes a new foundation subject ‘citizenship’
at Key Stages 3 and 4 from 2002.
In Wales, Welsh is a compulsory subject for
pupils at all four Key Stages.
Religious education—all state schools must
provide religious education, each LEA being
responsible for producing a locally agreed
syllabus. Syllabuses must reflect Christianity
while taking account of the other main
religions practised in the UK. Parents have
the right to withdraw their children from
religious education classes.
Sex education—state secondary schools are
required to provide sex education for all pupils,
including education about HIV/AIDS and

other sexually transmitted diseases. Parents are
entitled to withdraw their children from sex
education classes other than those required by
the National Curriculum. All state schools
must provide information to parents about the
content of their sex education courses.
Literacy and numeracy—the Government has
set targets to improve literacy and numeracy for
11 year olds in England with the aim of
providing them with a satisfactory preparation
for secondary education. The targets are for 80
per cent of 11 year olds to reach the standards
for their age in literacy by 2002 and 75 per cent
in numeracy. By autumn 1999, 71 per cent and
69 per cent of 11 year olds had reached the
standards in literacy and numeracy respectively.
Since September 1998 primary schools in
England have devoted an hour to literacy during
each teaching day, and since September 1999
pupils have also been taught a daily mathematics
lesson. Literacy and numeracy summer
schools are available to help those 11 year olds
about to enter secondary education who have
failed to meet the standards for English and
mathematics. In 2000 approximately 32,490
pupils attended literacy summer schools,
19,590 attended numeracy summer schools
and 14,400 have attended summer schools for
more gifted and talented children.
The Government is also introducing a
programme to raise standards at Key Stage 3.
A pilot involving 17 LEAs and 204 schools is
testing programmes designed to raise standards
for all pupils across the whole curriculum in
the early years of secondary education. There
are new teaching and learning programmes for
English, mathematics, science, and
information and communications technology
(ICT), including a programme of continuing
professional development, as well as ‘catch-up’
programmes in English and mathematics for
pupils who have not reached the required level
for their age.
In Wales the National Assembly has
adopted targets for attainment in the separate
subjects of English, Welsh (first language),
mathematics and science.
Assessment and testing—school pupils are
formally assessed at three key stages before
GCSE level—at the ages of seven, 11 and 14.
The assessments at all three key stages cover
the core subjects of English, mathematics and
science (and Welsh in Welsh medium schools
in Wales). The purpose of these assessments is
to help inform teachers and parents about the
progress of individual pupils and to give a
measure of the performance of schools. There
are two forms of assessment: tests and teacher
assessment. Pupils’ attainment is shown as a
level on the National Curriculum scale. A
typical seven year old is expected to achieve
level two, a typical 11 year old level four, and a
typical 14 year old between levels five and six.
In 2000 the proportion of boys reaching the
required standard in English at all three key
stages was considerably lower than that of girls.
The widest gap was at Key Stage 3 where 55
per cent of boys compared with 72 per cent of
girls reached or exceeded level five.
Qualifications—the General Certificate of
Secondary Education (GCSE) is the main
examination taken by pupils at the end of
compulsory schooling at the age of 16. GCSE
(Short Courses) are also available in a limited
range of subjects; they occupy half the time of
full GCSEs. In addition, the Part One General
National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ)—
a shortened version of the full GNVQ^(see
p. 134)—is available for 14 to 16 year olds. It
covers seven vocational areas: art and design;
business; engineering; health and social care;
ICT; leisure and tourism; and manufacturing.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered to
pupils in state schools must be approved by the
Government. Associated syllabuses and
assessment procedures must comply with
national guidelines and be approved by the
relevant qualification authority. The
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority
(QCA) and its Welsh counterpart are
independent government agencies responsible
for ensuring that the curriculum and
qualifications available to young people and
adults are of high quality, coherent and flexible.
The proportion of final year pupils
achieving five or more GCSE grades A* to C
in Great Britain has increased during the last
decade for both boys and girls—from 46 per
cent in 1992-93 to 55 per cent in 1998-99 for
girls, compared with 37 per cent and 44 per
cent for boys over the same period.
127
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Scotland
Unlike England and Wales, there is no
statutory national curriculum in Scotland.
Pupils aged five to 14 study a broad
curriculum based on national guidelines
which set out the aims of study, the ground to
be covered and the way the pupils’ learning
should be assessed and reported. Progression
is measured by attainment of five levels based
on the expectation of the performance of the
majority of pupils at certain ages between five
and 14. It is recognised that pupils learn at
different rates and some will reach the various
levels before others. The curricular areas are
language, mathematics, environmental
studies, expressive arts, and religious and
moral education.
Knowledge and understanding of language
and use of the skills of talking, reading and
writing run throughout the curriculum, but
they are the particular concern in the English
Language element of the curriculum and in
the pupils’ study of a modern European
language (which is currently being-
introduced into the curriculum for all pupils
in the last two years of primary education). In
Scotland there are 59 units in primary
schools where education is offered through
the medium of the Gaelic language. There
are about 1,830 pupils attending these units.
There are also a number of other schools
where pupils are able to learn Gaelic as a
second language.
Scottish education authorities must ensure
that pupils are given religious instruction,
although parents can withdraw their children if
they wish. Government guidance on sex
education is provided to education authorities
and headteachers.
Pupils take the National (Qualifications
(NQ) at Standard Grade after four years of
secondary education at the age of 16. NQ^
Standard Grade examinations are conducted
by the Scottish Qualifications Authority
(SQA). In 1998-99, 34 per cent of pupils in
S4 (fourth year of lower secondary
education) gained five or more Standard
Grades at levels 1-2. The percentages
achieving five or more Standard Grades at
levels 1-4 and 1-6 were 76 and 91 per cent
respectively.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland curriculum,
compulsory in all publicly financed schools,
consists of religious education and six broad
areas of study: English, mathematics, science
and technology, the environment and society,
creative and expressive studies and, in
secondary schools and some primary schools,
language studies. The main churches have
approved a core syllabus for religious
education and this must be taught in all grant-
aided schools.
The curriculum also has cross-curricular
educational themes, including cultural
heritage, education for mutual understanding,
health education and information technology.
Secondary schools have two additional
themes, namely, economic awareness and
careers education.
Sex education is taught through the
compulsory science programme of study and
the health education cross-curricular theme.
Pupil assessment, which is statutory, is
broadly in line with practice in England and
Wales, taking place at eight, 11, 14 and 16.
The GSCE examination is used to assess 16
year old pupils.
School Performance
England and Wales
All state schools in England and Wales are
regularly inspected and inspection reports are
published. The Office for Standards in
Education (OFSTED) in England and the
Office of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector in
Wales (Estyn) aim to help improve the quality
and standards of education through
independent inspections and advice. Schools
in England and Wales are normally inspected
every six years, but more often where
weaknesses are apparent, and schools must act
on the inspectors’ recommendations. Between
inspections, school performance is regularly
monitored by LEAs, which aim to ensure that
schools’ development plans meet national
guidelines set out by the Government.
A statutory code of practice, issued under
the School Standards and Framework Act
1998, governs relations between LEAs and
128
10: EDUCATION
schools. It states that the LEA needs to
monitor data about all schools, and spread
best practice among local schools and more
widely. The LEA’s resources should
otherwise be focused on schools which
monitoring information suggests need further
improvement—that is, those in the categories
of under-achieving, low performance, serious
weakness or special measures.
Where a school found to be failing by
inspectors does not make adequate progress,
the DfEE or the National Assembly for Wales
may either put the school under new
management or require the LEA to close it,
or a Fresh Start school can be opened. A
Fresh Start school is one opened in place of
a school in special measures which has
closed. At the end of the summer term 2000,
1,141 schools had been found to be failing
since the introduction of special measures in
1993. Of these schools, 611 had improved
sufficiently to be removed from the special
measures category and 132 had been closed,
including 16 schools which have had Fresh
Starts.
Excellence in Cities
Excellence in Cities was launched by the
Government in 1999 with the aim of
addressing educational problems of the major
cities. It now covers secondary schools in all
the major cities across nearly 60 local authority
areas. There are six strands to the Excellence
in Cities programme:
• Learning Mentors for all pupils who
need them;
• Learning Support Units (units shared by
schools where pupils with problems can
be taught until they are ready to return to
the classroom);
• a network of new City Learning Centres
(school-based centres which share their
latest ICT facilities with a network of
other schools);
• more Beacon Schools and specialist
schools (see below);
• small Education Action Zones; and
• extended opportunities for gifted and
talented pupils.
Education Action Zones
The Education Action Zone (EAZ) initiative
was introduced under the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998 as an attempt to
raise standards in disadvantaged urban and
rural areas of England. An EAZ is typically
made up of two or three secondary schools
with their associated primary and special
school provision working in partnership with
parents, schools, businesses, the LEA, the
local Training and Enterprise Council (TEC)
and others. Each EAZ is run by an Action
Forum made up of key partners of the zone
including private sector representation.
By August 2000, 73 zones were in
operation. Some 1,450 schools are participating
in the zones, mostly in urban areas.
Beacon Schools
The Beacon School initiative is intended to
raise standards through the spreading of good
practice. Beacon Schools are those which have
been identified as among the best performing
in the country and represent examples of
successful practices to be brought to the
attention of the rest of the education service.
They are expected to work in partnership with
other schools to pass on their particular areas
of expertise and so help others reach the same
high standards as themselves. The initiative is
open to all maintained schools in England in
the nursery, primary, secondary and special
sectors. By September 2000 there were 550
Beacon Schools in England. The network is
set to expand to 1,000 schools from September
2001.
Scotland
HM Inspectors of Schools, a unit within the
framework of the Scottish Executive
Education Department, have the right to enter
schools, including independent schools and
certain other educational establishments, for
the purpose of inspection. Reports are
published on inspections and made available
to the public. The findings and
recommendations of these reports are followed
up with the schools and with local authorities,
governing bodies and other interested parties.
129
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the purpose of inspection
is to help to promote the highest possible
standards of learning and teaching throughout
the education system in Northern Ireland and
to provide information to the Department of
Education and others about the quality of
education being offered.
Children with Special Educational Needs
A child is said to have special educational
needs (SEN) if he or she has a learning
difficulty which needs special provision. A
child has learning difficulties if he or she has
significantly greater difficulty in learning than
most children of the same age or a disability
which makes it difficult to use the normal
educational facilities in the area. Every child
has the right to receive a broad and balanced
curriculum. For pupils with SEN, planning
should take account of each pupil’s particular
learning and assessment requirements.
England and Wales
In January 2000, 1.71 million pupils were
identified as having special educational needs,
of whom some 252,600 had statements of SEN
monitored by their local authority. Of those
with statements, 60 per cent are educated in
mainstream schools while most of the others
are educated in special schools. State schools
must try to provide for pupils with SEN and
publish information about their SEN policy.
LEAs must identify and assess the needs of
those children with more severe or complex
needs and involve parents in decisions about
their children’s education.
If an LEA believes that it should determine
the education for the child, it must draw up a
formal statement of the child’s special needs
and the action it intends to take to meet them.
The LEA is required to comply with the
parents’ choice of school unless this is
inappropriate for the child or incompatible
with the efficient education of other children
or with the efficient use of resources. Parents
have a right of appeal to the Special
Educational Needs Tribunal if they disagree
with certain decisions by the LEA about their
child. The Tribunal’s verdict is final and
binding on all parties.
In 1998 the Government published a
programme of action setting out its strategy
for raising standards for children with SEN in
England. The main themes were:
• developing the knowledge and skills of all
staff working with children with SEN;
• improving the SEN framework and
developing a more inclusive education
system;
• working in partnership with parents and
carers; and
• promoting partnership in SEN provision
locally, regionally and nationally.
Legislation is planned to take forward
commitments made in the programme of
action, as well as recommendations of the
Disability Rights Task Force in respect of
education. The disability provisions, which
will cover England, Scotland and Wales, will
place new duties on LEAs, schools (including
independent schools and non-maintained
special schools), further and higher education
institutions, the youth service and adult
education. For example, this will include a
duty on education providers not to treat
disabled pupils and students less favourably,
without justification, than non-disabled pupils
and students; and further and higher
education institutions and LEAs (in respect of
LEA-secured non-schools education) to make
reasonable adjustments to enable disabled
students to have full access to education
services.
To support the implementation of the
action programme in England, support for
SEN in 1999-2000 was ^35 million, with a
further increase to £55 million for 2000-01. In
addition, £30 million has been made available
through the Schools Access Initiative in
2000-01 to make 1,900 mainstream schools
more accessible to disabled pupils and those
with sensory impairments.

educational needs fully into account when
making provision for pupils in their areas.
130
10: EDUCATION
There are a small number of pupils (about
2 per cent of the school population) whose
needs require the authority to open a record
describing the special education necessary to
meet them. This process incorporates a right
of appeal.
Northern Ireland
Similar arrangements to those in England and
Wales, including an appeal system, are in force.
Computer Technology in Schools
England and Wales
The rapid growth in information and
communications technology (ICT) is having
significant implications for teaching and
learning in schools. In 2000, record numbers
of young people took ICT examinations at age
16. In 2000, 86 per cent of primary schools
and 98 per cent of secondary schools in
England were connected to the Internet,
compared with 17 per cent and 83 per cent
respectively in 1998. All schools will be
connected by 2002.
The National Grid for Learning (NGfL)
was introduced in 1998 as the UK’s national
focal point for learning on the Internet, and a
programme for connecting schools and other
learning institutions. It is supported by a
programme for training teachers in the use of
IC F in the classroom and a rolling programme
of independent evaluations of current and
emerging educational technologies.
Scotland
The Scottish Consultative Council on the
Curriculum was merged with the Scottish
Council for Educational Technology in July
2000 and is now known as Learning &
Teaching Scotland. It will have a new
responsibility for advising on the use of ICT
in education, which includes:
• keeping under review, and providing
independent advice to Scottish ministers
on, all matters relating to the school and
pre-school curriculum, including the use
of ICT to support delivery of the
curriculum; and
• managing and supporting a programme
of research and development work
related to the school and pre-school
curriculum and to the use of ICT in
Scottish education.
Teachers
England and Wales
New teachers in maintained primary and
secondary schools are required to be
graduates. They must also hold Qualified
Teacher Status (QTS). There are currently
two main ways to become a teacher:
• the undergraduate route—taking a
Bachelor of Education degree at a
university or college of higher education.
This route combines a degree with QTS
and covers subject and professional
studies with practical teaching experience
in schools, where students teach a limited
timetable under the supervision of an
experienced teacher; or
• the postgraduate route—students need a
degree (Bachelor of Arts or Science) or
equivalent, that gives them the necessary
foundation for the subject and age-range
they want to teach. They then undertake
a one-year Postgraduate Certificate in
Education (PGCE) course leading to
QTS. All postgraduate courses focus on
professional preparation for teaching in a
chosen subject and include the National
Curriculum.
Teachers can also train on an employment-
based route. This type of training leads to
QTS and is available on the Graduate and
Registered Teacher Programmes. These
routes are for people at least 24 years old and
offer the opportunity to earn a salary while
following a training programme. They are
particularly suitable for overseas-trained
teachers who do not hold QTS, mature career
changers, school support staff and people who
have previous teaching experience. Trainees
are expected to gain employment as an
unqualified teacher in a school which is able to
support their training programme.
131
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP)
is for people already holding a degree. The
normal duration of the course is one year. The
Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) is for
people who do not have a degree, but do have
two years’ higher education experience. This
route takes up to two years and participants
complete a degree while they train.
New arrangements for the development of
the teaching profession in England are being
implemented from September 2000. Key
aspects include:
• requiring all trainee teachers, including
those on employment-based routes, to
meet the standards for the award of
Qualified Teacher Status before they can
qualify to teach;
• establishing an independent General
Teaching Council for England;
• providing more training for headteachers;
• establishing the National College for
School Leadership;
• introducing a new pay system for teachers;
• allocating to teacher training colleges
resources to ensure that all teachers meet
the required standards in numeracy,
literacy and computer skills;
• requiring newly qualified teachers taking
up their first teaching post to go through
a further induction period, enabling them
to consolidate their teaching skills;
• introducing a fast-track initiative to attract
high quality graduates to the teaching
profession and moving outstanding teachers
quickly through the profession; and
• recruiting and training an extra 20,000
teaching assistants.
Similar reforms to the teaching profession
are taking place in Wales, including the
establishment of a General Teaching Council
for Wales from September 2000.
Between 1986 and 1999, the number of
full-time secondary school teachers in England
and Wales decreased by 14 per cent, from
about 221,000 to 191,000. In contrast, the
number of full-time teachers in primary
schools increased over the same period from
170,000 to 181,000, although the increase has
fluctuated in intervening years.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General Teaching
Council (GTC) for Scotland. The GTC gives
advice to the Minister for Children and
Education on teacher supply and the
professional suitability of teacher training
courses. It is also responsible for disciplinary
procedures under which teachers guilty
of professional misconduct may be
removed temporarily or permanently from
the register.
Teacher qualification procedures are
similar to England and Wales except the
Scottish Executive must approve all pre¬
service teaching courses. They must also be
validated by a higher education institution and
accredited by the GTC as leading to
registration. HM Inspectorate in Scotland has
powers to inspect teacher education and
training.
Revised national guidelines for teacher
development and appraisal were issued in
1998, and a new qualification for
headteachers—the Scottish Qualification for
Headship—has now been introduced.
The Scottish Higher Education Funding
Council is responsible for funding initial
teacher education and setting intake levels to
teacher education courses.
Northern Ireland
All new entrants to teaching in grant-aided
schools are graduates and hold an approved
teaching qualification. Arrangements have
been developed under which initial teacher
training is integrated with induction/early in-
service training, the latter covering a period of
three years. In addition, work continues on the
development of a recognised qualification for
headteachers, the Professional Qualification
for Headship (NI), equivalent to the
arrangements in England and Wales. A
General Teaching Council will be established
in Northern Ireland in the academic year
2000-01.
Teacher training is provided by the
University of Ulster (at the Coleraine and
Jordanstown campuses), Queen’s University
of Belfast and its two associated institutions,
132
10: EDUCATION
Stranmillis University College and St Mary’s
University College. The principal courses are
BEd Honours (four years) and the one-year
Postgraduate Certificate of Education and
around 700 new teachers qualify each year.
The majority of the 23,000 teachers currently
employed in Northern Ireland are graduates.
Education and library boards have a statutory
duty to provide curricular support services
and in-service training.
Business and Community Links
England
From April 2001 the Learning and Skills
Council (LSC—see p. 135) will have
responsibility through local LSCs for ensuring
the effective provision of education-business
links.
Scotland
In Scotland the Education for Work and
Enterprise agenda supports the transition of
young people from education to the world of
work. A very wide range of programmes is
available; these are designed to introduce
young people to patterns of employment, give
them direct experience of the world of work,
expose them to enterprise, or to re-engage
disaffected young people in learning.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are
entitled to careers information, advice and
guidance. All schools are now required to
provide a programme of careers education to
pupils in years 9-11. This requirement applies
to all registered pupils including those with
special needs, at county, voluntary, grant-
maintained and special schools.
In Northern Ireland careers education is
one of the six compulsory education themes
forming part of the secondary school
curriculum (see p. 126).
All state secondary schools in England and
Wales, and primary and secondary schools in
Northern Ireland, provide leavers with a
Record of Achievement setting out their
school attainments, including public
examination and National Curriculum
assessment results. In Scotland the Record is
not compulsory.
In England the current work of Careers
Services with 13 to 19 year olds will be
subsumed within the new Connexions Service
which is being phased in from 2001. The
Connexions Service will be a multi-agency
support service, delivered by a network of
personal advisers who will be based in a
variety of settings including schools and
colleges. It is intended to be particularly
relevant to school-age pupils as they make Key
Stage 4, post-16 or post-18 choices. The type
of help currently provided by careers advisers
will therefore be provided by personal advisers
working within the Connexions Service.
The National Assembly for Wales is
launching a careers guidance service, Careers
Wales, in April 2001.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AFTER 16
At age 16 young people are faced with the
choice of whether to remain in education, go
into training or seek employment. For those
young people who do not seek full-time
employment they have two routes that they
can follow—one based on school and college
education, and the other on work-based
learning. In addition, under the Welfare-to-
Work programme (see p. 151), all young
unemployed people are guaranteed education
and training opportunities, while those with
poor basic skills have the option of
participating in full-time study on an
approved course.
About 70 per cent of 16 year old pupils
choose to continue in full-time education in
school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges (in
England and Wales) and further education
colleges. Broadly speaking, education after 16
outside schools is divided into further and
higher education.
Education Maintenance Allowance
The Education Maintenance Allowance
(EMA) is a weekly allowance for 16 to 19 year
133
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
olds who continue in education beyond year
11. It was launched in September 1999 in 15
LEAs across England. Students can qualify
for allowances of between £5 and £30 per
week with additional bonuses paid termly if
the young person meets certain attendance
criteria and at the end of the course for
achievement. EMAs are an experiment to test
whether paying a weekly allowance increases
post-16 participation, retention and
achievement. Staying-on rates have improved
by 5 per cent in EMA pilot areas compared to
2 per cent nationally.
Further Education
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Having completed compulsory school
education, students may continue to study for
examinations that lead to higher education,
professional training or vocational
qualifications. These include the academic
General Certificate of Education (GCE)
Advanced (A) level and Advanced Subsidiary
(AS) qualifications, General National
Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs)/
Vocational A levels and job-specific National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs—see
p. 135). The GCE A level is usually taken at
age 18 after two years’ full-time study. They
are graded on a scale of A to E. A new
Advanced Subsidiary (AS) qualification,
representing the first year of a full A level and
worth 50 per cent of the marks, was introduced
in September 2000. The AS is designed to
encourage the take-up of more subjects,
particularly in the first year of post-16 study,
provide better progression from GCSE into
advanced level study and reduce the numbers
who do not complete their studies.
In addition, new A level syllabuses, made
up of six units, set at the same standard as the
previous syllabuses and offering candidates
the choice of linear (end of year) or modular
(staged) assessment, to the same standard in
each, were introduced.
There has been an increase in the
proportion of young men and women in the
United Kingdom achieving two or more A
levels or equivalent. The proportion of young
women who had achieved this has doubled
since the mid-1970s, to 24 per cent in
1998-99. The increase in the proportion of
young men has been by just under a half over
the same period. In 1987-88 an equal
proportion of young men and women achieved
two or more A levels or equivalent (15 per
cent) but since 1988-89 women have
outperformed men at this level.
GNVQs, which are mainly undertaken by
young people in full-time education between
the ages of 16 and 19, provide a broad-based
preparation for a range of occupations and
higher education. There are three GNVQ^
levels—Vocational A levels (previously called
Advanced GNVQs), Intermediate and
Foundation. GNVQs/Vocational A levels may
be taken in combination with other
qualifications, such as GCE A levels or
GCSEs.

In 1998-99 there were around 23,000
advanced GNVQ_entries by young people
aged 17 in England, and of these just under
20,000 obtained a qualification.
A shortened version of the full GNVQwas
made available in September 1999 to all
schools and colleges. This Part One GNVQqs
designed to broaden choices for young people.
It is available in seven vocational subject areas:
art and design, business, engineering, health
and social care, information technology,
leisure and tourism, and manufacturing. In
England by the end of 1998/99 almost 10,000
15 year olds had obtained either an
Intermediate or Foundation GNVQPart One
qualification. Almost 3,000 pupils obtained a
GNVQPart One qualification in Business,
more than in any other subject.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland have
a wide range of job-specific National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), awards
which recognise work-related skills and
knowledge and provide a path for lifelong
learning and achievement. Prepared by
industry and commerce, including
representatives from trade unions and
professional bodies, NVQs are based on
national standards of competence and can be
achieved at levels 1 to 5.
The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority is responsible for supervising
academic and vocational qualifications in
England as well as the school curriculum.
Corresponding bodies in Wales and Northern
Ireland perform similar functions.
Learning and Skills Council
In June 1999 the Government published its
White Paper Learning to Succeed which set out
135
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
new proposals for restructuring post-16
education and training in England, including
plans to establish a new Learning and Skills
Council (ESC) to replace the Training and
Enterprise Councils and the Further
Education Funding Council.
The ESC became a legal entity on 1
September 2000, and will become fully
operational from 1 April 2001. It will be a
single, unitary organisation, and will operate at
national level and through 47 local Learning
and Skills Councils. The ESC will focus
particularly on skills and employer needs at
national, regional and local levels. It will have
responsibility for planning, funding,
monitoring and improving the quality of post-
16 up to higher education level, and will have a
wide remit ranging from basic skills to higher
level skills in further education, work-based
training for young people, and adult and
community education. It will also take
responsibility for school sixth form funding
from 2002-03 onwards. The Council has a
statutory duty to encourage participation in
learning, and will work with employers and
others to promote workforce development, and
economic and community regeneration activity.
The national and local councils will each
have a board of around 16 members, with
experience of a wide variety of interests in post-
16 education and training, including individual
learners, employers, disadvantaged groups,
education providers and the voluntary sector.
National Council for Education and
Training for Wales
From April 2001 a new National Council for
Education and Training for Wales will be
responsible for strategic development and
planning of all post-16 education and training
(excluding higher education, but including
community and adult learning and work-based
training for young people). It will also be
responsible for funding most post-16 learning,
taking over the work of the Further Education
Funding Council for Wales.
Scotland
In Scotland education for those aged 16 to 18
has been reformed. Traditional, fairly
academically oriented ‘Highers’ (Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education) are
being replaced by new ‘Higher Still’ courses
and modules, which will offer students greater
flexibility and, through a revised assessment
system, more opportunities to demonstrate
successful educational achievement. It is
intended that the new system of Scottish
Highers should be fully in place by 2003.
Higher National Certificates (HNCs) and
Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) are a
stepping stone to higher education or further
training.
The Scottish Qualifications Authority is
the national accreditation organisation.
Further Education Colleges
People over the age of 16 can take courses in
further education colleges, where much of the
study is work-related. Further education
colleges also offer many government-
sponsored training programmes. Many
students on further education courses attend
part-time (73 per cent in 1998-99), either by
day release or block release from employment
or during the evenings. The system has strong
ties with commerce and industry.
Further education colleges in the UK are
controlled by autonomous governing bodies,
with representation from business and the
local community. Public funding is allocated
in England, Wales and Scotland through
further education funding councils, although
in England and Wales the new Learning and
Skills Council and National Council for
Education and Training for Wales will
respectively be assuming this responsibility in
April 2001. In Northern Ireland colleges are
financed through the Northern Ireland
Executive.
Independent inspectors assess the quality of
the education provided by colleges. I hey
publish reports containing quality
assessments, and colleges are obliged to
explain how they will put things right il there
are major criticisms. Each college has to
publish information about its examination
results annually. Colleges in Scotland are
inspected by the Schools Inspectorate and in
Northern Ireland by the Education and
Training Inspectorate. Further education

Higher Education
Around a third of young people in England
and Wales, 40 per cent in Scotland and 45 per
cent in Northern Ireland continue in
education at a more advanced level beyond the
age of 18. Higher education courses are taught
in universities, further education colleges and
the Open University (see below). They
provide a variety of courses up to degree and
postgraduate degree level, and increasinglv
cater for mature students.
Universities
Universities in the UK enjoy academic
freedom, appoint their own staff, and decide
which students to admit and award their own
degrees. The universities of Oxford and
Cambridge date from the 13th century, and
the Scottish universities of St Andrew s,
Glasgow and Aberdeen from the 15th century.
The University of Edinburgh was established
in the 16th century. All the other universities
were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.
There are 87 universities, and 64 institutions
of higher education. The 1960s sawr
considerable expansion in new universities.
There was also a substantial increase in 1992,
w hen polytechnics and their Scottish
equivalents were given their own degree¬
awarding powers and were allowed to take the
university title. At the same time, similar
provision w as made for higher education
colleges which met certain criteria. Higher
education colleges have different backgrounds
and missions. Some are very specialised, such
as art and design or agriculture colleges, w hile
others are multi-disciplinary. They vary in
size from under 500 to more than 10,000
students. Some award their own degrees and
qualifications, while in others students take
degrees and qualifications validated by a
university or national body. Applications for
first-degree courses are usually made through
the Universities and Colleges Admission
Service (UCAS).
Students at university (in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland) usually spend three
years researching a subject in-depth and are
awarded a Bachelor’s degree (for example,
Bachelor of Arts, BA; or Bachelor of Science,
BSc) on the successful completion of their
studies. There are some four-year courses, and
medical and veterinary courses normally
require five or six years. A full-time first
degree in Scotland generally takes four years
for Honours and three years for the broad-
based Ordinary degree—a particular feature of
the Scottish system. In 1998-99 just over
260,000 students gained a first degree in the
UK, 24,000 more than in 1994-95. Of these
30,000 students graduated with a first degree
in business and administrative studies, more
graduates than any other subject.
A number of students go on to do
postgraduate studies. These usually lead to an
additional formally recognised qualification
such as a Master’s degree (for example,
Master of Arts, MA; or Master of Science,
MSc) or doctorate (PhD).
The Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
for adult students of all ages. Teaching is
through a combination of specifically
produced printed texts, corresponding tuition,
television broadcasts, audio/video cassettes
and, for some courses, computing and short
residential schools. There is a network of
tutorial centres for contact with part-time
tutors, and w ith fellow students. Students do
not need formal academic qualifications to
register for most courses.
Its first degrees are the BA (Open) and the
BSc (Open), which are general degrees
awarded on a system of credits for each course
completed. Either degree can be awarded with
honours. The OU also offers honours degrees
in selected subject areas. There is also an
MMaths degree for students who have taken
an approved combination of courses
specialising in mathematics, and an MEng
degree for those who have studied an
approved combination of courses to achieve
the highest professional status of Chartered
Engineer. The OU offers a wide range of
postgraduate courses.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Higher Education Funding Arrangements
Government finance for publicly funded higher
education institutions (to help meet the costs of
teaching, research and related activities) is
distributed by higher education funding
councils in England, Wales and Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland, by the Department of
Higher and Further Education, Training and
Employment, following advice from the
Northern Ireland Higher Education Council.
The private University of Buckingham receives
no public grants. Higher education institutions
also receive publicly funded paid fee income on
behalf of students who are below the
assessment thresholds for the payment of full
privately paid fees, and privately paid fee
contributions.
As well as teaching students, institutions
undertake paid training, research or
consultancy for commercial firms. Many
establishments have endowments or receive
grants from foundations and benefactors.
Student Support
England and Wales—student support,
depending on the type, is paid out by the
Student Loans Company, local education
authorities and the college or university. It
includes:
• tuition fees—since 1998-99 full-time
students have had a responsibility to
make an income-assessed contribution
towards their tuition fees. For 2000-01,
the maximum fee contribution is £1,050,
although most students are eligible for a
grant towards their fees, depending on
their own and their family’s income;
• dependant’s allowance—these are grants
for those students with family members
who are financial dependants. The
amount of grant depends on the student’s
and the dependant’s income;
• access bursaries—paid to students aged
25 and over with dependants, according
to need. The maximum is £1,000; and
• hardship funds—made at the discretion
of the institution, the amount depending
on the individual circumstances of the
student.
There are also other types of grant for
certain groups of student. These include a
Disabled Students’ Allowance, which helps
with the costs incurred in attending a course
as a direct result of a disability, and a Care
Leavers’ Grant which helps those who have
been in care by providing a grant towards
accommodation costs in the long, usually
summer, vacation.
Scotland—the Scottish Executive is
introducing a new student support scheme for
full-time higher education:
• From the academic year 2000-01 tuition
fees will no longer be payable by eligible
full-time Scottish-domiciled students or
EU students who are studying in
Scotland. Student loan entitlement may
be reduced, however, because any assessed
parental or spouse contribution will now
be set against the means-tested student
loan entitlement rather than tuition fees.
• Young Student Bursaries of up to £2,000
a year will be available for those eligible
students entering higher education in
2001-02 or later who need support while
studying (for example, students from
low-income groups).
Mature students entering higher
education for the first time in 2001-02 or
later may be entitled to claim from the
Mature Student Bursary Fund as well as
their loan entitlement. Assistance
through this scheme will be administered
by the universities and colleges and is
discretionary.
Graduates (with some exemptions) will
be expected to contribute £2,000 to the
• student loans—these are the main form
of support for assistance with living costs.
The maximum loan in 2000-01 for full- *
time students is £4,590. The amount of
loan depends on where a student lives
and studies, the length of the academic
year, the course of study and the year of
the course. The amount of loan paid also
depends on the student’s and his or her
family’s income. Loans are repaid on the
basis of income after the student has left •
their course;

Northern Ireland—student support
arrangements in Northern Ireland operate on
a parity basis with England and Wales.
Students are expected to make a means-tested
contribution to the cost of their tuition fees
(£1,050 in 2000-01) and have access to
student loans to cover their living costs.
A review of the student support system in
Northern Ireland was announced in February
2000 and the outcome is to be announced
before the end of 2000.
National Targets for Education and
Training
The Government in 1998 launched the
National Learning Targets for England for
2002 covering key stages of people’s lives.
Progress towards the targets is measured in
autumn each year. Targets for England have
been set which state that by 2002, 85 per cent
of 19 year olds will be qualified to NVQJevel
2 (equivalent to five GCSEs at grades A* to C)
and 60 per cent of 21 year olds will be
qualified to NVQJevel 3 (to two A levels ) or
its equivalent. Steady progress has been made
towards the targets. In 2000, 75 per cent of 19
year olds and 54 per cent of 21 year olds met
these standards in England.
In addition to these targets for young
people, a set of targets also exists for adults of
working age. The first states that by the year
2002, 50 per cent of the workforce is to be
qualified to NVQJevel 3 (equivalent to two A
levels), while the second states that 28 per cent
of the workforce will have a professional,
vocational, management or academic
qualification at NVQJevel 4 or above
(equivalent to a first degree). By 2000, 47 per
cent and 26 per cent of adults had achieved
qualifications at levels 3 and 4 respectively.
Adult Education
Education for adults is provided by further
education institutions, adult education centres
and colleges run by LEAs, community
organisations, and voluntary bodies such as
the Workers’ Educational Association. The
duty to secure such education is currently
shared by the further education funding
councils (the Learning and Skills Council in
England and the National Council for
Education and Training for Wales from April
2001), LEAs, and the education and library
boards in Northern Ireland. University
departments of continuing education also
provide courses for adults.
Other bodies concerned with the
promotion of adult and community education
include NIACE (the National Institute of
Adult Continuing Education), Community
Learning Scotland and the Basic Skills
Agency (BSA—concerned with improving
literacy and numeracy). NIACE and the
BSA jointly manage the Adult and
Community Learning Fund on behalf of the
Department for Education and Employment.
The fund supports innovative learning
opportunities and aims to encourage people
who have been reluctant to participate in
learning in the past and who may be
disadvantaged as a result.
General adult education courses available
include languages, physical education/
sport/fitness and practical crafts/skills such as
embroidery and woodwork. Nearly seven out
of ten of all enrolments on adult education
courses in England in November 1998 were
for courses that did not lead to a formal
qualification. In total, there were 1.1 million
adults in England and Wales enrolled on adult
education courses, and enrolment rates were
higher for women than for men.
Lifelong Learning
In 1998 government policy on lifelong
learning was outlined in a DfEE Green Paper,
The Learning Age: A Renaissance for a New
Britain (separate but parallel learning
strategies for Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland having also been published).
The strategy is intended to encourage the
continuous development of people’s skills,
knowledge and understanding. The concept
of developing lifelong learning underpins
all areas of post-16 educational learning
provision.
139
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
University for Industry (Ufl)
The University for Industry (Ufl), due to
become fully operational during autumn 2000,
will be a new national on-line and distributed
learning network aimed at both individuals
and business. Ufl will operate in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Ufl aims to play a key role in improving the
nation’s competitiveness by raising people’s
skill levels and employability. Its primary
objective is to stimulate demand for lifelong
learning among adults and small/medium
enterprises by promoting the availability of,
and improving access to, relevant high quality
learning through the use of ICT.
By October 2000, over 700 learndirect
development centres were in operation.
Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs)
Individual Learning Accounts are also a
central part of the programme for lifelong
learning. A learning account is a membership
scheme with government helping people plan
and pay towards for the cost of their learning.
The national framework of Individual
Learning Accounts was launched in September
2000; £150 million of resources are being used
to contribute £150 to the first million account
holders to book eligible learning, providing
the individual pays at least £25. Under the
national framework, people will also be able
to access 20 per cent and 80 per cent discounts
on the cost of learning. The 20 per cent
discount can be used on a wide range of
learning while the 80 per cent discount will be
narrowly focused to ICT literacy and basic
mathematics. By mid-September 2000 almost
250,000 people had opened an Individual
Learning Account.
Scotland
In 1998 the consultation paper Opportunity
Scotland outlined a plan for lifelong learning
in Scotland. Since devolution in 1999 the
Scottish Executive has expanded on these
plans in its Programme for Government, the aim
being to offer greater and more equal access to
a wider range of educational opportunities. To
help achieve this aim, the following initiatives
were introduced:
• The Scottish University for Industry, due
to be launched in October 2000. Its
services will be named learndirect Scotland
and aim to help people access learning
opportunities and promote lifelong
learning across all sectors of society.
Learndirect Scotland will offer information
and advice on courses via its helpline,
website or network of learning centres. It
will also stimulate new ways of learning
and commission ICT materials to meet
any gaps in provision.
• Individual Learning Accounts, which will
help people invest in their own learning
with financial support from the Scottish
Executive and, in some cases, from their
employers with similar arrangements to
those in England.
Northern Ireland
From September 2000, in Northern Ireland,
Individual Learning Accounts will be available
with an introductory incentive of £150 to the
first 20,000 people opening accounts.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people from other countries
come to the UK to study, and many British
people work and train overseas. The British aid
programme (see chapter 7, p. 90) encourages
links between educational institutions in the UK
and developing countries.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU’s
SOCRATES programme through the
ERASMUS action which provides grants
which enable university students from the
EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Central
and Eastern European and EU pre-accession
countries (see p. 79) to study in other states.
The programme covers all academic subjects,
and the period of study normally lasts between
three and 12 months. Between 1995 and 1999,
42,859 students participated in the
140
10: EDUCATION
programme. There are currently about 10,000
students from the UK participating in the
scheme each year.
Other parts of the SOCRATES
programme support partnerships between
schools, language learning, study visits by
senior educationalists and a range of
multinational projects including open and
distance learning and adult education.
Competence in another European language is
a feature and is supported in all activities.
The LEONARDO DA VINCI programme
supports and complements vocational training
policies and practices in participating countries,
fostering transnational co-operation and
innovation in training through pilot projects,
placements and exchanges and research
projects. Between 1995 and 1999 nearly 1,200
projects were supported in the UK. Of these
810 were placement-type projects through
which over 13,000 young people undertook
part of their vocational training in another
member state. The other 372 projects were
transnational pilot projects or research projects
involving at least three countries co-operating
to develop or disseminate innovative
approaches to specific training problems and
issues.
The Youth Programme supports youth
exchange projects and volunteering activities
in EU member states and related activities
such as youth leader training. Between 1995
and 1999, 55,224 young people participated in
the programme.
EU member states have created ten
European schools, including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire, for pupils aged between four
and 19, to provide a multilingual education for
the children of staff employed in EU
institutions. Around 16,400 pupils attend
these schools.
Overseas Students in the UK
About 275,000 overseas students are now
studying in the UK at higher and further
education institutions.
Most overseas students following courses of
higher or further education pay fees covering
the full cost of their courses. Nationals of other
EU member states generally pay the lower level
of fees applicable to British home students.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes provision for foreign
students and trainees through its international
development programme and other award and
scholarship schemes. Around 2,400 receive
awards from scholarship schemes, funded in
part by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(FCO) and the Department for International
Development (DFID), were made in
1999-2000. The two main schemes funded by
the FCO and DFID are:
• British Chevening awards, a worldwide
programme offering outstanding
graduate students and young
professionals the opportunity to spend
time studying at British universities and
other academic institutions; and
• the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, offering scholarships
for study in other Commonwealth
countries. Under the scheme in the
UK scholarships are for postgraduate
study or research for one to three
years at British higher education
institutions.
The FCO is also increasing the number of
scholarships jointly funded with British or
foreign commercial firms, and with academic
and other institutions.
Other Schemes
Many other public and private scholarships
and fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known are the
British Council Fellowships, the Fulbright
Scholarship Scheme, the British Marshall
Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarships, the
Churchill Scholarships and the Confederation
of British Industry Scholarships. The
Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme,
funded by the higher education funding
councils, also provides help for overseas full¬
time postgraduate students with outstanding
research potential. Most British universities
and colleges offer bursaries and scholarships
for which graduates of any nationality are
eligible.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service—a partnership between
local government and voluntary
organisations—is concerned with the informal
personal and social education of young people
aged 11 to 25 (5 to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional voluntary
organisations. In England, the service is
estimated to reach around 3 million young
people, with the voluntary organisations
contributing a significant proportion of overall
provision.
In England the DfEE supports the youth
service through grants to the National Youth
Agency, the National Council for Voluntary
Youth Services and to the headquarters of some
80 National Voluntary Youth Organisations.
Funded primarily by local government, the
National Youth Agency provides support for
those working with young people, and
information and publishing services.
The National Assembly for Wales sponsors
the Wales Youth Agency, which is the agent for
payment of grant aid to national youth service
bodies with headquarters in Wales; it is also
responsible for the accreditation of training and
staff development for youth workers.
In Scotland the youth service forms part of
the community education provision made by
local authorities. It is also promoted by
Community Learning Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund youth clubs
and outdoor activity centres. They assist with
the running costs of registered voluntary
youth units and provide advice and support to
youth groups. Boards also help young people
visiting the rest of Britain, Ireland and
overseas. The Youth Council for Northern
Ireland advises the education system on the
development of the youth service. It promotes
the provision of facilities, encourages cross¬
community activity and pays grants to the
headquarters of voluntary bodies.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations work
mainly through local groups, which raise most
of their day-to-day expenses by their own
efforts. Many receive financial and other help
from local authorities, which also make
available facilities in many areas. The
voluntary organisations vary greatly in
character and include the uniformed
organisations, such as the Scouts and Girl
Guides, church-based and other religious
organisations, and particular interest groups.
In Wales, Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh
League of Youth) provides cultural, sporting
and language-based activities for young Welsh
speakers and learners.
Many voluntary youth organisations and
local authorities provide services for the young
unemploy ed, young people from ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Many authorities have youth
committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented. They employ youth
officers to co-ordinate youth work and to
arrange in-service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth
and community workers; several undergraduate
part-time and postgraduate courses are also
available. In Scotland one-, two- and three-year
courses are provided at teacher education
institutions. Students from Northern Ireland
attend courses run in universities and colleges
in the UK and the Irish Republic.
In the English local authority sector there
are a total of about 27,000 full- and part-time
youth workers; 90 per cent of full-time youth
workers and 33 per cent of part-timers are
nationally qualified.
Other Organisations
Many grant-giving foundations and trusts
provide finance for activities involving young
people. The Prince’s Trust and the Royal
Jubilee Trust provide grants and practical
help to individuals and organisations; areas of
concern include urban deprivation,
unemployment, homelessness and young

Over recent years, the labour market in the United Kingdom has undergone
major change, with more women in the workforce, increased levels of part-time
working and the continuing move towards employment in service industries,
where over three-quarters of employees now work.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS),
carried out by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), some 29.6 million people
aged 16 and over were economically active1 on
a seasonally adjusted basis in the UK in
April-June 2000. Of these, 15.4 million men
and 12.5 million women were in employment,
giving a total of 27.9 million (see Table 11.1),
the highest level since the series began. The
number of people aged 16 and over in
employment rose by 338,000 in the year to
April-June 2000.
One of the most significant long-term
trends in the labour market has been the
growth in the number of women in
employment. In spring 2000 women
accounted for around 45 per cent of all those
in the labour force in the UK, and economic
activity rates for women with children under
five rose from 48 per cent to 58 per cent over

government-supported training programme) or unemployed
and actively seeking work.
the previous decade. In most service industries
more than half of employees are women, while
in manufacturing, construction, agriculture,
and transport and communications women
account for less than one-third of employees.
There are several reasons for the greater
involvement of women in the workplace.
Among these are that more women are putting-
off having children until their thirties and,
when they do have children, they are far more
likely to then return to work, making use of a
growing number of childcare options, than
were previous generations. In addition, many
of the new jobs available in the service sector,
particularly those involving computers and
telephones, are in areas where women can
compete for jobs with men on equal terms,
whereas many of the more traditional jobs,
which are declining in number, particularly
those in the mining, construction and heavy
engineering industries, require a degree of
physical strength which puts women at a
disadvantage.
More and more people are working part
time, although women are more likely to do so
than men. Part-time workers over the age of
16 now total 6.8 million. About 44 per cent of
144
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
women in employment work part-time,
compared with 9 per cent of men.
There has also been a gradual move away
from manual to non-manual occupations,
which are now held by around 61 per cent of
those in employment.
The private sector share of employment
rose from 71 per cent in 1981 to 82 per cent
(22.9 million) in 1999. In 1999 jobs in the
public sector increased for the first time since
1979 to 5 million, mainly reflecting higher
employment in education and in NHS Trusts
(see p. 188).
Around 1.2 million people had two or more
jobs in April-June 2000, while roughly 1.7
million (7.1 per cent of employees) were
engaged in temporary jobs (see Table 11.3).
Around one in three people work in temporary
jobs because they cannot find a permanent
one. A similar proportion work in temporary
jobs because they prefer to do so.
‘Teleworking’—people working from home
using information technology (IT)—is
becoming more widespread. In spring 2000
some 312,000 people were classed as
teleworkers whose main job was primarily in
their own home; extending the definition to
cover those working in different places using
home as a base and those who spent at least
one day a week working from home raised the
number to 1.6 million.
In the period April-June 2000 around 3.2
million people were self-employed in the UK:
15 per cent of men and 7 per cent of women in
employment are self-employed. Agriculture
and fishing, and construction have the highest
proportions of self-employed people, while
relatively few of those engaged in
manufacturing and public administration are
self-employed.
Employment by Sector
The shift in jobs from manufacturing to
service industries has continued in the past
decade. In the year to March 2000 the number
of workforce jobs, (a measure of the total
number of jobs, rather than the number of
people in employment) in service industries
rose to nearly 21.1 million.
Transport and communications was one
service sector to record a particularly large rise
in workforce jobs in the year to March 2000,
with the number of jobs up by over 4 per cent
from the previous year to 1.7 million. A
contributory factor was the growth in telephone
call centres, which are provided by several
companies, for example in banking, other
financial services, retailing and transport. Call
centres employ large numbers of people to deal
with customer requests, and computer
telephonists are one of the fastest growing
occupational groups in the UK. The continuing
growth in the number of mobile telephones in
use in the UK (see p. 376) has also accounted
for a large number of new jobs in this sector.
In the last ten years most other sectors have
experienced falling levels of employment.
Traditional manufacturing industries, such as
steel and shipbuilding, have recorded

particularly large falls in employment. By
March 2000 manufacturing accounted for 15
per cent of employee jobs, compared with 42
per cent in 1955.
Unemployment
Unemployment in the UK has fallen
considerably since the peak at the end of 1992.
In April-June 2000, 1.6 million people were
unemployed, 5.5 per cent of those in the
labour force, compared with 6.0 per cent in
the same period of 1999, according to the
International Labour Organisation (ILO)
definition of unemployment. In April-June
2000 some 449,000 people had been
unemployed for a year or more, of whom
254,000 had been out of work for two years or
more. The UK unemployment rate is similar
to that for the major G7 group of nations and
substantially below the EU average. In April
2000 the ILO unemployment rate for those
aged 15 and over was 5.9 per cent in the G7
and 8.5 per cent in the EU.
Unemployment among 16 to 24 year olds in
the UK is running at double the overall rate.
There are several reasons for the relatively high
level of youth unemployment, including lack of
skills, qualifications and experience.
Unemployment rates tend to fall as the level of
qualification increases. In spring 2000 the
unemployment rate for those with no
qualifications was around four times higher than
for those with a higher educational qualification.
Among people with broadly similar
educational qualifications, those from ethnic
minorities tend to have higher unemployment
rates than those from the White group.

Unemployment rates are particularly high for
young Black people; in spring 2000 the rate for
those aged 16 to 24 was 33 per cent.
Areas that used to rely on heavy industries
(such as steel, shipbuilding and coal mining)
which have since declined are often among
those with the highest rates of unemployment.
Areas with the lowest levels of unemployment
include the South East and East of England,
with rates well below the UK average.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
LABOUR MARKET POLICY
The Government’s strategy aims to ensure
employment opportunity for all who can work.
It comprises the following key elements:
• helping people to move from welfare to
work, through the New Deal and ONE—
the Government’s integrated, work-
focused service providing benefits and
employment advice (see p. 152);
• helping the transition into work, by aiming
to remove barriers to work and ensure that
people are not financially worse off when
moving from welfare to work;
• making work pay, through reform of the
tax and benefit system (see also chapters
12 and 24); and
• securing career progression in work,
through lifelong learning.
TRAINING AND EDUCATION
Training and education are among the
Government’s top priorities (see also chapter
10) as it wishes to ensure that the UK
workforce has the necessary skills to meet the
challenges of a rapidly changing world
economy. According to the LFS, in spring
2000, 3.6 million employees of working age
(15.1 per cent) in the UK had received job-
related training in the previous four weeks.
Employees with higher level qualifications are
almost six times more likely to have received
training than those with no qualifications;
younger employees are about two-and-a-half
times more likely to have received training
than older employees.
In June 1999 the Government published
the White Paper Learning to Succeed, in which
it announced its intention to create a new
framework for the planning, funding and
delivery of all post-16 education and training
provision. The White Paper included
measures affecting schools, colleges and work-
based training, as well as a new focus for the
Careers Service. In addition, under the
Welfare-to-Work programme (see p. 151), all
young unemployed people are guaranteed
education and training opportunities, while
those with poor basic skills have the option of
participating in full-time study on an
approved course. The Learning and Skills Act
2000, which covers England and Wales,
provides for the implementation of these
measures. The Act includes provision for:
• a new Learning and Skills Council for
England, which will bring together for
the first time into a single national body
responsibility for planning and funding
post-16 learning in England;
• a new Council for Education and
Training in Wales;
• new arrangements for rigorous and
independent external inspection of post-
16 education and training;
• the Connexions Service to provide
integrated support services for all 13 to
19 year olds; and
• powers to remove obstacles to
collaboration between schools, education
authorities and further education.
Training and Support Programmes
There are several programmes available to
help increase workforce skills. These are either
offered as alternatives to academic education
for 16 to 19 year olds or as part of an existing
employee’s training:
• Foundation Modern Apprenticeships
(FMAs—formerly National
Traineeships) aim to offer broad and
flexible learning programmes, including
the key skills of communication,
numeracy and IT, and operate to agreed
national standards—National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ) at Level 2 (see
chapter 10) is the primary qualification to
be achieved—set by industry and
employers in 40 industry sectors.
• Advanced Modern Apprenticeships
(AMAs—formerly Modern
Apprenticeships) are designed to increase
significantly the number of young people
trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. The primary
achievement of an AMA is the N\ Q^at
Level 3.
• The right to time off for study or training
for 16 and 17 year olds came into effect in
148
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
«
Great Britain from September 1999 and
came into operation in Northern Ireland
in September 2000. Under this measure,
young people are entitled to take paid
time off to study or train towards a
qualification, usually at NVQLevel 2.
• Individual Learning Accounts. Since
April 1999 Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs—see below) have been
providing starter accounts. For further
information see chapter 10, p. 140.
• Career development loans are available to
help people pay for vocational education
or training in Great Britain. Loans of
between £300 and £8,000 are provided
through major banks, and interest
payments on the loans during training
and for one month after training are
funded by the Department for Education
and Employment (DfEE). The loans help
to pay for courses lasting up to two years.
By the end of January 2000, 125,000
people had received a career development
loan, and £414 million had been lent.
• Small Firms Training Loans are deferred
repayment bank loans. The programme
helps firms with 50 or fewer employees to
meet a range of vocational training-
related expenses, including training
consultancy. Loans of between £500 and
£125,000 are available through major
banks. Repayments can be deferred for
between six and 12 months, according to
the amount borrowed, and during this
time interest payments on the loan are
funded by the DfEE. By the end of June
2000 over £3.5 million had been lent to
523 small firms.
• The National Training Awards, an
annual competition designed to promote
good training practice, rewards those
who have carried out exceptionally
effective training. There were 787 entries
in 1999 and 58 national winners.
• Work-Based Learning for Adults is open
to those aged 25 and over who have been
unemployed for six months or longer.
The aim is to help adults without work
move into sustained employment,
including self-employment, through
work-based learning.
In Scotland the government-funded
training programme for young people is
Skillseekers; all young people aged 16 and 17
are entitled to Skillseekers training. Its key
elements are:
• training leading to a recognised
qualification, up to Scottish Vocational
Qualification (SVQ) Level 3;
• an individual training plan; and
• employer involvement.
Training Bodies
Learning and Skills Council
Under the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the
national Learning and Skills Council for
England (and the Council for Education and
Training in Wales—see p. 136), will assume
responsibility for government-funded training
and workforce development from TECs with
effect from April 2001. The Council, which
will have 47 local arms across England, will
have the aim of increasing the range of
learning opportunities for businesses,
communities and individuals. The two
Councils will take over the roles of the 72
TECs/Chambers of Commerce Training and
Enterprise (CCTEs) in England and Wales.
These are independent companies with
employer-led boards. Their objectives are to
foster local economic development and
stimulate employer investment in skills.
Specifically, they are charged with developing
the quality, effectiveness and relevance to the
local labour market of government-funded
training and business assistance programmes.
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering both economic development
and environmental improvement. LECs are
also responsible for the delivery of the
Scottish Executive’s national training
programmes. They run under contract to two
non-departmental public bodies: Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
149
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Enterprise (see p. 395). The enterprise
networks are currently the subject of a review
initiated by the Scottish Executive (see
p. 395).
National Training Organisations
National Training Organisations (NTOs) are
employer-led bodies which are responsible for
the development of skills to meet the business
needs of employment sectors throughout the
UK. They have a primary role in encouraging
employer involvement in the development and
uptake of competence-based standards,
education, training and qualifications to help
businesses improve competitiveness in the UK
and abroad. The NTOs Network was created
in 1998, bringing together in a single network
over 180 Industry Training Organisations
(ITOs), Occupations Standards Councils and
other interested bodies.
By August 2000, 76 NTOs had been
officially recognised, covering 94 per cent of
the workforce.
Targets and Standards
The National Learning Targets (see p. 139),
launched in England in 1998, focus on the
Government’s priorities: a globally
competitive economy, with successful firms
operating in a fair and efficient labour market;
and a society where everybody has an equal
chance to realise their potential.
The Training Standards Council was
established in 1998 to supervise a Training
Inspectorate with the aim of raising standards
of work-based training funded through
TECs/CCTEs. Expenditure on training
inspections through the Council and its
Inspectorate is estimated at £6.9 million in
2000-01. From 1 April 2001, there will be new
arrangements for the inspection of post-16
learning. The Office for Standards in
Education (OFSTED) will have responsibility
for inspecting provision for 16 to 19 year olds
in schools and colleges (see chapter 10). The
work of the Training Standards Council will
be taken into the new Adult Learning
Inspectorate, which will be responsible for the
inspection of post-19 provision in colleges and
for work-based learning for all post-16s.
Further information on National Learning
Targets can be found in chapter 10.
Investors in People
Investors in People is the National Standard
w hich sets a level of good practice for improving
an organisation’s performance through its
people. It is designed to improve business
performance by linking the training and
development of employees to an organisation’s
business objectives. Reported benefits include
increased productivity, higher profits, lower
rates of sickness and absenteeism, and improved
morale. Over the past year Investors in People
UK, which is responsible for the promotion,
quality assurance and development of the
Standard, has carried out an extensive review to
simplify the Standard and make it more
accessible, especially for small firms. At the end
of September 2000,19,579 organisations in the
UK had been recognised as Investors in People,
and a further 21,480 were committed to
achieving the Standard. Over 8.6 million
employees work in organisations involved in
Investors in People, covering around 37 per cent
of the UK workforce.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Department for
Higher and Further Education, Training and
Employment (DHFETE) has responsibility
for ensuring that the skills and labour needs of
the local economy are met. The vocational
training and employment activities of the
Department are delivered through an
executive agency, the Training and
Employment Agency. The Agency has
facilitated the development of sector training
councils in each of the main industry private
sectors to advise on training needs. A Skills
Task Force has also been established.
Northern Ireland has its own range of
training and employment programmes
designed to raise skills levels and linked to
NVQs. The main youth programme—
Jobskills—serves the needs of 16 to 18 year
olds and Modern Apprenticeships
programmes are also delivered. In addition to
New Deal, a Worktrack programme and a
150
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
statutory organisation, Enterprise Ulster,
provide a range of places for adults. A focused
skills programme aimed at meeting immediate
needs in the economy provides a range of skills
opportunities, particularly in the high
technology sector.
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
W elfare-to-W ork
The Government’s Welfare-to-Work
programme, covering the UK, is a series of
measures designed with the aim of promoting an
efficient labour market and tackling structural
unemployment and inactivity, and social
exclusion. The Government has introduced
several key initiatives, including a number of
New Deals, ONE (see p. 152) and Employment
Zones (see p. 152). Common features of the
measures for those seeking employment include:
• the assistance of personal advisers,
providing a single point of contact and help;
• a ‘gateway’ period of concentrated
diagnosis and support; and
• an emphasis on trying to obtain
sustainable employment.
The Welfare-to-Work programme is
currently funded by a windfall tax on the
excess profits of the privatised utilities. Over
£4 billion is being invested in the programme
over the five years to 2001—02 in a number of
New Deals including:
• £\.5 billion for young unemployed
people;
• £600 million for the long-term
unemployed;
• £220 million for lone parents;
• £210 million for sick and disabled people;
• £50 million for partners of the
unemployed;
• £40 million for those aged over 50;
• £40 million for childcare; and
• £1.6 billion for schools.
A new Employment Opportunities Fund
will be created to fund the New Deal,
associated employment programmes, the ONE
service and the establishment costs of the
working age agency (see p. 153) after the
windfall tax receipts have been spent.
Young Unemployed
The New Deal for the young unemployed is
available to young people aged 18 to 24 who
have been unemployed for more than six
months. It begins with an intensive period of
up to four months, of counselling, advice and
guidance—the ‘gateway’. If a young person
has not left the ‘gateway’ after that time, he or
she must choose one of four options:
• a job attracting a wage subsidy of £60 a
week, payable to employers for up to six
months;
• a work placement with a voluntary
organisation;
• a six-month work placement with an
Environment Task Force (see p. 309);
and
• for those without basic qualifications, a
place on a full-time education and
training course, which might last for up
to one year.
All these options include an element of
education and training equivalent to one day a
week. By the end of August 2000 there had
been 532,200 starts on the New Deal since its
launch in April 1998: 416,900 people had left,
of whom 39 per cent had entered sustained
unsubsidised jobs.
Long-term Unemployed
Under the New Deal for the long-term
unemployed, which started in 1998, employers
receive a subsidy of up to £75 a week for 26
weeks if they employ anyone who has been
unemployed for two years or longer. From
April 2001 the scheme will be extended as the
New Deal 25 plus programme, with eligibility
reduced to 18 months for those aged 25 and
over. The programme will include:
• a ‘gateway’ period aimed at helping
people into jobs, tackling barriers to work
and providing people with
communication skills, motivation and
confidence-building;
151
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• a period of full-time activity where
individuals will be able to choose a mix,
based on their needs, of subsidised
employment, work-focused training,
work experience, help with jobsearch
or help with moving into
self-employment;
• a period for those who do not find w ork
through the full-time activity period
involving intensive help to take
advantage of their experience and move
into work; and
• benefit penalties, if individuals do not
take advantage of this assistance.
Other Groups
The New Deal for Lone Parents was launched
in October 1998. It provides the opportunity
for all lone parents on Income Support to
meet a personal adviser and receive help and
support to help improve their employment
prospects. A package of improvements was
introduced from May 2000 including more
intensive support for lone parents about to
move onto Jobseeker’s Allowance as their
children reach age 16, access to specialised
resource centres to help with preparation for
work and job search, and an extension of
invitations to lone parents w ith children from
the age of three.
From autumn 2000 in pathfinder areas, and
nationally from April 2001, lone parents on
Income Support with children over the age of
five will be required to meet a specialist
adviser to guide them through a series of
choices, offered on a voluntary basis,
including:
• work of 16 hours a week or more, to
move lone parents onto the Working
Families’ Tax Credit (see p. 176);
• the opportunity to try some work under
16 hours a week; and
• the opportunity to undertake education
and training.
There are also pilot schemes to help those
who are disabled or on incapacity benefit who
want training or work. The March 2000
Budget announced the first stage of the
development of a nationwide service to help
disabled people find work. The service will
evaluate different approaches in order to
develop the most effective policies for disabled
people. A New Deal for partners of the
unemployed, including the option of help
needed to return to work, was established on a
nationwide basis in April 1999.
New Deal 50 plus w as introduced
nationally from April 2000. This scheme
enables people over 50 who return to full-time
work after six months or more on benefits to
claim a subsidy of £60 a week for their first
year back in full-time employment.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland there is a broadly similar
system to Welfare-to-Work, although
programmes such as ONE (see below) may be
at a different stage of development.
Responsibility for administration of
programmes and services rests with the
Northern Ireland DHFETE and the
Department for Social Development and their
executive agencies.
Employment Zones
Following a prototype scheme, Employment
Zones began running in spring 2000 in 15
areas of Great Britain with concentrated, long¬
term unemployment. New approaches to
tackle unemployment—including financial
help for individual jobseekers through
personal job accounts—are being adopted and
are being provided by public, private and
voluntary sector organisations selected to run
the zones by open competition. About £112
million is available to support this initiative
over the two years from spring 2000. The aim
is to help around 50,000 long-term
unemployed jobseekers aged 25 and over.
ONE
The ONE service w as launched in four areas
in June 1999 and extended to a further eight
areas in November 1999. It is provided by the
Employment Service, Benefits Agency and
local authorities in partnership. It provides a
single point of entry into the benefit system
152
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
for people of working age who are
unemployed or working less than 16 hours a
week. Clients living within the 12 pilot areas
meet a personal adviser at the outset of their
claim and receive support and advice with the
aim of identifying and overcoming barriers to
work. For some people an immediate focus on
work is not appropriate and in these cases the
priority is to resolve their immediate financial
needs by paying them the correct benefit and
discussing the range of help which is available
to them. Four pilots are testing call centre
technology and four are being provided in
partnership with the private and voluntary
sectors. Since 3 April 2000 participation in a
work-focused meeting has been a condition of
receipt of benefits for new clients in all 12
areas.
Action Teams
In autumn 2000 Action Teams will be set up,
initially for one year, in 40 communities in the
UK with the lowest employment and highest
unemployment, including the 15 Employment
Zones. Funds of £45.5 million will be
available for a period of a year from autumn
2000 for the Teams to work with jobless
people in the most deprived areas, with the
aim of removing barriers to employment and,
by working with employers, identifying
suitable vacancies in neighbouring areas and
helping jobless people to fill them. Funding
will be available for transport to enable people
to access nearby vacancies. Action Teams will
be led by the Employment Service in 25 areas
and the Employment Zone contractors in the
Employment Zone areas. The Teams will
bring together secondees from the private and
voluntary sectors.
Government Employment Services
The Government is planning to change the
support for people of working age. The
Employment Service and those parts of the
Benefit Agency supporting people of working
age are to be merged in 2001. The new agency
will provide a single, integrated service to
benefit claimants of working age and to
employers.
Currently, the Government provides a
range of services to jobseekers through the
Employment Service, an executive agency of
the DfEE. These include:
• a network of local offices, at which people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into employment,
for example, by training; and
• a range of special programmes, including
those for people with disabilities.
The Employment Service has a national
network of over 1,000 Jobcentres and a budget
in Great Britain of over £1,900 million for
2000—01, of which £838 million is connected
with the New Deals. In 1999-2000 it placed
over 1.3 million unemployed people into jobs
and conducted nearly 4 million advisory
interviews to help people find appropriate
work or places on employment and training
programmes. The Employment Service also
has a key role in the delivery of the
Government’s Welfare-to-Work measures,
particularly in relation to the New Deal
programmes and ONE (see above).
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
employment advice and training
opportunities. Employment Service advisers
see all jobseekers when a claim is made for
Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 174) to assess
their eligibility and to provide advice about
jobs, training and self-employment
opportunities. To receive the allowance, each
unemployed person has to complete a
Jobseeker’s Agreement, which sets out his or
her availability for work, the types of job for
which he or she is looking, and the steps
which, if taken, offer the best ehance of
securing work. Jobseekers are required to
attend a job search review each fortnight and
periodic intensive advisory interviews to assess
their situation and see what additional help, if
any, is needed and, if appropriate, to revise the
Jobseeker’s Agreement.
With the introduction of the New Deal
programmes for the young and long-term
153
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
unemployed, the range of Employment
Service programmes was restructured and
brought together into a new package of
measures. Programme Centres have been
introduced nationally and are gradually
replacing traditional fixed-length job search
courses with a modular approach that
addresses the needs of individual jobseekers,
and allows providers to take a flexible
approach so that jobsearch help can be
adapted for local delivery. Other programmes
include Jobclubs (offering guidance on
jobseeking, interview skills and other practical
assistance), Jobplan workshops (a mandatory
five-day programme of individual assessment)
and work trial, where jobseekers spend up to a
maximum of 15 days in an actual vacancy.
A new Learning and Work Bank, which
will be set up later in 2000, will allow
jobseekers to use the Internet to search for
work, training or education at home, at call
centres or kiosks, in shopping centres, bars or
eventually via a mobile telephone. The
Government is supporting the scheme with
£68 million over the next two years. The
scheme is being run in conjunction with a
private sector firm, EDS, as part of the Private
Finance Initiative.
Employment Agencies
There are many thousands of private
employment agencies, including several large
firms with significant branch networks. The
law governing the conduct of employment
agencies is less restrictive than in many other
EU countries, but agencies must comply with
legislation which establishes a framework of
minimum standards designed to protect
agency users, both workers and hirers. A
review of the regulatory framework was
launched by the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) in 1999, and a revised series of
regulations should be in force by early 2001.
PAY AND CONDITIONS
Earnings
Average gross weekly earnings of full-time
employees on adult rates in Great Britain
whose pay was unaffected by absence were
£411 in April 2000, according to the ONS
New Earnings Survey. Average earnings for
men were £453 and for women £338.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£465) than for manual employees
(£321), with managerial and professional
groups the highest paid.
Minimum Wage
The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 set
out the regulatory framework for the national
minimum wage which was introduced on
1 April 1999. Minimum wage rates are:
• £3.70 an hour for those aged 22 or above
(from 1 October 2000); and
• £3.20 an hour for workers aged 18 to 21,
and for those aged 22 or over in the first
six months of a new job with a new
employer, and receiving accredited
training.
Among those to whom the national
minimum wage does not apply are:
• the self-employed;
• people under 18 years of age;
• apprentices and those on National
Apprenticeship schemes under 19 years
of age and those aged 19 to 25 in the first
12 months of their apprenticeship or
Modern Apprenticeship—from 1
October 2000 this exemption will also
apply to those on National Traineeships,
Foundation Modern Apprenticeships or
Advanced Modern Apprenticeships in
England and Wales, Skillseekers in
Scotland and Jobskills Traineeships in
Northern Ireland;
• members of the armed forces; and
• people living in their employer’s home
and treated as part of the family (for
example, au pairs).
Around 1.5 million low-paid workers are
estimated to have become entitled to higher
pay following the introduction of the national
minimum wage, some two-thirds of whom are
women and around 120,000 young people.
Sectors most affected have been hospitality
(hotels and catering), retailing, cleaning,
154
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
hairdressing, social care, footwear and clothing
manufacture, and private security.
Fringe Benefits
Fringe benefits are used by many employers to
provide additional rewards to their employees.
They include schemes to encourage financial
participation by employees in their companies,
pension schemes, private medical insurance,
subsidised meals, company cars and childcare
schemes. Company cars are provided for
employees in a wide variety of circumstances.
From April 2002, the tax charge for company
cars will be linked to exhaust emissions.
Around 1.7 million people in 1997-98 had a
company car available for private use and
about half of these received fuel for private
motoring in their car.
By the end of March 2000, 3,790 profit-
related pay schemes, which link part of pay to
changes in a business’s profits, were registered
with the Inland Revenue, covering around 1.6
million people. Many companies have adopted
employee share schemes, where employees
receive free shares or options to buy shares at a
discount from their employer without paying
income tax. A new all-employee share
ownership plan will be introduced later in
2000, allowing employees to buy shares from
their pre-tax salary and to receive free shares,
with tax incentives for longer-term
shareholding.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic
working week of between 34 and 40 hours, and
work a five-day week. When overtime is taken
into account, average weekly hours worked by
full-time workers in their main job in the UK
in April—June 2000 were 38.0 hours: 39.9
hours for men and 34.2 hours for women. For
part-time workers the average was 15.4 hours.
Both male and female full-time employees
tend to work more hours than people in other
EU countries. Hours worked tend to be
longest in agriculture, construction, and
transport and communications, and shortest in
most service industries. Self-employed people
work, on average, longer hours than full-time
employees. A significant minority of
employees have flexible working hours or are
engaged in some sort of shift work.
Holiday entitlements have generally been
determined by negotiation. In spring 2000 the
average paid holiday entitlement for full-time
workers was just under five weeks. However,
some employees, such as part-time and
temporary employees, may have much less
holiday entitlement.
Two EC regulations, on working time and
on young workers (in relation to hours of work
of adolescents), came into force in the UK in
1998. They apply to full-time, part-time and
temporary workers, although workers in certain
sectors—including transport, sea fishing, other
work at sea, and doctors in training—are
currently exempt. They provide for:
• a maximum working week of 48 hours
(on average), although individual workers
can choose to work longer;
• a minimum of four weeks’ annual paid
leave;
• minimum daily and weekly rest periods;
and
• a limit for night workers of an average
eight hours’ work in a 24-hour period.
There are specific provisions for adolescent
workers in respect of these rights and
entitlements.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Around a third of employees in Great Britain
in 1999 were in workplaces covered by
collective bargaining, which is generally more
prevalent in large establishments and in the
public sector. Collective bargaining mainly
concerns pay and working conditions. In
general, negotiations are now conducted more
at a local level, although many large firms
retain a degree of central control over the
bargaining process. There are relatively few
industry-wide agreements; where they do
exist, they are often supplemented by local
agreements in companies or factories (plant
bargaining). The EC’s European Works
Councils Directive requires firms with 1,000
or more employees and which operate in two
or more member states to establish European-
level information and consultation procedures.
155
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Regulations implementing the Directive in the
UK took effect in January 2000. About 110
UK-based companies are affected by the
Directive.
The results of the 1998 Workplace
Employee Relations Survey were published in
September 1999.2 The Survey was sponsored
by the DTI, the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS) (see p. 159), the
Economic and Social Research Council and
the Policy Studies Institute. Among its key
findings were:
• workplace flexibility has increased, with
many more workplaces reporting greater
use of contracting out, temporary agency
workers, fixed-term employees and part-
time workers;
• some workplaces have introduced
management practices designed to foster
employee commitment and improve
performance, including procedures for
dispute resolution, briefing meetings and
performance appraisals;
• fewer workplaces are recognising trade
unions—42 per cent, compared with 53
per cent in 1990;
• over half of employees expressed
themselves as satisfied (46 per cent) or very
satisfied (7 per cent) with their job—only
19 per cent being dissatisfied or very
dissatisfied (the remaining 27 per cent
were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied).
Employees were more likely to be satisfied
with their job when they could influence
how they carried out their work, and when
they thought management showed an
understanding about balancing work and
family responsibilities, encouraged skill
development, involved employees and
treated them fairly; and
• industrial action was reported in just 2
per cent of workplaces.

Individual Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
main conditions, including pay, hours of work
and holidays. Employees with at least two
years of continuous employment with their
employer are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist and their employers cannot offer suitable
alternative work.3
Minimum periods of notice are laid down
for both employers and employees. Most
employees who believe they have been
unfairly dismissed have the right to complain
to an employment tribunal (see p. 158),
subject to the general qualifying period of one
year’s continuous service. If the complaint is
upheld, the tribunal may make an order for re¬
employment or award compensation.
Legislation prohibits discrimination on
grounds of sex or marital status (see p. 115) or
disability or on grounds of race, nationality
(including citizenship) or ethnic or national
origin (see p. 111), in employment, training and
related matters. In Northern Ireland
discrimination in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is unlawful.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women in Great
Britain are entitled to equal pay with men when
doing work that is the same or broadly similar,
work which is rated as equivalent, or work
which is of equal value. Despite this, there is a
continuing pay gender gap. Among men and
women working full-time the gap between their
hourly earnings has narrowed since the mid-
1970s. By 1999, in Britain, women’s hourly
earnings were 84 per cent of men’s earnings.
Under the Disability Discrimination Act
1995, disabled people have the right not to be
discriminated against in employment.
Employers with 15 or more employees have a
duty not to discriminate against disabled
employees or applicants. The Disability Rights
3 The statutory redundancy payment is calculated
according to a formula based on a person’s age, the
number of years of continuous service and his or her
weekly pay. However, many employers pay more than the
statutory amount.
156
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
Commission (see p. 165) began operating on 25
April 2000 to protect the rights of all disabled
people, both those in work and out of work. It
has powers to investigate cases of discrimination
at work against people with disabilities, and to
ensure employers comply with the appropriate
legal regulations.
All pregnant employees have the right to
statutory maternity leave with their non-wage
contractual benefits maintained, and
protection against dismissal because of
pregnancy. Statutory maternity pay is payable
by an employer for up to 18 weeks to women
with at least six months’ service with that
employer.
New Rights
The Employment Relations Act 1999, and in
Northern Ireland the Employment Relations
(NI) Order 1999, introduced a package of
family-oriented employment rights. Key
elements are:
• a minimum of 18 weeks’ maternity leave
for all female employees (in line with
statutory maternity pay;
• additional maternity leave for women
after one year’s service (reduced from the
previous two years);
• 13 weeks’ parental unpaid leave after one
year’s service for mothers and fathers
after the birth of their baby or adopting a
child on or after 15 December 1999;
• being able to return to the same job, or its
equivalent, at the end of maternity and
parental leave;
• clarification of the status of an
employee’s employment contract during
periods of paternal or maternity leave;
• emergency time off unpaid to care for
dependants; and
• protection against victimisation for
exercising any of these rights.
The Government has launched a review
looking at the issues surrounding maternity
rights and paternity leave. The review will
consider the steps needed to make sure that
parents have choices to help them balance the
needs of their work and their children so that
they may contribute fully to the modern
economy. In doing so, it will take into
account:
• the impact of maternity pay and parental
leave on business, particularly small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and
families, including whether it is possible
to simplify the implementation of
existing legislation;
• best practice in business and its impact,
including the extent to which employers
currently offer additional entitlements or
flexible arrangements;
• factors affecting women’s decisions to
return to work after childbirth;
• factors affecting the take-up of parental
and paternity leave; and
• the impact of returning to work part-time,
working from home or on flexible hours.
Trade Union and Industrial Relations
Law
Among the legal requirements governing
industrial relations are:
• All individuals have the right not to be
dismissed or refused employment (or the
services of an employment agency)
because of membership or non¬
membership of a trade union.
• Where a union is recognised by an
employer for collective bargaining
purposes, union officials are entitled to
paid time off for undertaking certain
trade union duties and training. The
employer is also obliged to disclose
information to the union for collective
bargaining purposes.
• A trade union must elect every member
of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections
must be held at least every five years and
be carried out by a secret postal ballot
under independent scrutiny.
• If a trade union wishes to set up a
political fund, its members must first
agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an
aim of the union. The union must also
157
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
ballot its members every ten years to
maintain the fund. Union members have
a statutory right to opt out of
contributing to the fund.
• For a union to have the benefit of
statutory immunity when organising
industrial action, the action must be
wholly or mainly in contemplation or
furtherance of a trade dispute between
workers and their own employer.
Industrial action must not involve
workers who have no dispute with their
own employer (so-called ‘secondary’
action) or involve unlawful forms of
picketing. Before calling for industrial
action, a trade union must obtain the
support of its members in a secret postal
ballot.
Recent Changes
Various changes to industrial relations
legislation were introduced under the
Employment Relations Act 1999 and in
Northern Ireland the Employment Relations
(NI) Order 1999. For example, new
procedures concerning the recognition by
employers of trade unions, which apply to
organisations with over 20 workers, took effect
in June 2000. Unions can be recognised, or
derecognised, for collective bargaining
purposes where this is the clear wish of the
workers in the relevant bargaining units.
Parties are encouraged to reach a voluntary
agreement where possible, but if this proves
impossible a strengthened Central Arbitration
Committee (CAC) will decide the issues
concerned. Other provisions include:
• an extended right for employees
dismissed for taking part in lawfully
organised official industrial action to
complain of unfair dismissal to a
tribunal;
• a legal right for employees to be
accompanied by a fellow employee or
trade union representative at a major
hearing during disciplinary and grievance
procedures;
• the establishment of powers to prohibit
the blacklisting of trade unionists; and
• the establishment of a new Partnership
Fund to contribute to the training of
managers and employee representatives
in order to assist and develop
partnerships at work.
These provisions are being implemented,
on a phased basis, between 1999 and 2001.
Employment Tribunals
Employment tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints covering a range of
employment rights, including unfair dismissal,
redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex and race
discrimination. The Employment Rights
(Dispute Resolution) Act 1998 streamlined
tribunal procedures and encouraged voluntary
settlement of disputes on employment rights. It
also promoted a voluntary arbitration scheme,
developed by ACAS (see p. 159), to settle unfair
dismissal. These tribunals received 89,000
applications in 1999-2000. Northern Ireland has
a separate tribunal system.
Labour Disputes
In the past 20 years there has been a
substantial decline in working days lost
through labour disputes. In 1999 there were
205 stoppages of work arising from labour
disputes, and 242,000 working days were lost
as a result. Stoppages over pay accounted for
two-thirds of days lost. The United Kingdom
has a good record in employment relations: in
1998 only 12 days were lost per 1,000
employees to labour disputes, compared with
the EU average of 48.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. As well as negotiating pay and
other terms and conditions of employment
with employers, they provide benefits and
services, such as educational facilities,
financial services, legal advice and aid in work-
related cases.
In autumn 1999 there were 7.1 million
trade union members in Great Britain,
according to the Labour Force Survey, almost
158
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
20 per cent fewer than in 1989.4 The decline
in membership was particularly noticeable
where it has traditionally been high—among
male employees, manual workers and those in
production industries. Public administration
has the highest density of union members,
around 60 per cent of all employees (54 per
cent among female employees). Sectors with
relatively few union members include
agriculture, forestry and fishing, hotels and
restaurants, and wholesale and retail trade.
At the end of March 2000 there were 221
trade unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations. A further 22 unions were known
to the Certification Officer.
The national body of the trade union
movement is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. At the beginning of
1999 its affiliated membership comprised 74
trade unions, which together represented
some 6.8 million people.
There are six TUC regional councils for
England and a Wales Trades Union Council.
The annual Congress meets in September to
discuss matters of concern to trade unionists.
A General Council represents the TUC
between annual meetings.
In Scotland there is a separate national
central body, the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, to which UK unions usually
affiliate their Scottish branches. Nearly all
trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of unions
4 There are two main sources of information on trade union
membership: the ONS Labour Force Survey and data
provided by trade unions to the Certification Office.
Differences in coverage result in different estimates—for
example, the Certification Office’s figure for trade union
membership in 1998 was 7.9 million, compared with 7.1 million
obtained from the Labour Force Survey in autumn 1999.
affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority also
belong to unions based in Great Britain, which
are affiliated to the TUC.
I he EUC participates in international
trade union activity, through its affiliation to
the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions and the European Trade Union
Confederation. It also nominates the British
workers’ delegation to the annual International
Labour Conference.
The TUC initiated the TUC Partnership
Institute in spring 2000 to provide an advisory
and training service to help unions and
employers establish partnerships at work.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in the UK are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also trade associations
concerned with commercial matters in
general. Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. At
the end of March 2000, 101 listed employers’
associations were known to the Certification
Officer; a further 100 unlisted associations
were in operation.
Most national organisations belong to the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI—see
p. 399), which represents directly or indirectly
around 200,000 businesses.
ACAS
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body with a general duty of promoting the
improvement of industrial relations. ACAS
aims to operate through the voluntary co¬
operation of employers, employees and,
where appropriate, their representatives. Its
main functions are collective conciliation;
provision of arbitration and mediation;
advisory mediation services for preventing
159
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
disputes and improving industrial relations
through the joint involvement of employers
and employees; and the provision of a public
enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights,
and in late 2000 plans to introduce a new
voluntary system for resolving unfair
dismissal claims.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
There has been a long-term decline in injuries
to employees in the UK, partly reflecting a
change in industrial structure away from the
traditional heavy industries, which tend to
have higher risks. In 1999—2000 the number of
deaths of employees and the self-employed
from injuries at work was 216, which
represented a fatal injury rate of 0.8 per
100,000 workers. About 6.5 million working
days were lost in 1997-98 as a result of work-
related injuries.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work.
Employers with five or more staff must
prepare a written statement of their health and
safety policy and bring it to the attention of
their staff.
In June 2000 the Government announced
new targets to cut workplace deaths, injuries
and illness:
• to cut deaths and major injury accidents
by 10 per cent by 2010;
• to reduce the rate of work-related ill-
health by 20 per cent by 2010;
• to cut working days lost per 100,000
workers due to work-related injury and
ill-health by 30 per cent by 2010; and
• to achieve half of the above
improvements by 2004.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) has
responsibility for developing policy on health
and safety at work in Great Britain, including
proposals for new or revised regulations and
approved codes of practice. Recent work has
concentrated on a simpler and more effective
system of health and safety regulation.
The HSC has advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each covering a specific
sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the
primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. Its field services
and inspections are carried out by the Field
Operations Directorate, which includes the
Railway Inspectorate, the Safety Policy
Directorate, the Health Directorate and the
Hazardous Installations and Nuclear Safety
Inspectorates.
The HSE’s Technology Division provides
technical advice on industrial health and safety
matters. The Health and Safety Laboratory
(HSL), an Agency of the HSE, supports HSE’s
mission to ensure that risks to health and safety
from work activities are properly controlled. This
involves HSL in two main areas of activity:
operational support through incident
investigations and studies of workplace situations;
and longer-term work on analysis and resolution
of occupational health and safety problems.
In premises such as offices, shops, warehouses,
restaurants and hotels, health and safety
legislation is enforced by inspectors appointed
by local authorities, working under guidance
from the HSE. Some other official bodies
work under agency agreement with the HSE.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of health and safety
legislation in Northern Ireland are broadly
160
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
similar to those for Great Britain and are
enforced by the Health and Safety Executive
for Northern Ireland (HSENI) and the district
councils, with the latter having an
enforcement role similar to that of local
authorities in Great Britain. The HSENI,
established in April 1999 and funded by the
Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Investment, took over the functions previously
discharged by the Health and Safety Agency,
the Employment Medical Advisory Service
and the Health and Safety Division of the then
Department of Economic Development.

The responsibility for delivering social care support to older people, people
with physical disabilities, learning disabilities or people with mental health
problems, and children in need of care falls to local authorities and voluntary
organisations, who work within a policy framework set out by central
government.
Provisions in the Care Standards Act 2000 aim to improve standards in care
services, set new checks on private healthcare and reform regulation of early
years childcare and education. The Children (Leaving Care) Bill currently
before Parliament is intended to improve the prospects of young people living
in, and leaving, local authority care. Additional measures contained in the
Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 and the Child Support, Pensions and
Social Security Bill are meant to promote incentives to work, reduce poverty
and welfare dependency, and strengthen community and family life.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help older people,
people with disabilities, children and young
people, those with mental health problems or
learning disabilities, their families and carers.
Major services include residential and day
care, and domiciliary services—provided for
people needing support to live in their own
homes. In certain circumstances direct cash
payments may be made to enable individuals
to secure for themselves the relevant services
which they have been assessed as needing.
Services are administered by local authorities,
but central government is responsible for
establishing national policies, issuing guidance
and overseeing standards.
Much of the care given to older people and
disabled people comes from families and self-
help groups. One in eight adults gives
informal care and one in six homes has a carer.
Many of these carers are elderly themselves.
There are around 6 million informal carers in
the UK, about 58 per cent of whom are
women. The Carers and Disabled Children
Act 2000 ensures for the first time that
support is directed at carers themselves,
bringing their needs in line with those of the
person they are looking after.
Caring for Vulnerable People
The Care Standards Act 2000 aims to raise the
standards in care services, monitor private
162
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
healthcare provision and reform the regulation
of care for young people.
The Care Standards Act will:
• set up a National Care Standards
Commission—an independent, non-
departmental public body to regulate
private hospitals and clinics, children’s
homes and care homes for older people and
disabled people. It will regulate other care
services for the first time, including care to
people at home and fostering agencies. It
will also have powers to close down services
if they are not up to standard;
• set up a General Social Care Council
(GSCC) to raise professional and training
standards for the social care workforce of
1 million, 80 per cent of whom hold no
relevant qualifications and only 40,000
are professional social workers. The
GSCC will take over from the Central
Council for Education and Training in
Social Work (CCETSW) the statutory
duty to regulate training for professional
social work and offer an increased level of
protection to users of social care services;
• reform the regulation system for
childminders and day care services and
transfer the responsibility to a new Early
Years Directorate within the Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED—see
p. 128); and
• establish a new list of people judged
unsuitable to work with vulnerable adults
in the care sector. It will work in the same
way as the existing Protection of Children
list, and will be a means of ensuring that
people who have abused or mistreated
vulnerable adults in their care do not find
their way back into such positions again.
Older People
Older people represent the fastest growing
section of the community. The proportion of
the population in the United Kingdom aged
75 and over rose from 4 per cent in 1961 to
7 per cent in 1999. However, the number of
older people in the population is expected to
grow less quickly in the next decade than it
has in the previous one.
Services for older people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services, as well
as direct payments, day centres, lunch clubs
and recreational facilities. Adaptations to the
home can overcome a person’s difficulties in
moving about, and a range of equipment is
available for people with poor hearing or
eyesight or people with physical disabilities.
Alarm systems help older people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas
‘good neighbour’ and visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Older people who live in
residential care homes or nursing homes are
subject to means-test charging. Local
authorities contribute to care costs for those
who cannot pay the full charge.
The most marked trend in residential care
provision over recent years has been the
continuing increase in the number of places
provided in the private and voluntary sectors
and the corresponding fall in the number
provided in local authorities’ own homes (see
chart on p. 164).
As part of their responsibility for social
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for older people (‘sheltered
accommodation’); some of these developments
have resident wardens. Housing associations and
private builders also build such accommodation.
Many local authorities provide free or subsidised
travel for older people within their areas.
A Royal Commission on the funding of
long-term care for older people in the UK was
set up in 1997. The Commission’s report—
JVith Respect to Old Age: Long-term Care—
Rights and Responsibilities—was published in
March 1999 and made two main
recommendations:
• personal care, which includes nursing
care and some social care tasks such as
help with bathing, should be funded by
general taxation, subject to an assessment
of need; and
• a National Care Commission should be
established to take a strategic overview of
long-term care and represent the

interests of older people. (The Scottish
Executive has indicated that it intends to
put legislation through the Scottish
Parliament to set up a similar
Commission for Scotland.)
The Government’s response to the Royal
Commission on Long-term Care was set out
in the NHS Plan in July 2000 (see p. 184).
This announced a package of proposals
designed to make the funding of long-term
care clearer and fairer, together with wide-
ranging improvements to health and social
care services for all older people. Changes (to
be implemented as soon as parliamentary
approval allows) include making NHS nursing
care free in all settings and disregarding the
value of a person’s home from the means test
for the first three months after admission to a
care home. A National Care Standards
Commission has been established through the
Care Standards Act 2000, which will take up
many of the roles proposed by the Royal
Commission.
Long-term Care Charter
The Government published its long-term
care charter—Better Care, Higher Standards
—in December 1999. The charter sets out
the values on which people can expect their
local housing, health or social services to be
based (such as treating users and carers with
courtesy, honesty and respecting their
dignity) and requires local authorities and
health services to agree and make public-
local standards in the following six key areas:
• helping users and carers to find out
about services;
• understanding and responding to the
needs of users and carers;
• finding a suitable place to live;
• helping people to stay independent;
• getting the right health care; and
• helping carers to care.

12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
The NHS Plan announced the piloting of
Care Direct as a new, single point of access to
information about social care, health and
housing services, and social security benefits.
In addition to the £150 million invested for
intermediate care and related services in 2000,
the NHS Plan announced major new
investment, rising to around £900 million
annually by 2004.
Disabled People
Over the past ten years there has been increasing
emphasis on rehabilitation and the provision of
day, domiciliary and respite support services to
enable disabled people to live independently in
the community wherever possible.
Local authority social services departments
help with social rehabilitation and adjustment
to disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and
publicise services. About 413,000 people with
physical disabilities or frailty in England
receive community-based services. These may
include advice on personal and social
problems arising from disability, as well as on
occupational, educational, social and
recreational facilities, either at day centres or
elsewhere. Other services provided may
include adaptations to homes (such as ramps
for wheelchairs, stairlifts and ground-floor
toilets), the delivery of cooked meals, support
with personal care at home and direct
Disability Rights Commission
A Disability Rights Commission (DRC)
was established in April 2000. Its main
aims are to:
• work towards the elimination of
discrimination against disabled people;
• promote equal opportunities for
disabled people;
• encourage good practice; and
• advise the Government on the operation
of the Disability Discrimination Act
1995 and the Disability Rights
Commission Act 1999.
The Equality Commission (see p. 19) has a
similar role in Northern Ireland.
payments with which disabled people can
purchase support to meet their assessed need.
Local authorities and voluntary organisations
may provide severely disabled people with
residential accommodation or temporary
facilities to allow their carers relief from their
duties. Special housing may be available for
those able to look after themselves. Some
authorities provide free or subsidised travel
for disabled people on public transport, and
they are encouraged to provide special means
of access to public buildings.
In 1997 responsibility for disability issues
was transferred from the Department of Social
Security to the Department for Education and
Employment as a signal that disabled people’s
willingness and ability to take advantage of
education, training and employment
opportunities was valued by society. The New
Deal for Disabled People, part of the
Government’s Welfare-to-Work programme
(see p. 151), aims to help disabled people find
and keep work.
People with Learning Disabilities
The Government encourages the development
of local services for people with learning
disabilities and their families through co¬
operation between health authorities, local
authorities, education and training services,
voluntary and other organisations.
Local authority social services departments
are the leading statutory agencies for planning
and arranging such services. They provide or
arrange short-term care, support for families in
their own homes, residential accommodation
and support for various types of activity outside
the home. People with learning disabilities may
also be able to receive direct payments. The
main aims are to ensure that, as far as possible,
people with learning disabilities can lead full
lives in their communities. People with learning-
disabilities form the largest group for local
authority-funded day centre places and the
second largest group in residential care. A new
national learning disability strategy, designed to
eliminate inconsistencies in service delivery, is
due to be published by the end of 2000.
The National Health Service (NHS)
provides specialist services when the ordinary
primary care services cannot meet healthcare
165
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
needs. Residential care is provided for those
with severe or profound disabilities whose
needs can effectively be met only by the NHS.
In May 2000, the Scottish Executive
published The Same As You?, its review of
services for people with a learning disability.
By focusing on inclusion, it aims to improve
the lives of people with learning disabilities
and their families.
People with a Mental Health Problem
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental health problems should have
access to all the services they need as locally as
possible. A cornerstone of community care
policy for people with mental health problems
is the Care Programme Approach. Under this,
each patient should receive an assessment and
a care plan, have a key worker appointed to
keep in touch with him or her, and be given
regular reviews. The Care Programme
Approach is subject to audit, enabling health
authorities (health boards in Scotland) to
identify any problems with the quality of its
implementation. The separate Welsh Mental
Health Strategy employs many of the same
broad principles in delivering services in
Wales. In Scotland, each health board works
with its local authority care partners, users of
mental health services and their carers to
develop joint strategies to provide local and
comprehensive mental health services.
While the total number of places for people
with mental health problems in the large
hospitals has continued to fall, the provision of
alternative places has increased in smaller
NHS hospitals, local authority
accommodation and private and voluntary
sector homes. At 31 March 1999 there were
29,000 registered beds in private nursing
homes (including mental nursing homes) and
private hospitals and clinics in England
intended for people with mental health
problems and 38,000 places in residential care
homes. In 1998-99 the average daily number
of available NHS hospital beds for people with
mental health problems in England was 36,000
with a further 1,400 residential beds.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing care for mentally ill
people in the community include direct
payments, day centres, social centres and
residential care. Social workers help patients
and their families with problems caused by
mental illness. In some cases they can apply
for a mentally disordered person to be
compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital. Special bodies provide important
safeguards for patients to ensure that the law
is used appropriately.
Supervision registers for discharged
patients most at risk are maintained by the
providers of services for mentally ill people
and allow hospital staff to keep track of them.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with those suffering from mental
illness (such as MIND, SANE and the Scottish
Association for Mental Health), or learning
disabilities (such as MENCAP or its Scottish
equivalent ENABLE), and they play an
important role in providing services for these
groups of people. Central Government provides
funding to many similar voluntary bodies.
Help to Families
Local authorities must safeguard the welfare
of any child in need, and promote the
upbringing of such children by their families,
by providing an appropriate range and level of
services for them. These services can include
advice, guidance, counselling, help in the
home, or family centres, and can be provided
for the family of the child in need or any
member of the family, if this will safeguard
the child’s welfare. Local authorities can
provide these services directly or arrange for
them through, for example, a voluntary
organisation. They are also required to
publicise the help available to families in need.
Many local authorities or specialist voluntary
organisations run refuges for women, often
with young children, whose home conditions
have become intolerable, because of, for
example, domestic violence. The refuges
provide short-term accommodation and
support while attempts are made to relieve the
women’s problems.
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities are provided for young
children by childminders, voluntary agencies,
166
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
private nurseries and local authorities. In 1999
in England and Wales, there were 351,000
childminder places for children under eight;
258,000 day nursery places; 119,000 after
school clubs; and 373,000 playgroup places.
In allocating places, where local authorities
have their own provision, priority is given to
children with special social, learning or health
needs. From September 2001 the newly formed
Early Years Directorate of OFSTED will take
over responsibility from local authorities for the
regulation of day care providers for children
aged under eight.
Child Protection
Child protection is the joint concern of a
number of different agencies and professions.
Area child protection committees determine
how the different agencies should co-operate
to help protect children from abuse and
neglect in their area.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children who have no parent
or guardian, who have been abandoned, or
whose parents are unable to provide for them.
In England and W ales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if he
or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed to
moral danger, beyond the control of parents, or
not attending school. The court can commit
children to the care of a local authority under a
care order. Certain pre-conditions have to be
satisfied to justify an order. These are that the
children are suffering or are likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of reasonable
parental care or because they are beyond
parental control. However, an order is made
only if the court is also satisfied that this will
positively contribute to the children’s well¬
being and be in their best interests. In court
proceedings children are entitled to separate
legal representation. All courts have to treat
the welfare of children as the paramount
consideration when reaching any decision
about their upbringing. There is a general
principle that, wherever possible, children
should remain at home with their families.
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a Children’s Hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker, but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements
are reviewed at least once a year until ended
by a Children’s Hearing.
The Government has set up the Quality
Protects programme in England to improve
the management and delivery of children’s
social services; it is a key part of the
Government’s wider strategy for tackling
social exclusion. Starting in 2000, a special
grant of £375 million over three years will
support this strategy, subject to the
preparation and achievement of satisfactory
action plans by each local authority. In Wales
the National Assembly’s Children First
programme has similar objectives.
Fostering and Children’s Homes
Local authorities have a duty to ensure that the
welfare of children being looked after away
from home is properly safeguarded as regards
their health, education, contact with their
families and way of life. When appropriate,
children in care are placed with foster parents,
who receive payments to cover the child’s
living costs. Alternatively, the child may be
placed in residential care. Children’s homes
may be provided by local authorities, voluntary
organisations or private companies or
individuals. Voluntary children’s homes, which
are registered by the Department of Health, are
inspected by the Social Services Inspectorate,
while local authorities’ social services
departments inspect the children’s homes
which they are responsible for registering.
Under the Care Standards Act (see
pp. 162-3), all children’s homes will be
required to register with the National Care
Standards Commission. The Commission will
also take on the role of inspecting all children’s
homes, including small private children’s
homes accommodating three or fewer
167
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
children, which are not currently subject to
any inspection process.
Local authorities are as far as possible
expected to work in partnership with the
parents of children who are in their care.
They are required to produce a plan for the
future of each child in their care and to
prepare a child for leaving that care. Local
authorities are also expected to have a
complaints procedure for considering
representations about children’s services. The
Children Act 1989 requires the involvement
of an independent person at each stage of
consideration of a representation or
complaint.
The number of children looked after by local
authorities in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland increased from 55,000 in 1994 to 59,000
in 1998. The number of children placed in
foster homes increased by around 12 per cent
over the same period and the number placed in
children’s homes declined by 17 per cent.
Scotland has a different definition of children in
care which means data are not comparable with
the rest of the United Kingdom. At 31 March
1999, 31,900 children in England and Wales
were on child protection registers.
Young People Leaving Local
Authority Care
Improving the life chances of young people
living in and leaving local authority care is the
principal aim of the Children (Leaving Care)
Bill which was introduced into the House of
Lords in November 1999. The basis of the Bill
is to impose new and stronger duties upon
local authorities to support care leavers until
they are at least 21.
Subject to parliamentary approval, the Bill
would:
• impose a new duty on local authorities to
assess and meet the needs of eligible
young people aged 16 and 17, both those
whom they continue to look after and
those who have left care;
• require local authorities to keep in touch
with young people formerly in their care
until they are 21, or 24 if they are still
receiving local authority help with higher
education or training;
• oblige local authorities to provide all
eligible young people with an adviser
offering them support and guidance for
their future and working with them on an
action plan to help them live
independently;
• specify that the local authority which last
looked after a young person would
continue to have responsibility regardless
of where that individual moved in the
country; and
• simplify the financial regime so that young
people were better informed in how to use
the social security benefits system and
claim what they were entitled to.
Adoption
Local authority social services departments are
required by law to provide an adoption
service, either directly or by arrangement with
approved voluntary adoption societies.
Adoption is one way children in care are able
to leave—around a third of all children
adopted are looked after by a local authority
prior to their adoption. In 1999, 3,000
children were placed for adoption in England
and Wales. Under adoption law it is illegal to
receive an unrelated child for adoption
through an unapproved third party. The
Registrars-General of England and Wales, and
of Scotland keep confidential registers of
adopted children.
Adopted people may be given details of
their original birth record on reaching the age
of 18 (or 16 if adopted in Scotland), and
counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth parents
to be given a safe and confidential way of
making contact if that is the wish of both
parties. A person’s details are entered only if
they wish to be contacted. In Scotland a
similar service is provided through BirthLink.

people and children accounted for nearly
three-quarters of this (see pie chart above).
Social Security
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need. It provides income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement.

Social security is the largest single area of
government spending. In each year from
1994-95 to 1999-2000 spending on social
security benefits in Great Britain represented
about 30 per cent of total government
expenditure. At 1999-2000 prices, spending
grew from ^98.1 billion to £99.3 billion over
this five-year period, representing a growth
rate of about 0.25 per cent a year on average.
MODERNISING THE SYSTEM
Welfare Reform
The Government’s central aim for welfare
reform is to promote an ethic of work and
savings. After wide consultation in 1998, the
Welfare Reform and Pensions Act received
Royal Assent in November 1999.
The main measures in the Act are:
• the introduction of new stakeholder
pension schemes (see below);
• pension sharing for divorced couples;
• revisions to benefits for widows and
widowers;
• a single gateway to the benefit system for
those of working age (the ONE service—
see p. 152); and
• a new benefits structure for people with
disabilities or long-term illness.
Through the Act’s provisions, the
Government aims to support and strengthen
the framework for occupational pensions. The
new stakeholder pensions—for those people
who do not have access to an employer’s
occupational pension scheme and for whom a
personal pension may not be suitable—will be
introduced in April 2001.
Stakeholder pensions, which will be
provided by private sector companies, must
satisfy a number of minimum government
standards to ensure that they offer value for
money and flexibility. These standards include:
• not charging more than 1 per cent a year
on the value of each member’s funds;
• enabling members to transfer into or out
of a stakeholder pension, or stopping
payment for a time, without facing any
charge;
169
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• accepting contributions of £20 or more,
though some may accept lower payments;
and
• being run in the interest of their
members by either trustees or scheme
managers.
Another long-term government objective is
to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to
build up an adequate pension to guarantee
security in retirement. The Government plans
to introduce a new State Second Pension to
replace SERFS (see p. 172) from 2002.
The statutory framework necessary to
establish State Second Pensions is contained
in the Child Support, Pensions and Social
Security Bill 1999 currently before
Parliament. For the first time, carers, others
with domestic responsibilities who were
unable to contribute to a second pension in
their own right, and people suffering a long¬
term illness or disability with broken work
records would benefit from additional pension
provision. The Government expects that
about 11 million people nationwide will be
better off when they retire as a result.
Other measures in the Bill would
strengthen arrangements for child
maintenance (see p. 176). These include:
• giving the Child Support Agency (CSA)
far-reaching powers to enforce
maintenance payments;
• introducing fines of up to £1,000 for
absent parents who deliberately try to
evade the CSA; and
• requiring absent parents to pay 15 per
cent of their wages for a single child,
rising to 20 per cent for two children and
25 per cent for three children or more.
Fighting Fraud
The Government recognises the difficulties of
measuring a covert activity such as fraud, but
around £2 billion is lost each year in Great
Britain through confirmed fraud and a further
£3 billion in cases where fraud has probably
taken place but no claimant has been proved
guilty.
To combat this, the Benefits Fraud
Inspectorate was set up in 1997 to examine
and report on standards of performance in the
administration of all social security benefits, in
particular anti-fraud work, within the
Department of Social Security’s agencies and
local authorities. It also carries out work for
the Social Security Agency in Northern
Ireland.
In January 2000 the Government
introduced a number of additional counter¬
fraud initiatives including:
• extending the payment of benefits
directly into bank accounts, cutting losses
from order book fraud which costs
around £200 million a year;
• strengthening checks on Income Support
claimants before money is paid out,
saving around £200 million a year;
• cross-checking Department of Social
Security (DSS) and local council records,
saving £20 million in bogus claims;
• a new scheme stopping benefit cheques
being mailed on to fraudsters using false
addresses; and
• faster data transfer between the Benefits
Agency and local councils.
ADMINISTRATION
In April 1999 the Contributions Agency
merged with the Inland Revenue (see p. 406)
to provide customers with a single point of
contact for tax and National Insurance (NI)
matters. Major changes in the way the work of
the DSS is managed and organised came into
effect in April 2000. The aim is to:
• improve the Department’s ability to
deliver the Government’s modernisation
agenda; and
• streamline internal services so that
resources are more clearly focused on
supporting the front-line delivery of
services to the public.
The main parts of the new organisation are:
• three Client Directorates, each
responsible for designing and developing
the full range of services to children,
people of working age and pensioners
respectively;
170
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
• a Corporate Services Directorate, in
charge of corporate strategy, finance,
planning, personnel and procurement
across the Department;
• a Communication Directorate, looking
after internal and external
communications;
• the Benefits Agency (BA), administering
and paying the majority of benefits;
• the Child Support Agency, assessing and
collecting maintenance payments for
children (see p. 176);
• the War Pensions Agency, delivering
welfare support to war disablement
pensioners and war widows;
• The Appeals Service (TAS), providing
an impartial re-examination of decisions
under appeal; and
• independent statutory bodies, carrying
out a range of functions on behalf of the
Department.
Advice about Benefits
The DSS produces a range of information
material in English and other languages as well
as in different formats (audio or videotapes,
braille and large print). There is also a website
providing general information on entitlement
and liability, while telephone helplines provide
information on a number of benefits.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as Retirement Pension, Incapacity
Benefit, contributory Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Maternity Allowance and Widow’s Benefit, is
dependent upon the payment of contributions.
The amount an employee can earn before
employer NI contributions are charged is
aligned with the personal allowance for
income tax (see p. 409). There are five classes
of contributions. The rates given below are
effective from April 2000 to April 2001:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees earning between
£61 and £15 z week earn a National
Insurance credit and do not pay
contributions. Contributions on earnings
at or above £16 a week in non-
contracted-out employment are at the
rate of 10 per cent up to the upper
earnings limit of £535 a week.
Employers’ contributions are at the rate
of 12.2 per cent and are charged on
everything earned at or above £84 per
week. There is no upper earnings limit
for employers’ contributions.
Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with fuel and/or
a car for private use. A Class 1A
contribution is payable on the cash
equivalent of the benefit provided.
Class 2—paid by self-emplpyed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£2 a week. The self-employed may claim
exemption from Class 2 contributions if
their net earnings are expected to be
below £3,825 for the 2000-01 tax year.
Self-employed people are not eligible for
unemployment and industrial injuries
benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Contributions are
at a flat rate of £6.55 a week.
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£4,385 a year), and up to a set upper
limit (£27,820 a year) in addition to their
Class 2 contribution. Class 4
contributions are payable at the rate of
7 per cent.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. Self-employed people over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.
BENEFITS
Social security benefits can be grouped into
three types:
• means-tested, available to people whose
income and savings are below certain
levels;
• contributory, paid to people who have
made the required contributions to the

National Insurance Fund,1 from which
benefits are paid; and
• benefits which are neither means-
tested nor contributory (mainly paid
to cover extra costs, for example of
disability, or paid universally, for
example Child Benefit).
General taxation provides over half the
income for the social security programme,
employers’ NI contributions around a quarter
and employees’ NI contributions about a fifth.
From April 2000, responsibility for deciding
appeals across the whole range of DSS
business has been taken on by a new executive
agency, The Appeals Service.
For most contributory benefits there are two
conditions. First, before benefit can be paid at
all, a certain number of contributions must
have been made. Second, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless contributions have been
made or credited to a specific level over a set
period. A reduced rate of benefit is payable
dependent on the level of contributions made

all NI contributions payable by employers, employees and
self-employed people are deposited, and from which

or credited. For example, a great many of those
receiving retirement pensions and widows’
benefits receive a percentage-based rate of
benefit. Benefits are increased annually in line
with percentage increases in retail prices. The
main benefits (payable weekly) are summarised
on pp. 172—80. Rates given are those effective
from April 2000 until April 2001.
Retirement
A state Retirement Pension is a taxable weekly
benefit payable, if the contribution conditions
have been met, to women from the age of 60 and
men from the age of 65. Legislation was
introduced in 1995 to equalise the state pension
age for men and women at 65. The change will
be phased in over ten years, starting from April
2010. Women born before 6 April 1950 will not
be affected; their pension age will remain at 60.
The new pension age of 65 will apply to women
born on or after 6 April 1955. Pension age for
women born between these dates will move up
gradually from 60 to 65.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £67.50 for a single
person and £107.90 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension (sometimes called ‘SERFS’—state
earnings-related pension). Pensioners may
have unlimited earnings without affecting
their pensions. Those who have put off their
retirement during the five years after state
pension age may earn extra pension.
A non-contributory retirement pension of
£40.40 a week is payable to people aged 80 or
over who have lived in Britain for at least ten
years since reaching the age of 60, and who
have not qualified for a contributory pension.
People whose pensions do not give them
enough to live on may be entitled to Income
Support (see p. 174).
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded for
people whose opportunities to work are
limited while they are looking after a child or a
sick or disabled person. Men and women may
receive the same basic pension, provided they
have paid full-rate NI contributions when
working. The earnings-related pension
scheme will eventually be calculated as 20 per
cent rather than 25 per cent of earnings, and is
being phased in over ten years starting in

1999. However, the pensions of people who
retired in the 20th century will be unaffected.
As part of its plan to improve the income of
women in retirement, from April 2000
provisions in the Welfare Reform and
Pensions Act 1999 have enabled the courts to
divide pension rights equally between
divorcing couples.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from the state earnings related pension scheme
(SERFS) and provide their own occupational
pension instead. Contracted-out salary-related
schemes must meet a statutory test of overall
quality and offer benefits that are broadly the
same as, or better than, SERFS. They receive
a flat-rate refund of National Insurance
contributions and an age-related top-up based
on a percentage of earnings between the lower
and upper earnings limit on which National
Insurance contributions are based.
Membership of an employer’s contracted-out
scheme is voluntary; the State remains
responsible for the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes currently
have over 10.3 million members accruing
pension rights. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
173
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
pensionable age, who are unable or do not
want to transfer their contracted-out salary-
related pension rights, are now offered some
protection against inflation. Most workers
leaving a scheme at least a year before its
pension age and with two years’ pensionable
service have the right to a fair transfer value.
The trustees or managers of pension schemes
have to provide full information about their
schemes. Occupational schemes must provide
equal treatment between male and female
members.
As an alternative to their employer’s
scheme or SERFS, people are entitled to
choose a personal pension available from a
bank, building society, insurance company or
other financial institution.
Employees can also contract out of SERFS
using a personal pension plan rather than an
occupational scheme. A personal pension used
this way is called an appropriate personal
pension and it also receives National
Insurance rebates which are age-related.
The Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints of maladministration against
occupational and personal pension schemes
and adjudicates on disputes of fact or law. A
pensions registry helps people trace lost
benefits.
Unemployment
Jobseeker’s Allowance
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is a benefit for
people needing financial support because of
unemployment. Claimants must be capable of,
and available for, work, and actively seeking it.
They must normally be aged at least 18 years
and under pension age. JSA can be either
contribution-based or income-based:
• Contribution-based JSA\ those who have
paid enough NI contributions are entitled
to a personal JSA for up to six months
(£52.20 a week for a person aged 25 or
over), regardless of any savings or
partner’s income.
• Income-based JSA\ those on a low income
are entitled to an income-based JSA,
payable for as long as the jobseeker
requires support and continues to satisfy
the qualifying conditions. The amount a
claimant receives comprises an age-
related personal allowance (£52.20 a
week for a person aged 25 or over),
allowances for dependent children and
premium payments for those with extra
expenses, for example, disabled children.
Benefit is paid at rates determined by
family circumstances on a basis similar to
Income Support (see below).
Back to Work Bonus
Recipients of JSA (see above) and people aged
under 60 who receive Income Support can
benefit from a Back to Work Bonus. This is
intended to increase incentives to take up or
keep part-time work, and encourage people to
move off benefit and into employment. Those
who have been unemployed for three months
or more and are working part-time may keep
the first £5 of their earnings (£10 for couples;
£15 for lone parents, disabled people and
some people in special occupations) in any
week in which they work while still receiving
benefit. An amount equal to half of any
earnings above that level counts towards the
build-up of a bonus amount. When the
unemployed person moves off JSA because of
an increase in earnings or hours of work, he or
she will be able to claim a tax-free lump sum
of up to £1,000. The part-time (up to 24
hours a week) earnings of a partner can also
contribute towards building up a Back to
Work Bonus, which can be paid if the couple
leave benefit as a result of an increase in the
partner’s earnings or hours of work.
Income Support
Income Support is payable to certain people
aged 16 or over who are not required to be
available for work, and whose income and
savings are below certain set levels. They
include lone parents, pensioners, carers and
long-term sick and disabled people. Income
Support is made up of: a personal allowance
based on age and on whether the claimant is
single, a lone parent or has a partner;
age-related allowances for dependent children
and additional sums known as premiums; and
174
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
housing costs. From this total amount other
income, including some other social security
benefits, is deducted.
Income Support is not payable if savings
exceed £8,000. Savings between £3,000 and
£8,000 will reduce the amount received. For
people living permanently in residential care
or a nursing home, the allowance is not
payable if savings exceed £16,000; and savings
between £10,000 and £16,000 will affect the
amount received.
Families
Most pregnant working women receive
Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working
for the same employer for 26 weeks and who
earns on average at least £67 a week. She will
receive 90 per cent of her average weekly
earnings for the first six weeks and a rate of
£60.20 a week for the remaining 12 weeks.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, or have recently changed jobs
or left their job, may qualify for a weekly
Maternity Allowance, which is payable for
up to 18 weeks and is based on average
earnings. If average weekly earnings are equal
to or more than the lower earnings limit, this
amounts to £60.20 a week. If average weekly
earnings are at least £30 a week but less than
the lower earnings limit, the sum paid is 90
per cent of average earnings. All pregnant
employees have the right to take 14 weeks’
maternity leave.
A Sure Start Maternity Grant of up to
£200 may be made if the mother or her
partner receive Income Support, income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Working
Families’ Tax Credit or Disabled Person’s
Tax Credit and have savings under £500
(£1,000 for people aged 60 and over). It is also
available if a baby is adopted.
The main social security benefit for
children is Child Benefit. This is a tax-free,
non-contributory payment of £15 a week for
the eldest qualifying child of a couple, and
£10 for each other child. Child Benefit is
payable for children up to the age of 16, and
for those up to 19 who continue in full-time
non-advanced education. It is generally not
payable to people whose entry into the UK is
subject to immigration control.
People claiming Child Benefit for an
orphaned child they have taken into their
family may be entitled to Guardian’s
Allowance. This is a tax-free non¬
contributory benefit of £9.85 a week for the
eldest child and £11.35 for each other child
who qualifies. In certain circumstances

Guardian’s Allowance can be paid even if one
parent is still alive.
Child Support Agency (CSA)
An estimated 1 million lone parents in the UK
bring up 1.7 million children in households
where no one is working. The CSA and its
counterpart in Northern Ireland are responsible
for assessing child maintenance and, where
requested by either parent, collecting and
enforcing child maintenance payments from,
and for tracing, absent parents.
If any person is living with and caring for a
child, and one, or both, of the child’s parents are
living elsewhere in the UK, he or she may apply
to have child support maintenance assessed and
collected by the CSA (or its Northern Ireland
counterpart). If that person or their present
partner claims Income Support or income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance, they may be
required to apply for child support maintenance
if asked to do so by the CSA (or its Northern
Ireland counterpart).
Assessments for child support maintenance
are made using a formula which takes into
account each parent’s income and makes
allowance for essential outgoings. (A system of
departures from the formula allows the amount
of maintenance payable to be varied in a small
number of cases.) A child maintenance bonus
worth up to /J ,000 may be payable to parents
living with and caring for a child who have been
in receipt of Income Support or income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance and in receipt of child
maintenance when they leave benefit for work.
Working Families ’ Tax Credit
Working Families’ Tax Credit (WFTC)
replaced Family Credit in October 1999. It is
an Inland Revenue administered tax credit
paid, since April 2000, through workers’ pay
packets. Families (couples or lone parents) are
eligible if they:
• have one or more children;
• work at least 16 hours a week;
• are resident and entitled to work in the
UK; and
• have savings of £8,000 or less.
There are four components to WFTC:
• basic credit—£ 53.15;
• credit for working over 30 hours per
week—£11.25;
• tax credit for each child
—£25.60 (aged up to 15 years)
—£26.35 (aged 16 to 18); and
• childcare tax credit—up to 70 per cent of
eligible costs up to a maximum of £100
for one child and £150 for two or more
children.
The WFTC award, which normally lasts
for 26 weeks, is calculated by adding the
credits together. If the family income (after tax
and national insurance contributions) is above
£91.45 per week, this is reduced by 55 pence
for each £1 above £91.45.
By introducing a higher income threshold
before the new WFTC is withdrawn and
withdrawing it at a rate of 55 per cent, WFTC
is designed to improve work incentives and to
encourage people to move into and remain in
employment. It is central to the Government’s
major programme of tax and benefit reform,
representing a step towards greater integration
of the tax and benefits systems.
Social Fund
Payments, in the form of loans or grants, may
be available to people on low incomes to help
with expenses which are difficult to pay for
out of regular income. There are two kinds.
Discretionary payments are:
• budgeting loans for important
intermittent expenses;
• community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, to ease exceptional pressure
on families, to set up home as part of a
planned resettlement programme and to
meet certain travel expenses; and
• crisis loans to help people in an emergency
or as a result of a disaster where there is
serious risk to health or safety. People do
not have to be receiving any form of
benefit to qualify for this loan.
176
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
The Social Fund also provides regulated
payments (payments that are not cash-limited)
to help people awarded certain income-related
benefits with the costs of maternity or
funerals, or with heating during very cold
weather and winter fuel payments.
Widows
Widow’s Payment. Widows under the age of
60—or those over 60 whose husbands were
not entitled to a state retirement pension when
they died—receive a tax-free single payment
of £1,000 following the death of their
husbands, provided that their husbands have
paid a minimum number of NI contributions.
Women whose husbands have died of an
industrial injury or prescribed disease may
also qualify, regardless of whether their
husbands have paid NI contributions.
Widowed Mother’s Allowance, a taxable
benefit of £67.50 a week, is payable to a
widowed mother with at least one child for
whom she is getting Child Benefit. Additional
tax-free amounts of £9.85 for a child for whom
the higher rate of Child Benefit is payable, and
£11.35 for each subsequent child, are available.
Widow’s Pension. A taxable, weekly benefit
of £67.50 is payable to a widow who is 55 years
or over when her husband dies or when her
entitlement to Widowed Mother’s Allowance
ends. A percentage of the full rate is payable to
widows who are aged between 45 and 54 when
their husbands die or when their entitlement to
Widowed Mother’s Allowance ends. Special
rules apply for widows whose husbands died
before 11 April 1988. Entitlement continues
until the widow remarries or begins drawing
retirement pension. Payment ends if she lives
with a man as his wife.
A man whose wife dies when both are over
pension age inherits his wife’s pension rights
just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Sickness and Disablement
A variety of benefits are available for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying Statutory Sick Pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. There is a single rate
of Statutory Sick Pay for all qualifying
employees provided their average gross weekly
earnings are at least £67.00 a week. The
weekly rate is £60.20.
Incapacity Benefit is also for people who
become incapable of work. Entitlement to
Incapacity Benefit begins when entitlement to
Statutory Sick Pay ends or, for those who do
not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, from the
fourth day of sickness. There are three types:
• short-term benefit for people under
pension age: a lower rate of £50.90 a
week for the first 28 weeks; and a higher
rate of £60.20 a week between the 29th
and 52nd week;
• short-term benefit for people over
pension age: lower rate of £64.75; higher
rate of £67.50; and
• long-term benefit rate of £67.50 a week
(after 52 weeks of incapacity).
Extra benefits may be paid for dependent
adults and children. Incapacity Benefit is
taxable from the 29th week of incapacity.
The medical test of incapacity for work
usually applies after 28 weeks’ sickness. It
assesses ability to perform a range of work-
related activities rather than the ability to
perform a specific job.
Severe Disablement Allowance is a tax-
free benefit for people who have not been able
to work for at least 28 weeks because of illness
or disability but who cannot get Incapacity
Benefit because they have not paid enough NI
contributions. The benefit is £40.80 a week,
plus additions of up to £14.20 depending on
the person’s age when they became incapable
of work. Additions for adult dependants and
for children may also be paid. Claims may be
made by people aged between 16 and 65. Once
a person has qualified for the allowance, there
is no upper age limit for receipt. New
claimants must satisfy the same incapacity test
as that used in Incapacity Benefit (see above).
People who become incapable of work after
their 20th birthday must also be medically
assessed as at least 80 per cent disabled for a
minimum of 28 weeks. People already in
receipt of certain benefits, such as the higher
rate of the Disability Living Allowance care
177
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
component (see below), will automatically be
accepted as 80 per cent disabled.
From April 2001, Severe Disablement
Allowance will be abolished for new claims.
People under 20, or 25 if they were in
education or training before reaching 20, may
be able to receive Incapacity Benefit without
having to satisfy the contributions conditions.
Other Benefits
Disability Living Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to help severely
disabled people aged under 65 with extra costs
incurred as a result of disability. Entitlement
is measured in terms of personal care and/or
mobility needs. There are two components: a
care component which has three weekly rates—
£53.55, £35.80 and £14.20; and a mobility
component which has two weekly rates—£37.40
and £14.20, payable from age five or older.
Attendance Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to provide
financial help to severely disabled people aged
65 or older with extra costs incurred as a result
of disability. It is measured in terms of
personal care needs by day and/or night. The
two rates are £53.55 and £35.80.
A non-contributory Invalid Care
Allowance of £40.40 weekly may be payable to
people between 16 and 65 who have given up
the opportunity of a full-time paid job because
they are providing regular and substantial care
of at least 35 hours a week, to a severely
disabled person in receipt of either Attendance
Allowance or the higher or middle care
component of Disability Living Allowance. An
additional carer’s premium may be paid if the
recipient is also receiving Income Support,
income-related Jobseeker’s Allowance, Housing
Benefit or Council Tax Benefit.
Disabled Person’s Tax Credit (DPTC)
replaced Disability Working Allowance in
October 1999. It is payable under the same
rules as those for the new Working Families’
Tax Credit (see p. 176).
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease caused by a particular type of
employment. The main benefit is the tax-free
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit:
up to £109.30 a week is usually paid after a
qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is at
least 14 per cent or more physically or
mentally disabled as a result of an industrial
accident or a prescribed disease.
Basic Disablement Benefit can be paid in
addition to other NI benefits, such as Incapacity
Benefit. It can be paid whether or not the
person returns to work and does not depend on
earnings. The degree of disablement is assessed
by an independent adjudicating medical
authority and the amount paid depends on the
extent of the disablement and on how long it is
expected to last. Except for certain progressive
respiratory diseases, disablement of less than 14
per cent does not attract Disablement Benefit.
In certain circumstances additional allowances
may be payable.
Housing and Council Tax Benefits
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-free
benefit which helps people on low incomes meet
the cost of rented accommodation. The amount
paid depends on personal circumstances,
income, savings, rent and other people sharing
the home. It also normally depends on the
general level of rents for properties with the
same number of rooms in the locality.
Most single people under 25 years old who
are not lone parents and who are renting
privately have their Housing Benefit limited to
the average cost of a single non-self-contained
room (that is, shared use of kitchen and toilet
facilities) in the locality.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to
meet their council tax payments (the tax set by
local councils to help pay for services—see
p. 412). The scheme offers help to those
claiming Income Support and income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance and others with low
incomes. It is subject to rules broadly similar
to those governing the provision of Housing
Benefit (see above). A person who is solely
liable for the council tax may also claim benefit
for a second adult who is not liable to pay the
council tax and who is living in the home on a
non-commercial basis. In Northern Ireland,
where council tax does not apply, people on low
178
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
incomes may get help to pay for their domestic
‘rates’ from a means-tested housing benefits
scheme. For owner occupiers, this can be
claimed from the Rates Collection Agency,
while those renting property can claim their
benefit from the Housing Executive.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement as a result
of service in the armed forces or for certain
injuries received in the merchant navy or civil
defence during wartime, or to civilians injured
by enemy action. The amount paid depends on
the degree of disablement: the pension for 100
per cent disablement for an officer is £6,053 a
year; for other ranks it is £116 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£7.75 and £23.90 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of
pension for a private soldier’s widow is £87.55
a week.) War Widow’s Pension is also payable
to a former war widow who has remarried and
then become widowed again, divorced or
legally separated.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service helps
and advises war pensioners, war widows and
other dependants. It works closely with ex-
Service organisations and other voluntary
bodies which give financial help and personal
support to those disabled or bereaved as a
result of war.
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service charges
(see p. 190), grants towards the cost of
spectacles (see p. 191), legal aid (see p. 232) and
free school meals for their children. People on
low incomes, as well as all pensioners, widows
and long-term sick people on Incapacity
Benefit, receive extra help to meet the cost of
VAT (value added tax) on their fuel bills.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners are
usually entitled to reduced transport fares.
From November 2000, pensioners aged 75 and
over will no longer be required to pay for their
television licence (see p. 268).

Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which replace
lost earnings are subject to tax, while those
intended to meet a specific need are not (see
Table 12.4). Various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or a
need to support dependants.
Benefit Controls on People from Abroad
Residence Test
All claimants must be habitually resident in
the Common Travel Area (that is, the UK, the
Irish Republic, the Channel Isles or the Isle of
Man) before a claim for Income Support,
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Housing
Benefit or Council Tax Benefit can be paid.
This is in line with most other European
countries, which also limit access to their
benefit systems to those who have lived in the
country for some time.
Asylum Seekers
Generally only people who claim refugee
status as soon as they arrive in the UK can
claim income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Income Support, Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit. Their eligibility to
receive this will stop if their asylum claim is
refused by the Home Office. The Immigration
and Asylum Act 1999 (see p. 107), among
other things, replaces cash benefits for asylum
seekers with a voucher system.
ARRANGEMENTS AND COMPARISONS
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The regulations
also cover retirement pensioners and other
beneficiaries who have been employed, or self-
employed, as well as dependants. Benefits
covered include Child Benefit and those for
sickness and maternity, unemployment,
retirement, invalidity, accidents at work and
occupational diseases.
The UK has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries
which also provide cover for some NI benefits
and family benefits.
A comparison of the expenditure on social
protection benefits per head for the 12 EU
countries for which data are available (Austria,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Irish
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and the UK) indicates that, in
general, spending is much higher in the more
northerly countries than in the south. Denmark
spent the most per head in 1996; at just under
3^5,000 this was three times the amount spent
by Portugal, the country which spent the least.
The UK spent around j£3,000 per head of
population, just below the average for the EU.

In July 2000 the Government issued a National Health Service Plan in England.
A new system of integrated care is envisaged, based on making all parts of the
health and social care system work better together, and improving both clinical
performance and health service productivity. In addition, plans are being
developed which aim to improve patient care, tackle inequalities in healthcare
provision, and tackle the causes of avoidable ill-health. Across the UK,
spending is planned to grow by an average of 6.1 per cent a year in real terms
over the four years from 1999-2000, reaching nearly £69 billion in 2003-04.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services, available to all
residents, regardless of their income. This
basic principle was endorsed by the NHS
Plan. Central government is directly
responsible for the NHS, which is
administered by health authorities and health
boards throughout the UK. The Department
of Health (DH) is responsible for national
strategic planning in England and, within that
department, the NHS Executive, with eight
regional offices, is responsible for developing
and implementing policies for the provision of
health services. The Scottish Executive
Health Department, the National Assembly
for Wales and the Department of Health,
Social Services and Public Safety in Northern
Ireland have similar responsibilities. Policies
and initiatives for health in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland are similar to those for
England, but may feature distinctive
approaches which reflect the health variations
in the different parts of the UK.
The National Assembly for Wales is
considering how best to take forward the
issues raised in the NHS Plan for England,
and will be publishing the NHS Wales
Strategy around the end of 2000 or the start of
2001. In Northern Ireland the Executive’s
Programme for Government, published in
October 2000, includes a section on working
for a healthier population.
Public Health
During the 20th century life expectancy at
birth in the UK increased substantially, from
45.0 years for males and 48.7 for females in
1901 to 74.9 and 79.8 years respectively in
1997 to 1999. Both life expectancy and healthy
life expectancy rose in Great Britain between
1981 and 1997, but healthy life expectancy did
181
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
not increase by as much as life expectancy.
Both males and females born in 1997 could
therefore expect to spend more years in poor
health or with a limiting long-standing illness
than those born in 1981. Life expectancy and
healthy life expectancy are higher for women
than for men, but women can also expect to
live a larger number and a greater proportion
of their remaining years in poor health or with
a limiting long-standing illness than men.
Mortality rates are lower in England than in
the rest of the UK. Within England mortality
rates are higher in northern regions than in the
south. Local authorities in the UK with the
highest levels of mortality tend to be located in
urban and industrial areas, particularly areas
classified as coalfields, manufacturing centres
or ports and industry, characterised by high
unemployment, a high proportion of terraced
housing and a high proportion of social
housing. Over the period 1991 to 1997, East
Dorset had the lowest mortality rate in the UK
and Glasgow the highest.
Over the 20th century there were
significant changes in the types of disease that
people suffered from. The incidence of
childhood diseases are now at their lowest ever
levels and some diseases have been virtually
eliminated through the use of vaccines. Other
widespread illnesses, such as cancer and heart
disease, have become more prominent.
Advances in surgical techniques and intensive
care have helped to reduce deaths arising from
accidents or premature birth. In 1999, 39 per
cent of deaths in England and Wales were
from circulatory disease such as heart attacks
and strokes, 24 per cent from cancer and 17
per cent from respiratory disease. Less than
1 per cent of deaths resulted from infectious
diseases.
Health Strategies
In July 1999 the Government published a
White Paper, Saving Lives: Our Healthier
Nation (OHN), setting out its health strategy
for England. Similar strategies have been
published for Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. The two main aims are to improve the
health of the population as a whole and to
reduce inequalities, particularly by improving
the health of the least well off.
The White Paper set out action to combat
the four major causes of premature death and
avoidable ill-health: cancer, coronary heart
disease and stroke, accidental injury and
mental illness. Targets have been set for 2010
in each priority area, compared with figures
for the three years 1995 to 1997:
• cancer—to reduce the death rate in
people under 75 by at least a fifth;
• coronary heart disease and stroke—to
reduce the death rate in people under 75
by at least two-fifths;
• accidents—to reduce the death rate by at
least a fifth and the serious injury rate by
one-tenth; and
• mental health—to reduce the death rate
from suicide and undetermined injury by
at least one-fifth.
Towards a Healthier Scotland was published in
February 1999 and subsequently endorsed by
the Scottish Parliament.
The Government has a range of policies
across departments which aim to tackle the
underlying causes of ill-health and health
inequality, such as poverty, unemployment,
poor housing and pollution. Policies like Sure
Start (see p. 121), Welfare-to-Work (see
p. 151) and the New Deal for Communities
(see p. 352) all aim to improve health. There
are also strategies for other important public
health issues, such as HIV/AIDS and sexual
health (including teenage conceptions), drugs,
alcohol, food safety, water fluoridation and
communicable diseases.
Cancer Care
Cancer is one of the main OHN target areas. It
causes 156,000 deaths a year in the UK.
Cancer services are organised at three levels:
• primary care for initial care;
• cancer units in many local hospitals of
sufficient size to support a
multidisciplinary team with the expertise
and facilities to treat more common
cancers; and
• cancer centres situated in larger hospitals
to treat less common cancers and to
support smaller cancer units by
182
13: HEALTH SERVICES
providing services not available in all
local hospitals.
Cancer networks are being developed as a key
element in the structure for cancer treatment.
These bring together NHS providers (cancer
units and centres), health authorities, Primary
Care Groups and the voluntary sector.
The NHS Cancer Plan, published in
September 2000, includes a new target to
reduce the smoking rate among manual groups
from 32 per cent in 1994 to 26 per cent by
2010, extra funding, a new standard for
waiting times, and expansion of ‘on-the-spot’
booking systems by 2002 (see box). Also
announced in the Cancer Plan were an
increase in the number of cancer specialists,
additional resources for hospices and specialist
palliative care, and an increase in government
funding for cancer research.
Nine cancer networks across England have
introduced ‘on-the-spot’ booking systems,
which are intended to improve patient care
by:
• providing rapid urgent appointments
with specialists;
• introducing ‘one-stop clinics’ where
all diagnostic tests can be carried out
in one visit, with results available that
day;
• enabling patients to pre-book
appointments; and
• co-ordinating surgery with follow-up
therapy.
Additional resources for cancer services are
being provided, including:
• extra investment in breast, colorectal,
lung and outpatient cancer services with
the aim of improving the speed of access
and quality of care;
• 3^80 million from the Modernisation
Fund over two years from 2000 to cut
waiting times, support improvements to
gynaecological cancer services and
modernise cancer services;
• funding from the New Opportunities
Fund of £93 million to purchase over 300
items of equipment for the NHS Breast
Screening Programme and £23 million
for a palliative care and information
initiative, concentrating on projects
targeted at ethnic minorities and socially
disadvantaged groups; and
• investment in cancer equipment,
including 200 CT scanners, 50 magnetic
resonance imaging scanners, and 80 liquid
cytology units to improve cervical cancer
screening, if pilot studies are successful.
Cancer Screening
Cancer screening programmes are in operation
for breast cancer and cervical cancer. About
one in ten women in the UK develop breast
cancer, which results in some 14,000 deaths
each year. The UK was the first country in the
European Union (EU) to introduce a
nationwide breast screening programme,
under which women aged between 50 and 64
are invited for mammography (breast X-ray)
every three years by computerised call and
recall systems. Women aged 65 and over are
entitled to request screening. Under the NHS
Plan, the screening programme will be
extended to women aged 65 to 70 by 2004. In
1998-99 in England:
• 76 per cent of women aged 50 to 64
invited for screening were screened;
• 1.2 million women of all ages were
screened within the programme; and
• 7,561 cases of cancer were diagnosed
among women screened.
The nationwide cervical screening
programme aims to reduce death from cancer
of the cervix by inviting women aged between
20 and 64 (20 and 60 in Scotland) to take a
smear test at least once every five years.
Cervical screening is not a test for cancer but
for abnormalities which if left untreated may
develop into cancer. As at March 1999, in
England 84 per cent of women invited to
attend had been screened over the previous
five years and in Wales 82 per cent. In
1998-99 in Scotland 87 per cent of women
invited to attend had been screened over the
last S'/z years. Deaths from cervical cancer in
England and Wales have fallen since the
183
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
programme began, from 1,942 in 1988 to
1,106 in 1999, and in Scotland from 191 in
1988 to 122 in 1999.
Other screening programmes will be
introduced if and when they are proved to be
effective. Pilot studies are under way for
colorectal screening. Other possibilities for
future screening programmes are prostate,
lung and ovarian cancers.
Coronary Heart Disease
The UK has one of the highest premature
death rates from circulatory disease (including
heart disease and stroke) in Europe. Coronary
heart disease kills more than 110,000 people a
year in England and Wales. In Scotland about
13,000 people died from the disease in 1998.
Although this was some 6,000 fewer than in
1975, coronary heart disease rates in Scotland
are 15 per cent above the UK average. UK
death rates from coronary heart disease for
both males and females under 65 have fallen
steadily for the last 20 years, from 151 to 59
per 100,000 males and from 39 to 16 per
100,000 females between 1979 and 1999.
The Coronary Heart Disease National
Service Framework (NSF), published in 2000,
set out a ten-year programme to improve
prevention and treatment in England. An extra
£230 million a year is planned to be invested in
heart disease services by 2003-04. By April
2001 the first 139 rapid access chest pain
clinics, designed to assess within two weeks all
patients with new onset of chest pain that could
be due to angina, are expected to be in place.
By 2003 the national network is expected to be
completed, enabling 200,000 patients a year to
be diagnosed early.
In Scotland a Coronary Heart Disease Task
Force was established in 1998. Recognising
that many cases are preventable, the Task
Force is considering a needs assessment of
interventions needed for treatment, how to
prioritise those waiting for cardiac surgery,
and improving access to cardiac services.
Mental Health
Mental health problems are a major cause of
ill-health, disability and mortality. In
1999-2000 there were nearly 2.1 million
attendances at NHS facilities for psychiatric
specialities in England, of which 282,000 were
new attendances.
The Mental Health Services NSF sets out a
ten-year programme designed to raise
standards of mental health care. The NHS Plan
involves extra annual investment, of over £300
million by 2003-04, including the provision of:
• 1,000 new mental health care workers
helping GPs, and 500 additional
community mental health staff;
• 50 teams to be established over the next
three years to help reduce the period of
untreated psychosis in young people;
• over 300 ‘crisis resolution’ teams to help
deal quickly with people with acute mental
illness experiencing a crisis and who would
otherwise need to be admitted to hospital;
• 230 teams to deal with the small number of
high users of services, many of whom also
have a problem with substance misuse;
• women-only day centres in every health
authority by 2004; and
• more staff to increase respite care.
In Scotland, mental health continues as a
priority with forward planning and responsive
services based on the 1997 Framework for
Mental Health Services in Scotland.
The National Health Service
The NHS is based on the principle that there
should be a full range of publicly funded
services designed to help the individual stay
healthy. The services are intended to provide
effective and appropriate treatment and care
where necessary w hile making the best use of
available resources. All taxpayers, employers
and employees contribute to the cost so that
those members of the community who do not
require healthcare help to pay for those who
do. Most forms of treatment, such as hospital
care, are generally provided free, although
some may incur a charge.
NHS PLAN
The Government published The NHS Plan
for England in July 2000. This followed earlier
184
13: HEALTH SERVICES
changes to the NHS announced in the 1997
White Paper The new NHS: modern,
dependable and implemented under the Health
Act 1999 (see p. 187). These changes have
removed the internal market, with the
intention of improving access to, and services
provided by, the health services. Similar plans
are to be published for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, which will differ in some
details from those in England but will be
designed to achieve similar aims. The National
Assembly for Wales shares many of the
priorities and objectives in the NHS Plan. In
conjunction with the NHS, the National
Assembly is developing a strategy for health
services in Wales, setting out longer-term
developments to meet local circumstances.
The NHS Plan sets out how the NHS will
be modernised to meet the changing needs of
the people in the 21st century. Its aims are for:
• people to be more involved in managing
their own care, through NHS Direct (see
p. 189) and other new services;
• more emphasis on screening and
occupational health to prevent ill-health;
• more GPs to book hospital appointments
by e-mail and call up computerised
medical records;
• hospital appointments to be on time;
• reduced delays with special one-stop test
and treatment centres developed to speed
up surgery for common complaints;
• the provision of new modern hospitals
with smaller and more intimate wards; and
• the development of intermediate care to
prevent people having to be admitted to
hospital in the first place and to allow
them to recuperate at home.
A Modernisation Board is to be set up to
advise the Secretary of State for Health on,
and help oversee implementation of, the NHS
Plan. Membership will include health
professionals, patient representatives and
NHS managers.
Standards
The Department of Health will set national
standards for England, in three forms:
• National Service Frameworks (NSFs) for
key conditions and diseases (see p. 188);
© guidance on treatments and interventions
from the National Institute for Clinical
Excellence (see p. 189); and
• a limited number of national targets,
including shorter waiting times, and
quality of care and facilities for people in
hospital.
Performance Assessment Frameworks,
currently covering a variety of matters in
England, including health improvement,
access to services, and delivery of healthcare,
apply to health authorities. From April 2001 a
new version will apply to NHS Trusts and
Primary Care Trusts providing community
services. Results will be published by the
independent Commission for Health
Improvement (CHI). In Wales, a new
Performance Management Framework for the
NHS was launched in April 2000.
The CHI will inspect all local health bodies,
including NHS hospital care and community
and primary care services. With the support of
the Audit Commission, it will inspect every
NHS organisation every four years, or every
two years for organisations that fail to meet a
number of the main targets. It expects to
complete 25 inspections during 2000 and 100 a
year thereafter. It will be asked to look into any
Trusts where there are serious concerns about
clinical practice or safety.
Local NHS organisations that perform well
will be given more freedom to run their own
affairs. They will also have automatic access to a
new National Health Performance Fund, to be
established in April 2001, which will be able to
distribute £500 million a year by 2003-04.
However, organisations that fail to perform well
will be required to produce a detailed recovery
plan, and will receive intensive support from the
Modernisation Agency and NHS regional
offices. Persistent failure by a Primary Care
Group or Trust could result in the transfer of
responsibility to a neighbouring Group or Trust.
Investment and Planned Service
Improvements
Some £7 billion of new capital investment is
planned in the NHS in the period to 2010
185
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
through an expanded role for the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI). Major investment
will include over 100 new hospital schemes
between 2000 and 2010; the modernisation or
substantial refurbishment of up to 3,000 GP
premises by 2004; new equipment,
particularly for cancer, renal and heart disease
services (see p. 182); and new information
technology (IT) systems in hospitals and
surgeries. The NHS Plan indicates an increase
in the number of NHS hospital beds (see
p. 196), from the 1999-2000 level of an
average 186,000 overnight beds available in
England. A further 7,000 NHS beds are
expected to be available by 2004, of which
some 2,100 will be in general and acute wards
and the rest in intermediate care. In
partnership with the private sector, 20 new
diagnostic and treatment centres are planned
by 2004 to increase the number of operations
that can be treated in a single day or with a
short stay.
A new Modernisation Agency will be set up
to help local clinicians and managers redesign
services around the needs of patients, spreading
best practice and stimulating change.
Improvements are planned in the treatment
of cancer, heart disease and mental health
services (see pp. 183-4). This includes
expanding cancer screening, providing rapid
access chest pain clinics across England by
2003, shorter waiting times for heart
operations, and increasing the number of
immediate response mental health teams.
For older people, nursing care in nursing
homes will be free. New intermediate care
services will be introduced with the aim of
helping people to recover and resume
independent living more quickly, so speeding
up discharge from hospital when patients are
ready to leave. Elderly people and their carers
will have personal care plans.
To try to reduce inequalities, primary care
in deprived areas will be improved, more help
will be available for people to give up smoking
and, to improve the diet of young children,
fruit will be made freely available in schools
for 4 to 6 year olds.
Additional resources are planned to
increase the number of NHS staff from the
current level (see Table 13.1, p. 192), with the
recruitment of 7,500 more consultants, 2,000
more GPs, 20,000 extra nurses and 6,500 more
therapists, and the provision of 1,000 more
medical school places.
Targets
The NHS Plan includes a number of targets
set by the Government for the NHS. Among
the targets which the NHS is expected to meet
by 2004 are that:
• patients will be able to see a GP within 48
hours;
• hospital consultants, currently working
only in hospitals, will deliver
approximately 4 million outpatient
consultations a year in primary care and
community settings;
• GPs will be able to refer patients to up to
1,000 specialist GPs, for example in
ophthalmology, orthopaedics,
dermatology and ear, nose and throat
surgery, instead of referring them to
hospital; and
• average waiting time in accident and
emergency departments in hospitals will
fall to 1 hour 15 minutes, with a
maximum waiting time of 4 hours.
Targets to be met by the NHS by the end
of 2005 include:
• the replacement of waiting lists for
appointments and admission by booking
systems (see p. 197);
• a reduction in the maximum waiting time
for a routine outpatient appointment
from six to three months; and
• a reduction in the maximum waiting time
for inpatient treatment from 18 to six
months.
Patient Involvement
The Plan is designed to increase patients’
involvement in how the NHS works. Letters
about patients will be copied to them, and
‘smart’ cards will be introduced allowing
patients easier access to health records. If an
operation is cancelled, the patient may choose
a new date within 28 days of the original date
186
13: HEALTH SERVICES
or the hospital will pay for it to be carried out
at another hospital of the patient’s choice.
Relations with the Private Sector
The Government has announced its intention
to negotiate an agreement with private
healthcare providers (see p. 198) to enable the
NHS to make better use of facilities in private
hospitals, although NHS care will remain free
at the point of delivery. Among the areas
envisaged for co-operative working are:
• NHS doctors and nurses using operating
theatres and facilities in private hospitals
or the purchase of services by the NHS;
• the transfer of patients between the NHS
and the private sector when appropriate
for clinical reasons; and
• the development and provision by the
private and voluntary sectors of
intermediate care facilities to support the
Government’s strategy for improving
preventive and rehabilitation services.
ADMINISTRATION
7he Health and Personal Social Services
Programmes consist of:
• NHS Hospital and Community Health
Services (HCHS), providing ail hospital
care and a range of community services;
• NHS Family Health Services (FHS),
providing general medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and some ophthalmic
services, and covering the cost of
medicines prescribed by GPs;
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS) —in Scotland, Other
Health Services (OHS);
• provision of social care by local
authorities, supported by the DH and the
Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions’ programmes
in England, and the Scottish Executive in
Scotland; and
• the administration of the DH.
The Health Act 1999 provided for:
• the replacement of the internal NHS
market, including the abolition of the GP
fundholding scheme and its replacement
by Primary Care Groups;
• the establishment of free-standing
Primary Care Trusts;
• a new duty of quality requiring NHS
Trusts, Primary Care Trusts and health
authorities to assure and improve their
quality of care;
• the establishment of the Commission for
Health Improvement, to provide
independent advice and expertise to the
NHS on developing and improving the
quality of NHS services;
• a new duty of partnership between the
NHS and local authorities, with
strengthened arrangements for joint
working;
• a duty for health authorities to prepare
Health Improvement Programmes; and
• better provision for the regulation of
healthcare professionals.
Health Authorities
There are 99 health authorities in England
and five in Wales, 15 health boards in
Scotland and four health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland, all of which are
responsible for identifying the healthcare
needs of the people living in their area. They
secure hospital and community health
services and arrange for the provision of
services by family doctors, dentists,
pharmacists and opticians, as well as
administering their contracts. The latter is
undertaken by Primary Care Trusts/Island
Health Boards in Scotland. The health
authorities and boards co-operate closely with
local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other
services. There are community health
councils (local health councils in Scotland and
area health and social services councils in
Northern Ireland) covering all parts of the
country, representing local opinion on the
services provided.
Health authorities have two main roles: to
ensure that service improvements for local
187
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
people are coherently planned and delivered;
and to provide strategic leadership for
improving health and tackling health inequalities.
They are responsible for preparing a Health
Improvement Programme in partnership with
local Primary Care Groups, Primary Care
Trusts, NHS Trusts, local authorities, local
people and voluntary groups, and ensuring
that the Programme meets the needs of the
local population.
Primary Care Groups and Trusts
GP fundholding was abolished in October
1999 (except in Northern Ireland where the
fundholding scheme is due to end in March
2001 and future arrangements in primary care
are under consideration). Primary Care
Groups were introduced in each area in April
1999. They give responsibility for determining
services for patients to GPs, community
nurses, other health professionals, managers,
social services, health authorities, NHS Trusts
and the public. The Groups, which control
two-thirds of local NHS budgets, are
accountable to the local health authority and
are responsible for commissioning services for
their local communities. Typically Groups
may each serve about 100,000 patients. They
have a single unified budget, which allows
GPs to choose how best to meet patients’
needs. All Primary Care Groups are expected
to work closely with social services to provide
properly integrated care.
The first 17 Primary Care Trusts became
operational on 1 April 2000. They are larger,
more independent statutory bodies than the
Primary Care Groups, involving groups of
doctors, nurses and social care professionals—
as well as other organisations and agencies—
working in partnership to shape local health
and social care services. They carry out many
functions formerly performed by health
authorities and are also able to provide a range
of community health services directly. Under
the NHS Plan, they will identify and maintain
registers of those at the greatest risk from
serious illness, so that people can be offered
preventive treatment.
In Scotland primary care became a Primary
Care Trust function in April 1999, to establish
a single organisation with responsibility for
delivering primary, community and long-stay
health services.
NHS Trusts
NHS Trusts remain responsible for treatment
and care, but are also party to the local Health
Improvement Programmes. Short-term
contracts under the internal market have
ended and NHS Trusts are agreeing long¬
term service agreements with Primary Care
Groups and Primary Care Trusts. These
agreements are generally organised around
care groups (such as children) or disease areas
(such as heart disease). NHS Trusts are now
required to meet quality standards, to co¬
operate with other parts of the NHS, and to
take part (alongside Primary Care Groups,
Primary Care Trusts and local authorities) in
developing the local Health Improvement
Programme (see above). NHS Trusts publish
details of their performance, including the
costs of treatments and services.
Each NHS Trust (Health and Social
Services Trust in Northern Ireland) is run by
a board of executive and non-executive
directors/trustees, subject to provisions in the
Health Act 1999. Trusts are free to employ
their own staff and set their own rates of pay,
and can carry out research and provide
facilities for medical education and other
forms of training. All Trust board meetings
are now open to the public. Measures have
been taken to make boards more reflective of
the local communities.
Standards
National Service Frameworks (NSFs) set
national quality and efficiency standards and
describe service models for a defined service
or care group. They put in place programmes
to support implementation and establish
performance measures against which progress
within an agreed timescale can be measured.
Following existing frameworks for cancer and
paediatric intensive care, NSFs for coronary
heart disease and mental health have been
published (see p. 184); an NSF for older
people is planned in autumn 2000 and one for
diabetes in 2001. The first comprehensive

NHS Cancer Plan was published in
September 2000 (see p. 183). The standards
contained in NSFs also apply to Wales, but
separate implementation arrangements are
being developed.
The National Institute for Clinical
Excellence (NICE) was established in April
1999 to develop national standards for best
practice in clinical care within the NHS. This
includes drawing up new guidelines based on
clinical and cost effectiveness and ensuring
that they apply to all parts of the NHS. The
Institute’s membership is drawn from the
health professions, the NHS, academics,
health economists and patients. It appraises
drugs and technologies and produces clinical
guidelines. Areas covered in NICE’s work
programme include breast and ovarian cancer,
coronary heart disease, cervical screening,
multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, colorectal
cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. By
September 2000 NICE had carried out nine
appraisals and its first guideline is expected to
be announced in winter 2000. NICE had also
completed 11 GP referral protocols.
Health Education and Development
In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland
responsibility for health education lies with
separate NHS authorities working alongside
the national health departments. In England
the former Health Education Authority was
succeeded in April 2000 by two new bodies: the
Health Development Agency (HDA) and
Health Promotion England. The HDA aims to
improve the health of people in England—in
particular, to reduce inequalities in health
between those who are well off and those on
low incomes or reliant on state benefits. Its
three major roles are research, setting
standards, and training and resources. Health
Promotion England promotes campaigns on a
number of subjects, including childhood
immunisation, drugs, alcohol and sexual health.
In Wales a health promotion division has
been established in the National Assembly for
Wales, with responsibility for health
promotion policy and strategy, and the
development and delivery of national
programmes and initiatives to promote health
and wellbeing. In Scotland the authority is the
Health Education Board and in Northern
Ireland the Health Promotion Agency.
Almost all NHS health authorities/health
boards have their own health education
service, which works closely with health
professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to
determine the most suitable local
programmes.
NHS Direct
NHS Direct is a 24-hour helpline, where the
initial contact is with a nurse, giving immediate
healthcare advice and support over the
telephone, so that people are better able to care
for themselves and their families. Since
December 1999, 65 per cent of the population
in England have had access to the service. It will
be extended to cover the whole of England by
the end of October 2000. Over 1 million calls
have been made to NHS Direct. Discussions are
under way about the introduction of the NHS
Direct concept in Scotland.
NHS Direct On-line, a complementary
extension to the telephone-based services, was
launched in December 1999 using the Internet
and is linked to other health-related websites.
The service now receives about 1 million ‘hits’
every day. It includes an electronic version of
the NHS Direct Healthcare Guide, which
takes the top 20 symptoms about which people
seek advice from NHS Direct. Users answer a
series of‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions which prompt
advice on how serious a health worry might
be. While not a diagnostic tool, NHS Direct
The first of 36 pilot Walk-In Centres
opened in Soho in central London in
January 2000. They are designed to
provide quick and convenient access to
basic primary care services without the
need for an appointment. They are nurse-
led, treat minor injuries and illnesses, and
give health advice and information on
other local services, complementing the
more traditional GP service. Eight centres
will be in supermarkets or shop fronts and
six alongside hospital accident and
emergency departments.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
On-line provides advice and directs users to a
course of action depending on their answers.
The website address is www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk.
Under the NHS Plan, the Government’s
intention is that by 2002 all NHS Direct sites
will be able to refer people to local pharmacies
and by 2004 NHS Direct will provide health
information via digital television, and be able to
act as a gateway to out-of-hours healthcare,
including GP co-operative or deputising
services.
Health Action Zones
Twenty-six ‘Health Action Zones’ have been
set up in deprived areas of England. The
zones involve local partnerships between the
health service, local councils, voluntary groups
and local businesses, and receive government
funding. Their aim is to make measurable
improvements in the health of local people
and in the quality of treatment and care.
Working closely with the DH, the participants
co-operate to tackle inequalities and deliver
better services and healthcare. They focus on
areas such as smoking cessation programmes,
children’s and young people’s health, mental
health, older people’s health, and the health of
ethnic minorities.
Two Health Action Zones were established
in Northern Ireland in April 1999 and an
initiative to encourage local healthcare
partnerships has been launched in Scotland.
NHSnet
NHSnet is the short name for a range of voice
and data services used by the NHS, covering
radio, telephone and computer-based
communications. All health authorities and
most Trusts are connected to NHSnet, as are a
number of major NHS suppliers. All GPs in
Scotland are connected to NHSnet. Under the
GPnet programme, by 2002 every GP practice
in England will be connected to NHSnet and
will be able to receive hospital pathology test
results. NHSnet will also support the longer-
term goal of introducing electronic health
records to replace the paper-based records.
This will make possible, for example, secure
access by doctors to a patient’s records in an
emergency when patients are away from home.
An equivalent scheme, HPSSnet, has been set
up in Northern Ireland by Northern Ireland
Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS).
Finance
The NHS is financed mainly through general
taxation with an element of National
Insurance contributions (see chapter 12), paid
by employed people, their employers and self-
employed people. In 1999-2000 an estimated
79 per cent of the NHS was financed through
general taxation, with 13 per cent from
National Insurance contributions and 8 per
cent from charges and other receipts.
The Government’s Spending Review (see
p. 401), published in July 2000, gave details of
extra funding for the NHS. Expenditure on
the NHS, net of receipts, is forecast to rise
from £54.2 billion in 2000—01 to £68.7 billion
in 2003-04. This represents an increase in
funding in real terms of an average 6.1 per
cent a year. Extra resources have also become
available following the Government’s
decision, announced in November 1999, that
revenue raised from higher duties on
cigarettes and tobacco in real terms would be
spent on improved healthcare.
Health authorities may raise funds from
other, non-government, sources. For example,
some hospitals increase revenue by taking
private patients, who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment. They also use
private finance for NHS capital projects, under
the Private Finance Initiative (see p. 405).
In addition, reforms to the National
Lottery have set up a new good cause, the
New Opportunities Fund, which provides
complementary funding for health, education
and the environment. The Fund has provided
£300 million in the UK to support a series of
targeted initiatives. One of the first is to
establish a network of healthy living centres
which offer people fitness checks, fitness
routines, and advice on diet and healthy
lifestyles.

in 1999, an increase of 35 per cent in real terms
since 1994. The proportion of items provided
free of charge increased from 83 per cent in 1994
to 85 per cent in 1999. The following groups are
exempted from prescription charges: people
aged 60 and over; children under 16 and young
people aged 16, 17 or 18 in full-time education;
women who are pregnant or have given birth in
the previous 12 months; and people with certain
medical conditions. In addition, people who
receive (or whose partners receive) certain social
security benefits (see chapter 12), or who
otherwise qualify on low income grounds, do not
pay prescription charges. In 1999, 52 per cent of
all prescription items dispensed by community
pharmacies and appliance contractors in
England were for elderly people, an increase
from around 44 per cent in 1994.
There are charges for most types of NHS
dental treatment, including examinations,
based on a proportion of the fee paid to the
dentist. However, the following people are
entitled to free treatment: women who begin a
course of treatment while pregnant or within
12 months of having a baby; children under
18; full-time students under 19; and adults on
low incomes or receiving the same benefits or
tax credits as for free prescriptions.
Free NHS sight tests are available for
people aged 60 and over, children, full-time
students under the age of 19, adults on low
incomes or receiving the same benefits or tax
credits as for free prescriptions, and people
who have, or are at particular risk of, eye
disease. Just over 10 million sight tests were
paid for by health authorities in England and
Wales in the year to 31 March 2000.
NHS Workforce
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly 1 million
people.
Of the 968,000 employees in NHS hospital
and community health services in England in
September 1999 (equivalent to 782,000 whole¬
time staff), 430,000 were nursing, midwifery
and health visiting staff. The Government has
taken steps to address current shortages of
nurses and midwives through the launch of the
first national recruitment campaign in
February 1999 and an increase in training
places for nurses, midwives and health visitors.
For the most part, family practitioners
(GPs, dentists, optometrists and community
pharmacists) are either self-employed or (in
the case of pharmacists and optometrists) are
employed by independent businesses. They,
or their companies, agree to provide services
on the NHS’s behalf, and are paid by health
authorities for doing so.
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for undergraduate
teaching; the NHS provides hospital and
community facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and hospital
and the community, with a further year’s
experience in a hospital. For a dentist, Five
years’ training at a dental school is required
plus satisfactory completion of one year’s
mandatory vocational training before working

as a principal in the General Dental Services
of the NHS is permitted. Most GPs are paid
by a system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. All general dental practitioners are
paid by a combination of capitation fees for
children registered with the practice,
continuing care payments for adults
registered, and a prescribed scale of fees for
individual treatments.
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council
(GMC) and, for dentists, the General Dental
Council. The main professional associations
are the British Medical Association and the
British Dental Association.
Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors
Nursing students undertake the pre¬
registration Diploma in Higher Education
(Project 2000) programme, which emphasises
health promotion as well as care of the sick and
enables students to work either in hospitals or
in the community. The programme lasts three
years and consists of periods of college study
combined with practical experience in hospital
and in the community.
Midwifery education programmes for
registered general/adult nurses take 18
months, but the direct entry programme lasts
Measures are being taken by the
Government to improve clinical
governance, following a number of
criminal cases involving doctors, notably
the case of Harold Shipman (who was
convicted in January 2000 of murdering 15
elderly women patients)—a public inquiry
is to be held into the issues surrounding
this particular case. The measures include:
• a review by the Commission for
Health Improvement of local clinical
governance arrangements;
• a report by the Chief Medical
Officer—Supporting Doctors,
Protecting Patients—setting out plans
to ensure any problems in a doctor’s
performance are picked up at an early
stage; and
• a decision that all doctors will be
appraised annually from 2001,
supporting GMC plans to revalidate
doctors regularly to ensure that they
keep their professional practice up to
date. A National Clinical Assessment
Authority will be established from
April 2001 to provide a rapid objective
assessment of an individual doctor’s
performance where necessary.

three years. Health visitors are registered adult
nurses who have a further specialist
qualification in health visiting. District nurses
are registered adult nurses who have a further
specialist qualification in district nursing and
care for clients in the community.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions. Four National Boards—for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland—are responsible for ensuring that
training courses meet Central Council
requirements as to their type, content and
standard. The Government intends to replace
these with a single regulatory body, the
Nursing and Midwifery Council.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires four years’ training in a
school of pharmacy, followed by one year’s
practical experience in a community or hospital
pharmacy approved for training by regulatory
bodies for the profession—the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or the
Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.
Community pharmacists are paid professional
fees for dispensing NHS prescriptions, as well
as being reimbursed for the cost of the drugs
and appliances concerned.
Optometrists (Ophthalmic Opticians)
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight; training for the former takes four years,
including a year of practical experience under
supervision. Dispensing opticians take a two-
year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience, or follow a part-time day-release
course while employed with an optician.
Ophthalmic medical practitioners and
optometrists providing general ophthalmic
services for the NHS receive approved fees for
each sight test carried out.
Other Health Professions
The Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine (CPSM) and its 12 professional
boards regulate the initial training and
subsequent practice of health professions:
chiropodists; radiographers; orthoptists;
physiotherapists; occupational therapists;
dietitians; medical laboratory scientific officers;
prosthetists and orthotists; arts therapists (art,
drama and music therapists); speech and
language therapists; clinical scientists; and
paramedics. The boards are responsible for
promoting high standards of professional
education and conduct among members,
approving training institutions, qualifications
and courses, and maintaining registers of those
who have qualified for state registration—state
registration in these professions is mandatory
for employment in health authorities, Trusts
and local authority social services.
The Government intends to replace the
CPSM by a Health Professions Council
(HPC), which will have scope to regulate any
new professions. The HPC will also be
represented on the Council of Health
Regulators.
Dental therapists and dental hy gienists are
almost exclusively recruited from certified
dental nurses who have taken at least one
year’s training. Dental therapists then take a
two-to-three-year training course and dental
hygienists take a course lasting two years; both
carry out specified dental work under the
supervision of a registered dentist.
Openness in the NHS
The Code of Practice on Openness in the NHS
is designed to make NHS organisations
(including GPs, dentists and pharmacists) more
accountable and provide greater public access
to information. It sets out the information that
health authorities/boards and NHS Trusts
should publish or otherwise make available.
This includes information about services
provided, the targets and standards set and
results achieved, and the costs and effectiveness
of services, details of important proposals on
health policies or proposed changes in the way
the services are delivered, and information for
people on how to access their health records.
193
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
NHS Complaints System
Under the current NHS complaints system,
complaints should be resolved speedily at local
level, but if the complainant remains
dissatisfied with the local response he or she
can request an independent review of the
complaint. Where an independent review panel
investigation takes place, a report setting out
suggestions and recommendations will be
produced. Complainants who remain
dissatisfied, or whose request for a panel
investigation is turned down, can refer their
complaint to the Health Service Commissioner.
In 1998-99 some 86,000 written complaints
were made about hospital and community
health services in England, and nearly 38,900
complaints were made about family health
services. In Scotland, 7,257 written complaints
were made about hospital and community
health services and 2,710 written complaints
were made about family health services.
The NHS intends to set up before the end
of 2000 a new national mandatory reporting
system for England for logging all failures,
mistakes and errors.
The new Patient Advocacy and Liaison
Service (PALS) will be established in every
NHS Trust in England by 2002. Patient
advocates will be able to handle patient and
family concerns and have direct access to a
Trust’s chief executive. They will be able to
steer patients towards the complaints process
where necessary.
Health Service Commissioners
Health Service Commissioners (one each for
England, Scotland and Wales) are responsible
for investigating complaints directly from
members of the public about health service
bodies. The three posts are at present held by
one person (with a staff of about 250), who is
also Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman—see p. 52). As
Health Service Commissioner, he reports
annually to Parliament. In Scotland he reports
to the Scottish Parliament and in Wales to the
National Assembly. In Northern Ireland
complaints about health and social services
bodies are investigated by the Commissioner
for Complaints (the Ombudsman).
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered hardship or injustice as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by a health
service body;
• a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive or
maladministration by an NHS authority; or
• action by health professionals arising
from the exercise of clinical judgment.
Complaints must be sent to the
Commissioner in writing, and the health
service body concerned should first have been
given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
In 1999-2000 a total of 2,526 written
complaints were received in England
regarding both hospital and community health
services and family health services.
NHS Charters
Patient’s Charters originally set out national
standards of service that the NHS aims to
achieve. A new NHS Charter will replace the
Patient’s Charter in England by 2001. The
Charter in England will be entitled ‘Your
Guide to the NHS’ and will provide
information on how patients can access
appropriate services to meet their healthcare
needs, set out a series of standards for each
stage in the patient’s care, and include
improvements patients can expect in the future.
In Wales, a Health and Social Care Charter will
be launched in 2001, backed up with local
charters at local health group level. In Northern
Ireland consideration is being given to issuing a
revised HPSS Charter for Patients and Clients
in 2001. In Scotland discussions continue about
the future of the Patient’s Charter.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The Family Health Services are those
provided to patients by doctors (GPs),
dentists, opticians and pharmacists. In
England there were 251 million consultations
with GPs in 1998—99.
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case of
illness, give advice and may prescribe a suitable
course of treatment or refer a patient to the
194
13: HEALTH SERVICES
more specialised services and hospital
consultants. Primary healthcare teams also
include health visitors and district nurses,
midwives, and sometimes social workers and
other professional staff employed by the health
authorities. Most GPs in Great Britain and
about half in Northern Ireland work in health
centres. As well as providing medical and
nursing services, health centres may have
facilities for health education, family planning,
speech therapy, chiropody, assessment of
hearing, physiotherapy and remedial exercises.
Dental, pharmaceutical and ophthalmic
services, hospital out-patient and supporting
social work services may also be provided.
There have been increases in primary
healthcare staff in recent years. For example,
between 1989 and 1999 the number of general
medical practitioners (excluding retainers) in
England rose by 0.8 per cent a year on average to
29,987. Similarly, the number of general dental
practitioners continues to grow, rising to 17,715
in October 1999,2.7 per cent more than in 1998.
Initiatives in Primary Care
The NHS Plan envisages that by 2004 patients
will be able to see a primary care professional
within 24 hours and a GP within 48 hours.
More services will also be available in primary
care centres, with some 4 million consultant
outpatient appointments a year in primary
care and community settings, and up to 1,000
specialist GPs being able to take referrals from
other GPs.
A major target of the NHS Plan is reducing
inequality in access to services. To improve the
equitable distribution of GPs across the NHS, a
new Medical Education Standards Board will
monitor the number and distribution of doctors
in primary care, and by 2004, 200 new Personal
Medical Services schemes are planned, mainly
in disadvantaged areas.
In 1997 the Government launched its
Investing in Dentistry scheme in England, to
help improve dental care in areas of poor
availability and poor oral health. Similar
schemes are in operation in Scotland and
Wales. The dental strategy for England aims
to ensure that by the end of 2001 everyone
who wants to will be able to be treated by an
NHS dentist. Pilot dental services are being
set up to encourage innovation to meet
differences in local dental needs, and Dental
Access Centres are being set up in a number of
locations to relieve the most acute access
problems—for example, high streets, clinics and
some of the new primary care Walk-In Centres
(see p. 189). By the end of 2000 there will be
around 40 Dental Access Centres, providing
both routine and emergency dental care.
In 1999 the Review of Prescribing, Supply
and Administration of Medicines
recommended extending the authority to
prescribe to other health professionals. By
2001, around 23,000 district nurses, health
visitors and GP practice nurses who also have a
health visiting or district nursing qualification
will be trained to prescribe a limited range of
medicines. From 2004 both the range of
medicines and the number of nurses is to be
extended. The Government has also
announced its intention to introduce legislation
to allow supplementary prescribing by other
health professionals, such as pharmacists,
physiotherapists and chiropodists, as soon as
parliamentary time permits.
Midwives, Health Visitors and District
Nurses
Midwives provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy (see p. 199), birth and
the postnatal period (up to 28 days after the
baby is born). They work in both hospital and
community settings. Health visitors are
responsible for the preventive care and health
promotion of families, particularly those with
young children. They identify local health
needs and work closely with GPs, district
nurses and other professions. District nurses
give skilled nursing care to people at home or
elsewhere outside hospital; they also play an
important role in health promotion and
education. Practice nurses are based in GP
surgeries. They carry out treatments and give
advice on health promotion, working closely
with GPs and with other community nurses.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST SERVICES
District general hospitals offer a broad
spectrum of clinical specialities, supported by a
195
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
range of other services, such as anaesthetics,
pathology and radiology. Almost all have
facilities for the admission of emergency
patients, either through accident and
emergency departments or as direct referrals
from GPs. Treatments are provided for in¬
patients, day cases, out-patients and patients
who attend wards for treatment such as
dialysis. Some hospitals also provide specialist
services covering more than one region or
district, for example, for heart and liver
transplants, craniofacial services, and rare eye
and bone cancers. There are also specialist
hospitals such as the world-famous Hospital for
Sick Children at Great Ormond Street,
Moorfields Eye Hospital, and the National
Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, all
in London. These hospitals combine specialist
treatment facilities with the training of medical
and other students, and international research.
The NHS Plan envisages that around
three-quarters of operations in England will be
carried out on a day care basis, with no
overnight stay required.
Less than a third of hospitals now pre-date
the formation of the NHS in 1948. While
much has been done to improve existing
hospital buildings, the largest building
programme in the history of the NHS is
currently in progress, including several major
Private Finance Initiative schemes (see
p. 197). Altogether over 100 new hospital
schemes are planned between 2000 and 2010.
The main contribution of NHS Trusts (see
p. 188) remains the provision of hospital and
community services to patients. The services
they provide are subject to quality standards
set by the NICE (see p. 189) and to the new
‘earned autonomy’ system to be established
under the NHS Plan (see p. 185).
National Beds Inquiry
The National Beds Inquiry was set up
because of concerns that reductions in
hospital beds had gone too far. The Inquiry,
which reported in February 2000, found that
the long-term trend of reducing the number
of hospital beds could no longer meet
changing needs. Instead, it said that acute
and community beds and services needed to
expand to meet expected future patient
needs. It put forward three possible models
for debate and consultation:
• maintaining the balance of service
objectives and settings broadly as at
present;
• more investment in hospitals and a
significant increase in hospital acute
beds; and
• expanding intermediate care services to
treat older people in the community
rather than in hospital, so releasing
some of the beds currently occupied by
elderly patients.
Respondents to the National Beds Inquiry
Consultation with the public and health
professionals (published in February 2000)
envisaged a service providing care in the
right place to meet patients’ needs with no
discernible divide between the different
elements of the health and social care
system. In particular, there was support for:
• developing care closer to home;
• at least maintaining adequate acute
beds;
• greater integration of NHS care with
social services, focused on the patient;
and
• disease prevention and early
intervention in the community.
Intermediate care would be central to the
new approach, concentrating on maintaining
and restoring independence and on
rehabilitation. It would include:
• ‘drop-in’ facilities;
• fast access to diagnostics and pathology;
• multi-disciplinary teams with a mixture
of nurse, therapist, consultant and GP-
led services;
• fast access to acute services and in¬
patient settings where necessary; and
• timely discharge into appropriate
settings.
The private and voluntary sectors would
have important roles to play. The new
environment would be supported by
electronic patient records and more use of
new technology.

Waiting Lists
Half of all admissions to hospital are
immediate. The other half are placed on a
waiting list before the admission takes place.
Of patients admitted from waiting lists, half
are admitted within six weeks, and around
two-thirds within three months.
A major government target is to reduce
waiting lists in England to 100,000 below (and
in Scotland to 10,000 below) the level in May
1997, by the end of the present Parliament. At
the end of July 2000 just over 1 million
patients were waiting for NHS treatment. The
Government made £320 million available to
reduce waiting lists and times in England in
1999-2000 and will invest a further £300
million in 2000-01 from the Modernisation
Fund. It is developing a new National Booked
Admissions Programme, under which patients
are able to pre-book their appointments for a
convenient time. Almost all the first 24 pilot
sites have improved non-attendance rates and
a further 60 pilots are under way. An extra
£40 million has been made available by the
National Assembly for Wales to reduce
waiting lists by 15,000 during 2000-01.
Private Finance Initiative
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was
launched in 1992 to promote partnership
between the public and private sectors on a
commercial basis (see chapter 24). In the health
service it involves new facilities being designed,
built, maintained and owned by the private
sector, which then leases the completed
facilities back to the NHS. Clinical services
continue to be provided by NHS staff, and the
NHS remains in control of key planning and
clinical decisions. The Government introduced
legislation in 1997 to clarify the powers of NHS
Trusts to sign PFI agreements, and, following a
review of PFI hospital building schemes in
England, announced a major new hospital
building programme.
Organ Transplants
United Kingdom Transplant (a special health
authority of the NHS) provides a 24-hour
support service to all transplant units in the
UK for the matching and allocation of organs
for transplant. In many cases transplants are
multi-organ. During 1999, 1,621 kidney
transplants were performed, and at the end of
1999 there were 5,904 patients waiting for
kidney transplants.
There are seven designated thoracic
transplant centres in England, and one in
Scotland. In 1999, 230 heart, 110 lung, and 50
heart/lung transplants were performed. There
are six designated liver transplant units in
England and one in Scotland. In 1999, 691
liver transplants were performed.
A similar service exists for corneas and, in
1999, 2,275 were transplanted in the UK.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness to
become organ donors in the event of their
death. The NHS Organ Donor Register is a
computer database of those willing to be organ
donors. At December 1999 it contained 8.5
million names. Commercial dealing in organs
for transplant is illegal in the UK.
Blood Services
Blood services are run by the Blood Services
in England and North Wales, the Scottish
National Blood Transfusion Service, the
Welsh Blood Service and the Northern
Ireland Blood Transfusion Agency. The UK
is self-sufficient in blood components.
In the UK over 3 million donations are
given each year by voluntary unpaid donors.
These are made into many different life¬
saving products for patients. Red cells,
platelets and other components with a limited
‘shelf life’ are prepared at blood centres,
whereas the production of plasma products is
undertaken at the Bio Products Laboratory in
Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the Protein
Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Donors are normally aged between 17 and
70. Blood centres are responsible for blood
collection, screening, processing and
supplying hospital blood banks. They also
provide laboratory, clinical, research, teaching
and specialist advisory services and facilities.
These blood centres are subject to nationally
co-ordinated quality audit programmes,
through the Medicines Control Agency.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
to the public through the 999 telephone call
system for cases of sudden illness or collapse
and for accidents. They are also available for
doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid response services,
in which paramedics use cars and motorcycles
to reach emergency cases, have been
introduced in a number of areas, particularly
London and other major cities with areas of
high traffic density. Helicopter ambulances,
provided through local charities, serve many
parts of the country and an integrated NHS-
funded air ambulance service is available
throughout Scotland. Between 1998-99 and
1999-2000 the number of emergency calls to
the NHS rose by 7 per cent to 4.1 million and
the number of emergency patient journeys
grew by 5 per cent to 2.9 million.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are free to NHS patients considered by their
doctor (or dentist or midwife) to be medically
unfit to travel by other means. In many areas
the ambulance service organises volunteer
drivers to provide a hospital car service for
non-urgent patients. Patients on low incomes
may be eligible for reimbursement of costs of
travelling to hospital.
Rehabilitation
NHS and social services undertake
rehabilitation work for large numbers of people
of all ages to restore and maintain their
independence and social participation.
Rehabilitation plays an important role in
improving the quality of life of people, enabling
them to return to, or remain in, employment or
education and preventing inappropriate
admissions to hospital or long-term care.
Health and social services are encouraged
to develop a range of rehabilitative options and
to be flexible in meeting people’s needs. A
new Partnership Grant, announced in the
Modernising Social Services White Paper and
totalling nearly £650 million over three years,
has a particular emphasis on improving
rehabilitation services and avoiding
unnecessary admissions to hospital and other
institutional care.
Hospices
Hospice or palliative care is a special type of
care for people whose illness may no longer be
curable; it enables them to achieve the best
possible quality of life during the final stages.
The care may be provided in a variety of
settings: at home (with support from specially
trained staff), in a hospice or palliative care
unit, in hospital or at a hospice day centre.
Hospice or palliative care focuses on
controlling pain and other distressing
symptoms and providing psychological
support to patients, their families and friends,
both during the patient’s illness and into
bereavement.
Palliative care was first developed in the
UK in 1967 by the voluntary hospices and
continues to be provided by them in many
areas, but is now also provided within NHS
palliative care units, hospitals and community
services.
Hospices and palliative care services mostly
help people with cancer, although patients
with other life-threatening illnesses, such as
AIDS, are also cared for. Several hospices
provide respite care for children from birth to
16 years of age.
The National Council for Hospices and
Specialist Palliative Care Services is an
organisation which brings together both
voluntary and health service providers in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in order
to provide a co-ordinated view of the service. Its
Scottish counterpart is the Scottish Partnership
Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care.
Private Medical Treatment
Some NHS hospitals share expensive
equipment with private hospitals, and NHS
patients are sometimes treated (at public
expense) in the private sector when it
represents value for money. The scale of
private practice in relation to the NHS is,
however, relatively small. According to the
ONS Family Expenditure Survey, the
proportion of UK households covered by
private health insurance increased from 6 per
cent in 1985 to 9 per cent in 1998-99.
Many overseas patients come to the UK for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics.

Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
Complementary Medicine
Complementary medicine (or complementary
therapies) can cover a range of therapies and
practices, the best known being osteopathy,
chiropractic, homoeopathy, acupuncture and
herbalism. With the exception of
homoeopathy, complementary medicine is
usually available only outside the NHS. There
is a wide variety of regulatory and professional
arrangements ranging from statutory
regulation to little or no regulation. The
Government is providing funding to
encourage professional self-regulation.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided under
the NHS to safeguard the health of pregnant
women and of mothers with young children.
Services include free dental treatment; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 204). Under the NHS Plan, further
screening programmes are planned by 2004,
including a new national linked antenatal and
neonatal screening programme for
haemoglobinopathy and sickle cell disease.
Nearly all births take place in hospital,
although there was an increase during the
1990s in the popularity of home births: these
accounted for 2.2 per cent of births in England
and Wales in 1999, compared with around 1
per cent during the 1980s. Home births in
Scotland remain relatively constant at under 1
per cent. A woman is entitled to care
throughout her pregnancy, the birth and the
postnatal period. Care may be provided by a
midwife, a community-based GP, a hospital-
based obstetrician, or a combination of these.
The birth may take place in a hospital
maternity unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at
home. After the birth, a midwife will visit
until the baby is at least ten days old and after
that a health visitor’s services are available.
Throughout her pregnancy and for the first
year of her baby’s life, a woman is entitled to
free prescriptions and dental care.
Prescriptions for children, including older
children (up to the age of 19 when in full-time
education), are free of charge.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance, provided for pre-school children
(under five years of age), is run by community
health trusts and GPs who receive an annual
payment for every child registered on the
programme. (In Scotland this is carried out by
the Community Paediatric Service which may
be based in the primary care or acute services
trust.) This enables doctors, dentists and
health visitors to oversee the health and
development of pre-school children so that
any health problems are picked up and
appropriate intervention arranged as early and
as quickly as possible. Health Promotion
England (see p. 189) produces Birth to Five, a
guide to the early stages of development,
nutrition, weaning and common childhood
ailments; it is made available to all first-time
mothers free of charge. The Scottish
equivalent is Ready Steady Baby! by the
Health Education Board for Scotland.
There is a welfare food scheme for mothers
on low income, where distribution of formula
feed and vitamins is free of charge. This is
often undertaken at the child health clinic.
The NHS Plan envisages that the scheme will
be reformed by 2004 to improve access to a
healthy diet for children in poverty. Increased
support for breastfeeding will continue in
England through the Infant Feeding Initiative
on tackling health inequalities in this area.
The Scottish Executive funds the Scottish
Breastfeeding Group and the National
Breastfeeding Adviser, who actively promote
breastfeeding in Scotland.
New mothers also receive a Personal Child
Health Record for their child. It enables and
prompts parents to keep a record of
immunisation (see p. 204), tests, birth details
and health checks. This is not done in
Scotland although the concept is being
piloted. Children of school age attending a
state-maintained school have access to the
school health service, as well as usually being
registered with a GP and local dentist. In
addition to providing health advice to children
and young people, the school health service
assists teachers with pupils having medical
needs.
199
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems. In recent years special efforts have
been made to improve co-operation between
the community-based child health services
and local authority education and social
services for children. This is particularly
important in the prevention of child abuse and
for the health and welfare of children in care
(see p. 167).
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
the UK in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of infertility
and for the science of embryology. The social,
ethical and legal implications were examined by
a committee of inquiry and led eventually to the
passage of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990, one of the most
comprehensive pieces of legislation on assisted
reproduction and embryo research in the world.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA) licenses and controls
centres providing certain infertility
treatments, undertaking human embryo
research or storing gametes or embryos. The
HFEA maintains a code of practice giving
guidance to licensed centres and reports
annually to Parliament.
Sexual Health
The Government’s public health strategy aims
to ensure the provision of effective sexual
health services. Free contraceptive advice and
treatment are available from GPs, family
planning clinics and tailored services for young
people. Clinics are able to provide condoms and
other contraceptives free of charge.
The DH is developing a national sexual
health and HIV strategy to bring together
current initiatives in sexual health and HIV,
including work on chlamydia. The Scottish
Executive is also developing plans for a sexual
health strategy for Scotland. In addition, it is
funding £3 million in a demonstration project
which aims to foster responsible sexual
behaviour on the part of young people, with
emphasis on the avoidance of unwanted teenage
pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.
Teenage Pregnancies
Live birth rates to women under 20 in England
and Wales are the highest in Western Europe.
In 1998 the conception rate for women under
the age of 18 was 47 per thousand in England
and Wales, and 9 per thousand for those under
the age of 16. Just over 40 per cent of
pregnancies in under 18s, and about half in
under 16s, result in an abortion.
The Social Exclusion Unit report on
Teenage Pregnancy, issued in June 1999, set
two goals: to halve by 2010 the rate of
conceptions in England among those aged
under 18; and to lessen the risks of social
exclusion by getting more teenage parents
back into education, training or employment.
A cross-departmental Teenage Pregnancy
Unit, located within DH, has been set up to
oversee implementation of this strategy.
A £60 million package of measures includes:
• a national publicity campaign to reinforce
the report’s key messages;
• improved access to contraceptive and
sexual health services for teenagers;
• new guidance on sex and relationships
education in school; and
• special action targeted on prevention for
the most vulnerable groups, including
children looked after by a local authority,
those excluded from school and young
offenders.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a
time limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest
category of abortion—risk to the physical or
mental health of the pregnant woman—and
also to abortion because of a similar risk to any
existing children of her family. There are three
categories in which no time limit applies: to
prevent grave permanent injury to the physical
or mental health of the woman; where there is a
substantial risk of serious foetal handicap; or
where continuing the pregnancy would involve
a risk to the life of the pregnant woman greater

Between 1998 and 1999 the number of legal
abortions on women resident in England and
Wales fell by 2.3 per cent to 173,701, and the
overall rate fell slightly from 13.9 to 13.6 for
every 1,000 women aged between 14 and 49.
Substance Misuse
Tobacco Control
Cigarette smoking is the single greatest cause
of preventable illness and death in the UK. It
is associated with around 120,000 premature
deaths a year (mainly from cancer and heart
and respiratory diseases)—nearly one-fifth of
all deaths.
Action to reduce smoking, especially among
children and young people, is a government
priority. A White Paper—Smoking Kills—
published in December 1998, set out a number
of targets for the UK including:
• to reduce smoking among children from
13 per cent to 9 per cent or less by 2010,
with a fall to 11 per cent by 2005;
• to reduce adult smoking so that the
overall rate falls from 28 per cent to
24 per cent or less by 2010, with a fall to
26 per cent by 2005; and
• to reduce the percentage of women who
smoke during pregnancy from 23 per
cent to 15 per cent by 2010, with a fall to
18 per cent by 2005.
The NHS Cancer Plan, launched in
September 2000 (see p. 183), introduced a
further target, to reduce smoking rates among
manual groups from 32 per cent in 1998 to
26 per cent by 2010.
In September 1999, the Government
produced a Public Places Charter which
committed signatories to improve the facilities
for customers who do not smoke in public
houses, bars and restaurants. According to the
DH, it is anticipated that half of licensed
hospitality venues will be signed up to the
Charter by 2002.
Smoking peaked in the 1950s and 1960s
and fell steadily in the 1970s and 1980s (see
chart above). Smoking rates, which used to be
higher for men than for women, have fallen
more among men than among women,
201
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
narrowing the difference to 28 per cent for
men in Great Britain and 26 per cent for
women in 1998-99.
The proportion of regular smokers among
secondary school pupils aged 11 to 15 fell from
13 per cent in 1996 to 9 per cent in 1999. Boys
are less likely than girls to be regular smokers.
The NHS Plan envisages an expansion in
specialist smoking cessation services for those
smokers who need extra help to give up. The
services include nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT), available on prescription from GPs,
providing the body with nicotine in decreasing
doses until the craving can be coped with, to
complement the newly available treatment,
buproprion. Of the 14,600 people who set a date
to quit smoking through these services in Health
Action Zones in England in 1999-2000, 39 per
cent had still given up a month later. Increased
cessation of smoking since 1965 has almost
halved the number of lung cancer deaths that
would otherwise have been expected in the UK.
Advertising
The Government is preparing primary
legislation to ban tobacco advertising as soon
as parliamentary time permits. In December
1999 the Government launched an advertising
campaign against smoking, costing up to £50
million over three years and initially targeted
at adult smokers. Campaigns aimed at
teenagers, pregnant women, ethnic minorities
and other target groups will follow.
Drug Misuse
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem. In England, during the six
months to September 1999, the number of
users reported as presenting to drug misuse
agencies (30,545) had risen 7 per cent from the
previous six months. Around half were in
their twenties and one in seven under 20,
while about three-quarters were male. Heroin
was the most widely used drug among this
group, being taken by 59 per cent of users.
A survey of secondary school children aged
11 to 15 in 1999 found that 7 per cent of 11 to
15 year olds in England had used drugs in the
month before the survey, and the proportion
who had used drugs at some time in their lives
was 15 per cent. The pattern varies with age:
only 1 per cent of 11 year olds had used drugs
in the last year, but 30 per cent of 15 year olds
had done so. Cannabis was by far the most
likely drug to have been used (11 per cent of
11 to 15 year olds had used it in the last year).
Many more pupils had been offered drugs
(35 per cent) than had tried them.
In 1998, among those aged 16 to 24 in
England and Wales, 29 per cent had used
drugs in the last year and 19 per cent in the
last month, similar levels to those in previous
surveys in 1994 and 1996. Cannabis was again
the most likely drug to be used (27 per cent
had used it in the last year).
The Government published its ten-year
drugs strategy, Tackling Drugs to Build a Better
Britain, in 1998. In May 1999 the UK Anti-
Drugs Co-ordinator set targets to:
• substantially reduce the proportion of
people under 25 reporting use of illegal
drugs in the last month and previous year,
and to reduce the proportion of young
people using heroin and cocaine, which
cause the greatest harm, by 25 per cent by
2005 and 50 per cent by 2008; and
• increase the participation of problem
drug misusers, including prisoners, in
drug treatment programmes, by 66 per
cent by 2005 and 100 per cent by 2008.
Over the period 1999-2000 to 2001-02
some £70.5 million from the NHS and
Personal Social Services Modernisation Fund
is targeted to drugs misuse.
A new long-term strategy for tackling
substance misuse in Wales was launched in
May 2000. Tackling Substance Misuse in Wales:
A Partnership Approach covers the full range of
substances that are misused in Wales
including illegal drugs, alcohol, prescription-
only medicines, over-the-counter medicines
and volatile substances. The new Welsh
strategy embraces the key aims of the UK
anti-drugs strategy.
Prevention
As part of the Government’s anti-drugs
strategy, a new Drugs Prevention Advisory
Service was set up in 1999 (see p. 215). It
202
13: HEALTH SERVICES
works with Drug Action Teams in England to
encourage good drug prevention practice and
to assist in developing appropriate
demonstration programmes. In Wales a
Strategic Prevention Action Plan on Drugs
and Alcohol has been published.
The Government makes funds available
through local education authorities in England
and Wales to provide in-service training for
teachers involved in drug prevention work in
schools. As part of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales (see chapter 10), children
in primary and secondary schools receive
education on the dangers of drug misuse. In
Scotland, education authorities are
encouraged to address health education,
including drug education, within a
comprehensive programme of personal and
social education.
Drug Prevention Projects targeted at young
people at particular risk of drug misuse have
been commissioned in Health Action Zones
(see p. 190) with funding of £4 million for
1998—99 and 1999—2000 and a second round of
funding of £1.8 million in 2000-01. The
projects are intended to address the needs of
vulnerable young people, including truants
and those excluded from school, young people
in public care, young offenders, young
homeless people and children of drug
misusing parents.
UK National Drugs Helpline
The National Drugs Helpline gives advice and
information to anyone in the UK concerned
about drugs. In 1999-2000 it received 0.4
million calls. The telephone number is
0800 77 66 00.
Solvent Misuse
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and health professionals about the
dangers and signs of misuse, and, where
practicable, restricting the sales of solvent-
based liquefied gas and aerosol products to
young people.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or has
reason to believe they are to be used to induce
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law. Since October
1999 it has been an offence in the UK to sell
butane lighter refills to people under 18; these
refills are implicated in more than 50 per cent
of deaths from solvent abuse.
The DH funds a hospital-based unit in
London to collect and publish annual
mortality statistics associated with volatile
substance misuse. There were 70 deaths in
1998 in the UK. Of these, 34 were aged 15 to
19, accounting for one in 45 deaths in this age
group. The drug use survey among 11 to 15
year olds in England found that about 2 per
cent had used glue and a similar proportion
butane gas in 1999.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90 per cent of
the adult population. While the vast majority
drink sensibly and safely, alcohol misuse does
cause preventable illness and social problems,
and is a factor in many accidents. The latest
Department of Health guidelines are that
consistently drinking four or more units a day
for men or three or more units for women is
not advised, because of the progressive health
risks. In 1998-99, 38 per cent of adult males
and 21 per cent of adult females in Great
Britain consumed more than the advised
number of units of alcohol a day.
Part of the funds allocated to Health
Promotion England (see p. 189) is for
promoting sensible drinking in England, and
equivalent bodies are similarly funded in other
parts of Britain. ‘Drinkline’ provides
confidential telephone advice about alcohol
problems and services in England and Wales.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS includes in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and some specialised alcohol treatment units.
Primary care teams and voluntary
organisations providing treatment and
rehabilitation in hostels, day centres and
advisory services also play an important role.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
203
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
England, Alcohol Concern plays a prominent
role in improving services for problem
drinkers and their families; increasing public
awareness of alcohol misuse; and improving
training for professional and voluntary
workers. The Scottish Council on Alcohol has
a similar role in Scotland.
The Government is preparing a new strategy
to tackle alcohol misuse in England, for
publication later in 2000. Its broad aims are:
• to encourage people to drink sensibly in
line with guidance, so as to avoid alcohol-
related problems;
• to protect individuals and communities
from anti-social and criminal behaviour
related to alcohol misuse; and
• to provide services that enable people to
overcome their alcohol misuse problems.
In Scotland, developing a new strategy will
be the responsibility of the Scottish Advisory
Committee on Alcohol Misuse. A report,
Reducing Alcohol Related Harm in Northern
Ireland, was published in June 1999 and the
resulting strategy for the Province was
published in September 2000.
Communicable Diseases
Health authorities/health boards have a key
responsibility for prevention and control of
infectious disease, liaising closely with
colleagues in environmental health
departments of local authorities. They are
assisted by the Public Health Laboratory
Service, which aims to protect the population
from infection through the detection,
diagnosis, surveillance, prevention and control
of communicable diseases in England and
Wales. Similar facilities are provided in
Scotland by the Scottish Centre for Infection
and Environmental Health and, in Northern
Ireland, by the Communicable Disease
Surveillance Centre, the Northern Ireland
Public Health Laboratory and other hospital
microbiology laboratories.
Immunisation
Health authorities/health boards carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis, whooping
cough (pertussis) and haemophilus influenzae
type B infection (‘Hib’). The UK is the first
country in the world to use a new vaccine to
protect against meningitis Group C. This
vaccine was introduced into the immunisation
programme from November 1999, and the
programme is on schedule to immunise all
children under age 18 by the end of 2000. By
autumn 2000 the incidence of disease in the
age groups so far vaccinated had fallen by up
to 85 per cent.
Immunisation is not compulsory. Parents
are provided with information about the safety
and efficacy of vaccines and are encouraged to
have their children immunised. Immunisations
are mainly given by GPs and their practice
nurses. Annual immunisation rates for the UK
were 96 per cent for tetanus in 1998—99, 95 per
cent for diphtheria and polio, and 94 per cent
for whooping cough. The incidence of such
diseases in childhood is at its lowest ever level.
Since the introduction of the Hib vaccine in
1992, Hib meningitis has been almost
completely eliminated in young children.
Vaccination against influenza is
recommended for certain groups at increased
risk of serious illness from influenza. The
groups were extended in 1998-99 to include
all people aged 75 or over, and from 2000-01
to include everyone aged 65 or over.
HIV/AIDS
Although the UK has a relatively low prevalence
of HIV/AIDS as a result of sustained public
education and health campaigns, about 3,000
new infections are reported each year. The use
of combination drug therapy is delaying
disease progression, and mortality has fallen
substantially. HIV-related deaths are
estimated to have fallen by about two-thirds
from over 1,500 in 1994 to around 500 in 1999.
As a consequence, the number of individuals
within the population infected with HIV is
increasing. During 1999 over 19,000 individuals
were reported to have received HIV-related
treatment and care from statutory health
services. Anonymous surveillance data give an
estimated prevalence of HIV infection at just
under 30,000 at the end of 1998.
204
13: HEALTH SERVICES
HIV is more prevalent in London than
elsewhere in the UK, reflecting a higher
concentration of‘at risk’ groups. Within
Scotland prevalence is higher in Edinburgh
than elsewhere. Those most vulnerable to
HIV infection are homosexual/bisexual men,
injecting drug users and people from high
prevalence regions, for example sub-Saharan
Africa. Although the UK has not seen a
substantial spread of HIV to the heterosexual
population, the HIV prevalence in pregnant
women giving birth in London is relatively
high at one in 450 in 1998 (compared with one
in 6,550 in the rest of the UK).
The Government has introduced a range of
initiatives to encourage pregnant women to
have an HIV test as an integral part of their
antenatal care. Most HIV-infected pregnant
women accept measures to decrease the risk of
passing the infection to their babies. Health
authorities have a national objective to reduce
the number of children who acquire HIV from
their mothers by 80 per cent by 2002.
Government strategies to reduce HIV
transmission include:
• HIV/AIDS health promotion aimed at
both the general population and groups
at risk;
• information on antenatal HIV testing to
help pregnant women to reach informed
decisions, for example about ways of
reducing the risk of transmission to
babies; and
• the National AIDS Helpline, which
provides confidential information and
advice on all aspects of HIV and AIDS.
Tuberculosis
The UK has an excellent record of
tuberculosis (TB) control. Notifications of TB
in the UK have reached the relatively low
levels of around 6,500 cases a year, compared
with nearly 50,000 in 1950. This compares
with a low of 5,745 cases in 1987 but is still
well below the 1980 level of over 9,000. These
lower levels have been achieved and
maintained through an immunisation
programme, treatment of identified cases and
screening of their close contacts, screening and
treatment for immigrants from countries with
a high prevalence of TB and active
surveillance of TB. This success is against a
worldwide resurgence in TB that is having a
small but important impact on trends in the
UK. The Government has a two-pronged
approach to prevention and control of TB in
new immigrants to the UK: first to screen
those at highest risk at ports of entry, and then
to offer more detailed screening, including
skin testing, locally when they arrive at their
destination.
Eating Habits and Nutrition
Since the early 1970s there have been marked
changes in the British diet. One feature has
been the long-term rise in consumption of
poultry, while that of red meat (such as beef
and veal) has fallen. Consumption of fresh
fruit has increased since 1970, while
consumption of fresh green vegetables,
including cabbages, peas and beans, was lower
in 1999 than in 1970. In addition, the use of
convenience food—both frozen and ready
meals—has increased. Despite these changes,
the British diet is still noticeably different to
that in other countries such as those in the
Mediterranean, being relatively low in fruit,
vegetables and fish. However, there have been
important changes within these broad types of
food, so that mushrooms and salad vegetables
have superseded traditional vegetables, such as
swedes and parsnips. Health considerations
appear to have been influencing some aspects
of diet in recent years, for example, in the
long-term fall in red meat sales, and the
growth in low-fat spread consumption.
Features of the pattern of consumption in
1999 compared with 1998 included:
• household consumption of carcass beef and
veal was virtually the same as in both 1997
and 1998—lower than in 1995 but above
the long-term trend evident at that time;
• consumption of poultry, pork, and
mutton and lamb all fell slightly in 1999,
while frozen convenience meat and meat
products (including frozen ready meals)
rose by 8 per cent;
• a 2 per cent rise in consumption of fresh
vegetables in the home, the third annual

• margarine consumption declined by 23

respectively while wine consumption in
the home remained close to its 1998 level.
Energy intakes from food continued to
decline—to an average of 1,690 kilocalories
(kcal) in 1999, compared with 1,740 kcal in
1998. The percentage of food energy derived
from fat continued its long-term decline in
1999 and the proportion of food energy
derived from saturated fatty acids also fell.
Grams per person per week
The proportion of adults who are obese or
overweight has increased—in 1998, 21 per
cent of women and 17 per cent of men aged 16
and over in England were classified as obese,
compared with 8 per cent and 6 per cent
respectively in 1980 in Great Britain. The
likelihood of being overweight increases up to
the age of 65 and then declines at older ages.
The Committee on the Medical Aspects of
Food and Nutrition Policy published its report
Nutritional Aspects of the Development of Cancer
in 1998. It noted that research suggests that diet
might contribute to about one-third of all
cancers. Its main recommendations are
consistent with the Government’s healthy eating
advice to the effect that a healthy and balanced
diet is one which is varied and rich in fruit and
vegetables and dietary fibre. The report also
underlined the importance of maintaining a
healthy body weight throughout adult life.
The major supermarket groups and most
food manufacturers have introduced voluntary
labelling schemes indicating the energy, fat,
protein and carbohydrate content of food.
Nutrition labelling is compulsory on products
for which a nutritional claim is made.
The Department of Health is piloting ‘five
a day’ projects testing the feasibility of
changing fruit and vegetable consumption.
The results of these studies will form the
foundations of a general guidance pack

13: HEALTH SERVICES
A survey on diet and nutrition among
young people aged 4 to 18, carried out in
1997, was published in June 2000. It is part
of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey
programme, run jointly by the Food
Standards Agency and the Department of
Health. Among some of the findings:
• boys ate significantly larger average
amounts than girls, the most marked
differences being for pizza, white
bread, breakfast cereals, semi-
skimmed milk, bacon and ham,
sausages, baked beans and potato
chips. In contrast, girls consumed
significantly larger amounts of ‘other’
raw and salad vegetables, raw
tomatoes, and apples and pears;
• during the seven-day recording
period in the survey no citrus fruit
had been eaten by 76 per cent of boys
and 72 per cent of girls, while 61 per
cent of boys and 56 per cent of girls
had not eaten any leafy green
vegetables;
• 1 per cent of boys and 5 per cent of
girls reported that they were
vegetarian or vegan, although this was
10 per cent for girls aged 15 to 18;
• 2 per cent of boys and 6 per cent of
girls reported that they were dieting
to lose weight, rising to 16 per cent of
girls aged 15 to 18: and
• young people, particularly boys, in
households of lower socio-economic
status reported lower intakes than
average of energy, fat and most
vitamins and minerals.

The Scottish Diet Action Plan ‘Eating for
Health’ provides the framework for wide-
ranging action to tackle Scotland’s poor
health, with a particular focus on children and
young people. The most recent initiatives in
this area include fruit for infants, breakfast
clubs, and school fruit and salad bars.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health provides public health
protection through control of the physical
environment—atmospheric pollution and
noise; contaminated land, food and water;
waste management; housing; occupational
health and safety; communicable diseases; and
statutory nuisances. In the UK no single
government department is responsible for
environmental health as a whole, although the
DH advises other government departments
on the health implications of their policies.
Local authorities provide environmental
health services and employ professionally
trained environmental health officers,
concerned with inspection, health promotion
and regulation.
The Institute for Environment and Health,
established by the Medical Research Council
(see p. 441), is concerned mainly with research
and management of research into the hazards
to which people may be exposed through the
environment. In Scotland the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health
provides surveillance and advisory services on
environmental health matters.
DH, the National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland
Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety have established the National
Focus, a unit based in Cardiff, to co-ordinate
work on responses to chemical incidents and
surveillance of health effects of environmental
chemicals.
Accidents
In 1999 there were 235,000 road accidents
involving personal injury in Great Britain, and
there were over 3,400 deaths and nearly
317,000 injuries (see p. 363).
The Department of Trade and Industry
records home and leisure accidents needing
hospital treatment. Data for 1998 show that
every 6 hours one older person dies from an
accidental fall in the home. Altogether
1.1 million people in the UK go to a hospital
casualty department each year as a result of a fall
in the home. Around 33,000 people experience
falls from ladders each year, and burns from
barbecues are thought to affect 625 people.
207
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Food Safety
Under the Food Safety Act 1990, it is illegal to
sell or supply food that is unfit for human
consumption or falsely or misleadingly
labelled. The Act covers a broad range of
commercial activities related to food
production, to the sources from which it is
derived, such as crops and animals, and to
articles which come into contact with food.
There are also more detailed regulations,
which apply to all types of food and drink and
their ingredients. Local authorities are
responsible for enforcing food law in two main
areas: trading standards officers deal with the
labelling of food, its composition and most
cases of chemical contamination; and
environmental health officers deal with
hygiene, with cases of microbiological
contamination of foods, and with food which
is found to be unfit for human consumption.
The UK Food Standards Agency, which
began operating in April 2000, is
responsible for all aspects of food safety
and standards. The Agency will contribute
to the targets to reduce coronary heart
disease and stroke, and identify new ways
to help disadvantaged consumers to
improve their diets. It also sets and audits
standards for the enforcement of food law
by local authorities. An example of this is
the statutory scheme for licensing butchers’
shops throughout the UK, which will come
into force in autumn 2000.
CJD and Public Health
CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a rare
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in
humans. In 1996 the Government announced
that the National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh had identified a previously
unrecognised form of the disease, variant CJD
(vCJD).1 The Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC) concluded that
the most likely explanation, in the absence of
any credible alternative, was that these cases
1 Sometimes referred to as new variant CJD (nvCJD)
were linked to exposure to BSE (see p. 455)
before the introduction of the specified bovine
offal ban in 1989. In 1997 SEAC concluded
that the agent causing BSE is the same as that
causing vCJD. However, these results did not
provide information about the route of
infection. In light of the increased number of
cases of vCJD, the Committee has concluded
that vCJD is an acquired prion disease caused
by exposure to a BSE-like agent. Cases of
vCJD are increasing—there were 84 probable
and definite cases in 2000 up to 28 September,
compared with 83 in the whole of 1999.
To safeguard public health the
Government is providing additional funding
for research into CJD and BSE, including the
work carried out at the National CJD
Surveillance Unit which monitors the
incidence of the disease.
An independent public inquiry set up to
establish and review the history of the
emergence and identification of BSE and
vCJD in the UK reported in October 2000.
(See chapter 27 for details of government
measures to control the spread of BSE.)
Safety of Medicines
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued by the
European Medicines Evaluation Agency or the
Medicines Control Agency may be sold or
supplied to the public. Marketing
authorisations are issued following scientific
assessment on the basis of safety, quality and
efficacy.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European Economic
Area (EEA—see p. 79) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals
resident in a member state are entitled to
receive emergency treatment, either free or at
a reduced cost, during visits to other EEA
countries. Treatment is provided, in most
cases, on production of a valid Form El 11

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system. Instead, England and
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own systems, with considerable
differences in law, judicial procedure and court structure. There is, however,
substantial similarity on many points and a large volume of modern legislation,
including EC legislation, applies throughout the UK. In all three systems there
is a common distinction between criminal law and civil law.
Introduction
Criminal and Civil Law
Criminal law deals with wrongs affecting the
community for which a prosecution may be
brought in the criminal courts. Civil law is
about deciding disputes between two or more
parties—individuals, companies or other
organisations—and for providing a means of
legal scrutiny of the actions of public bodies.
The purpose of civil proceedings is not to
punish, but to obtain compensation or some
other appropriate remedy, although in
England and Wales the payment of damages
may sometimes have a punitive element.
The distinction between civil and criminal
matters is not precise. Courts may be classified
as criminal courts and civil courts, but in
England and Wales, and Northern Ireland,
magistrates’ courts have both a civil and a
criminal jurisdiction as have the sheriff courts
in Scotland. Conduct may amount to both a
civil and a criminal wrong. However, the court
of trial and the rules of procedure and
evidence will usually differ in civil and
criminal cases.
Sources of Law
Statutes passed by Parliament are the ultimate
source of law. There are no legal limits on
what may be done by Act of Parliament,
although a legal duty exists to comply with
European Community (EC) law. A statute
may also confer power on a minister, local
authority or other executive body to make
delegated legislation (see p. 49).
An Order made by a minister of the Crown
is the usual means of bringing a modern
statute into effect. The Order allows
provisions to become effective when practical.
Pilot schemes can be set up to test the
operation of statutory provisions. Changing
policies or circumstances may sometimes
mean that provisions are not brought into
effect, and may be repealed.
Many key areas of law have, over the
centuries, developed through the decisions of
210
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
the courts. This is known as common lam. The
doctrine of binding precedent means that
decisions of higher courts bind those courts
lower down in the court hierarchy. This
ensures consistency of judicial approach.
Judges give reasons for their decisions, and
principles of law are stated, developed and
modified. When the legality of government
action is being tested, a court will try to ensure
that it is not overstepping its proper role; it
should avoid examining the merits of the
particular action or policy being challenged.
European Sources
EC law, which applies in the UK as a member
of the European Union (see p. 71), derives
from the EC treaties, from the Community
legislation adopted under them, and from the
decisions of the European Court of Justice.
That court has the ultimate authority, under
the Treaty of Rome, to decide points of EC
law. Where a point arises before a British
court, it may refer the point of law to the
Court of Justice for it to decide. Sometimes a
court is obliged to make a reference to the
European Court.
The decisions of the Court of Justice do not
directly bind British courts, but the UK is
under treaty obligations to uphold EC law.
Consequently, British courts are obliged to
apply EC law, even at the expense of not
applying the provision of an Act of
Parliament. If a rule of statute or common law
is incompatible with Community law, it is
Community law that will be applied by a
British court.
European Convention on Human Rights
The European Convention on Human Rights
is an international treaty containing a
statement of some basic human rights, such as
right to life, prohibition of torture, right to a
fair trial, right to respect for family and
private life, freedom of expression and
freedom of assembly. Most Convention rights
can be limited by public authorities under
certain circumstances. Individual rights
sometimes have to be balanced against one
another or the wider public interest.
The Convention was ratified by the UK in
1951, but not incorporated into UK domestic
law. However, the judgments of the European
Court of Human Rights have been binding in
international law on the UK, and successive
governments have responded to adverse
findings by amending domestic law or practice
where necessary.
The Human Rights Act 1998, taking full
effect on 2 October 2000, requires all public
authorities, including courts of law, to act in
accordance with the Convention rights (unless
an Act of Parliament leaves no choice). It
enables individuals to rely on those rights in
any legal proceedings and to bring a claim
against a public authority which has acted
incompatibly with those rights. The Act
requires a court to give effect to legislation, as
far as possible, in a way that is compatible with
Convention rights. A court cannot declare
invalid an Act of Parliament which is
incompatible with the Convention, but the
higher courts may make a declaration of
incompatibility. It will be up to Parliament to
decide what action to take, if any, following
such a declaration.
The Convention is already in force in
Scotland in respect of all Acts of the Scottish
Parliament.
Personnel of the Law
The law is enforced by judicial officers,
ranging from judges in the House of Lords
and the superior courts to stipendiary and lay
justices who, together with juries in certain
cases, are responsible for deciding disputed
cases. The law also depends on officers of the
court who have general or specialised
functions of an administrative, and sometimes
of a judicial, nature in the courts to which they
are attached.
Judges are legally qualified, being appointed
from the ranks of practising barristers and
advocates or solicitors. They have
independence of office, and can be removed
only in rare and limited circumstances
involving misconduct or incapacity. They are
not subject to ministerial control or direction.
Lay magistrates in England and Wales, and
justices of the peace in Scotland, are trained in
order to give them sufficient knowledge of the
211
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
law, including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing. There are
over 30,000 lay magistrates and 90
stipendiary—legally qualified and salaried—
magistrates in England and Wales, and 4,000
justices of the peace in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland there are 17 resident magistrates
(drawn from practising solicitors or barristers,
with powers similar to those of stipendiary
magistrates) and 21 deputy (part-time)
magistrates. Although people are free to
conduct their own cases if they so wish,
barristers (in Scotland, advocates) and
solicitors, or other authorised litigators,
generally represent the interests of parties to a
dispute. There are over 10,000 practising
barristers in England and Wales and around
80,000 practising solicitors. Scotland has over
400 practising advocates and some 8,250
solicitors; in Northern Ireland there are about
450 barristers. Barristers practise as
individuals, but join a group of other
barristers, in Chambers. Advocates in
Scotland practise as individuals; they do not
operate from Chambers and work
independently of each other. Solicitors usually
operate in partnership with other solicitors,
unless employed. Large firms of solicitors will
comprise not only qualified staff, but also legal
executives and support staff. Certain legal
functions may be performed by non-lawyers—
licensed conveyancers (qualified conveyancers
in Scotland) can act in conveyancing matters
(the transfer of interests in land).
Traditionally, rights of audience in the
higher courts—the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, House of Lords, Court of
Appeal, High Court and Crown Court, High
Court of Justiciary (Scotland) and Court of
Session (Scotland)—have mostly been limited
to barristers and advocates, who are regarded
as specialist court pleaders. However,
legislation in 1990 opened the door for other
professional bodies to apply to become
authorised to grant their members rights of
audience in the higher courts. In 1993 it
became possible for solicitors in private
practice to obtain the same rights of audience
as barristers and advocates. In 1999 the
Institute of Legal Executives and the
Chartered Institute of Patent Agents were
authorised to grant rights of audience to their
members. The Access to Justice Act 1999 (not
applicable in Scotland) established the
principle that all barristers and solicitors
should acquire full rights of audience on call
to the Bar or admission to the Roll. It also
extended the ability for employed barristers
and solicitors to acquire rights of audience in
the higher courts, to which they had
previously been excluded.
The two branches of the profession have
separate professional bodies: the Bar Council
for barristers (in Scotland, the Faculty of
Advocates); and the Law Society of England
and Wales, Law Society of Scotland and Law
Society of Northern Ireland for solicitors. The
profession is self-regulating, with the
professional bodies exercising disciplinary
control over their members.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for
England and Wales oversees the way in which
relevant professional bodies handle complaints
about barristers, solicitors, legal executives,
licensed conveyancers and patent agents. The
Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman performs
a similar task. In Northern Ireland there is a
Lay Observer with somewhat lesser powers.
Crime in the UK
Crime Statistics
There are two main measures of the scale of
crime in the UK: the recording of crimes by
the police, and periodic surveys which ask
representative samples of the population about
their experiences of crime.
Recorded Crime
In the year ended March 2000 in England and
Wales:
• overall recorded crime totalled 5.3
million offences, representing an increase
of 3.8 per cent over the previous 12
months (see Table 14.1);
• the overall clear-up rate was 25 per cent;
• about 83 per cent of offences recorded by
the police were against property, while 13
per cent involved violence; and

preceding year, regardless of whether or not
they reported the incident to the police. The
survey therefore provides a measure of those
crimes not reported to, or recorded by, the
police. 'The latest BCS, published in October
2000, estimated that there were 14.7 million
crimes in 1999, 10 per cent lower than in 1997.
Burglary was down 21 per cent from 1997 (to
its lowest level since 1991) and theft of
vehicles decreased by 11 per cent from its
1997 level. The number of violent crimes fell
by 4 per cent. The proportion of people who
were victims of some type of crime once or
more during 1999 fell from 34 to 30 per cent.
The 1996 Scottish Crime Survey estimated
that just under 1 million crimes were
committed against individuals and private
households in Scotland during 1995. This was
8 per cent fewer than the number estimated in
the 1993 survey.
Crime Reduction
Notifiable offences recorded by the police
broadly cover the more serious offences. In
1998 the Government amended the way
notifiable offences are recorded in England
and Wales, changing the counting rules so that
the number of crimes corresponds more
closely to the number of victims. In 1999 there
was a change in the way clear-ups are counted,
with some circumstances no longer qualifying
as clear-ups.
In Scotland there were 436,000 crimes
recorded by the police in 1999, an increase of
1 per cent compared with 1998. The overall
crime clear-up rate was 43 per cent.
Recorded crime in Northern Ireland in
1999-2000 totalled 119,000 offences. About
71 per cent of recorded offences were against
property. The overall clear-up rate was 30 per
cent.
Principal Crime Surveys
The British Crime Survey (BCS) is a large
household survey first conducted in 1982,
which has a sample representative of people
aged 16 and over in private households in
England and Wales. The BCS asks
respondents whether they have experienced
certain personal and household crimes in the
Within the Home Office, the Crime
Reduction Unit aims to encourage and
develop strategies and tactics to reduce crime.
The Unit supports the police crime reduction
effort through its Crime Prevention College
(in North Yorkshire), which is the national
centre for training police officers in
prevention skills. Since April 2000 every
police authority and crime and disorder
reduction partnership (see p. 214) has been
asked to set five-year targets for the reduction
of two key offences—vehicle crime and
domestic burglary—and five metropolitan
forces have been set the additional target of
reducing street robberies.
Crime reduction initiatives include:
• a £250 million Crime Reduction
Programme, announced in 1998, which
focuses on reducing burglary and
promoting targeted policing;
• a £150 million investment in closed-
circuit television (CCTV) surveillance
systems in public areas such as housing
estates, shopping centres, railway stations
and car parks;
• Neighbourhood Watch schemes, in which
residents look out for suspicious activity in
their area and inform the police;
213
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• crime reduction action teams, which
meet regularly to examine crime
problems in their area and to suggest
practical solutions;
• youth action groups, encouraging young
people to tackle problems relevant to
them—for example bullying, vandalism
or drug misuse; and
• partnerships set up under the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998, which bring together
the police, local authorities and other
relevant agencies to develop strategies for
dealing with local crime problems.
The Scottish Crime Prevention Council
has been disbanded and will be replaced by the
Scottish Community Safety Forum. In Northern
Ireland, there is a Crime Prevention Panel.
Crime and Disorder Act 1998
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 has created
a framework that aims to keep individuals,
particularly young offenders, out of the
criminal justice system, and to ensure timely
action to prevent reoffending. Particular
emphasis is placed on preventing offending
behaviour by persons under 18 (see p. 223).
The Act requires police services and local
authorities in England and Wales to develop
statutory partnerships for crime prevention
and the promotion of community safety. The
partnerships must examine local levels of
crime and disorder, consult local people and
then set targets for tackling the problems that
have been identified. The statutory provisions
do not, however, apply to Scotland, where
police forces and local authorities already
enter into such partnerships.
Prohibitive anti-social behaviour orders
(ASBOs) may be applied to individuals or
groups whose threatening and disruptive
conduct harasses the local community.
Anyone in breach of such an order is guilty of
a criminal offence. The Act also empowers the
courts to grant an order against convicted sex
offenders, prohibiting behaviour which causes
concern for public safety (for example,
loitering near schools). Anti-social behaviour
orders and sex offender orders are applicable
throughout the UK. By September 2000,
around 50 ASBOs had been issued.
Helping Victims and Witnesses
In England and Wales a government-funded
organisation, Victim Support, provides
practical help and emotional support to
victims of crime with the help of 16,000
volunteers. It also runs the Witness Service,
which advises victims and other witnesses
attending Crown Court centres (and is
developing similar services in magistrates’
courts). Victim Support Scotland provides a
volunteer-based service similar to that
provided by Victim Support in England and
Wales. A separate scheme operates in
Northern Ireland.
In 1998 the Government published a
report—Speaking up for Justice—on
improving the treatment of witnesses
(including children) who become involved in
the criminal justice system in England and
Wales. Twenty-six of the report’s
recommendations required statutory force and
were included in the Youth Justice and
Criminal Evidence Act 1999. The
implementation plan includes:
• pagers for intimidated witnesses so that
they do not have to wait at court buildings
in the same room as the defendant
(introduced at the end of 1999);
• a ban on the cross-examination of victims
of rape and serious sexual assault by
unrepresented defendants, and greater
restrictions on questioning a rape victim
about their sexual history (introduced in
April 2000);
• video-recorded evidence, live CCTV
links, screens and communication aids
for adult and child witnesses likely to be
distressed by facing the defendant in
court (to be introduced by the end of
2000 in the Crown Court); and
• new measures to help child and adult
witnesses including video-recorded
pre-trial cross-examination, and
intermediaries to help them give evidence
and understand questioning.
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland may be eligible
for compensation from public funds under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In
Northern Ireland there are separate statutory
214
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
arrangements for compensation for criminal
injuries, and for malicious damage to property.
Drug Misuse
In 1998 there were around 140,000 seizures of
illegal drugs in the UK, and a similar number
of drug-related offences. The Government’s
UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator was appointed
in that year to co-ordinate the fight against
illegal drugs and draw up a national strategy
(Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain). This
cross-government strategy—focusing mainly
on England, but reflecting the UK and
international dimension of the problem—has
four main elements:
• helping young people resist drug misuse
in order to achieve their full potential in
society;
• protecting communities from drug-
related anti-social and criminal
behaviour;
• enabling people to overcome drug
problems through treatment; and
• stifling the availability of illegal drugs on
the streets.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998
introduced drug treatment and testing orders,
targeted at persistent offenders (aged 16 and
over) with drug problems who show a
willingness to co-operate with treatment. The
orders are coming into effect across England
and Wales from October 2000.
The Drugs Prevention Advisory Service
(DPAS) was launched in April 1999 to
promote community-based drugs prevention
at local, regional and national level in line with
the objectives of the Government’s national
strategy. In particular, the DPAS provides
information, advice and support to local Drug
Action 1 earns (the bodies charged with local
implementation of the national strategy) to
encourage good drugs prevention practice
based on available and emerging evidence, and
promotes consistent and coherent prevention
policy across Government. DPAS teams have
been established in each of the nine
Government Regions in England.
In an effort to reduce the availability of
drugs in Scotland and to target organised drug
crime, the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency
was launched in June 2000.
Countering Terrorism
In the light of serious terrorist attacks that
have taken place in the UK, it has been the
Government’s view that the ordinary
criminal law is not sufficient to deal with
terrorism effectively. The law has been
supplemented by the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (PTA) and
successive Northern Ireland (Emergency
Provisions) Acts (EPA), and more recently
amended and reinforced by the Criminal
Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998
(see below).
The PTA has a UK-wide application while
the EPA applies only in Northern Ireland.
Both Acts are temporary and must be renewed
by Parliament each year. They are intended to
strike a balance between providing powers that
are necessary to protect the public and
safeguarding the rights of individuals. They
give the security forces wider powers to
question and arrest people suspected of
involvement in terrorism and to search
property, including vehicles.
The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and
Conspiracy) Act 1998 aimed to underpin the
Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland
(see p. 16) by making it easier to secure the
conviction of members of proscribed
organisations which are not observing a
complete and unequivocal ceasefire. It also
made it an offence to conspire in the UK to
commit terrorist or other serious offences in
another country.
With the aim of rationalising these
arrangements, the Terrorism Act 2000 is
introducing permanent UK-wide counter¬
terrorism legislation, providing for:
• the adoption of a new definition of
terrorism (including ideological and
religious motivation for terrorist acts)
which would extend to domestic as well
as Irish and international terrorism;
• a new offence of inciting terrorist acts
abroad from within the UK;
• stronger powers for dealing with terrorist
fund-raising;
215
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• a new judicial authority to consider
applications for extensions of detention
of terrorist suspects; and
• a review of the provisions of the Criminal
Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act
1998.
Exclusion order powers under the current
legislation are not carried forward into the new
legislation.
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act 2000 provides for the closer regulation
of telephone tapping, surveillance and
encryption (decoding e-mail messages)
activities carried out by law enforcement
agencies. One of the aims of the Act is to
ensure that law enforcement operations are
consistent with the duties imposed on
public authorities by the European
Convention on Human Rights and the
Human Rights Act 1998.
Police Service
Government ministers, together with police
authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for providing an effective and
efficient police service in the UK.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces organised on a local
basis—43 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland and one (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary—RUC) in Northern Ireland. The
Metropolitan Police Service and the City of
London force are responsible for policing
London.
Police strength in England and Wales is
about 124,400 (of which the Metropolitan
Police numbers around 25,500). There are
some 14,700 officers in Scotland and 8,400
(plus 3,800 reserves) in the RUC. Each force in
Great Britain has volunteer special constables
who perform police duties in their spare time,
without pay, acting in support of regular
officers. They number about 20,000 in all.
Policing in Northern Ireland is undergoing
considerable change as a result of a report
by the independent Patten Commission.
This was set up under the terms of the
Good Friday Agreement of April 1998.
The Patten Commission reported in
September 1999 and, in accepting the
report, the Government brought forward a
Police Bill to implement changes which
will require a change in law (see p. 20).
Other non-statutory administrative and
structural changes to policing are already
under way.
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by local police authorities. In the 41
police areas outside London, they normally
have 17 members—nine locally elected
councillors, three magistrates and five
independent members. In July 2000 the Home
Secretary’s duties as the police authority for the
Metropolitan Police District were assumed by a
new Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), the
majority of whose 23 members are elected
representatives from the London Assembly.
For the City of London Police Area, the
authority is the Common Council of the
Corporation of London. Police authorities, in
consultation with the chief constables and local
community, set local policing objectives, while
the Government sets key objectives for the
police as a whole. The police authorities in
Scotland are composed of elected councillors.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
appoints the Police Authority (although a new
Policing Board is due to replace the Authority
in 2001 as part of the Patten reforms).
Police forces are headed by chief constables
(in London the Commissioner of the City of
London Police, and the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police), appointed by their police
authorities with government approval. They are
responsible for the direction and control of their
forces and for the appointment, promotion and
discipline of all ranks below assistant chief
constable. On matters of efficiency they are
generally answerable to their police authorities.
Independent inspectors of constabulary
report on the efficiency and effectiveness of
police forces.
216
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
National Crime Bodies
The National Criminal Intelligence Service
(NCIS), which was put on an independent
statutory footing in 1998, has the leading role
in collecting and analysing criminal
intelligence for use by police forces and other
law enforcement agencies in the UK. It has a
headquarters and south-east regional office in
London, five other regional offices in England
and offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
NCIS co-ordinates the activities of the
Security Services in support of the law
enforcement agencies against organised crime,
and liaises with the International Criminal
Police Organisation (INTERPOL), which
promotes international co-operation between
police forces. It also provides the channel for
communication between the UK and
EUROPOL (see p. 90).
In 1998 a National Crime Squad, with 1,400
officers, replaced six regional crime squads in
England and Wales. Its role is to prevent and
detect organised and serious crime across police
force and national boundaries and to support
provincial forces in their investigation of
serious crime. The Scottish Crime Squad
performs the same function in Scotland.
Forensic Science Service (FSS)
The FSS, a Home Office executive agency,
provides scientific support in the investigation of
crime to police forces in England and Wales
through six regional laboratories. It also operates
the national DNA database, which provides
intelligence information to police forces by
matching DNA profiles taken from suspects to
profiles from samples left at the scenes of crime.
In Scotland forensic science services are
provided by forces’ own laboratories.
Northern Ireland has its own laboratory.
Powers and Procedures
England and Wales
Police powers and procedures are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of
practice. Evidence obtained in breach of the
codes may be ruled inadmissible in court. The
codes must be accessible in all police stations.
• Stop and search—Police officers can stop
and search people and vehicles if they
reasonably suspect that they will find stolen
goods, offensive weapons or implements
that could be used for burglary and other
offences. An officer must record the
grounds for the search, and anything
found, and the person stopped is entitled to
a copy of the officer’s report.
• Arrest—The police may arrest a suspect
on a warrant issued by a court, but can
arrest without warrant for arrestable
offences (for which the sentence is fixed
by law or for which the term of
imprisonment is five years or more). This
category includes serious arrestable
offences such as murder and rape. There
is a general power of arrest for all other
offences if it is inappropriate to proceed
by way of a court summons, or if an
officer believes a suspect may injure
someone else or damage property.
• Detention and questioning—Suspects must
be cautioned before the police can ask
any questions about an offence. They
must be told that they do not have to say
anything, but that anything they do say
may be given in evidence in court, and
that it may be harmful to their defence if
they fail to mention something during
questioning which they later rely on in
court. For arrestable offences, a suspect
can be detained in police custody without
charge for up to 24 hours. Someone
suspected of a serious arrestable offence
can be held for up to 96 hours, but not
beyond 36 hours unless a warrant is
obtained from a magistrates’ court.
If someone thinks that his or her
detention is unlawful, he or she may
apply to the High Court for a writ of
habeas corpus against the person
responsible, requiring them to appear
before the court to justify the detention.
Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others.
• Charging—Once there is sufficient
evidence, the police have to decide
whether a detained person should be
charged with an offence. If the police
institute criminal proceedings against a
217
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
suspect, the CPS (see p. 220) then takes
control of the case.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
The police in Scotland can arrest someone
without a warrant, under wide common law
powers, if suspects are seen or reported as
committing a crime or are a danger to
themselves or others. They also have specific
statutory powers of arrest for some offences.
In other cases they may apply to a justice of
the peace for a warrant. As in England and
Wales, Scottish police have powers to enter a
building without a warrant if they are
pursuing someone who has committed, or
attempted to commit, a serious crime. A court
can grant the police a warrant to search
premises for stated items in connection with a
crime, again as in England and Wales. The
police may search anyone suspected of
carrying an offensive weapon. Someone
suspected of an imprisonable offence may be
held for police questioning without being
arrested, but for no more than six hours
without being charged. If arrested, suspects
must be charged and cautioned. The case is
then referred to the procurator fiscal (see
p. 227).
The law in Northern Ireland relating to
police powers in the investigation of crime and
to evidence in criminal proceedings is similar
to that in force in England and Wales.
Firearms
The policy in Great Britain is that the police
should not generally be armed but that there
should be specialist firearms officers, deployed
on the authority of a senior officer where an
operational need arises. In 1998-99 there were
over 11,000 operations in Great Britain where
firearms were issued to the police. Most forces
operate armed response vehicles to contain
firearms incidents. In Northern Ireland police
officers are issued with firearms for their
personal protection.
Police Discipline
An officer may be prosecuted if suspected of a
criminal offence. Officers are also subject to a
code of conduct. If found guilty of breaching
the code, an officer can be dismissed.
Revised conduct and efficiency
arrangements for England and Wales came
into effect in April 1999. The main changes
include introducing the civil standard of proof
at disciplinary hearings; a fast-track procedure
to deal with officers caught committing
serious criminal offences; and separate formal
procedures (for the first time) for dealing with
unsatisfactory performance.
Complaints
Members of the public can make complaints
against the police if they feel that they have
been treated unfairly or improperly. In
England and Wales the investigation of such
complaints by the force concerned is overseen,
or in more serious cases supervised, by the
Police Complaints Authority. In 1998-99 over
30,000 complaints were handled by the
Authority, less than 3 per cent of which were
substantiated. In Scotland complaints of
misconduct against police officers are overseen
by chief constables. Police authorities have
statutory responsibility for dealing with
complaints against chief officers. Allegations
of criminal misconduct are referred to the
procurator fiscal for investigation. HM
Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland also
considers representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have
handled their complaints. In Northern Ireland
the Independent Commission for Police
Complaints has been superseded by a Police
Ombudsman.
Community Relations
Within every police authority there are
police/community liaison consultative
arrangements, involving representatives from
the police, local government and community
groups. Home Office and police service
initiatives have sought to ensure that racist
crime is treated as a police priority.
The need to recruit more members of the
ethnic minorities to the police service, and
retain them, has been recognised. In England
and Wales there are about 2,570 officers from
ethnic minorities (2 per cent of police
218
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
numbers in England and Wales). The
corresponding figure for Scotland is about 50
(less than 1 per cent of police numbers). In
April 1999 the Government set new targets for
the number of ethnic minority officers in
England and Wales (with the basic aim of
achieving a similar proportion of ethnic
minority officers to that of the population in a
particular police force area).
Dealing with Racism
In March 1999 the Government announced an
action plan to take forward the
recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence
inquiry1 to restore confidence in policing and
counter racism in England and Wales. By
mid-2000 measures being introduced to that
end included:
• an extension of the race relations
legislation—through the Race Relations
(Amendment) Bill, currently before
Parliament—which would make direct and
indirect discrimination in all public
authorities unlawful, and place a duty on
public authorities to promote race equality;
• citizenship classes in schools, to be
introduced into the National Curriculum
(see p. 126) in 2002, to ensure that pupils
are taught about the cultural diversity of
Britain;
• the setting of targets for the recruitment
and retention of ethnic minorities in the
Civil Service and other public bodies;
• the introduction of specific criminal
offences of racially aggravated violence,
harassment and criminal damage; and
• a programme of research into the use by
the police of their powers to stop and
search people (with the aim of ensuring
these powers are used fairly).
1 In 1993 a young black student, Stephen Lawrence, was
murdered in a racist attack in south-east London. Concerns
about inadequacies in the investigation of the case by the
Metropolitan Police Service led ultimately to an official
inquiry, which reported in February 1999. The report was
critical, with some exceptions, of police conduct, claiming
there was a combination of professional incompetence,
institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior
officers.
In July 1999 the Scottish Executive
published a separate action plan to implement
the recommendations of the inquiry in
Scotland.
Legal System of England
and Wales
Responsibility for the administration and
management of the English legal system is
divided between various government
departments and agencies.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and sits as a member of the judicial
committee of the House of Lords. He also
presides over the House of Lords in its
legislative capacity, and is a senior Cabinet
minister heading a government department.
The Lord Chancellor’s Department has
overall responsibility (exercised through the
Court Service) for the court system, including
the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of
Appeal, High Court and Crown Court) and
the county courts in England and Wales. The
Lord Chancellor advises the Crown on the
appointment of most members of the higher
judiciary, and appoints most magistrates. In
addition, he has responsibility for the civil
justice process, for promoting general reforms
of the civil law and for the legal aid
arrangements.
The Home Secretary has overall
responsibility for criminal law, the police
service, the prison system, the probation
service, and for advising the Crown on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy.
The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers, providing advice on a range of legal
matters, including proposed legislation. They
may represent the Crown in appropriate
domestic and international cases of difficulty
or public importance, although do not always
do so. As well as exercising various civil law
functions, the Attorney-General has final
responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.
The Solicitor-General is the Attorney-
General’s deputy.
The Crown Prosecution Service is headed
by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP),
who is accountable to the Attorney-General.
219
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Structure of the Courts in England and Wales
Other prosecuting authorities include the
Serious Fraud Office, which answers to the
Attorney-General, and bodies such as the
Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise
Commissioners, local authorities and trading
standards departments which prosecute cases
within their own sphere of activity. Private
prosecutions by individuals are permitted in
respect of most crimes, but some require the
consent of the Attorney-General and they may
be taken over by the DPP.
Some administrative functions are
performed by senior members of the judiciary:
the Lord Chief Justice,2 for example, has some
responsibilities for the organisation and work
of the criminal courts. Other functions are
performed by statutory committees. The Civil
Procedure Rules Committee, created by the
Civil Procedure Act 1997, is responsible for
making rules that govern the civil justice
process, and comprises members of the
judiciary, members of the legal profession and
lay representatives.
Responsibility for the management of
functions often lies with executive bodies or
agencies. Examples include the Prison
Service, the Forensic Science Service, and the
Youth Justice Board.
The Government is advised by a range of
bodies of a statutory and non-statutory nature.
These include the police inspectorates, the
magistrates’ courts service, the probation
service, the Audit Commission, the Criminal
Justice Consultative Committee, law reform
bodies such as the Law Commission and ad
hoc Royal Commissions and departmental
committees.

and Wales who have been charged with a
criminal offence. It works closely with the
police, but is an independent body. With
headquarters in London and York, the service
operates under a structure (introduced in
April 1999) of 42 geographical Areas in
England and Wales. The Areas correspond to
the 43 police forces in England and Wales,
with the CPS London Area covering the
operational boundaries of both City of London
and Metropolitan Police Forces. Each Area is
headed by a Chief Crown Prosecutor (CCP),
who is responsible for prosecutions within the
Area, supported by an Area Business
Manager. The CPS:
• advises the police on possible
prosecutions;
• reviews prosecutions started by the police
to ensure that the right defendants are
prosecuted on the right charges before
the appropriate court;
• prepares cases for court; and
• prosecutes cases at magistrates’ courts
and instructs counsel to prosecute cases
in the Crown Court and higher courts.3
The decision by the CPS on whether or not
to go ahead with a case is based on two
criteria. Crown Prosecutors must be satisfied
that there is enough evidence to provide a
realistic prospect of conviction against each
defendant on each charge. If there is enough
evidence, prosecutors must then decide
whether a prosecution is in the public interest.
A prosecution will usually take place unless
there are public interest factors against it
clearly outweighing those in favour.
Serious Fraud Office
Cases of serious or complex fraud are
prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office.
Investigations are conducted by teams of
lawyers, accountants, police officers and other
specialists. The Office has wide powers that
go beyond those normally available to the
police and prosecuting authorities.
Initial Stages
For minor offences, the police may decide to
caution the offender rather than prosecute. A
caution does not amount to a conviction, and
will not take place unless the person admits
the offence. Under the Crime and Disorder
Act 1998, cautioning for young offenders is
being replaced with the final warning scheme
(see p. 224).
If the police decide to charge a person, that
person may be released on bail to attend a
magistrates’ court. If not granted police bail,
the defendant must be brought before a
magistrates’ court (or, if under 18, a youth
court) as soon as possible. There is a general
right to bail, but magistrates may withhold
bail if there are grounds for believing that an
accused person would abscond, commit an
offence, or otherwise obstruct justice. If bail is
refused, an accused has the right to apply
again, subject to certain limitations, to the
Crown Court or to a High Court judge. In
certain circumstances, the prosecution may
appeal to a Crown Court judge against the
granting of bail by magistrates.
Once a person has been charged, it is for the
CPS to decide whether the case should proceed.
Criminal Courts
Criminal offences are divided into: summary
offences, which are the least serious and are
triable only in a magistrates’ court; and
indictable ones, which are subdivided into
‘indictable-only’ offences (such as murder,
manslaughter or robbery) which must be tried
on indictment4 at the Crown Court by judge
and jury, and either-way offences, which may
be tried either summarily or on indictment.
Either-way offences, such as theft and burglary,
can vary greatly in seriousness. A magistrates’
court decides whether an either-way case is
serious enough to warrant trial in the Crown
Court, but if the magistrates decide in favour of
summary trial, the accused person can elect to
have trial by jury in the Crown Court (although
this right would be abolished under legislation
currently before Parliament—see p. 222).
3 Under a change in legal rules, a number of CPS lawyers
are now qualified to appear in some cases in the Crown
Court and other higher courts.
221
4 An indictment is a written accusation against a person,
charging him or her with serious crime triable by jury.
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Where a case is to be tried on indictment,
the magistrates’ court must be satisfied that
there is a case to answer. In most cases this is
accepted by the defence and the magistrates
do not need to consider the evidence. If the
defence challenges the case, the magistrates
consider the documentary evidence: no
witnesses are called to give evidence. If there
is a case to be answered, the accused is
committed for trial.
A magistrates’ court usually comprises
three lay magistrates, known as justices of the
peace (JPs), who sit with a court clerk to
advise them on law and procedure. In some
areas a stipendiary (paid professional)
magistrate sits instead of the JPs. Stipendiary
magistrates are becoming increasingly
common, although most cases are still dealt
with by lay magistrates.
Responsibility for running the magistrates’
courts service locally rests with magistrates’
courts committees (MCCs), made up of lay
magistrates selected by their colleagues. The
number of MCCs is being reduced, and their
areas increased, to improve efficiency and to
bring their boundaries into closer alignment
with those of other criminal justice agencies,
such as the police and CPS.
Youth courts are specialist magistrates’
courts, which sit separately from those dealing
with adults. They deal with all but the most
serious charges against people aged at least ten
(the age of criminal responsibility) and under
18. JPs who have been specially trained sit in
youth courts. Proceedings are held in private.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues,
in six regional areas called circuits, and is
In 1998 nearly 2 million defendants were
dealt with at magistrates’ courts, while
100,000 were dealt with in the Crown
Court. The Government is proposing to
transfer the decision on mode of trial in
either-way offences from the defendant to
the court. The Criminal Justice (Mode of
Trial) Bill sought to provide that the
decision where either-way cases are heard
should rest with the courts, and that the
defendant’s right to elect Crown Court trial
should be removed. In September 2000 this
Bill was rejected by the House of Lords.
presided over by High Court judges, circuit
judges and part-time recorders. The type of
judge who will preside over a case, with a jury
of 12 members of the public, will depend on
which Crown Court the case is being heard in:
not all Crown Courts deal with cases of the
same level of seriousness.
An independent review of the practices and
procedures of, and the rules of evidence
applied by, the criminal courts in England and
Wales was announced by the Lord Chancellor
in December 1999. The review is expected to
report around the end of 2000.
Trial
Criminal trials have two parties: the
prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved beyond reasonable
doubt by the prosecution. Accused people
have a right at all stages to remain silent;
however, an adverse inference may be drawn
from their failure to mention facts when
questioned which they later rely upon in their
defence. There are rules governing the pre¬
trial disclosure of material by both the
prosecution and the defence. A judge may, in
a case to be tried on indictment, hold a
preliminary hearing, where pleas of guilty or
not guilty are taken. If the defendant pleads
guilty the judge will proceed to sentence. In
contested cases, the prosecution and defence
are expected to help the judge in identifying
key issues, and to provide any additional
information required for the proper and
efficient trial of the case.
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court. The burden of proof is on the
prosecution, and strict rules of evidence
govern how matters may be proved. Certain
types of evidence may be excluded because of
their prejudicial effect, or because of their
unreliability. Documentary statements by
witnesses are allowed with the consent of the
other party or in limited circumstances at the
discretion of the court. Otherwise evidence is
taken from witnesses testifying orally on oath.
Child witnesses may testify without taking the
oath and their evidence must be received by
the court unless the child is incapable of
giving intelligible testimony. A child in some
222
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
circumstances can testify through a live TV
link, and the court may consider a video-
recorded interview as the evidence of the
child, subject to the defence having the right
to question the child in cross-examination.
Further measures to help both child witnesses
and adult vulnerable or intimidated witnesses
to give their best evidence in court are being
introduced under the Youth Justice and
Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (see p. 225).
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the case to the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
The jury verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not
guilty’, the latter resulting in acquittal. Juries
may, subject to certain conditions, reach a
verdict by a majority of at least 10-2.
If an accused person is acquitted, there is
no right of prosecution appeal, and the
accused cannot be tried again for that same
offence. However, an acquittal may be set
aside and a retrial ordered if the acquittal has
been tainted by a conviction for interfering
with or intimidating a juror.
A jury is independent of the judiciary and
any attempt to interfere with its members is a
criminal offence. People aged between 18 and
70 whose names appear on the electoral
register are, with certain exceptions, liable for
jury service; they are chosen at random.
Sentencing
T he court will sentence the offender after
considering all the relevant information,
which may include a pre-sentence report and
any other necessary specialist report, and a
plea in mitigation by a defence advocate. The
powers of the magistrates’ court in respect of
sentence are limited to a maximum period of
six months’ imprisonment. The offender may
be sent to the Crown Court for sentence if the
magistrates feel their powers of sentence are
insufficient.
A custodial sentence can be imposed only
where the offence is so serious that a custodial
sentence alone is justified. In 1998, 7 per cent
ot males and 3 per cent of females found guilty
of all offences received a custodial sentence. A
term of up to two years’ imprisonment may be
suspended. Courts are required to impose
minimum three-year sentences on offenders
convicted of a third offence of domestic
burglary. A second serious violent or sexual
offence requires a court to impose a life
sentence unless there are exceptional
circumstances. Life imprisonment is the
mandatory sentence for murder, and is
available for certain other serious offences.
Community sentences may include
probation orders (involving supervision in the
community—see p. 231); community service
orders (unpaid work within the community);
combination orders (elements of both
probation supervision and community service
work); curfew orders (requiring the offender
to remain at a specified place for specified
periods, usually monitored by electronic
tagging); and drug treatment and testing
orders. Punishment for breach of community
orders is under review.
A fine is the most common punishment,
with most offenders fined for summary
offences. A court may also impose
compensation orders, which require the
offender to pay compensation for personal
injury, loss or damage resulting from an
offence; or impose a conditional discharge,
whereby the offender may be resentenced for
the original offence if the discharge is broken
by reoffending.
In May 2000 the Government announced a
review of the legal framework for sentencing
and its impact on reducing reoffending. The
review will explore the possibility of introducing
more flexible sentencing options which link up
custodial and community penalties.
Young Offenders
Offenders aged ten to 17 years come within
the jurisdiction of youth courts, but may also
be tried in an adult magistrates’ court or in a
Crown Court, depending on the nature of the
offence.
Custodial sentences are available to the
courts where no alternative is considered
appropriate. The main custodial sentence for
those aged 15 and over is currently detention
in a young offender institution. Remission of

part of the sentence for good behaviour,
release on parole and supervision on release
are available. A secure training order may be
given to those persistent offenders aged 12 to
14 who fulfil certain strict criteria.
Non-custodial penalties include:
conditional discharge; fines and compensation
orders (where the parents of offenders may be
ordered to pay); supervision orders (where the
offender would have to comply with certain
requirements, which might include a stay in
local authority accommodation); and
attendance centre orders. Those aged 16 or 17
may also be given the same probation,
community service, combination and curfew
orders as older offenders.
A number of measures taken under the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998 aim to prevent
offending and reoffending by young people.
Local authorities are required to produce
annual youth justice plans detailing how youth
justice services in their areas are provided and
funded. They must also establish one or more
youth offending teams, with membership drawn
from the police, social services, the probation
service, health and education authorities and, if
considered appropriate locally, the voluntary
sector. As well as supervising existing
community sentences, these teams provide and
supervise a range of new orders and powers
under the Act (see below).
The 1998 legislation provides for a
statutory final warning scheme to replace the
practice of repeat cautioning by the police; this
began in June 2000. The scheme is intended to
provide a swift response to early incidences of
criminal behaviour, and a final warning will
also trigger referral to a youth offending team
to draw up a rehabilitation programme to
address the factors which led the young
person into offending.
New orders include: a reparation order,
which requires young offenders to make non-
financial reparation to the victim(s) of their
offence or to the community which they have
harmed; and an action plan order, which
requires them to comply with an individually
tailored action plan intended to address their
offending behaviour. These new orders took
effect nationally from June 2000. In addition, a
detention and training order, combining custody
and community supervision, came into force
in April 2000.
The new criminal orders are complemented
by a range of other powers. These include
parenting orders, which require a parent or
224
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
guardian to attend counselling and guidance
sessions, and may direct them to comply with
specified requirements; and child safety orders,
which place a child under ten who is at risk of
becoming involved in crime or is behaving in
an anti-social manner under the supervision of
a specified, responsible officer. Both orders
also took effect in June 2000.
Furthermore, under the provisions of the
Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act
1999, young offenders convicted in court for
the first time and pleading guilty, in specified
pilot areas, can be sentenced to referral to a
panel of expert youth workers and local
community representatives (unless the crime
is serious enough to warrant custody). The
referral orders will last between three and 12
months, with the panel establishing a
programme of corrective reparation in order to
tackle the offending behaviour and prevent
reoffending.
I he Youth Justice Board for England and
Wales, which began operation in 1998,
monitors the youth justice system, promotes
good practice and advises the Home Secretary
on the operation of the system and the setting
of national standards.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the High Court, on points of
law, and to the Crown Court, by way of re¬
hearing. Appeals from the Crown Court go to
the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A
further appeal can be made to the House of
Lords on points of law of public importance.
A prosecutor cannot appeal against an
acquittal, but mechanisms exist to review
over-lenient sentences and rulings of law.
Alleged miscarriages of justice in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland are reviewed by
the Criminal Cases Review Commission,
which is independent of both government and
the courts. Referral of a case requires some
new argument or evidence not previously
raised at the trial or on appeal.
Coroners’ Courts
The coroner (usually a senior lawyer or
doctor) must hold an inquest if the deceased
died violently, unnaturally, suddenly, of
unknown causes, while in prison or in other
specified circumstances. The coroner’s court
establishes how, when and where the deceased
died. A coroner may sit alone or, in certain
circumstances, with a jury.
CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Jurisdiction in civil matters is split between
the High Court and the county courts. Some
90 per cent of all cases are dealt with by the
county courts, but most civil disputes do not
go to court at all. Many are dealt with through
statutory or voluntary complaints
mechanisms, or through mediation and
negotiation. Arbitration is a common form of
adjudication in commercial and building
disputes. Ombudsmen have the power to
determine complaints in the public sector,
and, on a voluntary basis, in some private
sector activities (for example, banking,
insurance and pensions).
A large number of tribunals exist to
determine disputes. About 80 different types
of tribunal are supervised by a statutory
supervisory body, the Council on Tribunals,
and deal with disputes such as liability for tax
(Commissioners for Income Tax), eligibility
for social benefit (Social Security Appeals
Tribunals) and the compulsory treatment of
an individual for mental health problems
(Mental Health Review Tribunals).
Courts
The High Court is divided into three
Divisions (see chart on p. 220).
• The Queen’s Bench Division deals with
disputes relating to contracts, general
commercial matters (in a specialist
Commercial Court), and liability in tort
(general civil wrongs, such as accidents
caused by negligence, or defamation of
character). A Queen’s Bench Divisional
Court has special responsibility for
dealing with applications for judicial
review of the actions of public bodies,
and has the power to declare the action of
a public individual, department or body
unlawful.
225
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• The Chancery Division deals with
disputes relating to land, wills,
companies and insolvency.
• The Family Division deals with matters
relating to divorce and the welfare of
children.
About 270 county courts deal with claims
in contract and in tort, with family matters
(including divorce and the welfare of children)
and a wide range of statutory matters.
Magistrates’ courts have limited civil
jurisdiction, in family matters (when they sit
as a Family Proceedings Court) and in
miscellaneous civil orders.
Appeals in civil cases in the county courts
or High Court generally go to the Court of
Appeal (Civil Division). Appeals from
magistrates’ courts in civil matters go to the
High Court, on matters of law, or to the
Crown Court, if the case is to be reheard. A
further appeal on points of law of public
importance goes to the House of Lords. The
Access to Justice Act 1999 is reforming the
jurisdiction of the courts to hear appeals in
civil and family cases, and the constitution of
the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal
(see below).
Reform of the Civil Justice System
Amendments to the civil justice system were
implemented in 1999, introducing:
• a unified code of procedural rules,
replacing separate sets of High Court and
county court rules, the objective being to
enable the courts to deal with cases more
appropriately. This includes the court
taking a more active case management
role than before, so that cases are dealt
with in a way which is proportionate to
their value, complexity and importance;
• pre-action protocols (for clinical
negligence and personal injury cases),
setting standards and timetables for the
conduct of cases before court proceedings
are started. This requires more exchange
of information and fuller investigation of
claims at an earlier stage. People should
therefore be in a better position to make a
realistic assessment of the merits of a case
far earlier than before, encouraging them
to settle disputes without recourse to
litigation. If litigation is unavoidable,
cases coming to court should be better
prepared than before; and
• a system of three tracks to which
disputed claims are assigned by a judge
according to the value and complexity of
the case. These are the:
— small claims track, which deals with
cases worth less than £5,000 at an
informal hearing by a district judge;
— fast track, which deals with cases
worth from £5,000 to £15,000,
setting a fixed timetable from
allocation to trial; and
— multi-track, for cases over £15,000,
or of unusual complexity, which is
supervised by a judge and given
timetables tailored to each case.
Judges have a key role in ensuring that the
procedures deliver the objectives of reducing
cost, delay and complexity, by managing cases
to ensure that litigants and their
representatives keep to the timetable, and
undertake only necessary work.
The Access to Justice Act 1999 is reforming
the workings of the appeals system according
to the principles of proportionality and
efficiency, by:
• diverting from the Court of Appeal those
cases which, by their nature, do not
require the attention of the most senior
judges in the country; and
• making various changes to the working
methods and constitution of the Court,
which will enable it to deploy its
resources more effectively.
The Civil Justice Council has been
established to oversee the working of the civil
justice system, and to make proposals for its
improvement.
Legal System of Scotland
Scots law belongs to a small group of ‘mixed’
legal systems which have legal principles, rules
and concepts modelled on both Roman and
English law. The main sources of Scots law are
226
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
judge-made law, certain legal treatises having
‘institutional’ authority, legislation, and EC
law. The first two sources are sometimes
referred to as the common law of Scotland.
Legislation, as in the rest of the UK, consists of
statutes (Acts of Parliament) or subordinate
legislation authorised by Parliament.
PROSECUTION AND THE
CRIMINAL COURTS
Awaiting Trial
When arrested, an accused person may be
released by the police to await summons, on
an undertaking to appear at court at a specified
time, or be held in custody to appear at court
on the next working day. Following that
appearance, the accused may be remanded in
custody until trial or released by the court on
bail. If released on bail, he or she must
undertake to appear at trial when required, not
to commit an offence while on bail, and not to
interfere with witnesses or obstruct justice.
There is a right of appeal to the High Court
against the refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor
against the granting of bail, or against the
conditions imposed.
Prosecution Arrangements
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal
Service provides Scotland’s independent public
prosecution and deaths investigation service.
The Department is headed by the Lord
Advocate, assisted by the Solicitor-General for
Scotland (who are the Scottish Law Officers
and members of the Scottish Executive). The
Crown Agent, a senior civil servant, is
responsible for the running of the Department.
Prosecutions in the High Court are
prepared by procurators fiscal and Crown
Office officials, and are conducted by the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor-General for
Scotland; they in turn delegate the bulk of
their work to advocates depute, collectively
known as Crown Counsel, of whom there are
13. In all other criminal courts the decision to
prosecute is made, and prosecution carried
out, by procurators fiscal, who are the Lord
Advocate’s local representatives (one for each
sheriff court). They are lawyers and full-time
civil servants subject to the direction of the
Department.
The police report gives details of alleged
crimes to the local procurator fiscal who has
discretion whether or not to prosecute. He or
she may receive instructions from the Crown
Counsel on behalf of the Lord Advocate.
The office of coroner does not exist in
Scotland. Instead the local procurator fiscal
inquires into sudden or suspicious deaths.
When appropriate, a fatal accident inquiry
may be held before the sheriff; this is
mandatory in cases of death resulting from
industrial accidents and deaths in custody.
Criminal Courts
There are three criminal courts in Scotland:
the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. Cases are heard under
one of two types of criminal procedure.
• In solemn procedure in both the High
Court of Justiciary and the sheriff court,
an accused person’s trial takes place
before a judge sitting with a jury of 15 lay
people. As in England and Wales, the
alleged offence is set out in a document
called an indictment. The judge decides
questions of law and the jury decides
questions of fact and may reach a
decision by a simple majority. They may
decide to find the accused ‘guilty’, ‘not
guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the last two are
acquittals and have the effect that the
accused cannot be tried again for the
same offence.
• In summary procedure in sheriff and
district courts, the judge sits without a
jury and decides questions of both fact
and law. The offence charged is set out in
a document called a summary complaint.
Pre-trial hearings (diets) in summary and
solemn cases are intended to establish the state
of readiness of both the defence and the
prosecution.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme
criminal court in Scotland, sitting in
Edinburgh, Glasgow and other major urban
centres. It tries the most serious crimes and
has exclusive jurisdiction in cases involving
murder, treason and rape.
227
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The 49 sheriff courts deal mainly with less
serious offences committed within their area of
jurisdiction. These courts are organised in six
sheriffdoms; at the head of each is a sheriff
principal. There are over 100 permanent
sheriffs, most of whom are appointed to
particular courts. The sheriff has jurisdiction in
both summary and solemn criminal cases. In
the summary court, the sheriff may impose
prison sentences of up to three months
(although more in some cases) or a fine of
£5,000. Under solemn procedure, the sheriff
may impose imprisonment for up to three years
and unlimited financial penalties, and has an
additional power of remit to the High Court of
Justiciary if he or she thinks a heavier sentence
should be imposed. The sheriff also has
available a range of non-custodial sentences,
principally community service and probation.
District courts, which deal with minor
offences, are the administrative responsibility of
the local authority. The longest prison sentence
which can be imposed is generally 60 days and
the maximum fine is £2,500. The bench of a
district court will usually be made up of one or
more lay Justices of the Peace. A local authority
may also appoint a stipendiary magistrate, who
must be a professional lawyer of at least five
years’ standing, and who has the same
summary criminal jurisdiction and powers as a
sheriff. At present, only Glasgow has
stipendiary magistrates sitting in the district
court. A government review of the operation of
the district courts was announced in May 2000.
Sentencing
In Scotland a court must obtain a social enquiry
report before imposing a custodial sentence if
the accused is aged under 21 or has not
previously served a custodial sentence. A report
is also required before making a probation or
community service order, or in cases involving
people already subject to supervision.
Non-custodial sentences available to the
courts include fines, probation orders,
community service orders, restriction of
liberty orders (monitored by electronic
tagging) and supervised attendance orders
(which provide an alternative to imprisonment
for fine default, and incorporate aspects of
work and training).
Children
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged eight years or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are necessary
before anyone under 16 years of age is
prosecuted. Most children under 16 who have
committed an offence or are considered to be in
need of care and protection may be brought
before a Children’s Hearing. The hearing,
consisting of three lay people, determines
whether compulsory measures of care are
required and, if so, the form they should take.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in young offender
institutions. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Appeals
The High Court of Justiciary sits as the Scottish
Court of Criminal Appeal. In both solemn and
summary procedure, a convicted person may
appeal against conviction, or sentence, or both.
The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside
a conviction. There is no appeal from this court
in criminal cases. The Scottish Criminal Cases
Review Commission has responsibility for
considering alleged miscarriages of justice and
referring cases meeting the relevant criteria to
the Court of Appeal for review.
CIVIL COURTS
The main civil courts are the Court of Session
(the supreme court, subject to appeal only to
the House of Lords in London) and the sheriff
court (the principal local court).
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh, and
may hear cases at first instance as well as those
transferred to it and appealed from sheriff
courts and from tribunals. A leading principle
of the court is that cases originating in it are
both prepared for decision, and decided, by
judges sitting alone whose decisions are
subject to review by several judges. The total
number of judges is 32, of whom 24, called
Lords Ordinary, mainly decide cases in the
first instance. This branch of the court is
called the Outer House. The other eight
judges are divided into two divisions of four
228
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
judges each, forming the Inner House. The
First Division is presided over by the Lord
President of the Court of Session and the
Second Division by the Lord Justice-Clerk.
The main business of each division is to
review the decisions of the Lords Ordinary or
inferior courts which have been appealed to it.
In addition to its criminal jurisdiction, the
sheriff court deals with most civil litigation in
Scotland. The value of the subject matter with
which the court can deal has, with very few
exceptions, no upper limit, and a broad range
of remedies can be granted. Cases dealt with
may include debts, contracts, reparation, rent
restrictions, actions affecting the use of
property, leases and tenancies, child
protection issues and family actions. There is a
right of appeal in some cases from the sheriff
to the sheriff principal and then, in some
cases, to the Court of Session.
Civil Proceedings
The formal proceedings in the Court of
Session are started by serving the defender
with a summons or, in sheriff court cases in
ordinary actions, an initial writ. A defender
who intends to contest the action must inform
the court; if he or she fails to do so, the court
normally grants a decree in absence in favour
of the pursuer. Where a case is contested, both
parties must prepare written pleadings, after
which a hearing will normally be arranged.
In summary actions involving sums
between £750 and £1,500 in the sheriff court,
a statement of claim is incorporated in a
summons. The procedure is designed to
enable most actions to be settled without the
parties having to appear in court. Normally,
they, or their representatives, need appear
only when an action is defended.
In cases below £750 a special small claim
procedure enables those who do not have legal
advice to raise claims themselves. The
procedures are similar to, but less formal than,
the summary procedure. In addition to the
courts, there is a wide range of tribunals which
administer justice in special types of case.
Many of these are common to the rest of
Great Britain; others, such as the Land Court,
the Lands Tribunal and the Children’s
Hearings, are peculiar to Scotland.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE
SCOTTISH LEGAL SYSTEM
The Scottish Executive Justice Department,
under the Minister for Justice, is responsible
for civil law and criminal justice, including
criminal justice social work services, police,
prisons, courts administration, legal aid, and
liaison with the legal profession in Scotland.
The Scottish Court Service, an executive
agency, deals with the work of the Supreme
Courts and the sheriff courts.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-
General for Scotland provide the Scottish
Executive with advice on legal matters and
represent its interests in the courts. Since
devolution, advice to the UK Government on
Scots law is provided by the Advocate-
General for Scotland.
The role of the Scottish Parliament is to make
laws in relation to devolved matters in Scotland.
In these areas, it is able to amend or repeal
existing Acts of the UK Parliament and to pass
new legislation of its own in relation to devolved
matters. It is also able to consider and pass
private legislation, promoted by individuals or
bodies (for example, local authorities) in relation
to devolved matters. Examples of laws passed in
the First year of the Parliament include the
abolition of the feudal system of land tenure, and
the introduction of a new system to manage the
welfare and Finances of adults with incapacity.
The Court of Session and the High Court
of Justiciary enact the rules regulating their
own procedure and the procedures of the
sheriff courts and the lay summary courts.
The Court of Session and Criminal Courts
Rules Councils, and the Sheriffs Courts Rules
Council, consisting of judges and legal
practitioners, advise the courts about
amending the rules.
Legal System of
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s legal system is similar to
that of England and Wales. Jury trials have the
same place in the system, except in the case of
offences involving acts of terrorism (see
p. 230). In addition, the course of litigation is
the same and the legal profession has the same
two branches.
229
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Superior Courts
The Supreme Court of Judicature comprises
the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the
Crown Court. All matters relating to these
courts are under the jurisdiction of the UK
Parliament. Judges are appointed by the
Crown.
The Court of Appeal comprises the Lord
Chief Justice (as President) and two Lords
Justices of Appeal. The High Court comprises
the Lord Chief Justice and five other judges.
The practice and procedure of the Court of
Appeal and the High Court are virtually the
same as in the corresponding courts in
England and Wales. Both courts sit in the
Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast.
The Court of Appeal has power to review
the civil law decisions of the High Court and
the criminal law decisions of the Crown
Court, and may in certain cases review the
decisions of county courts and magistrates’
courts. Subject to certain restrictions, an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal can go to the House of Lords.
The High Court is divided into a Queen’s
Bench Division, dealing with most civil law
matters; a Chancery Division, dealing with,
for instance, trusts and estates, title to land,
mortgages and charges, wills and company
matters; and a Family Division, dealing
principally with matrimonial cases, adoption,
wardship, patients’ affairs and undisputed
probate matters.
The Crown Court deals with all serious
criminal cases.
Inferior Courts
The inferior courts are the county courts and
the magistrates’ courts, both of which differ in
a number of ways from their counterparts in
England and Wales.
County courts are primarily civil law courts.
They are presided over by one of 14 county
court judges, two of whom—in Belfast and
Londonderry—have the title of recorder.
Appeals go from the county courts to the High
Court. The county courts also deal with
appeals from the magistrates’ courts in both
criminal and civil matters. In civil matters, the
county courts handle most actions in which
the amount or the value of specific articles
claimed is below a certain level. The courts
also deal with actions involving title to, or the
recovery of, land; equity matters such as trusts
and estates; mortgages; and the sale of land
and partnerships.
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily
with minor local criminal cases is carried out
in magistrates ’ courts presided over by a full¬
time, legally qualified resident magistrate. The
magistrates’ courts also exercise jurisdiction in
certain family law cases and have a very
limited jurisdiction in other civil cases.
Terrorist Offences
People accused of offences specified under
emergency legislation (see p. 215) are tried in
the Crown Court without jury. The onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt and the defendant
has the right to be represented by a lawyer of
his or her choice. The judge must set out in a
written statement the reasons for conviction
and there is an automatic right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal against conviction and/or
sentence on points of fact as well as of law.
Administration of the Law
Court administration is the responsibility of
the Lord Chancellor, while the Northern
Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State,
deals with policy and legislation concerning
criminal law, the police and the penal system.
The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for legal aid, advice and
assistance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, who is responsible to the
Attorney-General, prosecutes all offences
tried on indictment, and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Prison Service
The Prison Service in England and Wales, the
Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
230
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
agencies. There are currently 137 prison
establishments in England and Wales (eight of
which are run by private contractors), 17
Scottish establishments and four in Northern
Ireland.
Prison accommodation ranges from open
prisons to high-security establishments.
Sentenced prisoners are classified into different
risk-level groups for security purposes. Women
prisoners are held in separate prisons or in
separate accommodation in mixed prisons.
There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland.
In recent years the prison population as a
whole has been growing steadily in Great
Britain. For example, the average daily prison
population in England and Wales rose from
44,566 in 1993 to 64,771 in 1999. In Scotland
the figure rose from 5,637 in 1993 to 6,030 in
1999.
Independent Oversight of the Prison
System
Every prison establishment in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland has a board of visitors,
comprising volunteers drawn from the local
community appointed by the Home Secretary
or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
Boards, which are independent, monitor
complaints by prisoners and concerns of staff,
and report as necessary to ministers. In
Scotland, visiting committees to prisons are
appointed by local authorities.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report
on the treatment of prisoners and prison
conditions, and submit annual reports to
Parliament. Each prison establishment is
visited about once every three years.
In England and Wales prisoners who fail to
get satisfaction from the Prison Service’s
internal request and complaints system may
complain to the independent Prisons
Ombudsman. In Scotland, prisoners who
exhaust the internal grievance procedure may
apply to the independent Scottish Prisons
Complaints Commission.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners in the UK may write and receive
letters, be visited by relatives and friends, and
make telephone calls. Privileges include a
personal radio; books, magazines and
newspapers; and watching television. Offences
against prison discipline are dealt with by
prison governors, who act as adjudicators. In
England, Wales and Scotland measures to
counter drug misuse in prisons include
mandatory drug testing. Voluntary testing has
been piloted in Northern Ireland, but there is
no mandatory programme. People awaiting
trial in custody have certain rights and
privileges not granted to convicted prisoners.
Early Release of Prisoners
There are statutory arrangements governing
the early release of prisoners. Offenders
serving shorter terms (less than four years)
may be automatically released at specific
points in their sentences, while those detained
for longer require Parole Board approval or
the consent of a government minister.
Probation
The Probation Service in England and Wales
supervises offenders in the community under
direct court orders and after release from
custody. It also advises offenders in custody.
All young offenders and all prisoners in
England and Wales sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment and over are supervised on
release by the Probation Service, or, in the
case of certain young offenders, by local
authority social services departments or youth
justice teams.
A court probation order requires offenders
to maintain regular contact with their
probation officer, who is expected to supervise
them. The purpose of supervision under a
probation order is to secure the rehabilitation
of the offender, to protect the public and to
prevent the offender from committing further
offences. A probation order can last from six
months to three years; an offender who fails to
comply without good reason with any of the
requirements can be brought before the court
again. The Probation Service also supervises
those subject to community service orders,
combination orders and those released from
prison on parole. The probation service in
231
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
England and Wales dealt with around 120,000
new offenders in 1999. Just under half this
total were commencing probation orders; a
similar number were commencing community
service orders
HM Inspectorate of Probation has both an
inspection and an advisory role, and also
monitors any work that the Probation Service
carries out in conjunction with the voluntary
and private sectors.
The Criminal Justice and Court Service
Bill, currently before Parliament, would
provide for a new National Probation
Service of England and Wales. The
proposed new structure would bring the
existing 54 probation services into a
national, unified service comprising a
national headquarters and 42 area boards.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation,
community service and other community
disposals, and offenders subject to supervision
on release from custody. With effect from
September 2001, responsibility for delivery of
community disposals will pass to 11 mainland
groupings of local authorities
In Northern Ireland the probation service is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Legal Aid
Someone who needs legal assistance or
representation may be able to get help with
legal costs from publicly funded schemes.
People who qualify for help may have all their
legal costs paid for, or may be asked to make a
contribution, depending on their means and,
in civil cases, the outcome of the case.
(ESC). The ESC administers two separate
schemes for funding services:
• the Community Legal Service (CLS),
which was launched in April 2000. The
CLS replaced civil legal aid with a CLS
Fund, through which funding is targeted
on quality-assured services in priority
areas of need; and
• the Criminal Defence Service for funding
criminal cases (being launched in April
2001), which will aim to achieve quality
assurance and improve value for money
in publicly funded defence services.
Legal help and representation is provided
from the Community Legal Service Fund if
applicants qualify for it—which depends on
their financial circumstances and the nature of
their case. The CLS Fund supports eligible
people in paying for help with legal problems,
including divorce and other family issues,
welfare benefits, credit and debt problems,
housing and property disputes, immigration
and nationality issues, clinical negligence
cases, challenges to decisions by government
departments and other public bodies, and
actions against the police. The CLS Fund is
not available for most personal injury cases
(except clinical negligence cases), as the
Government believes that such cases are best
conducted by way of conditional fee (‘no win,
no fee’) arrangements between solicitors and
clients.
In criminal proceedings the LSC makes
arrangements for duty solicitors to assist
unrepresented defendants in the magistrates’
courts. Solicitors are also available, on a 24-
hour basis, to give advice and assistance to
people being questioned by the police. These
services are not means-tested and are free.
Criminal legal aid may be granted by the court
if it appears to be in the interests of justice and
if a defendant is considered to require
financial assistance. A contribution towards
the costs may be payable.
England and Wales
Legal aid funding arrangements have been
reformed (under the provisions of the Access
to Justice Act 1999), replacing the Legal Aid
Board with the Legal Services Commission
Scotland
The Scottish Legal Aid Board is responsible
for managing legal aid in Scotland. Its main
tasks are to grant or refuse applications for
232
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
legal aid; to pay solicitors or advocates for the
legal work that they do; and to advise Scottish
ministers on legal aid matters. Where legal aid
is granted to the accused in criminal
proceedings, he or she is not required to pay
any contribution towards expenses.
Northern Ireland
Civil legal aid in the Province is administered
by the Law Society for Northern Ireland.
Where legal aid is granted for criminal cases it
is free.
Other Legal Advice
The CLS will provide the framework for local
networks of legal advice services throughout
England and Wales. The networks will
include solicitors’ firms, Citizens Advice
Bureaux, law centres, local authority services
and other independent advice centres.

15 Religion
Introduction 234 Other Faith Communities 241
The Christian Community 237 Co-operation between Faiths 243
Britain in the 21st century is a multicultural, multi-faith society. Everyone in
the United Kingdom has the right to religious freedom. Religious organisations
and groups may conduct their rites and ceremonies, promote their beliefs
within the limits of the law, own property and run schools.
INTRODUCTION
Historically, Christianity has been the most
influential and important religion in Britain,
and it remains the declared faith of the
majority of the people. The influence of
Christianity has been widespread, extending
beyond the spheres of prayer and worship.
Churches and cathedrals make a significant
contribution to the architectural landscape of
the nation’s cities and towns. The church is
actively involved in voluntary work and the
provision of social services—many schools and
hospitals were founded by men and women
who were strongly influenced by Christian
motives. Easter and Christmas, the two most
important events in the Christian calendar, are
still recognised as public holidays.
In addition to Christians, there are large
communities of Muslims, Hindus, Jews and
Sikhs, and smaller communities of practising
Baha’is, Buddhists, Jains and Zoroastrians.
Most of these religious communities are also
involved in voluntary work and show practical
concern for the less privileged. Although
members within a community share many
beliefs and practices, there may be significant
differences, within each community, of
tradition, organisation, language and ethnicity.
As well as the 7.9 million active members of
religions, the UK also has a large proportion
of people who may involve themselves in
formal religious ceremonies only at times of
crisis or significant events such as birth,
marriage and death. Organisations such as the
British Humanist Association and the
National Secular Society offer the opportunity
for members to debate and explore moral and
philosophical issues in a non-religious setting.
There has been a significant development
of other forms of religious expression, with the
growth of a range of independent churches
and also of other groups sometimes referred to
as ‘cults’ or ‘sects’ which have now become
known collectively as new religious
movements. These tend to be smaller and less
formal than longer established churches, and
rely more on the inspiration of their leader or
founder.
A distinction is often drawn between
community size figures and active
membership figures, with the former
representing a broader form of identification
with religion and the latter a closer association.
Current community size estimates suggest 40
million people in Britain identify themselves
as Christians; on the same basis there are over
1 million Muslims; around half a million

Relations with the State
Two churches have a special status with
regard to the State. In England, the Anglican
Church of England is legally recognised as the
official, or established, Church and is subject
to Parliament. A similar situation applied in
Scotland until the early 20th century
regarding the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.
Since then the Church continues to be
recognised as the national Church, but it is
completely self-governing. There is no longer
an established Church in Wales or Northern
Ireland. No church is financially supported by
the State, although many ministers of religion
work as army chaplains, and in schools and
hospitals, and will consequently draw a salary
from the State for that work, and the churches
may also receive funds for their social and
educational work.
Religious Education
In England and Wales all state schools must
provide religious education, each local
education authority being responsible for
producing a locally agreed syllabus. Syllabuses
must reflect Christianity, while taking account
of the teaching and practices of the other
principal religions represented in the UK.
State schools must provide a daily act of
collective worship. Parents may withdraw
their children from religious education.
In Scotland, education authorities must
ensure that schools provide religious
education and regular opportunities for
religious observance. The law does not specify
the form of religious education, but it is
recommended that pupils should be provided
with a broad-based curriculum, through
which they can develop a knowledge and
understanding of Christianity and other world
religions, and develop their own beliefs,
attitudes and moral values and practices.
In Northern Ireland a core syllabus for
religious education has been approved by the
main churches and this must be taught in all
state schools. Integrated education is
encouraged and all schools must be open to
pupils of all religions, although in practice
most Catholic pupils attend Catholic
maintained or Catholic voluntary grammar
schools, and most Protestant children are
enrolled at controlled schools or non-
denominational voluntary grammar schools.
However, the number of inter-denominational
235
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
As well as non-denominational state
schools, there are in England and Wales
around 4,000 voluntary schools receiving
the bulk of their funding from the State.
Most of these schools still seek to maintain
a particular religious tradition. Until 1997,
mainly for historical reasons, virtually all
such schools were Anglican or Roman
Catholic. Since then, as part of a wider
government initiative to increase parental
choice, state-funded schools representing
other religions have been established. Two
Muslim state primary schools have been
approved in Birmingham and London, as
well as two Sikh schools, a Seventh-day
Adventist school, and five Jewish primary
schools. Further plans include proposals
for state schools representing the Greek
Orthodox Church and Hindu religions. In
Scotland the State fully funds
denominational schools, almost all of
which are Roman Catholic.
schools is increasing. In 1998—99, over 12,000
primary and secondary school pupils received
their education at integrated’ schools not
attached to any particular religion.
Church Maintenance
The State does not contribute to the general
expenses of church maintenance, although some
state aid does help repair historic churches. In
1998-99 the joint scheme of English Heritage
and the Heritage Lottery Fund offered grants to
churches totalling £26 million. Assistance is also
given to meet some of the costs of repairing
cathedrals, with £3 million available from
English Heritage in 2000-01.
The Churches Conservation Trust
(formerly the Redundant Churches Fund),
funded jointly by the Government and the
Church of England, preserves Anglican
churches of particular cultural and historical
importance that are no longer used as regular
places of worship. At present over 300
churches are maintained in this way.
The Historic Chapels Trust was
established to take into ow nership redundant
chapels and other places of w orship in
England of outstanding architectural and
historic interest (other than those which are
eligible for vesting in the Churches
Conservation Trust). Buildings of all
denominations and faiths can be taken into
care. These have included Nonconformist
chapels, Roman Catholic churches, private
Anglican chapels and synagogues.
Social Involvement
The Church of England’s Church Urban
Fund is an independent charity which raises
money to enable those living in the most
disadvantaged urban areas to set up local
projects to help alleviate the effects of poverty.
These projects help support a wide range of
community-based programmes concerned
with issues such as education, employment,
young people and poverty. Although rooted in
the Christian faith, the Fund does not restrict
its grants on the basis of religious belief. By
2000 it had made grants totalling £37 million
to nearly 2,900 different projects.
The General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland debates annual reports from its
Committee on Church and Nation, on social,
economic and political matters; and, through
its Board of Social Responsibility, it is the
largest voluntary social work agency in
Scotland. The Board currently runs more than
80 projects offering care and support to over
4,000 people every day. Churches in Wales
and Northern Ireland, and other faith
communities also have a concern for social
issues.
In England, the Inner Cities Religious
Council, based in the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions,
provides a forum in which the Government
and the faith communities w ork together on
issues relating to urban regeneration. Chaired
by a government minister, the Council
comprises senior leaders of the Christian,
Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faiths.
The Census and Religious Affiliation
Religion is to be included as a topic in the
2001 Census throughout the United
Kingdom. Questions have not normally been
236
15: RELIGION
asked about religious beliefs in censuses or for
other official purposes, except in Northern
Ireland. The Scottish Parliament had
approved similar legislation in March 2000.
Unlike other Census questions, however,
there is no legal penalty for failing to answer
the question about religion, reflecting the
sensitivity that some people feel about
disclosing such information.
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY
Church of England
The Church of England became the
established church during the Reformation in
the 16th century. Conflicts between Church
and State culminated in the Act of Supremacy
in 1534, which repudiated papal supremacy
and declared Henry VIII to be the Supreme
Head of the Church of England. The title was
altered to ‘Supreme Governor’ by Elizabeth I
when she acceded to the throne in 1558. The
Church of England’s form of worship was set
out in successive versions of the Book of
Common Prayer from 1549 onwards.
The Church of England plans to publish in
November 2000 Common Worship,
containing its new services. Common
Worship replaces the Alternative Service
Book and will be used alongside the
traditional Book of Common Prayer.
Common Worship contains modern
language and forms of service side by side
with traditional versions. As well as being
published in book form, it will be available
as a CD-Rom and can be accessed over the
Internet.
There have been various attempts to sever all
links between church and state, among them the
‘disestablishmentarian’ campaign of the 19th
century. Recent constitutional reforms (outlined
in chapter 6) have not altered the link.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’
of the Church of England and must always be
a member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. The Church can regulate its own
worship. Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans of a number of cathedrals
are appointed by the Monarch on the advice of
the Prime Minister, although the Crown
Appointments Commission, which includes
lay and clergy representatives, plays a key role
in the selection of archbishops and diocesan
bishops. Clergy of the Church, together with
those of the Church of Scotland, the Church
of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church,
may not sit in the House of Commons. The
two archbishops (of Canterbury and York),
the bishops of London, Durham and
Winchester, and 21 other senior bishops sit in
the House of Lords.
The Church of England is divided into two
provinces: Canterbury, comprising 30
dioceses, including the Diocese in Europe; and
York, with 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
divided into archdeaconries and deaneries,
which are in turn divided into about 13,000
parishes, although in practice many of these
are grouped together. Altogether, there are
about 13,000 Church of England clergy,
excluding those in mainland Europe. In 1998,
177,000 people were baptised in the Church in
the two provinces, excluding the Diocese in
Europe; of these, 129,000 were under one year
old, representing 21 per cent of live births. In
the same year there were 40,000
confirmations. In 1998 nearly 66,000
marriages were solemnised in the Church of
England. These accounted for 67 per cent of
marriages with religious ceremonies, and 26
per cent of marriages in England.
In 1998 the General Synod, the central
governing and legislative body, approved
proposals to overhaul the central organisation
and structure of the Church. The number of
Church Commissioners (see below) was
reduced by two-thirds and some of their
powers transferred to an Archbishops’
Council which became the Church’s central
co-ordinating body. The Council is the centre
of an administrative system dealing with inter¬
church relations, inter-faith relations, social
questions, recruitment and training for the
ministry, and missionary work.
The Church Commissioners are responsible
for a large part of the Church of England’s
invested assets. The Crown appoints a Member
of Parliament from the backbenches of the
governing party to the unpaid post of Second
Church Estates Commissioner, to represent the
Commissioners in Parliament. The Church
237
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Commissioners provide a fifth of the Church’s
total annual income, with most of the remainder
provided by local voluntary donations. The
average annual stipend of a Church of England
priest is about £16,480; additional benefits
include free housing (valued in 1999 at £8,270)
and a non-contributory pension.
The Church of England reported an
increase in the ordination of new clergy
between 1998 and 1999 (from 468 to 481), and
in the number of people in training for
ordination. There are at present over 1,450
people in training.
The first women priests were ordained in
1994 and by 1999 they numbered 2,100.
Women priests cannot, however, be appointed
bishop or archbishop.
Other Anglican Churches
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
Communion of Anglican churches. These are
similar in organisation and worship to the
Church of England and originated from it.
There are four distinct Anglican Churches in
the United Kingdom: the Church of England,
the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland (which
also operates in the Irish Republic). Each is
governed separately by its own institutions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 38
autonomous Churches in the UK and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas, with a
total membership of about 70 million. Links
between the components of the Anglican
Communion are maintained by the Lambeth
Conference of Anglican bishops, which is held
in Canterbury every ten years, the last
conference having taken place in 1998.
Presided over by the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Conference has no executive
authority, but enjoys considerable influence as
an opinion-forming group.
The Anglican Consultative Council, an
assembly of lay people and clergy as well as
bishops, meets every two or three years to
allow consultation within the Anglican
Communion. Since 1979 the Primates (the
senior archbishop or presiding bishop) of the
Churches of the Anglican Communion have
met regularly to discuss theological, social and
international issues.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation in
the late 16th century and legislation enacted
by the Scottish Parliament. The Church’s
status was then consolidated in the Treaty of
Union of 1707 and by the Church of Scotland
Act 1921, the latter confirming its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. The Church
appoints its own office bearers, and its affairs
are not subject to any civil authority.
The adult communicant membership is
over 600,000 and there are around 1,200
ministers serving in parishes. Both men and
women may join the ministry. The Church of
Scotland has a Presbyterian form of
government, that is government by church
courts or councils, composed of ministers,
elders, and deacons. The 1,600 congregations
are governed locally by courts known as Kirk
Sessions, consisting of ministers and elders.
The next court is the Presbytery, responsible
for a geographical area made up of a number
of parishes; and finally there is the General
Assembly, the supreme court, consisting of
elected ministers, elders and deacons. The
General Assembly meets annually under the
chairmanship of an elected moderator, who
serves for one year. The Monarch is normally
represented by the Lord High Commissioner
at the General Assembly.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland. They are very
active in the Highlands and Islands.
Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe those Protestant churches in the UK
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not established
churches. Free Churches have existed in
various forms since the Reformation,
developing their own traditions over the years.
Their members have also been known as
dissenters or nonconformists because of their
more informal ecclesiastical structures and
patterns of worship. Although this historical
experience has given these churches a certain
238
15: RELIGION
sense of shared identity, they otherwise vary
greatly in doctrine, worship and church
government. All the major Free Churches—
Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, United
Reformed and Salvation Army—have
ministers of both sexes.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, originated in the 18th century
following the Evangelical Revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). It has 353,000 adult full
members and a community of more than 1.2
million. The present Church is based on the
1932 union of most of the separate Methodist
Churches. It has 3,727 ministers and student
ministers and 6,452 places of worship.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the Baptist
Union of Great Britain (re-formed in 1812)
with about 145,000 members, 1,780 ministers
and 2,100 places of worship. There are also
separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales
and Ireland, and other independent Baptist
Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is
the United Reformed Church, with some
96,500 members, 1,090 serving ministers and
1,775 places of worship. It was formed in 1972
upon the union of the Congregational Church
in England and Wales (the oldest Protestant
minority in the UK, whose origins can be
traced back to the Puritans of the 16th
century) with the Presbyterian Church of
England (a church closely related in doctrine
and worship to the Church of Scotland).
Further unions have taken place: in 1981 with
the Reformed Association of the Churches of
Christ and in 2000 with the Congregational
Union of Scotland.
I he Salvation Army was founded in the
East End of London in 1865 by William Booth
(1829-1912). Within the UK it is the largest,
most diverse provider of social services after
the Government. The Salvation Army also has
a strong musical tradition. It is one of the
biggest providers of hostel accommodation,
offering over 3,000 beds every night. Other
services include work with alcoholics, prison
chaplaincy and a family tracing service which
receives 5,000 enquiries each year. The
Salvation Army in the UK is served by 1,600
officers (ordained ministers) and runs over 800
local church and community centres.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 17,000 adult members
and 9,500 attenders in the UK and 490 places
of worship, was founded in the middle of the
17th century under the leadership of George
Fox (1624-91). It has no ordained ministers
and no formal liturgy or sacraments. Silent
worship is central to its life as a religious
organisation and emphasis is also placed on
social concern—Quakers have a long tradition
of carrying out voluntary work in prisons—
and peacemaking.
Among the other Free Churches are: the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest
Protestant church in Northern Ireland, where
it has around 300,000 members; the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales, with 49,750 members and
the largest of the Free Churches in Wales; and
the Union of Welsh Independents with 40,750
members.
Pentecostal Organisations and
Charismatic Groupings
A recent development has been the rise of
Pentecostalism and the charismatic
movement. A number of Pentecostal bodies
were formed in the UK at the turn of the 20th
century. The two main Pentecostal
organisations in the UK today are the
Assemblies of God, with approximately 54,000
members, over 900 ministers and over 650
places of worship; and the Elim Pentecostal
Church, with around 62,000 members. Since
the Second World War immigration from the
Caribbean has led to a significant number of
Black Majority Pentecostal churches, and
these are a growing presence in British (and
especially English) Church life.
In the early 1960s a Pentecostal charismatic
movement began to influence some followers in
the Church of England, the Roman Catholic
Church and the historic Free Churches. The
Christian ‘house church’ movement (or ‘new
churches’) began in the 1970s when some of the
charismatics began to establish their own
congregations. Services were originally held in
private houses although many congregations
have now acquired their own buildings. The
239
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
movement, whose growth within the UK has
been most marked in England, is characterised
by lay leadership and is organised into a
number of loose fellowships.
Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which was
suppressed after the Reformation, was restored
in 1850, and that of the Scottish Roman
Catholic Church, suppressed in the early 17th
century, in 1878. There are now seven Roman
Catholic provinces in Great Britain—five in
England and Wales and two in Scotland. There
are 30 dioceses in Great Britain—22 in England
and Wales and eight in Scotland. Each province
is under an archbishop; each diocese is under a
bishop. There are separate Bishops’
Conferences for England and Wales and for
Scotland. There are 2,843 parish churches in
England and Wales and 828 other churches and
chapels open to the public. Scotland has 463
parish churches.
The Roman Catholic Church in Ireland is
organised as a unit covering the whole island.
There are 1,329 parishes, and 2,646 churches.
Northern Ireland is covered by seven dioceses,
some of which also have territory in the Irish
Republic.
There are approximately 12,000 members
of religious orders in England, Scotland and
Wales. These orders undertake teaching and
chaplaincy, and social work such as nursing,
childcare and running homes for the elderly.
Other Churches
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
go back to the Reformation. The Christian
Brethren are a Protestant body organised by
J.N. Darby (1800-82). There are two
branches: the Open Brethren and the Closed
or Exclusive Brethren.
Many Christian communities founded by
migrant communities, including the
Orthodox, Lutheran and Reformed Churches
of various European countries, the Coptic
Orthodox Church and the Armenian Church,
have established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London. All these churches
operate in a variety of languages. The largest
is probably the Greek Orthodox Church,
many of whose members are of Cypriot origin.
There are also several other religious
groups in the UK which were founded in the
United States in the 20th century. These
include the Church of Jesus Christ of the
Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church, with
about 180,000 members), the Jehovah’s
Witnesses (146,000 members), the
Christadelphians, the Christian Scientists, and
the Seventh-day Adventists. The Spiritualists
have about 36,000 members, over 500
churches and nearly 300 ministers.
Co-operation among the Churches
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland is
the main co-ordinating body for the Christian
churches in the UK. The Council co¬
ordinates the work of its 32 member churches
and associations of churches, in the areas of
social responsibility, international affairs,
church life, world mission, racial justice and
inter-faith relations. The Council’s member
churches are also grouped in separate
ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, Churches
Together in Wales (Cytun), and the Irish
Council of Churches.
The Free Churches’ Council, with 19
member denominations, includes most of the
Free Churches of England and Wales. It
promotes co-operation among the Free
Churches (especially in hospital chaplaincy
and in education matters).
The Evangelical Alliance, with a
membership of individuals, churches or
societies drawn from 20 denominations,
represents over 1 million evangelical Christians.
Inter-church discussions about the search
for Christian unity take place internationally,
as well as within the UK, and the main
participants are the Anglican, Baptist,
Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox, Reformed
and Roman Catholic Churches. In 1999 the
Church of England and the Methodist Church
began formal discussions on a move towards
unity. The Baptist Union, the Moravian
Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the
United Reformed Church had participating
240
15: RELIGION
observers at the discussions. Informal trilateral
contact between the Church of England, the
Methodist Church and the United Reformed
Church also began in 1999.
Alpha, a course that offers a practical
introduction to the Christian faith,
originated from an Anglican West London
church in 1980. It is now being used as a
form of evangelism by every major
denomination. By 1999, an estimated 7,000
courses were being run each year in
churches and institutions (including
prisons and educational establishments)
across the UK, attended by approximately
250,000 people.
OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES
The Buddhist Community
The Buddhist community in the UK has
followers both of British or Western origin,
and of South Asian and Asian background. In
1907, a Buddhist Society of Great Britain and
Ireland was formed but did not become firmly
established. In 1924, Christmas Humphreys
(1901—83) founded the Buddhist Centre of the
Theosophical Society from what remained of
the earlier society. This became the Buddhist
Lodge of the Eheosophical Society in 1926,
and was constituted as a new and independent
organisation—the Buddhist Society—in 1943.
The Society promotes the principles, but does
not adhere to any particular school, of
Buddhism. The Network of Buddhist
Organisations links many of the various
Buddhist educational, cultural, charitable and
teaching organisations.
Although religious buildings are not as
central to Buddhist life as to that of some
other religious traditions, there are over 500
Buddhist groups and centres, including some
50 monasteries and temples in the UK.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in the UK originates
largely from India, although others have come
from countries to which earlier generations
had previously migrated, such as Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Malawi.
Migrants have also come from Fiji and from
I rinidad and other Caribbean islands. The
number of members is around 400,000 to
550,000, although some community
representatives suggest a considerably higher
figure (of close to 1 million). They are
predominantly Gujaratis (between 65 per cent
and 70 per cent) and Punjabis (between 15 per
cent and 20 per cent). Most of the remainder
have their ancestral roots in other parts of
India, such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal,
and the Southern states, as well as other
countries such as Sri Lanka.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was
opened in London in the 1950s and there are
now over 120 mandirs in the UK; many are
affiliated to the National Council of Hindu
Temples (UK). Other national bodies serving
the Hindu community include the Hindu
Council (UK) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad.
The Swaminarayan Hindu Temple, in north
London, is the first purpose-built Hindu temple
in Europe, having a large cultural complex with
provision for conferences, exhibitions,
marriages, sports and health clinics.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest. They were banished by
royal decree in 1290, but readmitted following
the English Civil War (1642-51). Sephardi
Jews, who originally came from Spain and
Portugal, have been present in the UK since
the mid-17th century. The majority of Jews in
the UK today are Ashkenazi Jews, of Central
and East European origin, who fled persecution
in the Russian Empire between 1881 and 1914,
and Nazi persecution in Germany and other
European countries from 1933 onwards.
The Jewish community in the UK numbers
about 283,000, around 30 per cent of whom
are affiliated to synagogues. Of the total
number of synagogue-affiliated households,
most Ashkenazi Jews (60 per cent)
acknowledge the authority of the Chief Rabbi,
while the more strictly observant (7 per cent)
have their own spiritual leaders, as do the
Sephardim. The Reform movement (founded
in 1840), the Liberal and Progressive
movement (founded in 1901) and the recently
241
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
established Masorti movement account for
most of the remaining synagogue-affiliated
community membership.
Jewish congregations in the UK number
about 365. The Board of Deputies of British
Jews is the officially recognised representative
body for these groups. Founded in 1760, it is
elected mainly by synagogues, but a growing
number of communal organisations are also
represented. The Board serves as the voice of
the community to both government and the
wider non-Jewish community.
The Muslim Community
A significant Muslim community has existed
in the UK since Muslim seamen and traders,
from the Middle East and the Indian
subcontinent, settled around the major ports
in the early 19th century. There was further
settlement from those demobilised from
military service in the British army after the
First World War, and of workers seeking, or
recruited for, employment in the mills and
factories in the 1950s and 1960s because of a
shortage of labour following the Second
World War. The 1970s saw the arrival of
significant numbers of Muslims of Asian
origin from Kenya and Uganda. There are
also well-established Turkish Cypriot and
Iranian Muslim communities, while more
recently Muslims from Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia
and Kosovo have sought refuge in the UK.
There are between 1.5 million and 2 million
Muslims in the UK and estimates from within
the community suggest that the proportion of
young people is significantly higher than the
national average.
There are over 1,000 mosques and
numerous community Muslim centres
throughout the UK. Mosques are not only
places of worship; they also offer instruction
in the Muslim way of life and facilities for
education and welfare. The first mosque in the
UK was established at Woking, Surrey, in
1890. Mosques now range from converted
buildings in many towns to the Central
Mosque in Regent’s Park, London, and its
associated Islamic Cultural Centre, one of the
most important Muslim institutions in the
western world. The Central Mosque has the
largest congregation of practically every
minority ethnic community in the UK, and
during festivals it may number over 30,000.
The main conurbations in the Midlands,
North West and North East of England, and
in Scotland also have their own central
mosques with a range of community facilities.
Sunni and Shi’a are the two principal
traditions within Islam and both are
represented among the Muslim community in
the UK. Sufism, the mystical aspect of Islam,
can be found in both traditions, and members
of some of the major Sufi traditions have also
developed branches in British cities.
The Muslim Council of Britain, founded in
1997, is a recent example of a representative
body of established national and regional
Muslim bodies as well as local mosques,
organisations and specialist institutions. The
Council aims to promote co-operation,
consensus and unity on Muslim affairs in the
UK. A number of other representative bodies
such as the Union of Muslim Organisations
has been set up to co-ordinate the social,
cultural, economic and functional aspects of
Muslim life in Britain.
The Sikh Community
Most of the Sikh community in the UK are of
Punjabi ethnic origin. A significant minority
came from East Africa and other former
British colonies to which members of their
family had migrated, but the vast majority
have come to the UK directly from the
Punjab. There are between 400,000 and
500,000 members, making it the largest Sikh
community outside the Indian subcontinent.
The first gurdwara, or temple, in the UK
was opened in Shepherd’s Bush, London, in
1911. The largest is situated in Southall,
Middlesex. Gurdwaras cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare and cultural needs
of their community. A granthi is usually
employed to take care of the building and to
conduct prayers. There are over 200
gurdwaras in the UK, the vast majority being
in England and Wales.
Other Faiths
Jainism is an ancient religion brought to the
UK by immigrants mainly from the Gujarat
242
15: RELIGION
and Rajasthan areas of India. It is estimated
that there are between 25,000 and 30,000
members in the UK. The Zoroastrian religion,
or Mazdaism, is mainly represented in the UK
by the Parsi community. Founders of the UK
community originally settled in the 19th
century and it is estimated that there are
between 5,000 and 10,000 members. The
Baha’i movement originated in Persia in the
19th century. The UK community has around
6,000 members connected to 200 local groups
and 180 local spiritual assemblies.
Rastafarianism, with its roots in the return-to-
Africa movement, emerged in the West Indies
early in the 20th century. It arrived in the UK
with immigration from Jamaica in the 1950s.
New Religious Movements
A number of new religious movements,
established since the Second World War and
often with overseas origins, are active in the
UK. Examples include the Church of
Scientology, the Transcendental Meditation
movement, the Unification Church and various
New Age groups. INFORM (Information
Network Focus on Religious Movements),
which is supported by the main Churches,
carries out research and seeks to provide
information about new religious movements.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
The Inter Faith Network for the United
Kingdom links a wide range of organisations
with an interest in inter-faith relations,
including the representative bodies of the
Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain,
Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian
communities. The Network promotes good
relations between faiths in the UK, and runs a
public advice and information service on
inter-faith issues. The Council of Christians
and Jews works for better understanding
among members of the two religions and deals
with educational and social issues. Churches
Together in Britain and Ireland (see p. 240)
has a Commission on Inter Faith Relations.
There are now many organisations in the UK
dealing wholly, or in part, with inter-faith
issues. Many towns and cities now have inter¬
faith councils or groups whose focus is
working for good inter-faith relations locally.
Faith and the Year 2000
In the UK many national and civic
millennium celebrations had a specifically
Christian framework. For example, during the
first weekend of the new millennium
celebrations there were national Millennium
church services held in Belfast, Cardiff,
Edinburgh and London. However, the
Government was keen to ensure that the
celebrations were relevant and accessible to
people of all faiths. I he church services were
therefore complemented by a ‘Shared Act of
Reflection and Commitment’ by the faith
communities of the UK hosted by the
Government in the Houses of Parliament and
organised on their behalf by the Inter Faith
Network.
Among the Christian celebrations were a
passion play with a cast of 1,000 held in
Greenwich Park over the Easter holiday
period; and Jesus Day 2000, a global street
celebration of Christ’s millennium in cities
throughout the UK. Additionally, promoting
the Christian significance of the year 2000 are
‘TimeLord’, a poster originating as a colour
supplement feature, updated and reprinted
because of its relevance to the millennium; and
the Jesus Video Project, issued with an
accompanying magazine version of Luke’s
Gospel entitled ‘The Man Behind the
Millennium’.

The arts and cultural sectors make important contributions to the wider economy
in the UK. Consumer spending on the performing arts alone in 1999 is estimated
at about £850 million. Arts and culture are a major influence on business location
and decisions affecting tourism. The arts are seen by Government as having a role
in helping to lift personal and community self-esteem, and developing skills and
confidence that open up wider economic and social opportunities. New space,
new work and new talent have a role in the regeneration of some of Britain’s inner
cities. The performing and visual arts, as well as the fine arts market, make
important contributions to the balance of payments.
Among developments during 1999—2000 have been the launches of significant
new museums and arts complexes—among them Tate Modern and Somerset
House in London and The Lowry in Salford Quays; the flourishing of British
arts festivals; and a record amount given in arts sponsorship.
Government Policy
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) implements government policy and
administers expenditure on national museums
and art galleries in England, the Arts Council of
England (see p. 245), the British Library and
other national arts and heritage bodies. Other
responsibilities include the regulation of the
film and music industries, broadcasting and the
press, the National Lottery and the export
licensing of antiques.
DCMS’s stated aim is to improve the
quality of life for all through cultural activities
and to strengthen the creative industries.
Among its targets are:
• to promote competitiveness, at home and
abroad, in the creative industries and
improve the collection of statistical data
so that meaningful comparisons can be
regularly made;
• to implement a jointly funded strategy
for the British film industry;
• to increase visitor numbers to the major
national museums in line with the
removal of all entry charges (see p. 258),
if trustees decide to remove charges
while maintaining the quality of
exhibitions;

• to attract new audiences for the
performing arts—with the help of the
New Audiences Fund;
• to raise standards of care of collections and
public access through the Challenge Fund;
• to double the number of public library
Internet connections; and
• to establish a new funding council for the
performing and visual arts and for film, and
new arrangements for supporting the crafts.
The National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland
Assembly have responsibility for the arts in
their countries, including museums, galleries
and libraries, and their respective Arts
Councils (see below). The Scottish Executive
published a National Cultural Strategy in
August 2000.
Government funds are distributed to arts
organisations indirectly, through bodies such
as the Arts Councils, the Film Council and
Scottish Screen.
The Creative Industries Task Force, set up
in 1998 to identify issues vital to the economic
health of the creative industries, organised a
work programme which included skills
development, ensuring access to capital,
stressing the importance of intellectual
property, export promotion, regional activity,
and Britain’s image overseas.
The Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team
(QUES F) monitors financial management
across DCMS sectors.
Arts Councils
The independent Arts Councils of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the
main channels for the distribution of
government grants and Lottery funding to the
visual, performing and community arts and to
literature, d he Arts Councils give financial
assistance and advice not only to the major
performing arts organisations, but also to
small touring theatre companies, experimental
performance groups and literary organisations.
They provide funds for training arts
administrators and help to develop
sponsorship and local authority support. In
addition to promoting education and public
access to, and participation in, performing and
visual arts and literature, the Arts Councils
commission research into the effects of the
arts and develop forward strategies.
The Arts Council of England (ACE) is the
strategic authority for the arts in England and
acts as their ‘champion’. It rewards quality
through its annual award allocations and
through its stabilisation programme, which
helps arts organisations manage long-term
change. ACE’s Recovery Programme is
designed to provide rapid, shorter-term help
to arts groups with pressing financial
difficulties.
ACE funds the major national arts
producing organisations, including the Royal
Opera, the Royal Ballet, the Birmingham
Royal Ballet, English National Opera (ENO),
the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), the
Royal National Theatre (RNT) and the South
Bank Centre; and the main touring companies,
such as Opera North and English National
Ballet, while delegating decisions for regional
and local activities to the ten English Regional
Arts Boards (RABs). Other sources of money
for the RABs are the British Film Institute
and local authorities.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Finance
In England planned central government
expenditure through the DCMS in 2000—01
amounts to £226.3 million for museums and
galleries; £231.6 million for the visual and
performing arts; £103.7 million for
broadcasting and the media (including film);
and £107.7 million for libraries and archives.
ACE has a grant of £237.2 million in 2000—01
(an increase of £10 million on 1999—2000). In
addition, the National Lottery arts proceeds
distributed by the Arts Councils amount to
about £186 million in 2000—01 (£150 million
for the ACE).
Planned 2000-01 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is respectively £29.5 million, £15.4
million and £7.5 million, between 4 and 9 per
cent up on 1999-2000. The Scottish Executive
is also providing £40 million for Scotland’s
National Galleries and Museums, National
Library and film industry, while the National
Assembly for Wales is giving some £38.8
million for Wales’s National Museum,
National Library and other arts. Planned
spending by the Department of Culture, Arts
and Leisure for Northern Ireland on the
National Museums (see p. 261), arts and
libraries amounts to just over £40 million in
2000-01.
National Lottery
By December 1999, Lottery awards of over
£1.4 billion had been announced by the Arts
Councils for arts projects. Grants for the
acquisition of works of art from the Heritage
Lottery Fund (HLF—see p. 322) to
museums, galleries and other organisations
between June 1995 and April 2000 amounted
to £60.8 million. The Lottery’s New
Opportunities Fund has £120 million to help
develop a network of community centres,
linked to libraries and the National Grid for
Learning (see p. 131), to open up access to
information. Millennium Festival Awards for
All, allowing community organisations to
apply for grants of up to £5,000, have been
available throughout Great Britain since April
1999. Larger one-off Lottery awards support
millennium arts projects. The Millennium
Theatre in Londonderry, which has received
£2.5 million, will open at the end of 2000.
NESTA
The National Endowment for Science,
Technology and the Arts has initial finance of
£200 million from the National Lottery. It
aims to help talented individuals or groups to
develop their full potential; to turn creativity
into products and services that are effectively
exploited with rights effectively protected; and
to contribute to public knowledge and
appreciation of science, technology and the
arts. It grants fellowships worth up to £75,000
over three years.
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain about 1,000 local
museums and art galleries, and a network of
public libraries (see p. 263). They also provide
grant aid for professional and amateur
orchestras, theatres, and opera and dance
companies. In England total expenditure on
museums, galleries and libraries for 1999-2000
was £937 million. Fourteen authorities are
piloting Local Cultural Strategies, a DCMS
scheme to bring cultural issues into the heart of
local government planning.
The Corporation of London, the local
authority for the City of London, is one of the
largest sponsors of the arts in the UK, with a
budget of £49 million in 1999—2000 from
various resources. The Corporation owns,
funds and manages the Barbican Centre
(Europe’s largest multi-arts and conference
centre), which has the London Symphony
Orchestra and RSC as residents; owns, funds
and manages the Guildhall School of Music
and Drama; jointly funds and manages the
Museum of London with the DCMS; and
funds various other cultural activities.
Business and Other Sponsorship
Total UK business investment in the arts rose
by 22 per cent in 1998—99, to over £140
million. London attracted most of the
investment—£64.5 million—followed by
Scotland and the West Midlands. Museums
246
16: CULTURE
and galleries received £31.7 million each;
theatre received £17 million; music £12.3
million; and opera £13 million. The year saw a
large rise in sponsorship of capital projects,
and smaller rises in corporate donations and
sponsorship. As one example, HSBC, the
UK’s largest bank, is giving £1.5 million over
three years to the National Youth Theatre, the
National Youth Orchestra, the National Youth
Ballet and the National Opera Studio.
Among sponsorship from charitable trusts,
the Jerwood Foundation gives about £3.5
million a year in capital and revenue grants,
with emphasis on encouraging young
performers. In 1999 the opening of the new
Jerwood Library at Trinity Hall in Cambridge
took place and in January 2000 the Foundation
pledged £500,000 over five years to the Young
Singers Programme at ENO. In addition to its
£3 million towards the renewal of the Royal
Court Theatre in London (with two
auditoriums—the Jerwood Theatre
Downstairs and the Jerwood Theatre
Upstairs), it plans to continue with revenue
funding for the theatre of up to £100,000 a
year, provided it comes up with new plays by
young writers. The first grants in the Artworks
programme (to introduce children to the visual
arts) of the Vivien Duffield Foundation were
also announced. To celebrate National
Children’s Art Day on 5 May 2000, £20,000
was made available to create special events in
museums and galleries throughout the UK.
Arts & Business exists to promote and
encourage partnerships between business and
the arts. It has over 350 business members and
manages the Arts & Business New Partners
Programme on behalf of ACE and the DCMS.
Under the programme, investments can be
made in arts/business partnerships, which
bring benefits to both parties. Arts & Business
New Partners was launched in April 2000,
replacing the former Pairing Scheme, which
raised £10 million from business and
contributed over £160 million (including £52
million from the Government) to the arts over
16 years. Arts & Business also runs the Arthur
Andersen Skills Bank and the NatWest Board
Bank, which enable 3,000 volunteers from
companies to loan their skills, in computing,
accountancy, marketing or personnel, to local
arts groups on a part-time basis.
Some £4 million from the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts, run by the Pools
Promoters Association, was used to help the
arts in 1999 in the form of awards. Many arts
organisations also benefit from the fund¬
raising activities of Friends groups and from
private individuals’ financial support.
Cultural Diversity
The Arts Councils promote cultural diversity
in the arts. The Scottish Arts Council (SAC),
for example, while supporting Gaelic culture,
is also funding the Indian Mahila Cultural
Committee in Glasgow and the African and
Caribbean Resource Centre in Scotland.
CADMAD, funded by the Arts Council of
Wales (ACW), runs a cultural diversity
training programme for artists and arts
organisations. Measures to foster cultural
diversity in Northern Ireland include funding
for arts in both the Irish language and Ulster
Scots. The Councils encourage the growth of
Caribbean carnival across the UK, of which
the most famous is the annual Netting Hill
Carnival, the largest street festival in Europe.
In recent years the Belfast Carnival has
attracted an international audience. With
financial support from ACE’s Regional Black
Theatre Initiative, Kuumba, an arts centre in
Bristol, takes part in youth projects with the
Bristol Old Vic, while the work of black
writers in Britain has been promoted through
Listening Posts. This included CDs of authors
reading their own work, distributed through
festivals, libraries and the media.
Arts and Disability
The National Disability Arts Forum and other
similar national agencies are funded by ACE,
as are creative organisations, such as Candoco
Dance Company, composed of disabled and
non-disabled dancers, and Graeae, a theatre
company promoting performers with
disabilities. ACE also supports an
apprenticeship scheme for disabled people in
arts organisations, such as the RSC, which is
part of an initiative aimed at increasing
employment opportunities for disabled people
in the arts; and projects involving disabled
artists in schools. The SAC supports ArtLink
247
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and Project Ability, which promote the
development of disabled people’s creativity.
Provision of access, in the widest sense, for
disabled people in arts buildings is a major
criterion for capital grants made from the
National Lottery (see p. 117).
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in the UK give people the
chance of seeing a range of specialist art and of
taking part in activities, especially educational
projects. Nearly all the centres are professionally
managed, while using the services of volunteers.
They are assisted mainly by the Arts Councils,
RABs and local authorities, while ACE
currently funds two national centres in
London, the South Bank Centre and the
Institute of Contemporary Arts, popular for
its art films and avant-garde exhibitions. Pier
Arts Centre at Stromness (Orkney) and
Dundee Contemporary Arts, the latter with
two galleries, two cinemas, a print studio and
activity rooms, are two of the centres supported
by the SAC. The ACW funds Chapter Arts
Centre in Cardiff, which helps to promote
international artists and collaborations.
The British Council
The British Council (see p. 93) is the UK’s
international organisation for educational and
cultural relations. It works in 243 cities in 110
countries to promote international
understanding of British creativity in the arts,
literature and design, as well as education,
good governance and science. It aims to
represent a modern and culturally diverse
picture of the UK. In 1999 it supported some
3,000 cultural events overseas. The Visiting
Arts Office of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland is a joint venture of the British
Council with the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office, the Arts Councils and the Crafts
Council. It encourages the inward flow to the
UK of arts from other countries.
Broadcasting
Arts programmes broadcast by BBC radio and
television and the independent companies (see
chapter 17) have won many international
awards, such as at the Prix Italia and
Montreux International Television Festivals.
Independent television companies also give
grants for arts promotion in their regions.
Broadcasting has created its own art forms—
nothing like the arts documentary or drama
series exists in any other medium.
Among British successes in the 1999 51st
international Emmy awards, which honour the
best television shows, Helen Mirren and Peter
O’Toole won the awards for Best Actress and
Best Actor in a mini-series or movie {The
Passion ofAyn Rand and Joan of Arc
respectively); Horatio Hornblower, a joint
British-American production, won the award
for Best Mini-Series; while Tracey Ullman won
Best Guest Actress for her part in Ally McBeal.
For the second year running the 88-year-old
Thora Hird won the BAFTA television award
for Best Actress (ITV’s Lost for Words). Other
BAFTA awards went to Michael Gambon for
Best Actor in Wives and Daughters (BBC ONE)
and to Channel 4’s ‘This is Modern Art’ for
Best Arts Programme. Honor Blackman, Diana
Rigg, Linda Thorson and Joanna Lumley won
special awards for their contribution to The
Avengers/New Avengers.
The BBC has five orchestras, which
employ many of Britain’s full-time
professional musicians. Each week it
broadcasts about 100 hours of classical and
other music (both live and recorded) on Radio
3 (see p. 269). BBC Radio 1 broadcasts rock
and pop music, and much of the output of
BBC Radio 2 is popular and light music. BBC
Music Live in May 2000 featured more than
6,000 events, for all tastes, throughout the
UK. In the drumming relay, a beat travelled
from Londonderry across Great Britain to the
Channel Islands. Of the two national
commercial radio stations which broadcast
music, Classic FM offers mainly classical and
Virgin Radio plays rock. Much of the output
of the UK’s local radio stations is popular and
light music.
Attendance at the 1999 Promenade
Concerts (the ‘Proms’), the world’s largest
music festival, was 88 per cent of capacity. For
the 2000 season the BBC commissioned seven
works from British composers, including
Robin Holloway’s First Symphony and a
248
16: CULTURE
religious work by Jonathan Harvey (Mothers
shall not cry). A Millennium Youth Day, in
which some 800 young musicians filled the
Albert Hall, premiered four compositions and
joined in a performance of Walton’s
Belshazzar’s Feast. Star international
symphony orchestras, such as the Berlin,
Dallas, San Francisco and Rotterdam
orchestras, contrasted with a late-night prom
that featured the Cuban band Los Van Van
and Vocal Sampling, a group which creates a
20-strong salsa band with their voices.
Festivals
Some 500 professional arts festivals take place
in the UK each year. In 1999 they attracted
some £10 million in sponsorship from
business. Their appeal has broadened, with
what had been mainly classical music festivals
now offering jazz, contemporary, world and
early music. There are many more literature
and film festivals, such as Brief Encounters in
Bristol for short films, 60 or so festivals
concentrating on poetry, and visual arts
festivals, such as the Liverpool Biennial.
The 2000 Edinburgh International Festival
featured some 180 performances of music,
theatre, opera and dance, as well as lectures and
discussions. Its home-grown element included
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra with Christian
Zacharias performing a cycle of Mozart’s piano
concertos; a series of concerts celebrating
Scottish song; and Scottish Opera performing
Das Rheingold. The Abbey Theatre, Dublin
performed \ alle-Inclan’s Barbaric Comedies and
the New York City Ballet made its first visit to
Britain for 11 years. The Edinburgh Festival
h ringe, with programmes (including street
events) to suit all tastes, takes place alongside
the main events. In 2000 there were over 17,000
performances by over 600 different companies.
Other annual Edinburgh events include the
International Film Festival and the Book
Festival.
At the 2000 53rd Aldeburgh Festival its
artistic director, Thomas Ades, conducted the
first performance of his choral work America
and Britten’s Peter Grimes was given in
concert. The St Magnus festival in Orkney
included two premieres by the festival’s
founder, Peter Maxwell Davies.
For a calendar of the main arts events in the
UK in 2000, see Appendix 5, p. 551.
DRAMA
Among unusual theatrical events in 1999,
the RSC at Stratford -upon-Avon
performed Shakespeare’s Edward III, the
first professional group to do so after the
play was officially restored to the canon in
1998 and computer analyses of the
language had satisfied scholars that it was
Shakespeare’s work. Fanny Burney’s
comedy A Busy Day (c. 1800), lost until
the 1980s, had its first West End staging in
2000. An ACE Lottery grant of £6 million
has contributed most of the cost of
building the Theatre by the Lake at
Keswick (Cumbria) on the banks of
Derwentwater. The ten-strong repertory
company celebrated its opening with an
early 19th-century musical play, The
Lakers by James Plumptre, a skit on early
tourism in the Lake District.
A full-size reconstruction in London of
the Elizabethan Rose Theatre (on the site
of Collins Music Hall), using the set (oak,
with a thatched roof) made famous in the
film Shakespeare m Love, is being planned,
as part of a £27 million development.
ACE and the RABs are spending more than
£50 million to support drama, including
regional theatre, in 2000-01—21 per cent of
ACE’s total grant. In Scotland, Dundee
Repertory Theatre received a further
£286,000 SAC Lottery grant in early 2000 to
create Scotland’s only full-time ensemble
company, in addition to the £2.4 million
granted in 1999 for building improvements to
expand its range of work. The ACW has
established Clwyd Theatr Cymru as a Wales
National Performing Arts Company,
supported major building work at the Grand
Theatre in Swansea, and funded new
equipment at the Sherman in Cardiff.
In 1999 the London West End theatres
were credited with bringing £1 billion into the
London economy, when additional

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
In February 2000 London’s Royal Court
Theatre re-opened after a four-year
restoration, costing £28 million, under
retiring artistic director Stephen Daldry.
The opening play, under new artistic
director Ian Rickson, was Dublin Carol by
Conor McPherson.
London’s Donmar Warehouse, of which
Sam Mendes is artistic director, gained a
£270,000 annual grant from ACE, to help
assure its future.
The RNT topped the winners at the 2000
Olivier Awards for achievement in the West
End theatre: Trevor Nunn for Best Director
(Nick Dear’s adaptation of Gorky’s
Sutnmerfolk; Troilus and Cressida; The
Merchant of Venice); Honk! The Ugly
Duckling by George Stiles and Anthony
Drewe, and directed by Julia McKenzie, for
Best New Musical; and Bernstein’s Candide
for Outstanding Musical Production. Henry
Goodman won Best Actor for his Shylock in
The Merchant of Venice and Roger Allam and
Patricia Hodge were Best Supporting Actor
and Actress, in Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s
Money (1840). Simon Russell Beale won
Best Actor in a Musical (Candide). Away
from the RNT, Janie Dee took Best Actress
award (having already won the Evening
Standard and Critics’ Circle awards) for her
performance in Alan Ayckbourn’s Comic
Potential, and Barbara Dickson was Best
Actress in a Musical (Spend, Spend, Spend).
Peter O’Toole won an award for
Outstanding Achievement. The BBC award
for Best New Play went to Goodnight
Children Everywhere (RSC at the Pit) by
Richard Nelson.
British candidates won eight out of 21
Tony awards in New York: Jennifer Ehle for
Best Actress and Stephen Dillane for Best
Actor (in Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing);
Michael Blakemore for Best Director twice
(in Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen—which also
won Best Play—and in his revival of Kiss Me
Kate); Roy Dotrice for Best Featured Actor;
Elton John and Tim Rice for Best Musical
Score (Aida); and Bob Crowley for Best
Scenic Design. In January 2000 Kenneth
Branagh received the John Gielgud Golden
Quill award, given by the Shakespeare Guild
of the United States to an outstanding
interpreter of the Bard.
meals has been added to the cost of a ticket. As
well as popular musicals, such as Cats and The
Phantom of the Opera (which has taken £2
billion worldwide), more serious plays, such as
Conor McPherson’s The Weir, have enjoyed
long runs. Famous film actors returning to the
London stage have contributed to the revival
of theatre-going.
The RNT’s director, Trevor Nunn, has in
1999-2000 run a repertory system with a
permanent ensemble, handling works from
Shakespeare to musicals, on all three stages.
The RNT’s See a Play programme encourages
young people aged between 15 and 26 to sign
up for a series of plays for £5 a ticket. Critics
praised the Shoreditch Shakespeare project (at
the old Gainsborough studios) in 2000,
conceived by the Almeida Theatre’s artistic
directors, Jonathan Kent and Ian McDiarmid,
which gave Ralph Fiennes in Shakespeare’s
Richard II cin<\ Coriolanus. In 2000—01 the
RSC at Stratford is giving all eight of
Shakespeare’s history plays (‘This England
—The Histories’) from Richard II (with
Samuel West) to Richard III. One of the
events of 2000 was Kathleen Turner at the
Gielgud as Mrs Robinson in Neil Simon’s The
Graduate, adapted and directed by Terry
Johnson. At the autumn 1999 Belfast Festival
an Irish cast’s version of Beckett’s Waiting for
Godot was noted for its ‘minute care and
power’.
In 1999 the SAC launched the three-year
Scotland Onstage initiative to stimulate the
best in Scottish theatre. Eighteen winners
were announced at Christmas 1999, with
awards totalling £480,000. Successes have
included Noel Coward’s Cavalcade at Glasgow
Citizens Theatre and the children’s play The
Happy Prince, a collaboration between the
MacRobert in Stirling and the Lemon Tree in
Aberdeen.
Some of the UK’s 300 professional theatres
are privately owned, but most belong to local
authorities or to non-profit-making
organisations. In January 2000 Andrew

Lloyd-Webber’s Really Useful Group (with
NatWest Equity Partners) bought control for
£87.5 million often London theatres, including
the Apollo, Theatre Royal (Drury Lane), Her
Majesty’s, Cambridge and the Gielgud.
London
London’s 100 or so theatres include:
• the RNT, which stages modern and
classical plays in its three auditoriums on
the South Bank;
• the Barbican Centre, with two
auditoriums, and home for half the year
to the RSC, with a varied drama
programme for the other half, including
the Barbican International Theatre
Event; and
• the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane
Square, home to the English Stage
Company, which specialises in new work.
Since its opening in 1996, Shakespeare’s
Globe on London’s South Bank has attracted
an attendance of 250,000 a year, with about 90
per cent capacity, brings in £2 A million at the
box office and runs at a profit. With its
exhibition centre, it cost £30 million to build,
with a grant of £12.4 million from ACE
lottery funds. It has established itself as a
centre for Shakespearean studies and is
contributing to the regeneration of the
neighbourhood.
In 1999 West End attendances increased
slightly on 1998. Total West End box office
takings were £266.6 million compared with
£257.9 million in 1998.
Theatre for Young People
The RNT’s Education Programme
encourages access to drama on a national level
through youth theatre projects, touring
productions, workshops, rehearsed readings,
work in schools and a nationwide membership
scheme. The year 1999 saw the culmination of
the third cycle of B P’s National Connections
youth programme, a partnership between 150
youth theatre companies and ten theatres
across the UK. The National Youth Theatre

Training
The DCMS and the Department for Education
and Employment (DfEE) disburse £19 million
a year in grants for drama and dance students
for tuition and maintenance. Over 800 students
a year cover their tuition fees on the same basis
as other higher and further education pupils.
All training must be at accredited institutions
and towards recognised qualifications, with
annual evaluation by the DCMS and DfEE to
ensure that standards are maintained. Among
drama schools which train actors, directors,
technicians and stage managers are the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the
London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art
(LAMDA), and the Drama Centre (all in
London); the Bristol Old Vic School, the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
(Glasgow) and the Welsh College of Music and
Drama (Cardiff). Competition to enter the
School of Performing Arts at Stratford-upon-
Avon College is keen.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
MUSIC
In the UK more people attend live music
performances than football matches. In 1999,
200.3 million music albums and 75.7 million
singles were sold in the UK, while turnover
increased by 1.1 per cent on the previous year
to £1,133.4 million. Gross overseas earnings
by the UK music industry were some £1.3
billion, of which more than half came from the
sales of recordings, and the net surplus on
overseas trade was about £500 million. The
industry is worth about £4 billion a year (with
domestic consumers spending about £3.3
billion a year on pop, classical music and
opera) and employs about 130,500 people.
The Government’s Music Industry Forum
advises the DCMS on how best it can promote
the use of digital technologies, stimulate
exports and see to the health of the industry’s
creative base.
Orchestral and Choral Music
London leads the world for the wide range of
music available throughout the year. In
classical music alone, there are four symphony
orchestras with public subsidy, two more at
the BBC, one at ENO and one at Covent
Garden. The London Symphony (LSO—
which gave 85 concerts in 1999-2000), with an
ACE grant of £1.3 million in 1999-2000, gets
matching funding from the Corporation of
London, and, from its residence at the
Barbican Centre in the City, has attracted
sponsorship from banks and City firms. In
2000 the LSO marked the 75th birthday of
Pierre Boulez with a project to trace the
development of orchestral music through the
20th century, with performances all over the
world. Every year it gives a series of concerts
in New York.
National Orchestra Week in March 2000
celebrated orchestras and orchestral music
throughout the UK and was partly funded by
ACE’s New Audiences Programme. Open
days enabled the public to take part in
workshops and discussions, to attend
rehearsals and to meet the players. Concerts
by English orchestras at the Royal Festival
Hall from January to July were given by the
Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic
(under Bernard Haitink), the BBC Symphony
(under Andrew Davis), and the City of
Birmingham Symphony (under Simon
Rattle). The smaller Queen Elizabeth Hall
featured the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment and chamber groups: the
London Mozart Players, the Academy of St
Martin-in-the-Fields and the English
Chamber Orchestra. The Bournemouth
Symphony, Manchester’s Halle Orchestra and
the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic are well-
known orchestras outside London. The Royal
Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra each give over 100
performances a year and attract over £2
million and £1.3 million respectively in SAC
funding and sponsorship. In December 1999
the acclaimed BT Scottish Ensemble made a
special tour {Tabula Rasa) of Scotland, its
programme including Vivaldi and Arvo Part.
Among Britain’s famous choral groupings
is the Sixteen (16 singers specialising in early
English polyphony and Renaissance music,
under their conductor Harry Christophers),
with an international reputation and 70 CDs
to their name, who embarked on a tour during
2000 of 14 of England’s cathedrals. At the
Covent Garden festival in London in May,
they gave Handel’s oratorio Israel in Egypt, the
choir and small orchestra (playing period
instruments) forming an oval surrounded by
the audience. English and Welsh choral
societies have done much to foster the oratorio
tradition at the leading music festivals.
English ecclesiastical choral singing is
exemplified by the choirs of cathedrals and by
those of the colleges at Cambridge and
Oxford. The choir at Westminster Cathedral
is known for its more astringent tone (based
on that of the Sistine Chapel at Rome) and has
inspired works from modern English
composers.
Two celebrated events in the musical
calendar are the Leeds International
Pianoforte Competition for young pianists and
the biennial Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition, which attracts outstanding
young singers, and distinguished adjudicators,
from all countries. The BBC Young
Musicians contest in 2000 was won by the 18-
year-old cellist Guy Johnston (playing
Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto).

16: CULTURE
Pop and Rock Music
In 1999—2000 the Welsh contribution to
British pop, with the Stereophonies, Manic
Street Preachers, Catatonia and Super Furry
Animals as leading groups, and the veteran
Tom Jones, was again marked. Super Furry
Animals issued their fourth album, ‘Mwng’,
entirely in Welsh. Home-grown black talent is
also significant. Music of black origin
accounted for 40 per cent of all singles and 21
per cent of all album sales in the UK in 1998.
Black Voices, an a capella group from
Birmingham, have intrigued audiences. In
1999 the Technics Mercury Music Prize
(worth £25,000) went to Talvin Singh, whose
music is a fusion of Indian classical melodies
with present-day British dance music. Lynden
David Hall’s album The Other Side earned him
approval as one of Britain’s best soul singers.
At the international Grammy Awards in Los
Angeles the British singer Sting won two
awards, for Best Pop Album {Brand New Day)
and Best Male Pop Vocalist. Phil Collins won
for the soundtrack of the film Tarzan and
Elton John received the ‘legend’ award. Club
music also continued to be influential and
scored successes in the United States. In 2000
Robbie Williams became the most honoured
artist yet at the Brit Awards by winning two
more, for Best British Single and Best British
Video {She’s the One). Best British Female
Solo Artist was Beth Orton and Best British
Male Solo Artist was Tom Jones. The
Scottish group Travis won two awards, for
Best British Group and Best British Album
{The Man Who). Its success underscored a
renewed interest in guitar music. The Spice
Girls won a special award for Outstanding
Contribution. At the £ Awards in 1999, Keith
Richards of the Rolling Stones received the £)
Lifetime Achievement award.
At the 2000 Ivor Novello Awards for
popular songwriters, Paul McCartney was
given a fellowship of the British Academy of
Composers and Songwriters; the Pet Shop
Boys won an Outstanding Contribution to
British Music award; Fran Healy of Travis
was Songwriter of the Year {Why does it
always rain on me'f)\ and Elton John and Tim
Rice won for International Achievement in
Musical Theatre, for their musical The Lion
King, which opened in London in 1999.
Folk Music
Folk and traditional music has always been
strong in all parts of the UK. In Northern
Ireland, bands perform in pubs and clubs,
playing fiddles and other customary
instruments. Irish acoustic groups are also in
the Celtic tradition. Scottish and Welsh
festivals honour Gaelic and Celtic music and
song. The SAC highlights the diversity of
Scottish traditional music: its sampler CD,
Seriously Scottish, places traditional music
alongside other contemporary forms. The
sisters Jennifer and Hazel Wrigley have
recorded guitar and fiddle duets {Mither o’the
Sea) which show the strength of the Orkney
tradition. English folk groups since the early
1970s, such as Steeleye Span, have blended the
traditional and rock, and even used Gregorian
chant, when arranging material of their own.
Jazz and blues have influenced the songs of
Maddy Prior, whose voice has helped increase
the popularity of English folk music over 30
years. Kate Rushy sings in a Yorkshire dialect,
and has been praised for her ‘wit, character and
invigorating freshness’. In February 2000 the
BBC launched the Folk Awards.
Jazz and Blues
The Brecon, Cheltenham and London Oris
jazz festivals, Edinburgh International Jazz
and Blues Festival, and venues such as Ronnie
Scott’s in London’s Soho, have helped win
new audiences for jazz in the UK and showed
how it can evolve when exposed to other
musical influences, such as pop and Latin
American, and how its rhythms can change.
With John Rae’s Celtic Feet, an Edinburgh
group, folk has met modern jazz. In spring
2000 the keyboard and flugelhorn player
Django Bates demonstrated the meeting of
jazz and classical music when, with his jazz
quartet, Human Chain, he joined the Britten
Sinfonia for a series of concerts. The 2000
Bishopstock Blues Festival, held in Devon in
May, featured Jools Holland and Steve Earle.
Training
Professional training in music is given at
universities and conservatoires. The leading
253
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
London conservatoires are the Royal Academy
of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music. Outside London are
the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama (RSAMD), including the Alexander
Gibson School in Glasgow, the Royal
Northern College of Music in Manchester, the
Welsh College of Music and Drama in
Cardiff, and the Birmingham Conservatoire.
Other Educational Schemes
The National Foundation for Youth Music,
set up in 1999, aims to improve opportunities
for young people to get involved in music¬
making, with ^10 million a year from ACE
Lottery funds and donations from other
sources, including British Phonographic
Industry. In addition, some £150 million from
the DfEE’s standards fund will be used over
three years to help buy musical instruments
for schools, restore free tuition and provide
extra training for teachers. The LSD’s
educational outreach programme, Discovery,
will have use of St Luke’s, a disused
Hawksmoor church in east London, in
restoration for classes and rehearsals. UBS,
the international financial services
organisation, has guaranteed the project with
£3.5 million, to attract support from ACE and
the Jerwood Foundation.
Nearly a third of the players in the
European Community Youth Orchestra come
from the UK. There is also a National Youth
Jazz Orchestra and a network of other youth
jazz orchestras and wind bands.
OPERA
London’s Royal Opera House (ROH) at
Covent Garden reopened in December 1999
after a £214 million restoration and
redevelopment. Verdi’s Fa 1st aff (under
Haitink) relaunched the building with Bryn
Terfel in the title role. The ROH’s ACE grant
has increased by £4 million to £20 million for
2000-01 and it has cut prices for seats with
restricted views. The auditorium (2,100 seats),
the rake of the stalls, the Vilar Floral Hall,
restored as a meeting place and bar, the
covered terrace overlooking Covent Garden
piazza, and Linbury studio won wide
admiration.
ENO won a 2000 Olivier award for
Outstanding Achievement in Opera (for its
high standard of production and championing
of the works of Handel). David McVicar’s
1999 staging of Handel’sH/cb?# (1735)
brought praise for conductor Charles
Mackerras for his mastery of Handelian
splendour and for principal mezzo Sarah
Connolly as ‘a star of our baroque firmament’.
ENO’s world premiere of British composer
Mark-Anthony Turnage’s new opera The
Silver Tassie won high praise.
Welsh National Opera’s (WNO) production
of Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel in 1999 at
Sadler’s Wells in London also won an Olivier
award, for Best New Opera Production.
Among WNO’s other successes was John
Crowley’s staging of Britten’s The Turn of the
Screw, under Carlo Rizzi, with sopranos Janice
Watson and Mary Lloyd-Davies singled out for
their ‘standards of expressiveness and dramatic
power’. Critics warmed to Opera North’s
spring 2000 production of Ponchielli’s La
Gioconda and to Scottish Opera’s rendition of
Verdi’s Macbeth, also performed at the Vienna
Festival in May 2000.
Glyndebourne Opera (East Sussex), which
relies on private patrons for its summer season,
through its education department staged Zoe,
an opera performed by and aimed at senior
teenagers. One of its main season offerings in
2000 was Janacek’s_7cm/£ir (with Amanda
Roocroft and x\nja Silja) which won acclaim
from audiences and critics alike. Castleward
Opera in Co. Down revived Flotow’s Martha,
to widespread enthusiasm. Other country
house opera ventures included Garsington
(Oxfordshire), where the stage is a garden
terrace, and Longborough (Gloucestershire),
where a Wagner '‘mmi-Ring’ was performed in
a converted Cotswolds barn.
DANCE
The Royal Ballet is to have an enhanced status
and more performances at the ROH. In the
2000 season it gave retrospective performances
in honour of its two most important
choreographers, Frederick Ashton and
254
16: CULTURE
Kenneth MacMillan; its celebration of
contemporary International Choreography
ended with ballets by Siobhan Davies and
Ashley Page; and a quadruple bill focused on
the legacy of Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.
English National Ballet was at the Coliseum at
Christmas and the New Year with Nutcracker
(directed by Derek Deane) and Coppeha
(choreographer Ronald Hynd). Birmingham
Royal Ballet brought David Bintley’s Arthur—
Part One and Giselle to the ROH in early
summer 2000 and Northern Ballet Theatre
presented Carmen at Sadler’s Wells in March.
Scottish Ballet embarked on a new era of
classical and contemporary dance with the
appointment of Robert North as artistic
director. Rambert Dance Company, Britain’s
oldest ballet troupe, has become known for its
forward-looking creativity. At Sadler’s Wells
in 2000 it initiated a series of promenade
performances.
Spring Loaded, a showcase of Britain’s
dance and performance artists during
March—June 2000, began and ended with
works by Yolande Snaith. The Richard Alston
Dance Company’s acclaimed new programme
(including ‘The Signal of a Shake’) came to
London in March.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by specialist
schools, which include the Royal Ballet School,
the Central School of Ballet, the Northern
School of Contemporary Dance (Leeds) and
the London Contemporary Dance School.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Phoenix Dance Company and
English National Ballet, for example, have
won awards for their projects. Ludus Dance
Company, in Lancaster, works mainly with
young people. The National Youth Dance
Company gives a chance for young people to
work with professionals.
FILMS
More than 500 new screens have been built in
the UK since 1996. There are 186 multiplexes
(five or more screens) with 1,727 screens. The
number of feature films made with some UK
investment and production involvement in
1999 rose to 103, compared with 91 in 1998.
Of these, 97 UK-producer films included 71
wholly UK productions, of which 66 were
made mainly or entirely in the UK. The
number of international co-productions
involving UK producers increased from 15 in
1998 to 26 in 1999. The number of foreign-
producer films shot in the UK fell from 11 to
six. Total investment in these titles was
£570.1 million, compared with £487.2 million
in 1998. Major US studios played a significant
role in 1999, investing in 19 UK films with a
combined budget of £303.6 million. The
biggest wholly UK production in 1999 was the
James Bond movie The World is not Enough
(director Michael Apted), with a budget of
£50 million; next came The Beach (director
Danny Boyle), filmed almost entirely outside
Britain, with a budget of £23.5 million, and
The End of the Affair (with Julianne Moore
and Ralph Fiennes; director Neil Jordan), on
£20 million. Of the 97 UK-producer films, 37
received public funding, 17 of these benefiting
from ACE, SAC and ACW National Lottery
grants.
In 1999, UK cinemas took £583 million at
the box office, from 360 films on release,
compared with £539 million in 1998, from 356
films. Wholly UK films took a 16.5 per cent
market share in 1999, earning £96 million
between them and increasing their share
sixfold. (The 190 US films released in 1999
earned £470 million between them—80.5 per
cent of all takings, compared with 83.9 per
cent in 1998.) Admissions to cinemas which
take advertising rose from 135.2 million in
1998 to 139.1 million in 1999. (Admissions to
the National Film Theatre—NFT—and
regional film theatres numbered 360,000.)
Britain excels in the digital technologies of
film-making, which gives it importance as a
centre in the final stages of production.
Film Council
The Film Council (FC), which came into
being in April 2000, channels the majority of
public funding for film production in the UK;
it will be responsible for distributing £150

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
In 1999 the average European film took 78
per cent of European admissions in its home
market; 42 of Europe’s top 50 releases
(which included nine from the UK) in 1999
saw at least half of their ticket sales come
from the home market. An exception was
Notting Hill (with Julia Roberts and Hugh
Grant; director Roger Michell). While it
topped the list of most successful European
films in Europe, only 27 per cent (7.4
million out of 27.4 million) of its admissions
came from the UK. Of the top films at the
UK box office in 1999, Notting Hill (second)
took £30.3 million; The World is not Enough
(fifth) £20.6 million and Shakespeare in Love
(sixth) £20.3 million. In March 2000 British
successes at the Academy Awards were Sam
Alendes as Best Director {American Beauty,
which also won the award for Best Film);
Michael Caine as Best Supporting Actor
(The Cider House Rules); Christine Blundell
and Trefor Proud, and Lindy Hemming, for
Best Make-up and Best Costume Design
respectively (Mike Leigh’s Topsy-Turvy);
Phil Collins for Best Original Song {You’ll
be in my heart in Tarzan); and Kevin
MacDonald for Best Documentary Feature
{One Day in September). Mendes and Collins
had previously won Golden Globe awards,
judged by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association. Janet McTeer also won a
Golden Globe for Best Actress
{Tumbleweeds). At the BAFTA awards in
April American Beauty was judged Best
Film. Maggie Smith won Best Supporting
Actress {Tea with Mussolini) and Jude Law
Best Supporting Actor {The Talented Mr
Ripley). Lynne Ramsay won the Carl
Foreman award for Newcomer in British
Film {Ratcatcher). Best Adapted Screenplay
went to Neil Jordan for his version of
Graham Greene’s The End of the Affair. The
Alexander Korda award for Outstanding
British Film went to East is East, produced
by Leslee Udwin and directed by Damien
O’Donnell, on a budget of £2.5 million and
which had taken £14 million at the box
office before opening in the United States.
The Orange Audience award went to

wide remit, with cultural and industry
objectives: to create a coherent structure for
the UK film industry and to develop film
culture in the UK.
New film production funds and initiatives,
totalling £22 million, have been announced.
The FC’s New Cinema Fund will make £5
million available to radical and innovative
film-makers looking to use the latest digital
technology. Its £10 million Premiere
Production Fund is geared towards the
making of popular mainstream films and the
£5 million Film Development Fund will be
targeted at developing projects more
intensively before going into production. The
FC has absorbed the British Film
Commission, which aims to attract foreign
film-making and production investment into
the UK, and British Screen Finance, a private
sector company which previously provided
funding to British productions and co¬
productions. The FC has earmarked 20 per
cent of its production funds towards
encouraging European co-productions. It also
funds the British Film Institute {bfi; see
p. 257) to deliver its cultural and educational
objectives and has fully absorbed bfi
Production.
The FC also helps to fund the British Film
Office in Los Angeles, which promotes both
British exports and the advantages of British
studios to US film-makers.
Animation
Two prizes at the British Animation Awards
in 2000 went to Tim Hope’s The Wolfman, a
six-minute film made on a home computer in
a bedroom, manipulating hand-drawn
characters into 3-D imagery. Richard
Goleszowski’s Robbie the Reindeer: Hooves of
Fire, shown by the BBC at Christmas 1999,
256
16: CULTURE
also won an award. In addition, the FC
contributes £50,000 a year to a scheme for
experimental animation, in conjunction with
Channel 4.
Government Support
Government help for the film industry allows
a 100 per cent tax write-off on the production
and acquisition costs for British movies with
budgets of up to £15 million. The
Government supports a number of
organisations that promote the film industry,
headed by the FC. In addition, the
Government provides grants to Scottish
Screen, which promotes film-making in
Scotland and receives 13 per cent of SAC
Lottery funding on the arts, and to the
Northern Ireland Film Commission (NIFC),
which has a similar remit in the Province.
The Government has clarified the definition
criteria for British films, making it more
straightforward for internationally financed
productions to be classified as British and in the
process benefit from a UK film tax credit. This
new definition is already benefiting
international productions wanting to shoot in
the UK, such as the Steven Spielberg/Tom
Hanks 11-hour TV series, Band of Brothers,
which started filming in spring 2000.
British Film Institute
The development of the moving image as an
art form is promoted by the bfi, and by
Scottish Screen and the NIFC.
The bfi maintains the J. Paul Getty
Conservation Centre, which contains over
275,000 films and 200,000 television
programmes, together with extensive
collections of stills, posters and designs. The
bfi National Library forms the world’s largest
collection of film-related books, periodicals,
scripts and other written materials.
On the South Bank bfi activities include
running the NFT, which screens over 2,000
films and television programmes each year,
and the bfi London IMAX cinema, with
Britain’s largest screen. The bfi also runs the
annual London Film Festival, the 44th in
2000, and supports newer festivals in the UK,
such as the Leeds Children’s Film Festival
and the Brief Encounters short film festival in
Bristol. A new UK cinema exhibition strategy
also brings non-mainstream films into high
street multiplexes, and a network of
independent cinemas across the UK also
receives bfi support. Its educational activities
include courses, conferences and other events,
and helping to formulate national film
education policy.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries (£5.5
million in 1999—2000). It offers postgraduate
and short course training for directors, editors,
camera operators, animators and other
specialists. The School enrols 50-60 full-time
students a year and about 850 on short course
programmes. I he London International Film
School, the Royal College of Art and some
universities and other institutions of higher
education also offer courses in production.
The Skills Investment Fund, worth £1.5
million and run by Skillset, the National
Training Organisation for the industry, aims
to boost UK film production training. The FC
makes £5 million available for the Film
4 raining Fund, for screenwriters to gain
expertise in producing commercially attractive
screenplays; and a further £1 million to First
Movies, to enable children to make a first film
using low-cost digital technology.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Public cinemas must be licensed by local
authorities, which have a legal duty to prohibit
the admission of children to unsuitable films,
and may prevent the showing of any picture.
In assessing films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent non-
statutory body, the British Board of Film
Classification (BBFC), to which all items must
be submitted. It does not use any written code
of censorship, but can require cuts to be made
before granting a certificate; on rare occasions,
it refuses a certificate.
Films passed by the BBFC are put into one
of the following categories:
257
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• U (universal), suitable for all;
• PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at premises to which no one under 18 is
admitted, for example, licensed cinema
clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of its
designation.
MUSEUMS, GALLERIES AND THE
VISUAL ARTS
About 80 million visits a year are made to the
UK’s 2,500 or so museums and galleries open
to the public (in contrast to the 800 museums in
1980), which include the major national
collections, about 1,000 independent museums,
and 800 receiving support from local
authorities. About a third of international
visitors come to the UK because of its
museums. Some 40,000 staff are employed in
this sector. The Government’s 24-Hour
Museum website (www.24hounnuseum.org. uk),
which provides a gazetteer of all UK museums
and galleries, a magazine, search facilities and
educational resources, receives about 300,000
‘hits’ a month. The £15 million Designated
Challenge Fund made its first awards (£2.7
million) in 1999 to 49 institutions in England,
to encourage them to raise their standards of
collection care and access.
Museums and galleries in the UK receive
about £620 million a year in public
expenditure. National museums are financed
chiefly from government funds; some charge
for entry to their permanent collections and
special exhibitions; all children (since 1999)
and pensioners (since April 2000) have free
access to those sponsored by the DCMS, and
visits by children have gone up by 22 per cent.
In addition, the Government has asked that
from April 2001 the main national museums
in England that charge for admission should
reduce their entry fee to £1. The DCMS has
set aside £7 million in direct funding (in
addition to the £30 million set aside in 1998 to
make free admissions possible) if the museums
accept this offer. In Scotland admission to the
National Galleries of Scotland is free of
charge, and the Scottish Executive is making
an additional £2 million a year available to
enable the National Museums of Scotland to
abolish admission charges from 1 April 2001.
Museums and galleries maintained by local
authorities, universities and independent or
privately funded bodies may receive help in
building up their collections through grants via
the Area Museum Councils, which are funded
by Resource: the Council of Museums, Archives
and Libraries, which replaced the Museums and
Galleries Commission in April 2000, and the
Area Museum Councils throughout the UK.
Support to national and regional public and
independent museums and galleries is also given
by the Arts Councils and by trusts, voluntary
bodies, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the
National Art Collections Fund.
Resource is the strategic agency working
with and on behalf of museums, archives and
libraries across the UK. It also provides funds
to the seven English Area Museum Councils,
which supply services and their own small
grants to individual museums, and to the
Cultural Heritage National Training
Organisation and the Museum
Documentation Association.
Resource advises ministers on the
Acceptance in Lieu scheme, whereby pre¬
eminent works of art may be accepted by the
Government in settlement of tax and allocated
to public galleries. Items accepted in 1999-2000
include Van Dyck’s portrait of Abbe Scaglia
(National Gallery) and the Powis archive
(Shropshire Records and Research Centre).
By August 2000 UK museums were
estimated to have benefited from £598.5
million of National Lottery money, as well as
some £100 million from the Millennium
Fund. Recent Arts Lottery grants have
included nearly £16 million to the New Art
Gallery, Walsall, and £1.2 million to the new
258
16: CULTURE
Milton Keynes Art Gallery. Heritage Lottery
grants included £15 million to the
development of Manchester’s City Art Gallery
and £15.9 million to the new wing of the
National Portrait Gallery.
Among noted exhibitions in 1999-2000,
Liverpool staged Trace, the UK’s first
Biennial of Contemporary Art, featuring 61
artists from 24 countries. The Tate St Ives
featured the work of Wilhelmina Barns-
Graham, since 1940 at the heart of the St Ives
School of modern British painting. For its
Encounters exhibition in 2000, the National
Gallery in London persuaded 24 of the
world’s leading artists—including Auerbach
(Constable), Caulfield (Zurbaran), Freud
(Chardin) and Hockney (Ingres)—to create
new works in response to past masters in the
Gallery. Tate Britain has launched a scheme,
backed by a £375,000 Lottery grant, to
distribute some 175 of its greatest artworks to
galleries around England. A British surrealist,
Eileen Agar (d. 1991), had a retrospective at
the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art
and at Leeds City Art Gallery. ‘Sonic Boom—
the Art of Sound’ at the Hayward Gallery in
London explored sound with cacophony and
visual effects. The London Science Museum’s
Wellcome wing, costing £50 million, of which
£23 million was financed through a Lottery
grant, was unveiled in 2000. The Wallace
Collection has created extra space (launched to
celebrate its centenary in June 2000) in its
mansion (1777) in London’s Manchester
Square, at a cost of £10.5 million.
The Jerwood Prize (worth £30,000) is
awarded annually and reserved solely for
painters. It was won in 1999 by the British
abstract painter Prunella Clough, who has
since died. Film and video artist Steve
McQueen won the Tate’s 1999 Turner Prize.
The 1999 NatWest Art Prize (worth £26,000)
went to the photorealist Jason Brooks, while
the National Portrait Gallery’s £10,000 BP
Portrait Award in 2000 went to Victoria
Russell for her ‘Two Women in White’.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries
contain some of the world’s most
comprehensive exhibits of objects of artistic,
The former Tate Gallery in London was
relaunched in 2000 in two parts: the old
Gallery on Millbank, restored at a cost of
£32.3 million (of which £18.75 million
came from the Heritage Lottery Fund),
became late Britain. Housed in two-thirds
of the transformed Bankside power station,
Tate Modern is London’s first specialist
gallery of 20th-century art, with works by
Picasso, Mondrian, Pollock, Bacon,
Warhol and others (including an
unrivalled collection of late 20th-century
minimalist and conceptual art). The
project cost £134 million, with £50 million
from government funding. An extra £5
million a year of government funding will
keep admission free.
The collector Sir Denis Mahon has
arranged to leave 58 Baroque paintings, done
in Italy (among them works by Guercino,
Guido Reni, Domenichino and Luca
Giordano), to the National Art Collections
Fund, to be allocated to institutions that
do not charge for admission.
I he ‘British Art Show’, organised by
the Hayward Gallery, spotlighting
contemporary visual art and held every
five years, in 2000 displayed works by 57
artists, such as Paula Rego, Martin Creed
and David Shrigley; it began in Edinburgh
and then toured to Southampton, Cardiff
and Birmingham. The Hayward also
organised 30 touring exhibitions to 120
places in the UK, reaching an audience of
1.4 million. These shows included pieces
from ACE’s national loan collection of
7,000 works by modern British artists. The
Arnolfini (Bristol), MOMA (Oxford) and
Whitechapel Art Gallery (London) also
launch touring shows of modern and
contemporary art.

In Scotland the national collections are held
by the National Museums of Scotland and the
National Galleries of Scotland. The former
include the Royal Museum, the Museum of
Scotland, the Scottish National War Museum
and the Scottish Agricultural Museum, in
Edinburgh; the Museum of Flight, near North
Berwick; and the Museum of Costume at
Shambellie House near Dumfries. The new
Museum of Scotland, built at a cost of £52
million and devoted to the history of Scotland,
has won instant fame for its imaginative
displays and distinctive architecture.
The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and
the Dean Gallery, housing the Paolozzi gift of
sculpture and graphic art, and renowned Dada
and Surrealist collections. The National
Galleries also have deposits at Paxton House
near Berwick upon Tweed and Duff House
in Banff. In 1999-2000 the National Museums
of Scotland attracted some 800,000 visitors,
and the National Galleries of Scotland
960,000.

16: CULTURE
The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff
has a number of branches, including the
Museum of Welsh Life at St Fagans, the Slate
Museum at Llanberis and the Industrial and
Maritime Museum in the Cardiff Bay
development.
The National Museums and Galleries of
Northern Ireland comprise the Ulster
Museum in Belfast, the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down, and the
Ulster-American Folk Park in County
Tyrone.
Other Collections
The highly praised New Art Gallery, Walsall,
built at a cost of £21 million, houses a
collection of European Art bequeathed by
Kathleen Garman (widow of the sculptor Jacob
Epstein) and Sally Ryan, while The Lowry at
Salford Quays, which cost £96 million (£64
million of which came from ACE Lottery
funds), has galleries dedicated to the works of
L. S. Lowry. In London the Dulwich Picture
Gallery has benefited from an extensive, and
warmly received, makeover (by Rick Mather)
costing £8 million, while a £48 million
(including a £20.75 million Lottery grant)
development of Somerset House provided
space for the Gilbert Collection of 800 pieces
of English and European decorative art.
Other important collections in London
include the Museum of London; the
Courtauld Institute Galleries (containing
masterpieces of 14th-20th-century European
painting); and the London Transport
Museum.
Museums outside London include those
associated with universities, such as the
Ashmolean in Oxford, the Fitzwilliam at
Cambridge and the Hunterian in Glasgow.
The Burrell Collection, also in Glasgow, has
an unrivalled display of tapestries, paintings
and objets d'art.
Among a number of national art exhibiting
institutions is the Royal Academy of Arts, at
Burlington House in London, which holds an
annual Summer Exhibition (232nd in 2000),
the world’s largest open present-day art
display, and other important ones during the
year. Anyone claiming the status of an artist of
‘distinguished merit’ and seeking ‘reputation
and encouragement’ may submit works to the
Summer Exhibition. In 2000, 1,516 were
chosen, representing 628 artists, from an entrv
of over 13,000. The Royal Scottish Academy
holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There
are also children s shows, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Open-air museums depict the life of an area
or preserve early industrial remains, such as
the Weald and Downland Museum in West
Sussex, the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in
Shropshire and the North of England Open
Air Museum at Beamish in County Durham.
Skills of the past are rev ived in a number of
‘living’ museums, such as the Gladstone
Pottery Museum near Stoke-on-Trent and the
Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in Cheshire.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities (these
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmiths’ College of Art, London), which
have absorbed the former independent art
schools, and in further education colleges and
private art schools. Some of these institutions
award degrees at postgraduate level. The
Royal College of Art in London is the only
postgraduate school of art and design in the
world. Art is also taught at an advanced level
at the four Scottish art schools.
University courses concentrate largely on
academic disciplines, such as the history of art.
The Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
U niversity of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College London are leading institutions. Art is
a foundation subject in the National
Curriculum in England (see p. 126). The
Society for Education through Art, among
other activities, encourages schools to buy
original works by organising an annual
‘Pictures for Schools’ exhibition.
Export Control of Works of Art
The UK market is second only to that of the
United States. 4 he UK’s art and antiques
trade handles about 70 per cent of European
art sales, employs about 50,000 people,
261
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
brought in about ^470,000 in foreign currency
in 1999-2000 and has an annual turnover of
£2.5 billion. Auctions of works of art take
place in the main auction houses (two of the
longest established being Sotheby’s and
Christie’s), and through private dealers.
A licence is required before certain items
can be exported, and if a DCMS Expert
Adviser objects to the granting of a licence,
the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. If
the Committee considers a work to be of
national importance, it can recommend to the
Government that a decision be deferred on the
licence application for a specified time to give
a chance for an offer to be made to buy it at or
above the recommended fair market price.
The UK has resisted an EU proposal to
impose artists’ resale rights, whereby the price
of any work of art sold during an artist’s
lifetime, or for 70 years after his or her death,
would include a tax payable to the artist or
heirs. It has, however, agreed an EU
compromise—a 15-year transitional period
(from 2000) to phase in the measure and a
maximum payment on any work at £7,650,
with a minimum value of a work of £4,000.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
Over 200 literary prizes are awarded yearly in
the UK, ranging in value from £30 to
£30,000, and for many different categories of
work. The winner of the 1999 Booker Prize
for Fiction (worth £20,000; UK and
Commonwealth citizens eligible) was the
South African writer J. M. Coetzee, for
Disgrace, while the Whitbread awards (valued
at £2,000 each with £21,000 extra for Book of
the Year; for British subjects), announced in
January 2000, were distributed as follows:
• Poetry award and Whitbread Book of the
Year: Seamus Heaney, for his translation
of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf,
• Novel award: Rose Tremain, Music and
Silence',
• First Novel award: Tim Lott, White City
Blue',
• Biography award: David Cairns, Berlioz',
and
• Children’s Book of the Year (£10,000):
J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban.
Billy’s Rain, a collection of poems by Hugo
Williams, won the 1999 T. S. Eliot Prize
(worth £5,000). J. K. Rowling was named
Author of the Year by more than 100
members of the British book industry at the
British Book Awards in February 2000. The
Orange Prize for Fiction (£30,000) in 2000,
open to any woman writing in English, went
to the British author Linda Grant for When I
Lived in Modern Times.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works (including computer programs and
databases), films, sound recordings, cable
programmes, broadcasts and the typographical
arrangement of published editions, are
automatically protected by copyright in the UK
if they meet the legal requirements for
protection. In general terms, copyright
protection may also be given to works first
published in (or, in the case of a broadcast or a
cable programme, made in or sent from) EU
member states, or from countries party to
international copyright conventions, the World
Trade Organisation or reciprocal agreements.
The copyright owner has rights against
unauthorised reproduction, public performance,
broadcasting, rental and lending, issue to the
public and adaptation of his or her work; and
against importing, possessing, dealing with or
providing means for making unauthorised copies.
In most cases the author is the first owner of the
copyright, and the term of copyright in literary,
dramatic, musical and artistic works is generally
the life of the author and a period of 70 years
from the end of the year in which he or she dies.
For films the term is 70 years from the end of the
calendar year in which the death occurs of the
last to die of the following: principal director,
authors of the screenplay and dialogue, or
composer of music specifically created for and
used in the film. Sound recordings are
protected for 50 years from the end of the year
of making or release, and broadcasts for 50 years
from the end of the year of broadcast.
262
16: CULTURE
Subject to qualifying requirements,
performers are also given automatic protection
against unauthorised broadcast or inclusion in
a cable television programme, or recording, of
live performances, reproduction of recordings,
and issue to the public or rental or lending of
copies of a recording. These rights in
performances last for 50 years from the year of
performance or release of a recording of it.
Performers also have a right to equitable
remuneration for the playing in public, or
inclusion in a broadcast or cable programme
service, of a commercially published sound
recording of their performance. There is also a
right against extraction and re-utilisation of
the contents of a database ^sui generis database
rights’), where there has been substantial
investment in obtaining, verifying or
presenting the contents of the database.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association, the Royal Society of
Literature and the Welsh Academy (Yr
Academi Gymreig). The leading society for
studies in the humanities is the British
Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the
British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several devoted to particular
authors, such as Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. The Poetry Society sponsors poetry
readings and recitals. London’s South Bank
Centre and the British Library run
programmes of literary events.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service. There are almost
5,000 public libraries in the UK. In Great
Britain more than 34 million people (58 per
cent of the population) are members of their
local library and about half of these borrow at
least once a month. About 480 million books
and 37 million audio-visual items were
borrowed from UK public libraries in
1999-2000. Adult fiction accounted for 50 per
cent, adult non-fiction for 25 per cent and
children’s books for 23 per cent.
Many libraries have collections of CDs,
records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local
history, and all provide services for children,
while reference and information sections, and
art, music, commercial and technical
departments, meet a growing demand. The
information role is important for all libraries:
nearly all have personal computers for public
use and, in November 1999, 41 per cent had
Internet connections. A government initiative
under the New Opportunities Fund (see
p. 117) is providing £20 million for
information and communications technology
training of library staff and £50 million for
enabling library material to be stored and
accessed in digitised form.
The Government is advised (since April
2000) by Resource. It is committed to
networking all public libraries and connecting
them to the National Grid for Learning by
2002. 4 he DCA4S/Wolfson Public Libraries
Challenge Fund has mounted a £3 million
campaign to persuade people, especially the
young, of the joys of reading as a leisure
pursuit.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors royalties from a central fund
(totalling just over £5 million in 1999-2000) for
the loans made of their books from public
libraries in the UK. Payment is made according
to the number of times an author’s books are
lent out. The maximum yearly payment an
author can receive is £6,000.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information management.
Founded in 1877, the Association has some
25,000 members. It maintains a Register of
Chartered Members and is the designated
263
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other EU member states.
The British Library and National
Libraries
The British Library (BL), the national library
of the UK, is custodian of the most important
research collection in the world (150 million
items spanning 3,000 years). It is also the
largest UK publicly funded building
constructed in the 20th century. The total
floor space is approximately 100,000 sq
metres. The basements, the deepest in
London, have 300 km of shelving for 12
million books. There are 11 reading areas,
three exhibition galleries and a conference
centre with a 255-seat auditorium. British
publishers are legally obliged to deposit a copy
of their publications at the BL. The National
Libraries of Scotland and Wales, the Bodleian
at Oxford and the Cambridge University
Library (and the Library of Trinity College,
Dublin) can also claim copies of all new
British publications under legal deposit.
Some 447,000 reader visits are made to the
BL each year. The reading rooms are open to
those who need to see material (for example,
manuscripts, newspapers, journals, stamps
and maps, as well as books) not readily
available elsewhere or whose work or studies
require the facilities of the national library.
During March-October 2000 the BL
exhibition ‘Chapter and Verse’ celebrated
1,000 years of English literature, with readings
by distinguished actors and authors.
The BL’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within the UK
and between the UK and other countries. It
dispatches over 4 million documents a year.
Other Libraries
As well as public and national libraries there are
nearly 700 more in higher and further education,
about 5,600 in schools and 2,220 specialised
libraries within other public and private sector
organisations (such as commercial companies,
research councils and government departments).
The university book collections of Oxford
and Cambridge number over 7 million and
In 2000 the BL relaunched an ‘adopt a
book’ scheme (www.bl.uk/adoptabook), to
provide funds in addition to its
preservation budget (^6.76 million in
2000-01) to prevent thousands of volumes
from deteriorating. Depending on the size
of the donation, a donor’s name appears
alone, or with others, on a permanent
bookplate.
more than 6 million items respectively. The
combined stores of the colleges and institutions
of the University of London total 9 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library
of Manchester contains 3.5 million volumes,
Edinburgh 2.5 million, Leeds 2.3 million, and
Durham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen
each have over 1 million volumes. Many
universities have vital research collections in
special subjects—the Barnes Medical Library
at Birmingham and the British Library of
Political and Economic Science at the London
School of Economics, for example.
Besides a number of private collections,
such as that of the London Library (for
private subscribers), there are the collections
of such learned societies as the Royal Institute
of International Affairs, the Royal
Geographical Society and the Royal Academy
of Music. The Poetry Library in the South
Bank Centre, owned by ACE, is a collection of
20th-century poetry written in or translated
into English; it has about 60,000 volumes.
The Public Record Office (PRO) in
London and in Kew (Surrey) houses the
records of the superior courts of law of
England and Wales and of most government
departments, as well as millions of historical
documents, such as Domesday Book (1086) and
autograph letters and documents of the
sovereigns of England. Public records, with a
few exceptions, are available for inspection by
everyone 30 years after the end of the year in
which they were created. The Scottish Record
Office in Edinburgh and the PRO of Northern
Ireland in Belfast serve the same purpose.

In 1999 about 123 million books were sold in
the UK. British publishers issued over 110,000

copies of the first three were printed; the fourth
was published in 2000).
Among the leading trade organisations are
the Publishers Association (PA), which has
200 members; and the Booksellers Association,
with about 3,300 members. The PA, through
its International Division, promotes the export
of British books. The Welsh Book Council
and the Gaelic Books Council support the
publication of books in Welsh and in Gaelic.
The Book Trust encourages reading and the
promotion of books through an information
service and a children’s library.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts locates, reports on, and gives
information and advice about historical papers
outside the public records. It also advises
private owners, grant-awarding bodies, record
offices, local authorities and the Government
on the acquisition and maintenance of
manuscripts. The Commission maintains the
National Register of Archives (the central
collecting point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, which are available to
researchers.
CRAFTS
The crafts in the UK have an annual turnover
estimated at £400 million. Government aid
amounted to £2.5 million in 1999-2000.
Policy and funding for the crafts in England
are the responsibility of ACE, which is
required to allocate at least £3.4 million, £3.6
million and £3.8 million for crafts for the
years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02
respectively, with a further £750,000 for
development. The Crafts Council runs the
National Centre for Crafts in London,
organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair
(which generated sales of £2.6 million for the
trade in 1999), and co-ordinates British groups
at international fairs. Five Crafts Council
exhibitions took place at its London gallery in
1999 (nearly 42,000 visitors) before going on
tour. Craft Forum Wales has a membership of
640 craft business groups in Wales; they had a
turnover of £27.5 million in 1999. Craftworks,
an independent company, is the development
agency for Northern Ireland. The ACNI also
funds crafts promotion, while the SAC has a
Crafts Department, which promotes crafts and
helps craftworkers in Scotland.

Digital terrestrial and satellite television services in the UK were launched in 1998.
Cable and commercial digital radio services got under way in 1999. Newspapers
throughout the UK—despite a gradual decline in hard-copy circulation for some
titles—continue to serve a wide readership. Increasingly the Internet is providing
an additional medium for information, entertainment and communication.
Television and Radio
Three public authorities oversee television and
radio services. They are accountable to
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day running of business. The
authorities are:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), which broadcasts television
and radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission), which licenses and regulates
commercial television services including
cable, satellite and independent teletext
services; and
• the Radio Authority, which licenses and
regulates commercial radio services,
including cable and satellite.
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for government policy
towards broadcasting.
There are five terrestrial analogue
television channels, offering a mixture of
drama, light entertainment, films, sport,
educational, children’s and religious
programmes, news and current affairs, and
documentaries. These comprise two national
BBC networks, financed almost wholly by a
licence fee, and the commercial ITV (Channel
3), Channel 4 and Channel 5 services, which
are funded by advertising and sponsorship. In
Wales, S4C—Sianel Pedwar Cymru—
broadcasts programmes on the fourth channel.
Satellite television and cable services are
mainly funded by subscription income. The
largest satellite programmer is BSkyB (British
Sky Broadcasting), which dominates
subscription-based television in the UK.
The UK’s first digital satellite and
terrestrial television services (see pp. 271 and
273) were launched in 1998, providing the
existing analogue programmes in a digital
format, together with free-to-air and
266

subscription and pay-per-view1 services.
Digital cable services began in 1999.
A government-commissioned report on
UK television exports, published in
November 1999, found that 13 per cent of
exported television programmes shown at
prime time anywhere in the world come
from Britain. This figure, although
substantially behind that of the United
States (68 per cent), is six times greater
than Australia, France, Germany and
Italy, each with 2 per cent.
The BBC has five national radio networks,
which together transmit all types of music,
news, current affairs, drama, education, sport
and a range of features programmes. There are
also 39 BBC local radio stations serving
England and the Channel Islands, and national
radio services in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, including Welsh and Gaelic
language stations. BBC national and local
radio services currently attract just over 50 per
cent of listeners (with local radio accounting
for nearly 11 per cent of that figure).
1 Pay-per-view allows subscribers to pay for a specific
programme, such as a film, sporting event or concert.
There are three national commercial radio
stations. About 240 independent local radio
(ILR) services are also in operation, supplying
local news and information, sport, music and
other entertainment, education and consumer
advice. The first commercial digital radio
services started in 1999.
DIGITAL BROADCASTING
The transition from analogue to digital
transmission technology has the potential to
expand broadcasting capacity enormously.
Digital broadcasting is a more effective way of
transmitting services. It allows much more
information than before to be transmitted, and
can offer many more channels, extra services,
interactivity, and higher quality picture and
sound to viewers and listeners with new
receiving equipment.
Digital television services can be received
through an existing television aerial, a cable
connection or a satellite dish. Viewers who
choose to receive them by any of these means
need either a special set-top box decoder,
enabling reception of digital broadcasts through
an analogue television set, or an integrated
digital television set. Radio listeners also need to
invest in new sets to hear digital radio.
Legislation was passed in 1996 setting out a
regulatory framework for the introduction of
digital terrestrial broadcasting (and paving the
way for more broadly based competitive media
groups—see p. 280). The Broadcasting Act
1996 provided for:
• the licensing of six digital terrestrial
television (DTT) ‘multiplexes’,2 and the
providers of the programmes or other
services on them; and
• the licensing of digital radio services on
two national multiplexes, with a multiplex
for local services in most parts of the UK.
The existing public service broadcasters
have guaranteed capacity on the multiplexes.
Licences to operate commercial DTT
2 Through the process known as multiplexing, the signals of
several broadcasters are combined into a single stream on
a single-frequency channel. There is therefore no longer a
direct one-to-one relationship between a television service
and a frequency.
267
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
multiplexes were awarded by the ITC in 1997,
and all DTT multiplexes started broadcasting
in 1998. The Radio Authority awarded the
national commercial radio multiplex licence in
1998 (with services beginning in November
1999), and is concentrating on advertising
local commercial multiplex licences in most of
the main population centres across the UK.
Many of the new services on digital
television are available on a subscription or pay-
per-view basis. Any broadcaster wishing to
offer pay-television needs to use a ‘conditional
access’ system (covering encryption,
scrambling and subscription management
services) to ensure that only those who have
paid for a particular service receive it.
Existing analogue transmissions will
continue for some time, but the Government
wants to announce a switch-off date for
analogue services as soon as is practicable. In
1999 it said that the switch-over to digital
broadcasting could start to happen as early as
2006 and be completed by 2010, provided that
all viewers who can receive the current free-to-
air analogue services can receive them digitally.
By April 2000 about 2.5 million households in
the UK had switched to digital television.
THE BBC
The BBC is the UK’s main public service
broadcaster. A Royal Charter and Agreement
The Government is reviewing the future
regulation of broadcasting and
telecommunications, taking account of the
implications of the increasing convergence
between the two sectors. Following on
from the report Regulating
Communications: the Way Ahead, published
in 1999, the Government proposes to issue
a White Paper later in 2000. The aim is to
promote the global competitiveness of the
UK’s media and communications
industries, as well as protect the interests
of the consumer. The White Paper will
include proposals for changing existing
broadcasting and telecommunications
legislation, encompassing both
infrastructure and content issues.
govern its constitution, finances and
obligations. Its Board of Governors appoints
the Director-General, who heads the bodies in
charge of the daily running of the
Corporation. It has a regional structure
throughout the UK.
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed almost wholly by a licence fee. All
households or premises with a television set
must buy an annual licence (costing £104 for
colour and £34.50 for black and white in
2000-01; people aged 75 and over get their
licences free from 1 November 2000). Licence
income is supplemented by profits from the
commercial activities of BBC Worldwide (see
p. 269). BBC World Service’s radio
broadcasting operations (see p. 270) are
financed by a grant from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office.
In response to the report of an independent
review panel (published in August 1999) on
the future financing of the BBC, the
Government announced new funding plans in
February 2000 for the Corporation over the
period to 2006-07. These provide for
additional annual support through the licence
fee, aimed at ensuring the Corporation’s
continuing ability to meet its public service
obligations and its effective operation in a
competitive market. The plans also include
new efficiency targets and arrangements to
increase accountability, with independent
scrutiny of the BBC’s fair trading policies and
financial reporting.
BBC Television
The BBC broadcasts 22,000 hours of
television each year on its two domestic
channels to national and regional audiences.
BBC ONE is the channel of broad appeal
(including documentaries and current affairs,
features, drama and light entertainment, sport,
religion and children’s programmes), while
BBC TWO aims for more innovation and
originality in its programming.
Network programmes are made at, or
acquired through, Television Centre in
London and six bases throughout the UK
(Glasgow in Scotland, Cardiff in Wales,
Belfast in Northern Ireland, and Birmingham,
268
17: THE MEDIA
Bristol and Manchester in England); or they
are commissioned from independent
producers—the BBC must ensure that at least
25 per cent of its original programming comes
from the independent sector.
The Corporation provides a range of digital
channels available free-to-air, including:
• an extended BBC ONE and BBC TWO
in widescreen;
• BBC News 24 (a 24-hour news channel);
• BBC Choice, a supplementary service to
complement and enhance the network
schedules;
• BBC Parliament (coverage of proceedings
in the House of Commons, House of
Lords, the new Parliament in Scotland
and the new assemblies in Wales and
Northern Ireland—see p. 274); and
• BBC Knowledge (the UK’s first fully
integrated public service multimedia
learning service).
The BBC’s Online channel on the Internet
provides constantly updated news, sport,
finance, travel and other information.
Education is a central component of the
Corporation’s public service commitment on
its domestic channels. A wide range of
educational programmes is broadcast for
primary and secondary schools (over 90 per
cent of which use BBC schools television),
further education colleges and the Open
University (see p. 137), while programmes for
adults cover numeracy, literacy, language
learning, health, work and vocational training.
Books, pamphlets, computer software, and
audio and video cassettes are produced to
supplement the programmes.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio, broadcasting to the
whole of the UK, transmits 43,000 hours of
programmes each year on its five networks
(broadcasting 24 hours a day):
• Radio 1 is a contemporary music station,
serving a young target audience (with
almost 11 per cent of the overall radio
audience share during October-
December 1999);
• Radio 2 offers a broad range of music,
light entertainment, documentaries,
public service broadcasting and popular
culture (nearly 13 per cent of audience
share);
• Radio 3 covers classical and jazz music,
drama, documentaries and discussion
(over 1 per cent share);
• Radio 4 offers news and current affairs
coverage, complemented by drama,
science, the arts, religion, natural history,
medicine, finance and gardening features;
it also carries parliamentary coverage and
cricket in season on Long Wave, and
BBC World Service overnight (11 per
cent share);
• Radio 5 Live broadcasts news, current
affairs and extensive sports coverage
(over 4 per cent share).
BBC Worldwide
With responsibility for the BBC’s commercial
activity, BBC Worldwide is a major international
broadcaster and a leading distributor and co¬
producer of BBC programmes.
BBC Worldwide is developing premium
channels to compete in the international
market-place. Its core service is BBC World,
an advertiser-funded, 24-hour international
news and information channel. The channel
provides news bulletins, in-depth analysis and
reports, and is available to about 168 million
homes around the world. BBC Prime, an
entertainment and drama channel for Europe
and Africa, has nearly 9 million subscribers.
In its first commercial broadcasting venture
in the UK, the BBC began themed subscription
services in 1997, in partnership with Flextech
pic, under the brand name UKTV. These
services are not funded by the licence fee.
In 1998 BBC Worldwide signed an
agreement with a US media company,
Discovery Communications Inc., creating a
BBC-branded network (BBC America) in the
United States and jointly developing quality
channels for pay-television around the world.
BBC Worldwide is the third largest
publishing house in the UK. Its operations
cover magazines, books, videos, audio sales,
CD-ROMs and a commercial on-line service.
269
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
BBC World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in
English and 42 other languages worldwide. It
has an estimated global weekly audience of
about 150 million listeners. This excludes any
estimate for listeners in countries where it is
difficult to survey audiences. The core
programming of news, current affairs,
business and sports reports is complemented
by cultural programmes, including drama,
literature and music.
While maintaining short wave broadcasts
for mass audiences, BBC World Service is
making programmes more widely available on
FM frequencies and delivering services in
major languages through digital broadcasting
and on the Internet.
BBC World Service programmes in English
and many other languages are made available by
satellite for rebroadcasting by agreement with
local or national radio stations, networks and
cable operators. BBC World Service Radio
International sells recorded programmes to
other broadcasters in 110 countries.
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service,
provides transcripts of radio and television
broadcasts from over 140 countries. As well as
providing a vital source of information to the
BBC, this service is used by other media
organisations, government departments, the
commercial sector and academic institutions.
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
The ITC is responsible for licensing and
regulating commercial television services
(including BBC commercial services)
operating in, or from, the UK. It does not
make, broadcast or transmit programmes.
The ITC must ensure that a wide range of
commercial television services is available
throughout the UK and that they are of a high
quality and appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. It must also ensure fair and effective
competition in the provision of these services,
and adherence to the rules on media
ownership.
The Commission regulates the various
television services through licence conditions,
codes and guidelines. The codes cover
programme content, advertising, sponsorship
and technical standards. If a licensee does not
comply with the conditions of its licence or
the codes, the ITC can impose penalties.
These range from a formal warning or a
requirement to broadcast an apology or
correction, to a fine. In extreme
circumstances, a company’s licence may be
shortened or revoked.
ITV (Channel 3)
ITV is made up of 15 regionally based
television companies, which are licensed to
supply programmes in the 14 independent
television geographical regions. There are two
licences for London, one for weekdays and the
other for the weekend. An additional ITC
licensee provides a national breakfast-time
service, transmitted on the ITV network.
The ITV licences for Channel 3 are
awarded for a ten-year period by competitive
tender to the highest bidder (who has to have
passed a quality threshold). Licensees must
provide a diverse programme service designed
to appeal to a wide range of viewers’ tastes and
interests. They have a statutory duty to
present programmes made in, and about, their
region.
Each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These
are produced by the company itself, by other
programme companies, or are bought from
elsewhere. As with the BBC, at least 25 per
cent of original programming must come from
the independent sector. About one-third of
the output is made up of informative
programmes—news, documentaries, and
coverage of current affairs, education and
religion—while the remainder covers drama,
entertainment, sport, arts and children’s
programmes. Programmes are broadcast 24
hours a day throughout the country. A
common national and international news
service is provided by Independent Television
News (ITN).
ITV (Channel 3) companies are obliged to
operate a national programme network. The
ITV Network Centre, which is owned by the
companies, independently commissions and
schedules programmes.
270
17: THE MEDIA
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees
derive most of their income from selling
advertising time. Their financial resources and
programme production vary considerably,
depending largely on the population of the
areas in which they operate. Newspaper
groups can acquire a controlling interest in
ITV companies, although measures are in
force to deter any undue concentrations of
media ownership (see p. 280).
Granada Media and Carlton, the two largest
regional ITV (Channel 3) television companies,
jointly own ONdigital, which occupies three of
the six multiplexes licensed for digital
terrestrial television. ONdigital services were
launched in 1998 and had attracted 673,000
subscribers by the end of March 2000.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4 provides a national 24-hour
television service, although Wales has its own
corresponding service—S4C (Sianel Pedwar
Cymru). Channel 4 is a statutory corporation,
licensed and regulated by the ITC, and
funded by selling its own advertising time.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide programmes
with a distinctive character and to appeal to
tastes and interests not generally catered for by
ITV (Channel 3). It must present a suitable
proportion of educational programmes and
encourage innovation and experiment. Channel
4 commissions programmes from the ITV
companies and independent producers, and
buys programmes from overseas.
The fourth analogue channel in Wales is
allocated to S4C, which is regulated by the
Welsh Fourth Channel Authority. Members
of the Welsh Authority are appointed by the
Government. S4C must ensure that a
significant proportion of programming—and
the majority between 18.30 and 22.00 hours—
is in the Welsh language. At other times it
transmits Channel 4 programmes. In 1998
S4C launched a new digital service
incorporating current analogue Welsh
programmes and additional material. Roughly
15 per cent of S4C’s income comes from
advertising, programme sales, publicity and
merchandising; the remainder comes from a
government grant, the level of which is fixed
by statute.
Channel 5
The UK’s newest national terrestrial channel
went on air in 1997, its ten-year licence having
been awarded by competitive tender to
Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. Channel 5
serves about 70 per cent of the population and
is supported by advertising revenue.
Like ITV (Channel 3), the new service is
subject to positive programming
requirements. It must show programmes of
quality and diversity, with a wide range of
original productions and commissions from
independent producers.
Gaelic Broadcasting
The Gaelic Broadcasting Committee is an
independent body committed to ensuring that a
wide range of quality television and radio
programmes is broadcast in Gaelic for
reception in Scotland. Its members are
appointed by the ITC, in consultation with the
Radio Authority. The Committee distributes
government money to programme makers
through the Gaelic Broadcasting Fund.
The Radio Authority
The Radio Authority’s licensing and
regulatory remit covers all independent radio
services, including national, local, cable and
satellite services. Its three main tasks are to
plan frequencies, appoint licensees with a view
to broadening listener choice, and regulate
programming and advertising.
The Radio Authority has to make sure that
licensed services are of a high quality, and
offer programmes which will appeal to many
different tastes and interests. It has published
codes covering engineering, programmes,
news and current affairs, and advertising and
sponsorship, to which licensees must adhere.
Independent National Radio
There are currently three independent
national radio services, whose licences were
awarded by the Radio Authority through
competitive tender, and which broadcast 24
hours a day:
271
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music, together with news and
information;
• Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based
rock music (and is supplemented by a
separate Virgin station which operates
under a local London licence); and
• Talk Sport, a speech-based service.
Independent Local Radio
Independent local radio (ILR) stations
broadcast a wide variety of programmes
and news of local interest, as well as music
and entertainment, traffic reports and
advertising. There are also stations serving
ethnic minority communities. The Radio
Authority awards independent local licences,
although not by competitive tender; the
success of licence applications is in part
determined by the extent to which
applicants widen choice and meet the needs
and interests of the people living in the area
and in part by whether they have the
necessary financial resources to sustain
programme plans for the eight-year licence
period. Local radio stations do not have
guaranteed slots on digital local radio
multiplexes.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted
service licences (RSLs)—short-term RSLs,
generally for periods of up to 28 days, for
special events or trial services, and long-term
RSLs, primarily for student and hospital
stations, to broadcast to specific
establishments.
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext Services
Teletext is written copy broadcast on
television sets. There are several teletext
services; one is operated by the BBC and
others by independent television. They offer
constantly updated information on a variety
of subjects, including news, sport, travel,
weather conditions and entertainment. The
teletext system allows the television signal to
carry additional information which can be
selected and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and
graphics on receivers equipped with the
necessary decoders. About 16 million homes
have sets with teletext decoders. The BBC
and Channels 3, 4 and 5 increasingly provide
subtitling for people with hearing difficulties.
The ITC awards teletext licences for the
capacity on Channels 3, 4, and 5 by
competitive tender for a period of ten years.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the regulation of cable television
services are carried out by the ITC, while the
Radio Authority issues cable radio licences.
ITC licences are required for systems capable
of serving more than 1,000 homes. Systems
extending beyond a single building and up to
1,000 homes require only an individual licence
regulated by OFTEL (see p. 376).
‘Broadband cable’ systems can carry
between 30 and 65 television channels using
analogue technology (including terrestrial
broadcasts, satellite television and channels
delivered to cable operators by landline or
videotape), as well as a full range of
telecommunications services. Digital
technology is being introduced which will
support up to 500 television channels. The
major cable operators (NTL and Telewest)
started converting their networks to digital
transmission during 1999.
There are no specific quality controls on
cable services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they
require a programme services licence from the
ITC, which includes consumer protection
requirements.
There are currently around 140 operating
cable franchises, covering areas which include
over 80 per cent of all homes and nearly all
urban areas in the UK. By April 2000 there
were over 12.6 million homes able to receive
broadband cable services; of these 3.3 million
subscribed to television services.
Cable also has the capacity for computer-
based interactive services such as
272
17: THE MEDIA
video-on-demand,3 home shopping, home
banking, security and alarm services,
electronic mail and high-speed Internet access
(see p. 377). It can additionally supply
television services tailored for, and directed at,
local communities. Local and community
television services operate under location-
specific restricted service licences (making use
of spare frequencies as and when they are
available). The first such services began in late
1998 in the Isle of Wight, followed by services
in Oxford, Leicester, Lanarkshire,
Londonderry and Edinburgh. Over 100 other
cities and towns have asked the ITC to
identify spare analogue frequencies for their
own local stations.
Satellite Services
Direct broadcasting by satellite, by which
television is transmitted directly by satellite into
people’s homes, has been available throughout
the UK since 1989. The signals from satellite
broadcasting are received through specially
designed aerials or ‘dishes’. Most services are
paid for by subscription. Some offer general
entertainment, while others concentrate on
specific areas of interest, such as sport, music,
children’s programmes and feature films.
All satellite television services provided by
broadcasters established in the UK are licensed
and regulated by the ITC. Around 250 satellite
television service licences, and about 20 digital
programme service licences, were in force in
April 2000. Many of these are foreign language
services, some of them designed for ethnic
minorities within the UK and others aimed
primarily at audiences in other countries.
Viewers in the UK may also receive a variety of
television services from other European
countries. Satellite services must comply with
the ITC’s programmes, advertising and
sponsorship codes, but they are not subject to
any positive programming obligations.
BSkyB is the UK’s largest satellite
programmer, with about 7.8 million
subscribers at the end of 1999. Of these almost
3 Video-on-demand enables viewers to dial into a video
library, via a cable or telephone network, and call up a
programme or film of their choice, which is then transmitted
to that household alone.
4 million were ‘direct to home’ subscribers
(over 2 million of which were subscribers to
digital services). BSkyB’s digital satellite
service, SkyDigital (carrying more than 140
channels), was launched in 1998, and new
interactive services started in October 1999.
Satellite radio services must be licensed by
the Radio Authority if they are transmitted
from the UK for general reception within the
country, or if they are transmitted from
outside the UK but are managed editorially
from within it.
OTHER ASPECTS
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not raise revenue from
broadcasting advertisements or from
commercial sponsorship of programmes on its
public service channels. Its policy is to avoid
giving publicity to any firm or organised
interest except when this is necessary in
providing effective and informative
programmes. It does, however, cover
sponsored sporting and artistic events.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed on
commercial television and radio services,
subject to controls. The ITC and the Radio
Authority operate codes governing advertising
standards and programme sponsorship, and
can impose penalties on broadcasters failing to
comply with them.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast in breaks during
programmes as well as between programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertisements must be
distinct and separate from programmes.
Advertising on terrestrial television is limited
to an average of seven minutes an hour during
the day and seven-and-a-half minutes in the
peak evening viewing period. Advertising is
prohibited in broadcasts of religious services
and in broadcasts to schools. Political
advertising and advertisements for betting
(other than the National Lottery, the football
pools and bingo) are prohibited. All tobacco
advertising is banned on television and
cigarette advertisements are banned on radio.
Religious advertisements may be broadcast on
commercial radio and television, provided
273
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
they comply with the guidelines issued by the
ITC and the Radio Authority.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In return for their financial contribution,
sponsors receive a credit associating them with a
particular programme. The ITC’s Code of
Programme Sponsorship and the Radio
Authority’s Advertising and Sponsorship Code
aim to ensure that sponsors do not exert
influence on the editorial content of programmes
and that sponsorships are made clear to viewers
and listeners. News and current affairs
programmes may not be sponsored. Potential
sponsors for other categories of programme may
be debarred if their involvement could constrain
the editorial independence of the programme
maker in any way. References to sponsors or
their products must be confined to the
beginning and end of a programme and around
commercial breaks; on television they must not
appear in the programme itself. All commercial
radio programmes other than news bulletins may
be sponsored.
Since 1998 the ITC has permitted
masthead programming (programmes with the
same title as a magazine and made or funded
by its publishers) on all UK commercial
television services (Channels 3, 4, and 5
having previously been excluded).
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it certain
obligations over programme content.
Broadcasters must display, as far as possible, a
proper balance and wide range of subject
matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not
offend against good taste. Broadcasters must
also comply with legislation relating to
obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply codes providing rules on
impartiality, the portrayal of violence, and
standards of taste and decency in programmes,
particularly during hours when children are
likely to be viewing or listening. Television
programmes broadcast before 21.00 hours (or
20.00 hours on certain cable and satellite
services) are required to be suitable for a
general audience, including children.
Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC)
The BSC acts as a forum for public concern
about fairness and taste and decency on
television and radio. It decides on complaints
received from the public about taste and
decency, and adjudicates on claims of unfair or
unjust treatment in broadcast programmes
and of unwarranted infringement of privacy in
programmes or in their preparation. It also
undertakes and commissions research and the
monitoring of public attitudes, and has drawn
up a code of practice on both broadcasting
standards and fairness which the broadcasters
and regulators are required to reflect in their
own programme guidelines. In 1999-2000 the
Commission received 126 fairness complaints
which were within its remit; 76 fairness
adjudications were completed, of which 28 per
cent were upheld in full or in part. It also
received 5,138 complaints about standards; of
those adjudicated upon, 25 per cent were
upheld in full or in part.
Parliamentary Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio,
either live or, more usually, in recorded and
edited form on news and current affairs
programmes. The BBC has a specific
obligation to transmit on radio an impartial
account day by day of the proceedings in both
Houses of Parliament. In 1998 the Corporation
took over a dedicated parliamentary channel
(initially launched in 1992 by a group of cable
operators) which is now known as BBC
Parliament, transmitting continuous coverage
of daily proceedings. The proceedings of the
Scottish Parliament and the assemblies for
Wales and Northern Ireland are also broadcast
live on occasions and in recorded and edited
form on a regular basis by the BBC.
Party Political Broadcasts
In the absence of paid political advertising in
the UK, there is a long-standing practice that
274
17: THE MEDIA
broadcasters make time available for party
political and election broadcasts on television
and radio. Recent reforms to the system have
been introduced by broadcasters to reflect the
increased number of elections in the UK
following devolution and to refocus broadcasts
between elections at key times in the political
calendar (for example, the Budget, the
Queen’s Speech and party conferences). The
content of these broadcasts is the
responsibility of the parties, although they
have to comply with ground rules laid down
by the broadcasters. In addition, the
Government may make ministerial broadcasts
on radio and television, with opposition
parties also being allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the commercial sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board).
Joint research is undertaken for BBC radio
and for commercial radio by RAJAR (Radio
Joint Audience Research).
The BBC, the commercial sector and the
BSC conduct regular surveys of audience
opinion on television and radio services.
Public opinion is further assessed by the BBC
and ITC through the work of their advisory
committees and councils.
European Agreements
The UK has implemented two European
agreements on cross-border broadcasting—the
European Community Broadcasting Directive
and the Council of Europe Convention on
Transfrontier Television. These aim to ensure
the free flow of television programmes and
services throughout participating countries,
setting minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency, and the
portrayal of sex and violence. If a broadcast
meets these standards then no participating
country may prevent reception in its territory.
The Press
On an average weekday it is estimated that
well over half of people aged 15 and over in
the UK read a national morning newspaper
(59 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women
in 1999-2000). Nearly nine out of ten adults
read a regional or local newspaper every week.
National papers have an average (but
declining) total circulation of some 13.5
million on weekdays and about 14.8 million on
Sundays. There are more than 1,300 regional
and local newspaper titles.
While newspapers are almost always
financially independent of any political party,
they often express obvious political leanings in
their editorial coverage, which may derive
from proprietorial and other non-party
influences. Ownership of the national press
lies in the hands of a number of large
corporations (see Table 17.1), most of which
are involved in the whole field of publishing
and communications. There are around 120
regional press publishers—ranging from those
owning just one title (about half of them) to a
few controlling more than 100 each.
In addition to sales revenue, newspapers and
periodicals earn considerable amounts from
advertising. Indeed, the press is the largest
advertising medium in the UK. The British
press receives no subsidies from the state.
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
The National Press
The national press consists of ten morning
daily papers and ten Sunday papers (see Table
17.1). At one time London’s Fleet Street area
was the centre of the industry, but now all the
national papers have moved their editorial and
printing facilities to other parts of London or
away from the capital altogether. Editions of
several papers, such as the Financial Times,
Guardian and Daily Mirror, are also printed in
other countries.
National newspapers are often described as
‘quality’, ‘mid-market’ or ‘popular’ papers on
the basis of differences in style and content.
Five dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as ‘quality’ newspapers, which are
directed at readers who want full information

17: THE MEDIA
on a wide range of public matters. Popular
newspapers tend to appeal to those who want to
read shorter, entertaining stories with more
human interest. ‘Mid-market’ publications
cater for the intermediate readership. Quality
papers are normally broadsheet in format, while
mid-market and popular papers are tabloid.
Many newspapers are printed in colour and
most produce extensive supplements as part of
the Saturday or Sunday edition, with articles on
personal finance, travel, home improvement,
food and wine, fashion and other leisure topics.
Increasing competition from other media in
the delivery of news, information and
entertainment has had its effects on the national
press over the last few decades, with a gradual
decline in circulation discernible for many titles.
Regional Newspapers
Most towns and cities throughout the UK have
their own regional or local newspaper. These
range from morning and evening dailies to
Sunday papers and others which are published
just once a week. They mainly include stories of
regional or local attraction, but the dailies also
cover national and international news, often
looked at from a local viewpoint. In addition,
they provide a valuable medium for local
advertising. The regional and local press has,
overall, been experiencing falling sales, but this
decline has slowed considerably in recent years,
from 2.3 per cent in 1995 to 1.2 per cent in 1999.
London has one paid-for evening paper, the
Evening Standard. Its publisher (Associated
Newspapers) also produces a free newspaper,
London Metro, launched in 1999. There are also
local weekly papers for every district in Greater
London; these are often different local editions
of one centrally published paper.
Of the Scottish papers, the Daily Record
has the highest circulation. The press in Wales
includes Welsh-language and bilingual papers
(and Welsh community newspapers receive an
annual grant as part of the Government’s
wider financial support for the Welsh
language). Newspapers from the Irish
Republic, as well as the British national press,
are widely read in Northern Ireland.
Around 700 free distribution newspapers,
mostly weekly and financed by advertising, are
published in the UK.

Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newpapers and magazines in the UK
are produced by ethnic minority communities.
Most are published weekly, fortnightly or
monthly. A Chinese newspaper, Sing Tao, the
Urdu Daily Jang and the Arabic Al-Arab,
however, are dailies.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include The
Gleaner, The Voice and Caribbean Times,
which are all weeklies. The Asian Times is an
English language weekly for people of Asian
descent. Ethnic language publications appear
in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi. The
fortnightly Asian Trader and Asian Business are
both successful ethnic business publications,
while Cineblitz International targets those
interested in the Asian film industry.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
There are almost 9,000 separate periodical
publications, which carry advertising. They
are generally defined as either ‘consumer’
titles, offering readers leisure-time
information and entertainment, or ‘business
and professional’ titles, which provide people
with material of relevance to their working
lives. Within the former category, there are
general consumer titles, which have a wide
appeal, and consumer specialist titles, aimed
specifically at groups of people with particular
interests, such as motoring, sport or music. A
range of literary and political journals,
appearing monthly or quarterly, caters for a
more academic readership. There are also
many in-house and customer magazines
produced by businesses or public services for
their employees and/or clients.
The periodical industry has experienced rapid
growth—over the last ten years the number of
consumer titles rose from about 2,200 to 3,170,
and business titles from around 4,200 to 5,700.
More than 80 per cent of adults (84 per cent of
women) read a consumer magazine. About 95 per
cent of business and professional people read a
publication relevant to their market (with the
highest concentrations in medicine, business
management, sciences, architecture and building,
social sciences, and computers).
The two top-selling weekly consumer
magazines, What's on TV and Radio Times,
carry full details of the forthcoming week’s
television and radio programmes and have
sales in the region of 1.5 million. Reader's
Digest, which covers a very broad range of
topics, has the highest sales (over 1.1 million)
among monthly magazines.
Women’s magazines traditionally enjoy
large readerships, while several men’s general
interest titles reached high levels of circulation
during the 1990s (see Table 17.3).
Children have an array of comics and
papers, while magazines like Smash Hits and
It ’.s' Bliss, with their coverage of pop music and
features of interest to young people, are very
popular with teenagers.
Leading journals of opinion include the
Economist, an independent commentator on
national and international affairs, finance and
business, and science and technology; New
Statesman, which reviews social issues, politics,
literature and the arts from an independent
socialist point of view; and the Spectator, which
covers similar subjects from a more conservative
standpoint. A rather more irreverent approach
to public affairs is taken by Private Eye, a
satirical fortnightly.
Weekly listings’ magazines like Time Out
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.

17: THE MEDIA
PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association, whose members
publish national newspapers, and the
Newspaper Society, which represents British
regional and local newspapers (and is believed
to be the oldest publishers’ association in the
world). The Scottish Daily Newspaper
Society represents the interests of daily and
Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish
Newspaper Publishers Association acts on
behalf of the owners of weekly newspapers in
Scotland; and Associated Northern Ireland
Newspapers is made up of proprietors of
weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland. The
membership of the Periodical Publishers
Association includes most publishers of
business, professional and consumer
magazines.
The Society of Editors is the officially
recognised professional body for newspaper
editors and their equivalents in radio and
television. It exists to defend press freedom
and to promote high editorial standards.
There is also a British Society of Magazine
Editors. Organisations representing journalists
are the National Union of Journalists,
Chartered Institute of Journalists and British
Association of Journalists. The main printing
union is the Graphical, Paper and Media
Union. The Foreign Press Association helps
the correspondents of overseas newspapers in
their professional work.
The Press Association is the national news
agency of the UK and Irish Republic,
delivering comprehensive news and sports
coverage, photographs, weather reports and
listings to the national and regional print,
broadcast and electronic media. A number of
other British and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are
smaller agencies based in other British cities.
Most regional agencies are members of the
National Association of Press Agencies.
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
Press Complaints Commission
In a free society, there is a delicate and
sometimes difficult balance in the relationship
between the responsibilities of the press and
the rights of the public. A policy of press self¬
regulation, rather than statutory control or a
law of privacy, operates in the UK. The Press
Complaints Commission, a non-statutory
body whose 16 members are drawn from both
the public and the industry, deals with
complaints about the content and conduct of
newspapers and magazines, and operates a
Code of Practice agreed by editors covering
inaccuracy, invasion of privacy, harassment
and misrepresentation by the press. The
Commission’s jurisdiction also extends to
publications on the Internet placed there by
publishers who already subscribe to the Code.
In 1999 the Commission dealt with 2,500
complaints, resolving about 90 per cent of
cases pursued under the Code.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and journalists
are subject to the law in the same way as any
other citizen. However, certain statutes
include sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing the extent of
newspaper ownership in television and radio
companies (see p. 280), the transfer of
newspaper assets, and the right of press
representatives to be supplied with agendas
and reports of meetings of local authorities.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
the printer’s imprint (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see
p. 264).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, copyright, financial services and fraud
legislation. Legal restrictions are imposed on
certain types of prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings; nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
279
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations,
where such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. These are
restrictions on publication generally, not just
through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
promotions, cinema, direct mail, and
electronic media (such as CD-ROM and the
Internet) is regulated by the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA is an
independent body whose role is to ensure that
advertisers conform to the British Codes of
Advertising and Sales Promotion. These
require that advertisements and promotions
are legal, decent, honest and truthful; are
prepared with a sense of responsibility to the
consumer and society; and respect the
principles of fair competition generally
accepted in business.
The ASA monitors compliance with the
Codes and investigates complaints received.
Pre-publication advice is available to
publishers, agencies and advertisers from the
Committee of Advertising Practice. If an
advertisement is found to be misleading or
offensive, the ASA can ask the advertiser to
change or remove it. Failure to do so can
result in damaging adverse publicity in the
ASA’s monthly report of its judgments, the
refusal of advertising space by publishers, and
the loss of trading privileges. Advertisers
found guilty of placing irresponsible or
offensive posters can face a two-year period of
mandatory pre-vetting. The ASA can also
refer misleading advertisements to the
Director General of Fair Trading (see
p. 396), who has the power to seek an
injunction to prevent their publication.
Media Ownership
Legislation in 1990 laid down rules enabling
the ITC and Radio Authority to keep
ownership of the broadcasting media widely
spread and to prevent undue concentrations of
single and cross-media ownership, in the
wider public interest. The Broadcasting Act
1996 relaxed those rules, both within and
across different media sectors, to reflect the
needs and aspirations of the industry against
the background of accelerating technological
change:
• allowing for greater cross-ownership
between newspaper groups, television
companies and radio stations, at both
national and regional levels; and
• introducing ‘public interest’ criteria by
which the regulatory authorities can
assess and approve (or disallow) mergers
or acquisitions between newspapers and
television and radio companies.
The 1996 Act overturned the rule that no
one company could own more than two of the
ITV (Channel 3) licences; instead, a new limit
was set whereby no company could control
franchises covering more than 15 per cent of
the total television audience. Local
newspapers with more than a 50 per cent share
of their market may own a local radio station,
providing at least one other independent local
radio station is operating in that area. An
additional regulation is the Office of Fair
Trading’s limit of 25 per cent on any
company’s share of television advertising
revenue.
The Media and the Internet
The Internet plays an increasingly important
role in the provision and distribution of
information and entertainment. Broadly, it is a
loose collection of computer networks around
the world—it links thousands of academic,
government and public computer systems,
giving millions of people access to a wealth of
stored information and other resources.
No one owns it—there is no centralised
controlling or regulating body. Access to the
system usually requires a computer with the
necessary software, a telephone and a modem
(allowing computers to communicate with
each other over a telephone line). However, it
is now possible to receive television-based
280
17: THE MEDIA
services, and the Internet is increasingly likely
in the future to be accessed through
interactive digital television and mobile
telephones. Among the most common uses of
the Internet are the sending and receiving of
e-mail (text that can be sent directly to
another computer linked to the system), the
publication of information and, increasingly,
commercial transactions.
The system dates from the 1960s, when it
began life in the military and academic
communities in the United States, but it has
only assumed widespread significance in
commercial and consumer terms during the
1990s. It is the World Wide Web (WWW or
the web) which has given the Internet its user
appeal and accessibility. The web consists of
many thousands of ‘sites’ on the Internet,
which can be viewed by a browser (software
that provides a window in a computer screen
on which the pages are displayed). Users can
move from page to page in search of whatever
information or service they are after.
Most national newspaper groups, press
institutions and prominent magazine
publishers in the UK have set up their own
websites. These offer a range of editorial,
directory and advertising services. It is
estimated that more than 75 per cent of the
local and regional press also operate a website.
Broadcasters and regulators, including the
BBC, the ITV companies, Channel 4, Channel
5, Sky, the ITC and the Radio Authority, are
similarly represented on the web.

Sport is one of the UK’s most popular leisure activities, with nearly half of all
adults taking part each week in one or more sporting activities. UK sportsmen
and sportswomen hold over 50 world titles in a variety of sports, such as
professional boxing, rowing, snooker, squash and motorcycle sports. In the 2000
Olympics in Sydney the Great Britain team won 28 medals: 11 gold (the most
since the Olympic Games of 1920), ten silver and seven bronze.
In 1996-97 (the latest period for which
information is available), 71 per cent of men
and 57 per cent of women took part in at least
one sporting activity in the four-week period
before they were interviewed for the General
Household Survey in Great Britain and the
Continuous Household Survey in Northern
Ireland. Walking (including rambling and
hiking) was by far the most popular form of
active recreation in the UK (see Table 18.1).
Many important sporting events are held
each year in the UK, including the
Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships, the
FA Cup Final, the Open Golf championship
and the Grand National steeplechase. In 1999
the UK hosted both the cricket and rugby
union world cups, with the finals being held
respectively at Lord’s and the Millennium
Stadium in Cardiff. Most of the matches in
the Rugby League World Cup will be staged
in the UK in October and November 2000,
with the final taking place at Old Trafford
(Manchester), and the World Track Cycling
Championships will be held in Manchester in
October 2000. The Commonwealth Games
will take place in Manchester in 2002. Two
major athletics events—the 2003 world indoor
championships and the 2005 world outdoor
championships—will be staged in the UK.
SPORTS POLICY
A ‘Sports Cabinet’, established in 1998, is
involved in identifying strategic priorities for
sport. It is headed by the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport and includes the
ministers responsible for sport in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In April 2000 the Government published A
Sporting Future for All, its new sports strategy
for England designed to increase participation
in sport and encourage greater success for the
top sportsmen and sportswomen.
Participation
The Government wishes to ensure that
sporting opportunities are widely available to
the entire community, irrespective of age,

gender, social background, location or ability.
For young people its strategy includes a series
of measures to reverse the decline of physical
education (PE) and sport in schools, and raise
standards:
• a new fund—Space for Sport and Arts—
which will provide up to £150 million of
new funds over two years (of which £75
million will be from the Government and
up to £75 million from the National
Lottery) for primary schools in England
to provide new multi-purpose sports and
arts facilities for pupils and the wider
community;
• the creation by 2003 of 110 Specialist
Sports Colleges (of which 67 had been
designated by mid-2000);
• encouraging schools to provide a range of
after-school activities (including PE and
sport) for all pupils, irrespective of age or
ability;
• establishing up to 600 school sports co¬
ordinators to develop more inter-school
competitive games; and
• ensuring that the most talented 14 to 18
year olds have access to appropriate
coaching and support.
Specialist Sports Colleges have a particular
focus on PE and sport, and provide high-
quality facilities and training to support the
most talented and promising pupils. Working
with the national governing bodies of sport,
those Sports Colleges that are best placed to
develop particular sports specialisms to the
highest levels will be identified so that the
most gifted 14 to 19 year olds can be given top
coaching and support. Some Sports Colleges
are already experimenting with a more flexible
timetable which allows talented pupils to focus
on developing their sporting careers, including
undertaking the necessary additional training
and receiving the required coaching, but still
284
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
provides the pupils with a full education
programme. At a Sports College talented
pupils can receive specialist coaching, flexible
study arrangements and individual tutorial
support to ensure that they realise both their
sporting and academic potential. The
Government envisages that Sports Colleges
will play an important part in reaching new
talent from groups who are traditionally
under-represented in sport, including ethnic
minorities and those from deprived
backgrounds. Where appropriate, Sports
Colleges will be linked to the network centres
of the United Kingdom Sports Institute (see
p. 289), so that pupils can have access to their
sports science, sports medicine and coaching
facilities, and can receive support on leaving
school if they embark on a sporting career.
The strategy also includes measures to raise
participation more widely in the community.
Previously the Government had announced
expenditure of £125 million from the
Lottery’s New Opportunities Fund (see
p. 117) to help communities to create new
areas of open space, or enhance existing open
spaces, and introduced tighter planning
controls to minimise the loss of playing fields
to development. It now envisages investing
between £1.5 billion and £2 billion in
community sports facilities in England in the
next ten years. Local authorities will conduct
an audit of sports facilities in England to
determine where the need for new or
improved facilities is greatest. Sport England
(see p. 287) and the Local Government
Association will then compile a comprehensive
The Government’s view is that sport is an
important component of regeneration, and
can have a beneficial effect in helping the
development of run-down areas. In
January 2000 Sport England announced
the first 12 Sport Action Zones. The zones
are areas of high economic and social
deprivation where basic sports provision
falls below an acceptable standard.
Eventually up to 30 zones will be
established. Sport England will target
these areas for improving sporting
provision.
national database of sports facilities, which
will form the basis of strategic planning for
sports development.
Sport England, the Youth Justice Board for
England and Wales and the UK Anti-Drugs
Co-ordination Unit have established a new
sports-based initiative to promote regular
participation in sport by young people,
citizenship and to reduce drug misuse by
promoting a healthy lifestyle—24 ‘Positive
Futures’ projects have been set up in England
to work with young people aged 10 to 16.
Sporting Excellence
As well as the Specialist Sports Colleges, two
main schemes are designed to promote
sporting excellence:
• The World Class Performance Programme
provides support to the UK’s most
talented athletes to enable them to
improve their performance and win
medals in major international
competitions. Since April 1997 grants
totalling £79 million have been
committed to more than 35 sports in the
Programme, and around 1,700 athletes
have received support.
• The World Class Events Programme aims
to ensure that major international events
can be attracted to, and staged
successfully in, the UK. About £1.6
million a year is currently available to
support funding of up to 35 per cent of
the cost of bidding for and staging
events. By June 2000, over £8 million
had been awarded to assist with staging
59 international events and bids for a
further ten events.
The national sports strategy envisages some
changes to strengthen the programmes,
including establishing targets for assessing
performance. The level of success in achieving
targets set by the national governing bodies
will be a key factor in decisions on future
levels of funding.
The Government wishes to see
improvements in coaching, and a review of
coaching and coach education will be
undertaken by the end of 2000. The Sports
285
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Councils, the National Coaching Foundation
(see p. 291) and sporting governing bodies will
work together to develop a ‘fast track’ system
for top-class performers to become coaches.
Relations with Governing Bodies of Sport
The Government is encouraging sporting
governing bodies to develop strategic plans for
their sports, which would widen participation
and develop sporting talent. Governing bodies
receiving funding from the Sports Councils are
already required to produce development plans,
from the grass roots to the highest competitive
levels, and, in order to have access to Lottery
funds, for their top athletes, they need to
prepare ‘world-class performance’ plans with
specific performance targets. The new plans
would include high-quality youth sport
programmes and coaching education systems, a
talent development framework and targets for
the development of their sport. For governing
bodies that adopt new strategic plans, the
Government intends that they should have
greater control of the distribution of funding
from the Sports Councils and the National
Lottery. Under these proposals, all major sports
bodies receiving significant revenues from
broadcasting would be required to set aside at
least 5 per cent of these revenues for investment
in grass roots facilities in their sports.
Sport on Television and Radio
Major sporting events (such as the Olympic
Games) receive extensive television and radio
coverage and are watched or heard by millions
of people. Football matches attract very high
ratings, especially when the UK’s national
teams are involved in the final stages of
international tournaments, most recently for
England’s matches against Portugal, Germany
and Romania in the final stage of Euro 2000
(the European Championship). Several other
sports, including rugby, horse racing, cricket
and athletics, also achieve high ratings figures.
For several years, many satellite and cable
channels have concentrated on sport. Live
coverage of a number of major events and
competitions is now shown exclusively by
subscription broadcasters. In the
Government’s view, there are a small number
Football receives substantial revenues
from broadcasting rights. The
Government, together with the Football
Association (FA) and the FA Premier
League, established in 2000 a Football
Foundation, which will channel at least
5 per cent of television revenues from
professional football into grass roots
development. The Foundation’s priorities
will be improving the provision and
maintenance of football pitches, and
coaching at a local level. The Government
hopes that the new body will prove a model
for other professional sports to follow.
of sporting occasions to which everyone
should have access. These events are included
on a protected list (‘Group A’) and cannot be
shown on subscription channels unless they
have first been offered to the UK’s universally
available free-to-air broadcasters (the BBC,
the ITV network and Channel 4). Live
coverage of events on the ‘Group B’ list may
be shown by satellite and cable channels on the
condition that an acceptable level of secondary
coverage is made available to the universally
available free-to-air channels. The current list
is as follows:

Crowd Safety and Control
The Football Trust has provided grant aid to
help football clubs to complete the safety work
required by the Government in response to
the Taylor Report following the Hillsborough
stadium disaster in 1989, when 96 spectators
died. Since May 2000 the Football Trust’s
work has been continued by the Football
Foundation. In England and Wales, licences
issued by the Football Licensing Authority
(FLA) require all clubs in the Premier League
and those in the First Division of the Football
League to have all-seater grounds, and clubs
in the second and third divisions of the
Football League have to ensure that any
terracing retained complies with the highest
safety standards, as outlined in guidance from
the FLA. The FLA will be succeeded by a
new Sports Ground Safety Authority
(SGSA), which will have a wider role in
advising other sports on outdoor ground
safety; the SGSA is expected to be in
operation by April 2001.
In Scotland the all-seating policy is being
implemented through a voluntary agreement
under the direction of the Scottish football
authorities.
The Government tries to work closely with
the police, football authorities and the
governments of other European countries to
implement crowd control measures. For
example, prior to Euro 2000 there was close
co-operation with the authorities of Belgium
and the Netherlands (the co-hosts of the
tournament) and also with the French
authorities to try to ensure that as far as
possible anyone previously involved in football
hooliganism was unable to gain entry to those
countries at the time of the tournament. In
addition, the Football (Offences and Disorder)
Act 1999 imposed a duty on the courts to
make a banning order whenever someone is
convicted of a football-related offence if a ban
would help prevent violence or disorder
connected with football matches. The Act also
provided for the imposition of passport
conditions on anyone subject to an
international football banning order. However,
serious disturbances, involving violent and
disruptive behaviour, did occur in Belgium.
The Government has announced that,
following discussions with the FA and the
Premier League, any supporter convicted of
hooliganism, or against whom there was good
evidence of hooliganism, would be banned for
life from attending football matches in
England. Anyone subject to a domestic or
international ban would have to surrender his
or her passport when major international
games involving England were in progress.
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities and funding for
sport and recreation are largely channelled
through five Sports Councils:
• the United Kingdom Sports Council,
operating as UK Sport;
• the English Sports Council, operating as
Sport England;
• the Sports Council for Wales;
• the Scottish Sports Council, operating as
sportscotland; and
• the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
UK Sport takes the lead on all aspects of
sport and physical recreation which require
strategic planning, administration, co¬
ordination or representation for the UK as a
whole. Its main functions include:
• co-ordinating support to sports in which
the UK competes internationally (as
opposed to the four home countries
separately);
• tackling drug misuse;
• co-ordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to the UK;
and
287
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• representing British sporting interests
overseas and increasing influence at
international level.
All the Sports Councils distribute
Exchequer and Lottery funds. UK Sport
focuses on elite athletes, while the home
country Sports Councils are more concerned
with the development of sport at the
community level by promoting participation
by all sections of the population, giving
support and guidance to facility providers, and
supporting the development of talented
sportsmen and women, including people with
disabilities. They also manage the National
Sports Centres (see pp. 290-1).
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 410
independent governing bodies. Some have a
UK or Great Britain structure, while others
are constituted on a home country basis. Their
functions include drawing up rules, holding
events, regulating membership, selecting and
training national teams, and producing plans
for their sports (see p. 286). There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking. Most sports clubs in the UK
belong to, or are affiliated to, an appropriate
governing body.
Other Sports Organisations
The main sports associations in the UK include:
• the Central Council of Physical
Recreation (CCPR), the largest sport and
recreation federation in the world, which
comprises 202 UK bodies and 66 English
associations, most of which are governing
bodies of sport. The British Sports Trust
is a charity set up by the CCPR to run a
volunteer sports leadership programme,
and in 1999 it enrolled an estimated
48,000 people. The Scottish Sports
Association, the Welsh Sports
Association and the Northern Ireland
Sports Forum are equivalent associations
to the CCPR. Their primary aim is to
represent the interests of their members
to the appropriate national and local
authorities, including the Sports
Councils, from which they may receive
some funding;
• the British Olympic Association (BOA),
comprising representatives of the 35
national governing bodies of Olympic
sports, which organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games,
sets standards for selection and raises
funds. It organised a team of over 300
competitors to represent the UK in the
Sydney Olympics in September 2000 and
the team won a total of 28 medals (see
p. 283); pictures of some of the medallists
are in the section between pp. 296 and
297. The BOA is supported by
sponsorship and by donations from the
private sector and the general public, and
works closely with UK Sport. It makes
important contributions to the
preparation of competitors in the period
between Games, such as arranging
training camps, and for the Sydney
Olympics had a holding camp on the
Gold Coast in Queensland for all team
members. The BOA also works through
its steering groups to deliver programmes
to national governing bodies and their
athletes in areas such as acclimatisation,
psychology and physiology. Its British
Olympic Medical Centre at Northwick
Park Hospital in Harrow provides
medical services for competitors before
and during the Olympics; and
• the Women’s Sports Foundation, which
promotes the interests of women and
girls in sport and active recreation. It
encourages the establishment of women’s
sports groups throughout the UK and
organises events and activities. It runs
both the Sportswomen of the Year
Awards and an annual nationwide awards
scheme for girls and young women
between the ages of 11 and 19.
Sport for Disabled People
Sport for disabled people is organised by a
wide range of agencies in the UK. Single¬
disability, multi-sport organisations
288
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
co-ordinate disability-specific recreation and
development opportunities and events. These
agencies are the British Amputee and Les
Autre Sports Association, British Blind Sport,
British Wheelchair Sports Foundation,
Cerebral Palsy Sport and the United Kingdom
Sports Association for People with Learning
Disability. The British Deaf Sports Council
organises sporting opportunities for hearing-
impaired people and co-ordinates British
interests at the World Deaf Games.
Multi-disability, multi-sport organisations
are responsible for the co-ordination and
development of sport on a pan-disability basis
within each home country and, where
possible, endorse integration into mainstream
sport activities. These agencies are the English
Federation of Disability Sport, Disability
Sport Cymru, Scottish Disability Sport and
Disability Sport Northern Ireland. In
addition, Disability Sport England runs some
training courses and regional or national
events in England.
The remit of the British Paralympic
Association (BPA) is to ratify selection, and
fund and manage the Great Britain Paralympic
Team in the winter and summer Paralympic
Games. The BPA is the British member of the
International Paralympic Committee. A team of
over 200 competitors will represent the UK in
the Paralympics in Sydney in October 2000.
UK Sport is reviewing disability sport,
with a key objective being the organisational
inclusion/integration of able-bodied and
disabled sport across a range of sports,
particularly at the high-performance level.
Nine sports already have a degree of
integration: athletics, swimming, cycling,
sailing, judo, equestrianism, powerlifting/
weightlifting, wheelchair tennis/tennis and
archery. The Commonwealth Games in
Manchester in 2002 will be the first to include
an integrated programme of events for people
with disabilities. All distributing bodies of
Lottery funding are required to ensure that
applicants incorporate access and availability
for people with disabilities.
SPORTS FACILITIES
The UK has a range of world-class sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports
Centres, operated by the home country Sports
Councils. Several of the major facilities have
seen considerable improvements in recent
years, including many football grounds,
Aintree and Cheltenham racecourses, and the
Wimbledon tennis complex. The Millennium
Stadium in Cardiff has been rebuilt and now
has a capacity of 72,500; it is the world’s
biggest stadium with a retractable roof. It
hosted the final of the Rugby World Cup in
November 1999.
Further improvements in major sports
facilities are in hand, or planned,
including:
• in Manchester, where modern
facilities are being provided for the
Commonwealth Games to be held in
2002, including a new 50,000-seat
sports stadium costing £90 million,
and an Olympic-sized swimming
complex—the Games are expected to
attract over 5,000 athletes from the
Commonwealth nations;
• the redevelopment of Wembley
Stadium in London, creating a new
90,000 capacity all-seater national
stadium for football and rugby league,
which is due to open in 2003; and
• a new purpose-built athletics
stadium, able to accommodate 50,000
spectators, which is to be built at
Picketts Lock, Edmonton (London),
and will stage the 2005 World
Athletics Championship.
United Kingdom Sports Institute
The United Kingdom Sports Institute
(UKSI) is being set up under the strategic
direction of UK Sport and in partnership with
the home country Sports Councils, and will be
fully operational by summer 2002. It will
provide facilities and integrated support
services to potential and elite athletes and
teams. Its Athlete Career and Education
programme, designed to enhance athletes’
personal development and sporting
performance, and the Fligh Performance
Coaching Programme were launched in 1999.
289
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
All sports have access to the UKSPs services,
although it concentrates on Olympic sports
and those minority sports lacking a
commercial element. The UKSI central
services team is part of UK Sport and based in
London. It co-ordinates a network of regional
centres in England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The UKSFs funds come
mainly from the National Lottery.
UKSI Regional Network
England
In England the UKSI network is managed by
the English Institute of Sport (part of Sport
England). It is based around a number of key
centres, of which four are based around
National Sports Centres:
• Crystal Palace in London, which is a
leading competition venue for a wide
range of sports and a major training
centre, and has Olympic-size swimming
and diving pools, and a sports injury
centre;
• Bisham Abbey in Berkshire, which caters
for a number of sports, including tennis,
football, hockey, weightlifting, squash,
rugby union and golf;
• Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire, which is used by a variety of
national teams and has extensive playing
fields for football and hockey, together with
facilities for archery and gymnastics; and
• the National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire,
one of the most comprehensive water
sports centres in the world, with facilities
for rowing (including a 2,000-metre
regatta course), canoeing, water-skiing,
powerboating, ski-racing, angling and
sailing—the East Midlands Network
Centre is jointly based here and around
the extensive facilities planned at
Loughborough University.
The other network centres are based
around the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield,
Gateshead International Stadium, Manchester
Sports City, the University of Bath and
Norwich Sportspark.
Wales
The centre of the UKSI network in Wales is
the Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff, run by
the Sports Council for Wales, which is the
premier venue in Wales for top-level training
and for competition in many sports. The
Institute has close links with other specialist
facilities, including the National Watersports
Centre at Plas Menai in north Wales, which is
a centre of excellence for sailing and canoeing;
the national indoor athletics centre at
University of Wales Institute, Cardiff; and the
cricketing school of excellence at Sophia
Gardens, Cardiff. In May 1999 the Sports
Council for Wales launched a new strategy: A
Strategy for Welsh Sport—Young People First.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre,
in Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, is
run by Sport England. It offers courses in rock
climbing, mountaineering, canoeing,
orienteering, skiing and most other mountain-
based activities, and is the UK’s leading
training institution for mountain instructors.
Scotland
The Scottish Institute of Sport, set up by
sportscotland in 1998, is initially catering for
seven sports: athletics, badminton, curling,
football, hockey, rugby and swimming. Its
network will include its headquarters in
Stirling, six area institutes and the three
National Sports Centres run by sportscotland:
• Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore, which
caters for a range of activities, including hill
walking, rock climbing, mountaineering,
skiing, kayaking and canoeing;
• Inverclyde in Largs, which has many
indoor and outdoor facilities, including a
gymnastics hall, golf training, and sports
medicine and sports science facilities of
an international standard; and
• the Scottish National Water Sports
Centre—Cumbrae—on the island of
Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde.
Northern Ireland
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has
announced a partnership with the University
290
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
of Ulster for the development of a Northern
Ireland network centre of the UKSI. This will
involve creating high-quality training facilities
and support services, primarily at the
University’s Jordanstown campus, with the
establishment of links with nearby facilities. It is
envisaged that the centre will include the
development of an indoor training centre,
athletics training track, sports medicine
facilities, a 50-metre training pool and outdoor
pitches, with support services such as sports
science and coaching.
The Tollymore Mountain Centre in
County Down, run by the Sports Council for
Northern Ireland, offers courses in
mountaineering, rock climbing, canoeing and
outdoor adventure. Leadership and instructor
courses leading to nationally recognised
qualifications are also available.
The Council’s Youth Sport programme has
pioneered innovative ways of involving young
people in sport.
Local Facilities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the
local community. In England they manage
over 1,500 indoor sports centres. Other
facilities include parks, lakes, playing fields,
playgrounds, tennis courts, artificial pitches,
golf courses and swimming/leisure pools. The
national sports strategy envisages that new
investment in grass roots facilities should be
concentrated on schools, for use by pupils
during the school hours and by the wider
community at other times.
Over 150,000 voluntary sports clubs are
affiliated to the national governing bodies of
sport. Some local clubs cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those which
provide sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. Many clubs linked to businesses and
other employers cater for sporting activities.
Commercial facilities include fitness centres,
tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller-skating
rinks, squash courts, golf courses and driving
ranges, riding stables and marinas.
SUPPORT SERVICES
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute
(NSMI), funded by UK Sport and Sport
England, is responsible for the co-ordination
of sports medicine services. Based at the
medical college of St Bartholomew’s Hospital,
London, its facilities include a physiology
laboratory, library and information centre.
In Scotland a network of 29 accredited
sports medicine centres provides specialist
help with sports injuries. Wales has 11 sports
medicine centres, accredited by the NSMI,
which are linked closely with the UKSI
network in Wales. The Northern Ireland
Sports Medicine Centre is a partnership
between the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland and a local healthcare trust.
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports
Councils, in collaboration with the British
Olympic Association and the National
Coaching Foundation, in an effort to raise the
standards of performance of national squads.
The type of support provided may cover
biomechanical (human movement),
physiological or psychological factors.
Coaching
The National Coaching Foundation (NCF)
works closely with sports governing bodies,
local authorities, and higher and further
education institutions. Supported by the Sports
Councils, it provides a comprehensive range of
services for coaches in all sports. In 1999, 30,000
coaches and 20,000 schoolteachers participated
in NCF programmes.
DRUG MISUSE
UK Sport aims to prevent doping and achieve
a commitment to drug-free sport and ethical
sporting practices. Its Ethics and Anti-Doping
Directorate co-ordinates a drugs-testing
programme and conducts a comprehensive
291
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
education programme aimed at changing
attitudes to drug misuse. Samples are analysed
at a laboratory accredited by the International
Olympic Committee, at King’s College,
University of London; UK Sport is
responsible for reporting the results to the
appropriate governing body. In 1999-2000 the
drugs-testing programme involved 50 national
governing bodies and 20 international sporting
federations from 44 sports. A total of 6,141
tests were conducted—-5,050 in competition
and 1,091 out of competition—and 98.1 per
cent were negative. UK Sport provides a Drug
Information Line to allow athletes to check
whether a licensed medication is permitted or
banned under their governing body’s
regulations, and issues a comprehensive guide
on drugs and sport for competitors and
officials. The UK is working closely with
international colleagues in the newly
established World Anti-Doping Agency.
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER
FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in the UK, and a joint
Department of Trade and Industry/Sports
Industries Federation competitiveness analysis,
published in July 1999, found that it is worth
almost £5 billion a year. Consumer expenditure
on sport is estimated at £13 billion a year, and
the industry employs about 440,000 people. The
private sector makes a substantial investment in
sport, with more than 2,000 UK companies
involved. The sports sponsorship market was
estimated to be worth £376.5 million in 1999.
Sponsorship may take the form of financing
specific events or championships, such as
horse races or cricket leagues, or grants to
sports organisations or individual performers.
Motor sport and football receive the largest
amounts of private sponsorship. Two recent
examples of major sport sponsorship are the
signature in February 2000 by Manchester
United of a new four-year sponsorship
agreement worth £30 million with Vodafone
(the biggest sponsorship deal in European
football) and an eight-year agreement under
which the Squash Rackets Association sold the
commercial rights to the British Open
Championships to Fablon Investments/Eye
Group for £2 million.
Sponsorship is encouraged by a number of
bodies, including the Institute of Sports
Sponsorship (ISS), which comprises some 100
UK companies involved in sponsoring sport;
and the Sports Sponsorship Advisory Service,
administered jointly by the CCPR (see p. 288)
and the ISS, and funded by Sport England,
and similar advisory services of sportscotland
and the Sports Council for Wales.
Under the EC’s Tobacco Advertising
Directive, the Government intends to ban
tobacco sponsorship of sport from 2003 in
most cases and from 2006 for certain
exceptional global events. It has set up a task
force of business and sponsorship experts to
help the sports affected. Seven sports have
sought assistance to make the transition—
rugby league, clay pigeon shooting, billiards
and snooker, pool, darts, ice hockey and
angling.
Sport is one of the main recipients of funds
raised by the National Lottery, and 62 sports
have received Lottery funding. By July 2000
awards totalling £1.1 billion had been made to
over 3,100 projects in the UK.
Sportsmatch
Sportsmatch aims to increase the amount of
business sponsorship going into grass roots
sport and physical recreation. It offers
matching funding for new sponsorships and
for the extension of existing ones. Priority is
given to projects involving disabled people,
the young and ethnic minorities and to
projects in deprived areas.
In England the ISS runs the scheme on
behalf of Sport England. Since 1992
Sportsmatch has approved 3,113 awards in
England, totalling £22 million and covering
about 70 different sports. Football, rugby union,
cricket, tennis and basketball have received most
awards. In Scotland and Wales the scheme is
managed by the appropriate Sports Council’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service.
SportsAid
SportsAid (the Sports Aid Foundation) raises
funds to help talented young British
sportspeople meet their training and
competition expenses. The criteria for
292
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
SportsAid grants are talent and the need for
financial help. Youngsters must normally be
aged between 12 and 18, but there is no age
limit for disabled people. SportsAid relies on
fund-raising, commercial sponsorship and
donations from the corporate and public
sectors. The Scottish SportsAid Foundation,
SportsAid Cymru/Wales and the Ulster
Sports and Recreation Trust have similar
functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, set up
by the football pools promoters in 1991, funds
small-scale projects in sport and the arts. This
initiative followed the 1991 Budget, in which
pools betting duty was reduced by 2.5 per
cent, provided that the money forgone by the
Government was paid into the new
Foundation; a further cut in duty announced
in the 1999 Budget will ensure that funding
continues until at least 2002. The Foundation
has made awards to schemes benefiting over
100 sports.
Betting and Gaming
Gross expenditure on all forms of gambling,
including the National Lottery, is estimated at
approximately £40 billion a year. In February
2000 the Government set up an independent
gambling review to examine the law on
gambling. The review has a wide remit and
will examine the ways in which gambling
might change in the next ten years (for
example, in the light of economic pressures,
the growth of e-commerce, technological
developments and leisure trends), the social
impact of gambling, and regulatory issues.
A new survey, published in June 2000,
found that 72 per cent of adults in Great
Britain gamble at least once a year. The
survey was carried out by the National
Centre for Social Research for a consortium
representing the gambling industry, the
Home Office and other regulatory
authorities, and GamCare (the national
centre addressing the social impact of
gambling). It found that the National
Lottery was by far the most popular
gambling activity in the UK. Some 65 per
cent of the adult population had bought
Lottery tickets in the year leading up to the
survey, and half the adult population
participated in the Lottery each week. For
one in four people the purchase of National
Lottery tickets was their only form of
gambling. According to the survey, other
forms of gambling in which people had
participated over the past year included:
• scratchcards (22 per cent);
• fruit machines (14 per cent);
• horse racing (13 per cent);
• private bets with friends or
workmates (11 per cent);
• football pools (9 per cent);
• bingo (7 per cent); and
• casino gambling (3 per cent).
New types of gambling, including spread
betting and gambling on the Internet, were
played by only a small number of people
(around 1 per cent). The survey found that
less than 1 per cent of adults would be
classed as problem gamblers.
POPULAR SPORTS1
Some of the major sports in the UK, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below.
1 Statistics for participation in particular sports in this section
are usually provided by the relevant governing body.
Angling
Angling is one of the most popular sports,
with an estimated 3 million anglers in the UK.
In England and Wales the most widely
practised form of angling is for coarse fish
(freshwater fish other than salmon or trout).
The rivers and lochs of Scotland and in Wales
are the main areas for salmon and trout
293
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
fishing. Separate organisations represent
game, coarse and sea fishing clubs in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and
there are separate competitions in each of the
three angling disciplines.
The UK has several world champion
anglers. In 1999 Bob Nudd became the first
angler to be world champion for the fourth
time when winning the world freshwater
fishing championships, and England
retained the men’s team title. England also
won the team gold in the 2000 European
freshwater fishing championships held in
Nottingham.
Athletics
In the UK athletics incorporates many
activities, including track and field events,
cross country and road running, race walking,
and fell and hill running. Mass participation
events, notably marathons and half
marathons, are popular. The largest UK
marathon is the London Marathon each
April, with over 31,500 runners completing
the 2000 event. The Great North Run, a
half marathon, takes place between
Newcastle upon Tyne and South Shields
each October. In these and other similar
events, many runners are sponsored, raising
considerable amounts for charities and other
good causes. The governing body for the
sport is UK Athletics. It has made successful
bids to host the world indoor and outdoor
championships in 2003 and 2005 respectively
(see p. 282).
At the Sydney Olympics in September
2000 Jonathan Edwards and Denise Lewis
won gold medals in the triple jump and the
heptathlon respectively. Four other athletes
won medals: two silver, for Steve Backley in
the javelin and Darren Campbell in the 200
metres, and two bronze, for Kelly Holmes
and Katharine Merry in the 800 metres and
400 metres respectively. British athletes held
world records in two events in September
2000: Jonathan Edwards in the triple jump,
achieved in 1995 when he became the first
man to jump beyond 18 metres; and Colin
Jackson in the 110 metre hurdles (achieved in
1991).
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch)
Badminton Unions. Around 2 million people
play badminton regularly. The Badminton
Association of England has a coach education
system to develop coaches for players of all
levels and a development department with a
network of part-time county development
officers.
The All England Badminton
Championships, staged at the National Indoor
Arena in Birmingham, is one of the world’s
leading tournaments. At the Olympic Games
in September 2000, Simon Archer and Joanne
Goode won the bronze medal in the mixed
doubles, the first Olympic medal ever won by
British badminton competitors in the
Olympics. At the 2000 European
Championships Joanne Goode and Donna
Kellogg won the ladies doubles.
Basketball
Over 3 million people participate in basketball
in the UK. The English Basketball
Association is the governing body in England,
with similar associations in Wales, Scotland
and Ireland (Ulster Branch). All the
associations are represented in the British and
Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as the
co-ordinating body for the UK and the Irish
Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues, which cover six divisions
for men and two for women, while there are
also leagues for younger players. Mini¬
basketball has been developed for players
under the age of 12. Wheelchair basketball is
played under the same rules, with a few basic
adaptations, and on the same court as the
running game.
The English Basketball Association runs
various development schemes for young
people which aim to increase participation and
improve the quality of basketball. With
support from National Lottery funds, some
294
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
10,000 outdoor basketball goals have been
installed in parks and play areas in England.
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat
green and crown green) and indoor bowls.
About 6,000 flat green lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish Bowling Associations, which, together
with Women’s Bowling Associations for the
four countries, play to the laws of the World
Bowls Board. Crown green bowls and indoor
bowls have their own separate associations.
The World Bowls Tour now organises bowls
at the professional level. Proposals for a single
world governing body are under discussion.
British bowlers have achieved considerable
success in international championships.
Scotland (represented by Alex Marshall and
George Sneddon) won the pairs event at the
world outdoor championships in April 2000 in
Johannesburg. The Scottish pairing of
Margaret Letham and Joyce Lindores won the
women’s world pairs title in Australia in
March 2000 and England won the overall team
title. At the 2000 world indoor
championships, held in Hopton-on-Sea
(Norfolk), Robert Weale won the singles
event, while David Gourlay and Alex
Marshall won the pairs title.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the
rules established by the Marquess of
Queensberry in 1865. In the UK boxing is
both amateur and professional, and in both
strict medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is controlled
by the Amateur Boxing Association of
England. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and boxing in Northern
Ireland is controlled by the Irish Amateur
Boxing Association. The associations organise
amateur boxing championships as well as
training courses for referees and coaches.
Headguards must be used in all UK amateur
competitions.
Professional boxing in the UK is controlled
by the British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints referees, timekeepers,
inspectors, medical officers and representatives
to ensure that regulations are observed, and
that contests take place under carefully
regulated conditions. Medical controls and
safety measures must be in place at all licensed
tournaments, to minimise the risk to boxers.
The Board nominates challengers for British
championships and represents the interests of
British licensed boxers in the international
championship bodies of which it is a member.
Lennox Lewis became the first undisputed
world heavyweight champion since 1992,
and the UK’s first undisputed world
heavyweight champion since 1897, when
beating Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas in
November 1999 to add two other versions
of the title to his existing World Boxing
Council (WBC) title. In August 2000 the
UK had four other world champions (as
recognised by organisations of which the
British Boxing Board of Control is a
member): Naseem Hamed, who holds the
World Boxing Organisation (WBO)
featherweight title and Paul Ingle (who
holds the International Boxing Federation
version); Joe Calzaghe (WBO super-
middleweight); and Johnny Nelson (WBO
cruiserweight).
Audley Harrison was the first British
gold medallist in boxing at the Olympic
Games since 1968 when winning the
super-heavyweight division at the Sydney
Olympics.
Chess
There are local chess clubs and leagues
throughout the UK, and chess is also played
widely in schools and other educational
establishments. Domestic competitions
include the British Championships, the
National Club Championships and the County
Championships. The Hastings Chess
Congress, which started in 1895, is the world’s
longest running annual international chess
tournament. A number of UK chess players
feature among the world’s best, including
Michael Adams and Nigel Short.
295
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The governing bodies are the British
Chess Federation (responsible for England
and for co-ordinating activity among the
home nations), the Scottish Chess Association
and the Welsh and Ulster Chess Unions.
Chess is not currently recognised as a sport,
but the Government has announced plans to
make it so by introducing legislation in
Parliament.
Cricket
The rules of cricket became the responsibility,
in the 18th century, of the Marylebone
Cricket Club (MCC), based at Lord’s cricket
ground in north London, and it still frames the
laws today. The England and Wales Cricket
Board (ECB) administers men’s and women’s
cricket in England and Wales. The Scottish
Cricket Union administers cricket in Scotland.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages. There is a
network of First Class cricket, minor county
cricket and club games with a variety of
leagues. A number of changes have been made
to the main professional cricket competitions.
A two-division structure was introduced in
2000 for the PPP Healthcare County
Championship, which is played by 18 county
teams in four-day matches. Promotion and
relegation are also a feature of the two-division
one-day Norwich Union National Cricket
League. Two other main one-day
competitions are held: the NatWest Trophy
and the Benson & Hedges Cup.
Each summer two visiting teams play Test
cricket against England in two-match and
five-match series of five-day Test matches; a
ten-match one-day triangular competition, the
NatWest Series, is also contested. In 2000 the
visiting teams were the West Indies and
Zimbabwe. England also play Test cricket
against Australia, India, New Zealand,
Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. A team
representing England usually tours one or
more of these countries in the UK winter. The
ECB has recently introduced a system of
contracts for elite cricketers, under which they
are under contract to the Board rather than to
their counties.
Cycling
Cycling includes road and track racing, time-
trialling, mountain biking (downhill,
cross-country and dual slalom), cyclo-cross
(cross-country racing), touring and BMX
(bicycle moto-cross). Mountain bikes are
increasingly popular and make up the majority
of the sales of bicycles.
The British Cycling Federation (BCF) has
14,000 members and 1,200 affiliated clubs. It
is the internationally recognised governing
body for British cycle sport. The Road Time
Trials Council controls road time trials and
has around 1,030 member clubs. In 1999
nearly 97,000 rides were completed in open
time trials in England and Wales. The CTC
(Cyclists’ Touring Club), with 70,000
members and affiliates, is the governing body
for recreational (including off-road) and urban
cycling, and hosts the CTC rally each year in
York. CTC Scotland and the Scottish
Cyclists’ Union represent cyclists in Scotland.
Wales and Northern Ireland have separate
federations affiliated to the BCF.
The World Track Cycling Championships
will be held at the Manchester Velodrome in
October 2000.
The British cycling team won four medals
in the Olympic Games in Sydney in
September 2000. Jason Queally won a gold
medal in the 1 km time trial, in an
Olympic record time, and then, along with
Craig MacLean and Chris Hoy, won a
silver medal in the men’s sprint. Bronze
medals were won by Yvonne McGregor in
the 3,000 m pursuit and by the team of
Bryan Steel, Paul Manning, Bradley
Wiggins and Chris Newton in the men’s
team pursuit; Rob Hayles and Jonny Clay
were also awarded bronze medals—they
were part of the squad but were not
involved in the final.
Equestrianism
Leading equestrian events are held at a
number of locations throughout the year. The
Badminton Horse Trials, sponsored by
Mitsubishi Motors, is one of the UK’s largest
296
BRITISH OLYMPIC SUCCESS
At the Olympic Games in Sydney, British athletes won 28 medals.

include the Horse of the Year Show at
Wembley in London and the Hickstead Derby
in West Sussex.
The British Equestrian Federation (BEF)
acts as the international secretariat on behalf of
its members, which include the British Show
Jumping Association, the British Horse Trials
Association, British Dressage, British Horse
Driving Trials Association, British Endurance
Riding Association and British Equestrian
Vaulting. These associations act as the
governing bodies of the different sporting
disciplines in the UK and oversee the
organisation of the major national and
international events. The British Horse
Society, which includes British Riding Clubs, is
responsible for promoting training, road safety,
rights of way and the welfare of horses, while
the Pony Club provides training for children.
In September 1999 the British three-day
event team—consisting of Jeanette Brakewell,
Pippa Funnell, Tina Gifford and Ian Stark—
won the European Championships at
Luhmuhlen (Germany), and Pippa Funnell
won the individual title. At the Olympic
Games a year later, the team of Jeanette
Brakewell, Pippa Funnell, Leslie Law and Ian
Stark won the silver medal.
Exercise and Fitness
Exercise and fitness is a term covering a
variety of activities—such as exercise to
music, aqua exercise, weight training and
circuit training—which aim to improve health
and fitness. The Keep Fit Association (KFA),
which has 900 teachers and a membership of
8,500, promotes fitness through movement,
exercise and dance for people of all ages and
abilities. Its national certificated training
scheme for KFA teachers is recognised by
local education authorities throughout the
UK. Autonomous associations serve Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Field Sports
Field sports in the UK include hunting,
shooting, stalking and hare coursing. There
are over 300 recognised packs of quarry
hounds in the UK, of which more than 180 are
foxhound packs recognised by the Masters of
Fox Hounds Association. Most hunts organise
‘point-to-point’ race meetings (see p. 299).
The Countryside Alliance promotes the
interests of field sports.
In June 2000 the report of the Committee
of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in
England and Wales was published. The
Committee looked at the contribution of
hunting to the rural economy, animal
welfare issues, the consequences of a ban
on hunting, pest control, and the social
and cultural impact. It found that between
6,000 and 8,000 full-time equivalent jobs
depend on hunting, but up to 70 per cent
more jobs might be affected by a ban,
although most employment effects could
be offset in the long term. However, the
effects on some communities would be
more serious in the short term. It said that
a ban on hunting with dogs would not have
any significant impact on the population of
foxes in lowland areas, but could lead to an
increase in numbers in upland areas where
the fox population causes more damage.
Although hunting caused concern on
animal welfare grounds, alternatives such
as shooting and snares also had adverse
effects.
In response to the report, the
Government has announced that it will
introduce a Government Bill in the next
parliamentary session containing a series of
legislative options. The main interest
groups will be consulted before the Bill is
produced, and Members of Parliament will
have a free vote on the options.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
320 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs
to regional or district associations. The FA,
founded in 1863, and the Football League,
297
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
founded in 1888, were both the first of their
kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78 full
and associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered
clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish
Football Association.
In England the FA Premier League comprises
20 clubs. A further 72 full-time professional
clubs play in three main divisions run by the
Football League. Over 2,000 English League
matches are played during the season, from
August to May. New centres of excellence for
coaching and developing young players are being
set up, with a contribution of £20 million from
the FA Premier League being matched by £20
million from Sport England’s Lottery Fund.
Three Welsh clubs play in the Football
League, while the National League of Wales
contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In
Scotland 12 clubs play in the Scottish Premier
League, while a further 30 clubs play in the
Scottish Football League, equally divided into
three divisions. In Northern Ireland, 16 semi-
professional clubs play in the Irish Football
League.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Cup (sponsored by AXA) and the
Worthington Cup in England, the Tennents
Scottish Cup and the CIS Insurance Cup in
Scotland, the Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup.
Football has seen an influx of money,
particularly into the top British clubs (such as
Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester
United, Tottenham Hotspur, Rangers and
Celtic), and many leading footballers from
other countries have been attracted to the
leading UK clubs. Turnover of the FA Premier
League reached £670 million in 1998-99, and
the League is the wealthiest in Europe.
In 1999 Manchester United won the
European Cup (the final of the European
Champions League), and the Toyota Cup in
Japan (an annual event between the two top
teams of Europe and Latin America), and in
January 2000 participated in the first FIFA
World Club Championship in Brazil.
Gaelic Games
Gaelic Games, increasingly popular in
Northern Ireland, cover the sports of Gaelic
football, ladies’ Gaelic football, handball,
hurling, camogie (women’s hurling) and
rounders. There are over 700 clubs
(incorporating more than 2,550 teams) in
Northern Ireland affiliated to the Gaelic
Athletic Association, the Ladies Gaelic
Football Association and the Camogie
Association, the official governing bodies
responsible for Gaelic Games.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland and since 1897 the
rules have been administered worldwide
(excluding the United States) by the Royal
and Ancient Golf Club (R & A), which is
situated at St Andrews. The Golfing Union of
Ireland and parallel unions in Wales, Scotland
and England are the national governing bodies
for men’s amateur golf. These bodies are
affiliated to the R & A and are represented on
the Council of National Golf Unions, which is
the UK co-ordinating body responsible for
handicapping and organising home
international matches. Women’s amateur golf
in Great Britain is governed by the Ladies’
Golf Union. Club professional golf is
governed by the Professional Golfers’
Association (PGA) and tournament golf by the
European PGA Tour and the European
Ladies Professional Golfers’ Association.
Women’s golf in the home countries is
governed by the English Ladies Golf
Association, the Welsh Ladies Golf Union,
Scottish Ladies Golf Association and the Irish
Ladies Golf Union.
The main tournament of the British golfing
year is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s four ‘major’ events. Other important
competitions include the World Matchplay
Championship at Wentworth; the Walker Cup
and Curtis Cup matches for amateurs, played
between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States; and the Ryder Cup and
Solheim Cup matches for men and women
professionals respectively, played every two
years between Europe and the United States.
There are over 2,000 golf courses in the
UK. Some of the most famous include St
Andrews (which staged the 2000 Open
Championship), Royal Lytham and St Anne’s,
Royal Birkdale, and Carnoustie.
Paul Lawrie won the 1999 Open
Championship. Colin Montgomerie was top of
298
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
the European list of money winners in 1999
for the seventh year running. Laura Davies
headed the women’s European list for the fifth
time and in May 2000 she recorded her 60th
tournament victory. In June 2000 the veteran
golfer Neil Coles became the first golfer to win
a professional event in six different decades
when he won an event on the European Senior
Four; he is also the oldest man to win a
tournament on this tour.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of the UK’s most
popular spectator sports, with about 4 million
spectators a year. The rules for the sport are
drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing
Club (NGRC), the sport’s judicial and
administrative body. The representative body
is the British Greyhound Racing Board.
Meetings are usually held three times a
week at each track, with at least ten races a
meeting. The main event of the year is the
Greyhound Derby, run in June at Wimbledon
Stadium, London. Tracks are licensed by local
authorities. There are 32 major tracks that
operate under the rules of the NGRC and
around 30 smaller independent tracks.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into seven main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics,
general gymnastics, sports aerobics,
trampolining, and gymnastics and movement
for people with disabilities.
The governing body for the sport is British
Gymnastics, to which 925 clubs are affiliated.
It is estimated that between 3 million and
4 million schoolchildren take part in some
form of gymnastics every day.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions, including running,
cycling and dancing. The heavyweight events
are the most popular and include throwing the
hammer, tossing the caber and putting the
shot. Over 70 events of various kinds take
place throughout Scotland, the most famous
being the annual Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for athletic
sports and games at Highland and Border
events in Scotland.
Hockey
The modern game of hockey was founded in
England in 1886. A single association—
English Hockey—now governs men’s and
women’s hockey in England; there are similar
single associations in Scotland and Wales. Cup
competitions and leagues exist at national,
divisional or district, club and school levels,
both indoors (six-a-side) and outdoors, and
there are regular international matches and
tournaments. The National Hockey Stadium
in Milton Keynes is the venue for all major
hockey matches played in England.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two main forms—flat
racing and National Hunt (steeplechasing and
hurdle) racing. The turf flat race season lasts
from late March to early November, but all-
weather flat racing and National Hunt racing
take place throughout the year. Great Britain
has 59 racecourses and about 13,000 horses
currently in training. Point-to-point racing,
restricted to amateur riders on horses which
are qualified by going hunting, takes place
between January and June, and is growing in
popularity.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event for three-year-old horses in
the flat racing calendar. Other classic races
are: the 2,000 Guineas and the 1,000 Guineas,
both held at Newmarket; the Oaks (Epsom);
and the St Leger (Doncaster). The meeting at
Royal Ascot in June is another significant flat
racing event. The most important National
Hunt meeting is the National Hunt Festival
held at Cheltenham in March, which features
the Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, since the 1830s, is the world’s most
famous steeplechase; the race is televised
around the world, with an estimated total
299
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
audience of approximately 515 million in 84
countries in 2000.
As the governing authority for racing, the
British Horseracing Board (BHB) is responsible
for strategic and financial planning, the fixture
list, race programmes, relations with the
Government and the betting industry, and
central marketing. The Jockey Club, as the
regulatory authority, is responsible for
licensing, discipline and security.
In March 2000 the Government announced
that the Horserace Totalisator Board (the
Tote), which provides pool betting facilities
on racecourses and in off-course betting
offices as well as offering telephone and
Internet betting, would be sold to the racing
industry. Legislation is planned both to effect
this transfer and to abolish the Horserace
Betting Levy Board and the annual levy under
which a proportion of horserace betting
turnover by bookmakers and the Tote is
returned to the racing industry. The
Government’s view is that these functions do
not need to be in the public sector, and that
arrangements under which racing receives
income from bookmaking should be decided
on a commercial basis. The BHB is preparing
a plan as to how racing would be funded
following abolition of the levy.
Ice Hockey
Ice hockey is a significant indoor spectator
sport, with over 2 million spectators each
season. Eight teams contest the British
Superleague, and 16 the Benson & Hedges
Cup. A further ten teams take part in the
British National League, run by the British
Ice Hockey Association, while there is also the
English Premier League; a new English
National League, in two sections (north and
south) has recently been established. There
are around 7,500 players in the UK.
Ice Skating
Ice skating has four main disciplines: ice figure
(single and pairs), ice dance, speed skating and
synchronised skating. Participation in ice
skating is concentrated among the under-25s,
and is one of the few sports that attracts more
female than male participants. The governing
body is the National Ice Skating Association of
UK Ltd, to which 75 clubs are affiliated.
There are over 70 rinks in the UK. A new ice
skating arena has recently opened in
Nottingham, with a second ice pad due to
open in June 2001. Construction of a twin ice
pad facility is in progress in Sheffield. Both of
the facilities in Nottingham and Sheffield have
received funding from the Sport England
National Lottery Sports Fund.
Judo
Judo is popular not only as a competitive sport
and self-defence technique, but also as a
means of general fitness training. An
internationally recognised grading system is in
operation through the sport’s governing body,
the British Judo Association.
At the world championships in
Birmingham in October 1999 Graeme Randall
won the light-middleweight title, while Kate
Howey and Karen Roberts won bronze medals
in the middleweight and light-middleweight
divisions respectively. In May 2000 Karina
Bryant won her second European heavyweight
title at the European Championships in
Wroclaw (Poland). At the Olympic Games in
September 2000 Kate Howey won the silver
medal in the middleweight event.
Martial Arts
Various martial arts, mainly derived from the
Far East, are practised in the UK. There are
recognised governing bodies for karate, ju¬
jitsu, aikido, Chinese martial arts, kendo,
taekwondo and tang soo do. The most popular
martial art is karate, with over 100,000
participants. For the first time, taekwondo was
a full Olympic sport at the Sydney Olympics,
and two people represented the UK. In
January 2000 the two main governing bodies
came together under the aegis of a
reconstituted British Taekwondo Council.
Motor-car Sports
Four-wheeled motor sports include motor
racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying and
karting. In motor racing the Formula 1 Grand
Prix World Championship is the pinnacle of
300
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
the sport. The British Grand Prix is currently
held at Silverstone (Northamptonshire), but
the next race, in July 2001, is expected to be
the last British Grand Prix at the track. From
2002 it is due to be transferred to Brands
Hatch (Kent).
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport in the UK is The Royal
Automobile Club Motor Sports Association,
which issues licences for competitors and
events. It also organises the Rally of Great
Britain, an event in the World Rally
Championship, and the British Grand Prix.
The UK has had more Formula 1 world
champions than any other country, the most
recent being the 1996 champion Damon Hill.
David Coulthard finished in third place in the
2000 World Championship, following Grand
Prix victories at Silverstone (for the second
successive year), Monaco and the French
Grand Prix.
UK car constructors, including McLaren
and Williams, have enjoyed outstanding
success in Grand Prix and many other forms
of racing. Most of the cars in Formula 1 have
been designed, developed and built in the UK.
The UK also provides a large proportion of
the cars used in the US Indy Car
Championships. The UK motor sport
industry is estimated to generate an annual
turnover of over £1.3 billion (of which exports
account for 60 per cent) and to employ more
than 50,000 people.
Motorcycle Sports
Motorcycle sports include road racing, moto-
cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing, enduro (endurance off-road racing)
and sprint. There are between 40,000 and
50,000 competitive motorcyclists in the UK.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union, for Great Britain, and the
Motor Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern
Ireland). The major events of the year include
the Isle of Man TT races, the British Road
Race Grand Prix and the British Superbike
series. T he Auto-Cycle Union also provides
off-road training by approved instructors for
riders of all ages.
Carl Fogarty is by far the most successful
rider in the World Superbike Championships
since they began in 1988, winning the world
title on four occasions, most recently in 1999,
and winning 59 races. However, in September
2000 he announced his retirement following
an injury earlier in the season.
In September 2000 Mark Loram won the
world speedway title, the first British winner
of the event since 1992. In 1999 Lee
Richardson won the world under-21
individual championship.
Mountaineering
The representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council (BMC), which works
closely with the Mountaineering Councils of
Scotland and Ireland. The main areas of work
include access and conservation. The BMC
estimates that the number of active climbers is
around 150,000, while there are also many hill
walkers. There are over 300 mountaineering
and climbing clubs in the UK, and three
National Centres for mountaineering activities
run by the Sports Councils (see pp. 290-1).
UK mountaineers have been prominent
among the explorers of the world’s great
mountain ranges. The best-known is Sir Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other expeditions.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball regularly
in England and a further 1 million young
people play in schools. The sport is played
almost exclusively by women and girls,
although male participation has increased in
recent years.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their own
separate organisations. National competitions
are staged annually for all age-groups, and
England plays a series of international matches
against other countries, both in England and
overseas.
Rowing
Rowing takes place in many schools,
universities and rowing clubs throughout the
301
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
UK. The main types of boats are single, pairs
and double sculls, fours and eights. The
governing body in England is the Amateur
Rowing Association (ARA); similar bodies
regulate the sport in Scotland, Wales and
Ireland (Ulster Branch). The ARA is also the
governing body for representative
international teams for Great Britain, in
World and Olympic competition.
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the w orld, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews from
all over the w orld compete each July in various
kinds of race over a straight course of 1 mile
550 yards (about 2.1 km).
The British rowing team won two gold
medals and a silver medal in the Olympic
Games in Sydney in September 2000, its
best result since 1948. Steve Redgrave
became the first competitor in Olympic
history to win a gold medal in an endurance
sport in five consecutive Olympics when
taking gold in the coxless fours, together
with Matthew Pinsent (w ith whom he had
w on the coxless pairs in the 1992 and 1996
Olympics), James Cracknell and Tim
Foster. The men’s eight of Louis Attrill,
Simon Dennis, Luka Grubor, Ben Hunt-
Davis, Andrew Lindsay, Fred Scarlett,
Steve Trapmore and Kieran West, together
w ith cox Rowley Douglas, also won gold.
In wanning silver, the women’s quad sculls
of Guin Batten, Miriam Batten, Katherine
Grainger and Gillian Lindsay achieved
Britain’s first w omen’s Olympic medal in
rowing.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby
union (see below) of 22 clubs in the north of
England, where the sport is still concentrated.
In the UK there are 30 professional clubs,
with about 1,500 professional players, and
some 400 amateur clubs with a total of around
40,000 players.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League, while the
amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association. The
major domestic club match of the season is the
Silk Cut Challenge Cup Final.
The tw o main leagues take place in the
summer. The Tetley’s Bitter Super League
consists of 12 clubs—11 from the north of
England and one from London—w hile 18
clubs play in the Northern Ford Premiership.
Sixteen nations will contest the Lincoln
Financial Group World Cup in October and
November 2000. It will be staged in England,
Wales, Scotland, Ireland and France, w ith the
final at Old Trafford (Manchester).
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game)
originated at Rugby School in the first half of
the 19th century. The sport is played under
the auspices of the Rugby Football Union in
England (the International Rugby Board
internationally) and parallel bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Ireland. Each of the four
countries has separate national league and
knock-out competitions for its domestic clubs;
how ever, the two premier sides in Scotland
play in a league with Welsh clubs.
Northampton became European club
champions in May 2000 w hen w inning the
Heineken Cup, beating Munster in the final.
The first Six Nations Championship,
contested by England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland (a team from the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland), France and Italy, was held
in 2000; previously this had been the Five
Nations Championship involving the home
countries and France. Overseas tours are
undertaken by the national sides and by the
British and Irish Lions, a team representing
Great Britain and Ireland. Tours to the UK
are made by teams representing the major
rugby-playing nations.
The 1999 Rugby World Cup took place in
Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and
France, w ith the final in the Millennium
Stadium in Cardiff.

18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Sailing
Sailing comprises yacht and dinghy racing and
cruising, powerboat racing, motor cruising, jet
skiing and windsurfing on inland and offshore
waters. The Royal Yachting Association
(RYA) is the national governing body for
boating in the UK and aims to make boating
in all its forms as accessible as possible; it also
includes RYA Sailability, the charity for
disabled sailors. It administers the
Yachtmaster yachting qualification. According
to the British Marine Industries Federation,
about 7.8 million people participate in the
sport. Among well-known yachting events in
the UK are the Admiral’s Cup, Cowes Week
and the Fastnet Race.
In January 1999 Ben Ainslie won the Laser
class world Championship in Melbourne, and
in June 2000 he won the Laser class European
championship for the fourth time. Jerry
Peachment won the World Formula II
powerboating title in 2000.
In the Olympic Games in September 2000
the British team was the most successful
nation in sailing, winning five medals.
Gold medals were won by Ben Ainslie (in
the Laser class), Iain Percy (Finn class)
and Shirley Robertson (Europe class),
while silver medals were won by Ian
Barker and Simon Hiscocks in the 49er
event and by Ian Walker and Mark Covell
in the Star class.
Skiing and Other Winter Sports
Skiing takes place in Scotland from December
to May and also at several English locations
when there is sufficient snow. The five
established winter sports areas in Scotland are
Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee, the Lecht and
Nevis Range. All have a full range of ski-lifts,
prepared ski-runs and professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-
slopes throughout the UK, and 1.5 million
people take part in the sport. The British Ski
and Snowboard Federation is the
representative body for international
competitive skiing and snowboarding. The
four home country ski councils are responsible
for the development of the sport, mainly
through coaching, race training and arranging
competitions.
The four-man bobsleigh team of Sean
Olsson, Dean Ward, Paul Attwood and
Courtney Rumbolt won a bronze medal at the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano in Japan.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India
in 1875 and is played by approximately
7 million people in the UK. British players
have dominated the major professional
championships. The main tournament is the
annual Embassy World Professional
Championship, held at the Crucible Theatre
in Sheffield. In May 2000 Mark Williams won
a closely contested final when defeating
Matthew Stevens by 18 frames to 16.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association organises all
world-ranking professional events and holds
the copyright for the rules. The representative
body for women is the World Ladies’ Billiards
and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association;
there are separate governing bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The British
Open Championships is one of the major
world events in the sport.
The number of players in the UK is
estimated at over 1.5 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly 9,000
squash courts in England, provided mainly by
squash clubs, commercial organisations and
local authorities.
For the first time the UK has two
individual world squash champions. In
September 1999 Peter Nicol won the men’s
303
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
World Championships in Cairo, regaining the
position of world number one, while in October
1999 Cassie Campion took the women’s title
when winning the final of the World Open
Championships in Seattle. In mid-2000 the UK
had ten men and nine women in the respective
top 20 world rankings.
Swimming
Swimming is a popular sport (see Table 18.1)
and form of exercise for people from all age-
groups. Competitive swimming is governed by
the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) in
England and by similar associations in
Scotland and Wales. Together these three
associations form the Amateur Swimming
Federation of Great Britain, which co¬
ordinates the selection of Great Britain teams
and organises international competitions.
Instruction and coaching are provided by
qualified teachers and coaches who hold
certificates awarded mainly by the ASA.
Table Tennis
Table tennis originated in England in the
1880s. Today it is played by all age-groups,
and in a variety of venues, ranging from small
halls to specialist, multi-table centres. It is also
a major recreational and competitive activity
for people with disabilities. The governing
body in England is the English Table Tennis
Association. There is also an English Schools
Association and separate associations in
Scotland, Wales and Ireland (where the
association covers both Northern Ireland and
the Irish Republic).
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1873 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), to which
Tennis Wales and the Scottish LTA are
affiliated. Tennis in Northern Ireland is
governed by Tennis Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. They attracted 457,000
spectators in 1999 and generated a surplus of
£30.2 million which was invested in British
tennis. Prize money totalled £8.1 million in
2000. Tim Henman reached the semi-finals in
the 1998 and 1999 Wimbledon
Championships. Lee Childs and James Nelson
won the boys’ doubles at the US Open in
September 2000.
About 5 million people play tennis in the
UK. There are national and county
championships, while national competitions
are organised for schools. Short tennis has
been introduced for children aged five and
over.
The LTA has a five-year plan for
developing tennis in Great Britain, with the
aim of expanding participation, encouraging
regular competition and producing more
world-class tennis players. Tennis facilities are
being improved, with more indoor tennis
centres, clay courts and floodlit courts. The
LTA’s Play Tennis 2000 initiative is designed
to attract more people to play tennis.

The term ‘sustainable development’ was first introduced in 1987, in the
Brundtland Report Our Common Future: the report of the World Commission
on Environment and Development. A widely used international definition is
‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs’. The UK Government has
adopted a strategy for sustainable development which includes 15 ‘headline
indicators’ against which progress will be monitored. A Sustainable
Development Commission was set up in 2000 to help monitor progress.
Introduction
Following the Rio de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’
in 1992 (the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development), the UK’s
first strategy on sustainable development was
published in 1994. In May 1999 the
Government published a revised strategy—A
better quality of life: A strategy for sustainable
development for the United Kingdom. This
builds on its predecessor by emphasising
social progress which recognises the needs of
everyone as well as effective protection of the
environment, prudent use of natural
resources, and maintenance of high and stable
levels of economic growth and employment. A
further report was published in December
1999 entitled Quality of life counts: Indicators
for a strategy for sustainable development for the
United Kingdom, which provides a baseline
assessment of the sustainable development
indicators (see p. 306).
The establishment of the Scottish
Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales
and the Northern Ireland Assembly means
that, where matters are devolved, the new
administrations decide how to proceed in the
light of their country’s particular
circumstances. Accordingly, while some of the
policies described in this strategy apply to the
UK as a whole, others are exclusive to
England.
Sustainable development requires
international co-operation. For the UK, the
European Union (EU) is especially influential.
Changes to the Treaty of Rome, agreed in the
Treaty of Amsterdam (see p. 78), give
sustainable development a much greater
prominence in Europe by making it a
requirement for environmental protection
concerns to be integrated into EU policies.
Indicators of Sustainable Development
The most widely used measure of the
economic progress of the nation is gross
domestic product (GDP, see p. 381) and, in
the context of sustainable development, this
305
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
has been complemented by two further
initiatives: the use of a range of economic, social
and environmental indicators of sustainable
development and the incorporation of
environmental data into the National Accounts.
In 1996, the Office for National Statistics
produced a first set of Environmental Accounts
for the UK—integrating environmental statistics
with the economic indicators in the National
Accounts. The most recent results were
published in the Office for National Statistics
compendium, The Blue Book, in August 2000.
Also in 1996, the UK published a set of
approximately 120 indicators of sustainable
development, and in the revised sustainable
development strategy, published in May 1999,
these were expanded to just under 150
indicators. The new set will be at the core of
future reports on progress. The most recent
report, Quality of life counts, gives more detail
illustrating past and recent trends and
providing a baseline assessment against which
future progress can be measured. This report
includes a subset of 15 key headline indicators,
which are intended to give a broad overview
and to focus attention on what development
means. Progress will be reported annually and
will inform future decision-making.
The 15 headline indicators, covering
economic, social and environmental concerns,
are:
• total output of the economy (GDP);
• total and social investment (investment in
education, healthcare, roads, railways,
buses, water and sewage) as a percentage
of GDP;
• the proportion of people of working age
who are in work;
• indicators of success in tackling poverty
and social exclusion;
• qualifications at age 19;
• expected years of healthy life;
• homes judged unfit to live in;
• the level of recorded crime;
• emissions of greenhouse gases;
• days when air pollution is moderate or
high;
• road traffic;
• rivers of good or fair quality;
• populations of wild birds;
• new homes built on previously developed
land; and
• waste arisings and management.
In addition, a core series of 29 local indicators,
linked to some of the national ones, have been
developed specifically for English local
authorities to use.
The Scottish Executive is currently looking
at adopting a similar set of sustainable
development indicators relevant to Scotland.
Government Role
The Government is committed, as part of its
strategy for sustainable development, to
integrating environmental considerations into
its decision-making at all levels, and in every
sphere of its activities. To ensure that this
happens, a number of committees and panels
have been set up.
Each main central government department
has appointed a Green Minister. Individually,
they are responsible for sustainable
development within their own departments,
their associated agencies and non-
departmental public bodies (NDPBs).
Collectively, they promote the integration of
sustainable development across government
and the wider public sector, encourage the use
of environmental appraisals as part of policy¬
making and continue to ensure departments
better manage their operational environmental
impacts. In July 1999 they produced their first
annual report which set out their
achievements and future work programme. A
second report is expected to be published in
November 2000.
Green Ministers report to the Cabinet
Committee on the Environment, which has
responsibility, at the strategic level, for
ensuring that environmental considerations
are fully integrated into all areas of policy, to
help achieve sustainable development. The
Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime
Minister. In addition, the parliamentary
Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) looks at
the effects of policies and programmes on
sustainable development and the environment
across all departments and monitors the work
of Green Ministers through an annual inquiry.

A Sustainable Development Unit was set up
within the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) in 1997 as
a focal point for policy, strategy and planning
on sustainable development. It works closely
with other departments and is able to offer
advice on the best way in which sustainable
development can be taken into account in
managing policy and operations. The Unit
promotes freedom of access to information on
the environment, public participation in
decisions that affect the environment and
access to legal recourse in environmental
matters. The Unit also oversees UK
ratification of the U nited Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE) Aarhus
Convention.
In 2000 the Sustainable Development
Commission was established. Its main role is to
encourage sustainable development in the
UK, review progress and build consensus on
the actions needed if further progress is to be
achieved.
The Commission supersedes The British
Government Panel on Sustainable
Development—an independent body, which
advised government on issues of major
strategic importance to sustainable
development. In 2000 it published its sixth
and final report covering five major topics:
sequestration of carbon dioxide (disposal by
storage); world trade, investment and
sustainable development; noise nuisance;
ethical aspects of biotechnology and
genetically modified organisms; and fisheries.
The Commission also supersedes The UK
Round Table on Sustainable Development,
which was established in 1995 to bring
together members from all parts of the UK
and from a wide variety of backgrounds. Its
main purpose was to identify ways of
achieving development in a sustainable
manner. In 2000 it published four reports:
Planning for Sustainable Development in the
21st Century; Indicators of Sustainable
Development; Not too difficult! Economic
instruments to promote Sustainable Development
within a modernised economy, and Delivering
Sustainable Development in the English Regions.
Other organisations set up to help formulate
or implement policy in this area are the
Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment (ACBE) (see p. 310), the Trades
Union and Sustainable Development Advisory
Committee (TUSDAC) (see p. 310) and Going
for Green, which seeks to persuade individuals
307
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
and groups to commit themselves to
sustainable development (in Scotland, this role
is taken by Forward Scotland).
One of the current projects of Going for
Green is the Don’t Choke Britain Initiative,
which aims to persuade people to adopt a
healthier lifestyle, for example, by
encouraging them to consider walking and
cycling rather than driving.
Local and Regional Sustainable Development
At the Rio de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992
an ‘Agenda for the 21st Century’ (Agenda 21)
was adopted by the international community.
It set out a framework of objectives and
activities for governments, civil society and
businesses, on sustainable development
necessary for the 21st century. In 1997 the
UK Government announced that all UK local
authorities should adopt Local Agenda 21
(LA21) strategies by the end of 2000. From
autumn 2000, local authorities will have a
statutory duty to promote and improve the
economic, social and environmental well¬
being of their areas, building on the
achievements of LA21.
The sustainable development strategy, A
better quality of life, encouraged the Government
Offices for the Regions in England to develop
regional sustainable development frameworks
by the end of 2000. Frameworks should set
sustainable development objectives for the
region as a point of reference for other regional
activity and be backed up by indicators and
targets which support the national indicators.
By July 2000, frameworks had been published
in the North West and the West Midlands.
Twenty-six of Scotland’s local authorities
expect to have adopted their LA21 strategies by
the end of 2000.
Taxes
‘Green taxes’ are one tool available to
government in its efforts to promote
sustainable development. One example of this
is the introduction of reductions of up to £500
in Vehicle Excise Duty for lorries and buses
with clean exhausts.
Other measures include the ‘climate change
levy’ (see p. 490) which will be applied to sales
of electricity, coal, natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) to the non-domestic
sector (business, commerce, agriculture and
the public sector) from April 2001. Its aims
will be to encourage business energy efficiency
and help meet the UK’s target for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent, set
under the Kyoto Protocol. Beyond that, it will
help the UK to move towards the
Government’s goal of a 20 per cent cut in C02
emissions in the UK. The levy package is
expected to save at least 5 million tonnes of
carbon a year by 2010. The levy should raise
around £1 billion in 2001-02, all of which will
be returned to business through a cut in
employers’ National Insurance contributions
and £150 million of additional support for
energy efficiency measures.
In the 1999 Budget, a staged increase in
landfill tax to encourage the diversion of waste
from landfill was announced, bringing the
standard rate of tax to £15 per tonne by 2004,
with a review thereafter (for waste disposal—
see p. 325). The landfill tax credit scheme
enables landfill site operators to channel up to
20 per cent of their landfill tax liability into
environmental bodies for approved projects,
which include reclamation of polluted land,
research and education activities to promote
re-use and recycling, provision of public parks
and amenities, and restoration of historic
buildings.
In the 2000 Budget, the Government
announced an aggregate levy for virgin sand,
gravel and crushed rock, due to be introduced
from April 2002.
Education and Training
In 1998 the Government set up an expert
panel (for England) to consider the provision
of education for sustainable development in
schools, youth services, further and higher
education, at work and at home. The panel has
commissioned a number of studies to develop
its strategy, including: a survey of sustainable
development learning by school leavers; a
good practice guide for the further education
sector and a survey of best practice in
business; research into appropriate languages

In Scotland, education for sustainable
development has been led by a group of
experts, associated with the Advisory Group on
Sustainable Development since 1995, and is
now integrated into the Scottish curriculum.
A Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland
has been set up to promote sustainable
development issues with its priorities being
waste, energy and travel. The Sustainable
Action Fund is giving over £1 million in
grants for 2000-01 to organisations promoting
sustainable development.
The Environmental Education Council for
Wales has developed a Welsh educational
strategy, and launched the first phase of its
Environment Network Centres in 1998.
The Environment Task Force (ETF), one
of four options available to 18-24 year olds
under the New Deal for Young People (see
p. 151), was launched in 1998. The ETF aims
to improve long-term employment prospects
through a combination of high-quality work
experience and training through sustainable
development projects.
Business and the Consumer
A number of initiatives have been introduced
to help both business and consumers to
become more environmentally aware. For
example, households are being encouraged not
only to recycle their waste, but also to buy
products that contain recycled material.
The Government is encouraging trade
associations and other representative bodies to
develop and implement strategies within at
least six business sectors by the end of 2000,
building on existing initiatives and best
practice.
The Environmental Technology Best Practice
Programme (ETBPP), launched in 1994, is a
13-year programme that promotes the use of
better environmental practices that reduce
business costs for industry and commerce. It
provides information and advice on
environmental technologies and techniques by
means of publications, events, and a freephone
UK helpline. By March 2000 the ETBPP had
stimulated savings for businesses of £100
million a year as a result of their adopting
better environmental practices and cleaner
technology. The ETBPP works in partnership
with the Energy Efficiency Best Practice
Programme (EEBPP, see p. 492) which
supports energy efficiency measures. In April
1999 the Government launched the
Sustainable Technologies Initiative (STI), to
build on the ETBPP and the EEBPP. The
STI is providing £7.8 million of support over
the next three years for the development of
new technologies that will help businesses to
be more efficient in their use of resources, and
produce less waste and pollution.
The Queen’s Awards for Environmental
Achievement are presented in recognition of
products, technology or processes developed
by British industry which offer major
environmental benefits. Awards are granted
only for products, technology or processes
which have achieved commercial success. In
2000 there were seven awards, for:
• Crossfield Limited of Warrington for
MACROSORB systems for treating and
recycling textile waste waters;
• the Paxton Division of McKechnie
Components Limited of Walsall, West
Midlands, for its ‘Maxi-Nest’ reusable
transport packaging system;
• the Renewable Energy Company of
Stroud (Gloucestershire) for ‘Ecotricity’;
309
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
• Strattons Hotel of Swaffham, Norfolk;
• TSL Group PLC of Wallsend, North
Tyneside, for its pollution-free Spectrosil
synthetic silica;
• Tesco Distribution Ltd of Hatfield
(Hertfordshire) for its ‘Maxi-Nest’
reusable transport packaging system; and
• D.W.Windsor Ltd of Hoddesdon
(Hertfordshire) for its Diamond Optic
light control system.
A similar scheme is the European
Environmental Awards sponsored by the
European Commission and the United
Nations Environmental Programme. This
award scheme (which runs every two years)
recognises and rewards companies that are
making significant contributions to economic
and social development without detriment to
the environment. In 2000, 12 UK companies
were nominated for the award and the judging
is due to take place in autumn 2000.
The Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment (ACBE) consists of business
leaders appointed by the Government and
serving in a personal capacity. It enables
government and business to discuss
environmental issues and aims to help the
business community to demonstrate good
environmental practice and management.
ACBE has produced eight progress reports
on its work to date. ACBE’s 1998 report,
Climate Change: A Strategic Issue for Business,
was influential in the development of the
climate change levy. A recent business
initiative on carbon emissions trading has been
led by an ACBE/Confederation of British
Industry Emissions Trading Group. ACBE
issued a report in October 1999 on carbon
trusts and low carbon technologies and a
report in May 2000 on how business can
contribute to the development of the flexible
mechanisms outlined in the Kyoto Protocol
(see pp. 331-2).
Many leading companies now address
environmental issues in their annual reports
and over 90 publish separate environmental
performance reports. To further encourage
the top 350 UK businesses to report publicly
on their major environmental impacts, the
Government has produced guidance to help
companies measure and report on greenhouse
gas emissions and waste. Guidance on water
use is due to be published in autumn 2000.
The TUSDAC was set up in 1998. Its key
objective is to provide the Government with a
trade union perspective on the employment
consequences of climate change.
Environmental Management Systems
In 1996, the International Organisation for
Standardisation (ISO) published ISO 14001, a
standard which allows organisations to
evaluate how their activities, products and
services affect the environment, and gives
them a systematic approach to improving their
overall environmental performance.
Certification is achieved only after an audit of
the organisation’s environmental management
system by an independent body, such as the
British Standards Institution (see p. 394).
Accreditation of certification bodies in the UK
is carried out by the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service (UKAS).
The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(EMAS) is a voluntary European Commission
scheme to register sites which have established
an environmental management system such as
ISO 14001 and which have additionally
produced an independently verified public
statement about the site’s environmental
performance. Although EMAS was
introduced primarily for industry,
participation has been piloted in the UK to
include local government. By May 2000, 73
industrial sites in the UK and seven local
authorities had registered under the scheme.
Environmental Labelling
Consumers often need assistance to make
environmental choices in the goods they buy
and often rely on the information given on
product labels. To help them, the
Government encourages accurate and relevant
environmental labelling, as part of an
integrated approach to reducing the
environmental impact of consumer products.
In 1998 the Government launched a voluntary
Green Claims Code which sets out guidance
for businesses making environmental claims
about their products. In June 2000 the code
was revised in line with ISO 14021—the
310
19: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
international standard on environmental
labelling (which was adopted in 1999).
The Government’s Market Transformation
Programme encourages the take-up of more
energy-efficient domestic appliances. The
mandatory EU energy labelling scheme
provides graded information on product
performance, and EU measures have also
resulted in the removal of inefficient
appliances from the market. The Government
has wound up the UK Ecolabelling Board and
has taken over the function of the competent
body for the voluntary EU Ecolabelling
scheme in the UK. d he Advisory Committee on
Consumer Products and the Environment assists
the development of a comprehensive approach
to consumer product policy and strategic
environmental labelling issues.
Biodiversity
The Convention on Biological Diversity was
another major initiative stemming from the
‘Earth Summit’ in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The
UK is one of 177 parties to the Convention.
The parties have agreed to develop national
strategies and programmes for the
conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity, and in particular to protect the
world’s growing number of endangered
species. In 1994, the UK published a
Biodiversity Action Plan, which combines
new and existing nature conservation
initiatives with its emphasis on a partnership
approach. It contains objectives for conserving
and enhancing plants, animals and habitats,
promoting public awareness and contributing
to international conservation efforts. The UK
Biodiversity Group advises the Government
on implementation, representing a partnership
of statutory, voluntary and private sectors.
By the start of 2000 action plans for 391
species and 45 habitats had been established in
the UK and over 30 local biodiversity action
plans were at various stages of
implementation. Current work involves
analysing the reports from lead partners (a
range of statutory and voluntary conservation
groups) on progress towards species and
habitat targets. A millennium biodiversity
report, accounting for the progress made so
far towards the implementation of the action
plans, is due for publication at the beginning
of 2001.
All government departments have agreed to
incorporate biodiversity concerns into their
policies and programmes and into the
management of their own estates.
Since the 1992 ‘Earth Summit’ the UK has
committed about £280 million to projects that
focus on, or contribute to, policy objectives on
biodiversity in 53 developing countries. In
light of the internationally agreed
development targets to halve the proportion of
people living in extreme poverty by 2015, and
associated targets for the creation of
sustainable livelihoods for people in poverty
and the protection of the environment,
projects funded in the last few years have
focused on the relationship between
biodiversity and poverty. Some examples of
these include improving people’s livelihoods
through sustainable use and conservation for
biodiversity, and the protection of those
livelihoods by preventing biodiversity loss. It
has also committed £215 million to the Global
Environment Facility, which supports the
Biodiversity Convention.
The UK continues to participate in
international efforts to implement the
Convention. In January 2000 at a meeting of
the Conference of the Parties, negotiations on
the Biosafety Protocol were concluded. This
Protocol—the first one to the Biodiversity
Convention—will give countries the chance to
make informed decisions (based on a risk
assessment) on the transboundary movement
of genetically modified organisms.

During 2000 several new strategies were developed: waste strategies for England
and Wales and for Northern Ireland (following the adoption of a similar strategy
for Scotland); the Climate Change Draft UK programme; and the UK-wide Air
Quality Strategy. Rural issues have also been on the agenda, with the
introduction into Parliament of the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill for
England and Wales, the National Parks (Scotland) Act, and with rural White
Papers planned for both England and Scotland.
Government funding for countryside and wildlife programmes in England and
Wales will rise from £161 million in 2001-02 to £207 million in 2002-03. For
Scotland funding will increase from £51.1 million to £52.6 million and for
Northern Ireland it will increase from £1.58 million to £1.62 million.
Conservation
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England. It works
closely with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) to ensure that
objectives for the countryside are integrated
with agricultural policies. The Environment
Group of the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs
Department, the National Assembly for Wales
(NAfW) and the Northern Ireland Executive
have broadly equivalent responsibilities for
other parts of the UK. The four bodies are
responsible for implementing the Biodiversity
Action Plan, the overarching framework for
conservation work in the UK. Many of the
conservation functions are delegated to
agencies, which are described below. In
addition, local authorities and many voluntary
organisations are actively involved in
environmental conservation and protection.
The Countryside and Wildlife
Countryside and Wildlife Agencies
The Wildlife and Countryside Directorate
(WACD), the DETR directorate responsible
for policy on wildlife and countryside,
sponsors four non-departmental public bodies:
313
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
• the Countryside Agency;
• English Nature;
• the Joint Nature Conservation
Committee; and
• the National Forest Company.
The Countryside Agency is the statutory
body whose stated aims are to conserve and
enhance the countryside; promote social
equality and economic opportunity for the
people who live there; and help everyone,
wherever they live, to enjoy this natural asset.
It was created in April 1999 by the merger of
the Countryside Commission and part of the
Rural Development Commission, and has a
budget of nearly £50 million for 2000—01. In
May 2000 the Countryside Agency published
The state of the countryside 2000, a
compendium of information about the
countryside, for example, how land is used for
business and for enjoyment and what it is like
to live in or visit the countryside. The
Countryside Agency is expected to have a key
role in implementing the measures that arise
out of the forthcoming Rural White Paper for
England. It will be assisted by a National
Countryside Access Forum, where
representatives of the main interest groups
will advise on the way the legislation is
implemented.
The Countryside Agency launched a
survey of all rural parishes in September
2000 to gather information about key
services in rural England. The findings
will be used to identify rural needs and
help the Countryside Agency to develop
policies to counteract rural social exclusion
and deprivation. The summary results will
be available from April 2001 to all county
councils and rural community councils for
use in planning for development and
service provision.
The purpose of English Nature is to
promote the conservation of England’s
wildlife and natural features and provide
advice to the Government on nature
conservation. Its budget for 2000-01 is £49.6
million. In Scotland the Countryside and
Natural Heritage Unit of the Environment
Group sponsors Scottish Natural Heritage
(SNH), a body with both the nature
conservation duties and powers of English
Nature, and the countryside and landscape
powers of the Countryside Agency. English
Nature works closely with SNH and the
Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), which
has responsibility in Wales for landscape and
nature conservation and countryside
recreation. The budgets for these two
organisations for 2000-01 are £42.4 million
and £33.5 million respectively. In Northern
Ireland, the Environment and Heritage
Service (EHS), an Agency within the
Department of Environment (DOE), protects
and manages landscapes, habitats and species
and also has an environmental protection role.
Its budget for 2000-01 is £26.2 million.
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are
also responsible for providing advice and
disseminating information to the Government
and the public on nature conservation, for
notifying land of special interest due to its
wildlife, geological and natural features and
for establishing National Nature Reserves.
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee
(JNCC) is the statutory committee through
which English Nature, the CCW and the
SNH exercise their joint functions. It is
responsible for advice and research on
international and national nature conservation
matters and for setting common standards for
monitoring, research and the analyses of
resultant information. Among other
initiatives, the JNCC has worked with a
consortium of agencies and bodies concerned
with the environment, including the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC), the
Environment Agency, the Natural History
Museum, the Royal Society for the Protection
of Birds (RSPB) and several others, to
establish a National Biodiversity Network.
The system (which is accessed via the
Internet) delivers information about the
management of biodiversities, nationally and
locally. At the international level, the JNCC is
working on implementing the Convention on
Biological Diversity (see p. 311).
The Rural Development Plan for England
for 2000 to 2006—jointly developed by
MAFF with the DETR and other
314
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
organisations—is the central programme for
implementing the new statutory rural
development regulation in England. This was
introduced as part of the Agenda 2000 reforms
of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) and sets the framework for bringing
agricultural and rural policy closer together.
The Plan marks a change in approach by the
Government to rural areas by introducing a
gradual reduction in direct production
subsidies and a gradual increase in support for
sustainable farming, forestry, rural enterprises
and communities.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill,
currently before Parliament, is being
introduced by the Government with the
aim of giving people greater freedom to
explore open countryside in England and
Wales. Proposals in the Bill cover:
• access to over 1.6 million hectares
(4 million acres) of mountain, moor,
heath, down and registered common
land, of England and Wales, much of
which will be opened up to the public
for the first time;
• new powers to enable public and
private landowners to create
additional permanent access rights
through their woodlands and other
land;
• a new duty for local authorities to
prepare improvement plans for rights
of way in their area; and
• new measures for the strategic
planning and management of rights of
way networks.
Nevertheless, the ‘right to roam’ will not be
unrestricted. It will be limited in scope to
avoid activities which cause harm or
damage, provide for closure of access land
and other restrictions to take account of the
need for conservation and of land
management, defence and national security.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
National Park status recognises the national
importance of the area concerned, in terms of
landscape, biodiversity and as a recreational
resource. However, the name National Park
does not signify national ownership and most
of the land in National Parks is owned by
farmers and other private landowners. There
are seven National Parks in England and three
in Wales. While there are currently no
National Parks in Northern Ireland or
Scotland, the Scottish Parliament passed the
National Parks (Scotland) Act in July 2000,
paving the way to establish Scotland’s first
National Park—Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs—by the summer of 2002, with the
second in the Cairngorms a few months later.
In England and Wales each Park is
administered by an independent National Park
Authority. The Countryside Agency and the
CCW designate National Parks and Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs),
subject to confirmation by the Secretary of
State for the Environment, Transport and the
Regions or NAfW respectively. In October
1999 the Countryside Agency began the
designation process of the New Forest as a
National Park and in April 2000 the
designation process began in the South
Downs.
There are 37 AONBs in England, five in
Wales and nine in Northern Ireland.
Designation started in 1956 with the Gower in
Wales and the most recent addition was the
Tamar Valley in Cornwall in 1995. Two
more—Erne Lakeland and Fermanagh
Caveland—have been proposed for
designation. In Northern Ireland the Council
for Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Government on natural landscapes
and the designation of AONBs.
The primary objective of the AONB
designation is the conservation and
enhancement of the natural beauty of the
landscape, although many of them also fulfil a
greater recreational purpose. In June 2000 the
Government announced its intention to
introduce amendments to the Countryside and
Rights of Way Bill (see box), which would
give a stronger role to local authorities and
communities in improving the conservation of
AONBs.
The budget for the management of AONBs

In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas (NSAs),
together covering 11,000 sq km (4,250 sq
miles). In NSAs certain developments are
subject to consultation with SNH and, in the
event of a disagreement, with the Scottish
Executive.
Forest and Country Parks
There are 17 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering nearly 3,000 sq km (1,150 sq miles),
which are administered by the Forestry
Commission (see p. 466). The Countryside
Agency recognises over 200 country parks and
more than 250 picnic sites in England. A
further 35 country parks in Wales are
recognised by the CCW, and there are also 36
country parks in Scotland. Northern Ireland
has eight Forest Parks, three Forest Drives
and over 40 minor forest sites. All are
The National Forest Company is
responsible for creating a new forest
between Burton-on-Trent and Leicester,
and so far has planted 2,600 hectares. The
Heart of the National Forest Visitor
Centre, the first phase of a £17 million
Millennium Discovery Centre complex
in north-west Leicestershire, opened in
1999 and attracted 55,000 visitors in its
first five months. It will be fully open by
early 2001.
administered by the Forest Service Agency, an
agency of the Department of Agriculture and
Rural Development.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County, metropolitan and unitary councils in
England and Wales (see chapter 6) are
responsible for keeping public rights of way
signposted and free from obstruction. Public
paths are usually maintained by these
‘highway authorities’, which also supervise
landowners’ duties to repair stiles and gates.
In Scotland planning authorities are
responsible for asserting and protecting rights
of way. Subject to public consultation, and, if
necessary, a public inquiry, local authorities in
Great Britain can create paths, close paths no
longer needed for public use, and divert paths
to meet the needs of either the public or
landowners. Farmers in England and Wales
are required by law to restore any cross-field
public paths damaged or erased by agricultural
operations. England has about 169,000 km
(106,000 miles) of rights of way: 132,000 km
of footpaths, 29,000 km of bridleways, 3,000
km of byways open to all traffic and 5,000 km
of roads used as public paths. There are also
13 long-distance routes in England and Wales,
designated as National Trails. Ten of the
National Trails have been fully developed and
three are in the process of being completed.
Horseriding and cycling in the countryside
are also encouraged. The Pennine

20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Disabled people are expected to be able to
access more of the UK countryside as a
result of an initiative by the Field Fare
Trust. The BT Millennium Miles Project
will identify and record at least 2,000 miles
of pathways for access by people with
disability.
Bridleway—currently under construction—
will be the first long-distance trail designed
specifically for horseriders and cyclists. About
a quarter of the rights of way in England may
be lawfully used by horseriders and cyclists.
Common land in England and Wales totals
more than 550,000 hectares and the open
character of commons has made them popular
for informal recreation. While four-fifths of
common land is privately owned, people other
than the owner may have rights over it, for
example, as pasture land. The DETR
estimates that 65 per cent of common land has
no remaining rights over it and only one-fifth
of common land has a right of public access.
Commons are largely unimproved, therefore,
have high amenity and wildlife value and are
protected by law and by nature conservation
designations. For example, 45 per cent of the
common land in England is found within
National Parks, and 33 per cent is designated
The Countryside Agency has established
at least 250 new Millennium Greens in and
on the edge of cities, towns, villages and
hamlets across England to mark the year
2000, with the aid of a £10 million Lottery
grant from the Millennium Commission.
By the start of 2000, over 250 communities
had received grants to help them prepare
their plans, acquire their land and begin to
create their local Millennium Green.
Examples include the Earlham Marsh
Millennium Green in Norfolk, Winston
Millennium Green in Co. Durham and
Aberfeldy Millennium Green in Tower
Hamlets, London. The Agency is also
looking for new opportunities and funding
to continue with work to provide new open
spaces for local people.
as SSSIs (see p. 318). Ministerial consent is
usually required to undertake works on them
or to enclose areas by fencing. In February
2000, the Government launched a public
consultation exercise aimed at finding ways to
improve the protection and management of
common land in England and Wales.
There is currently no automatic right of
public access to open country in England and
Wales, where local authorities can secure
access by means of agreements with
landowners. If agreements cannot be reached,
authorities may acquire land or make orders
for public access.
A similar situation prevails in Northern
Ireland, where the primary responsibility lies
with district councils. In Scotland, there is a
tradition of freedom to roam. The Scottish
Executive plans to formalise a right of
responsible access as part of the legislation on
land reform.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The policy for the protection of the
coastline against erosion and flooding is
administered by MAFF, NAfW, the Scottish
Executive and the Department of Agriculture
and Rural Development for Northern Ireland.
Operational responsibility lies with local
authorities and the Environment Agency.
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast of
particular beauty in England and Wales are
defined as Heritage Coast. There are 45
Heritage Coasts, protecting 1,540 km (960
miles), about 35 per cent of the total length of
coastline.
The National Trust (see p. 323), through
its Neptune Coastline Campaign, raises funds
to acquire and protect stretches of coastline of
great natural beauty and recreational value.
Around £34 million has been raised since
1965 and the Trust now protects around 940
km (600 miles) of coastline in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The National Trust for
Scotland owns large parts of the Scottish
coastline and protects others through
conservation agreements.

English Nature has supported 13 groups in
developing and managing a variety of marine
conservation initiatives. So far, 36 estuary
management plans have been completed or are
in preparation, covering 39 estuaries or 85 per
cent of England’s total estuaries by area (the
Dee and Severn estuary plans were jointly
funded with the CCW). There are also 29
informal marine consultation areas in
Scotland. In addition, SNH has established
the Focus on Firths initiative to co-ordinate
management of the main Scottish estuaries. In
Wales the CCW provides grants to the
Arfordir (or Coastal) Group, which is
concerned with the sustainable management of
the whole coast of Wales. Altogether there are
163 estuaries in the UK, representing about 30
per cent of the North Sea and Atlantic
seaboard of Western Europe. The UK also has
about 75 per cent of the European chalk coast.
Wildlife Protection
The protection of wildlife is an essential part of
the UK Government’s sustainable development
agenda. The UK has over 100,000 separate
species, out of a global total estimated by the
JNCC as being between 5 million and 15
million. The primary conservation legislation in
Great Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981, which provides for a range of
measures to protect plants and animals from
damage and destruction, including: affording
protection to wild birds and threatened wild
plants and animals, and enabling the effective
conservation of SSSIs (see below). The list of
protected species is reviewed by the three
statutory nature conservation agencies, acting
jointly through the JNCC, every five years,
when recommended changes can be submitted
to the Government. In 1998 a further 28 species
of flora and fauna were added to the list of
protected species.
Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Areas of
Special Scientific Interest
Habitat protection is mainly achieved through
the networks of Sites of Special Scientific
Interest (SSSIs) in Great Britain, and Areas of
Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs) in
Northern Ireland. By the end of March 2000,
6,545 SSSIs had been notified in Great Britain
and 177 ASSIs in Northern Ireland, for their
plants, animals or geological or
physiographical features. Some SSSIs and
ASSIs are of international importance and
have been designated for protection under the
EC Wild Birds and Habitats Directives or the
Ramsar Convention (see p. 320). Most SSSIs
and ASSIs are privately owned, but about 40
per cent are owned or managed by public
bodies such as the Forestry Commission,
Ministry of Defence and the Crown Estate.
318
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
English Nature, the CCW and SNH have
powers to enter into land management
agreements with owners and occupiers of
SSSI land, where this is necessary to
safeguard sites from damaging operations and
to support the management of their natural
features. The Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Government in Northern Ireland on nature
conservation matters, including the
establishment and management of land and
marine nature reserves and the declaration of
ASSIs.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill
(see p. 315) seeks to improve the protection
and management of SSSIs in England and
Wales, including enhanced powers for the
conservation agencies and powers to refuse
consent for damaging activities. Penalties for
deliberate damage to SSSIs will be increased
to a maximum of £20,000 in the magistrates’
court, with unlimited fines in the crown
court.
Wildlife Trusts (based on conurbations,
counties or regions), RSPB and the Scottish
Wildlife Trust play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout the UK. The
RSPB owns 161 reserves in the UK covering
111,542 hectares of land. During 1999-2000 it
acquired 2,075 hectares of land, including two
new reserves and a farm. The RSPB is the
largest voluntary wildlife conservation body in
Europe, with over 1 million members.
An important role in combating wildlife
crime is played by the Partnership for Action
Against Wildlife Crime, with representatives
from the organisations involved in wildlife law
enforcement in the UK. It provides a strategic
overview of wildlife law enforcement issues
and promotes increased awareness of wildlife
crime and the damage done to certain
threatened species. Wildlife crime takes many
forms and has been increasing in recent years:
for example, theft of eggs from birds of prey,
illegal shooting, trapping, poisoning, digging
up of wild plants, and the illicit trade in
endangered species. DNA testing is playing an
increasing role in combating crime of this
kind, and there are now specialist wildlife
officers in almost every police force in the
UK. Two of the most recent initiatives to be
developed include a National Wildlife Crime
Unit to tackle organised wildlife crime and
tougher penalties for persistent wildlife
criminals.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill
proposes to strengthen the species
enforcement provision of the Wildlife and
Countryside Act in England and Wales. Its
measures will include the option of custodial
sentences for wildlife offences and provide
police officers and DETR wildlife inspectors
with powers to take tissue samples from
wildlife species for DNA analysis. Following a
separate consultation exercise in Scotland, a
process of pre-legislative consultation on
reform of the law will take place in the near
future.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Extensive research and management are
carried out, principally by the four statutory
nature conservation agencies, to encourage the
recovery of populations of species threatened
with extinction in the UK. Species recovery
programmes form part of the UK Biodiversity
Action Plan (see p. 311). Individual action
plans cover a large number of plants and
animals in need of conservation action,
including some which are close to extinction.
While some well-known species, such as the
skylark and red squirrel, are still declining,
others like the otter and red kite are
recovering.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see
p. 446) has been successful for many years
with reintroduction projects. The Millennium
Seed Bank within the Wellcome Trust
Millennium Building, at Wakehurst Place,
West Sussex, has recently been completed.
The Bank holds seeds of 1,312 native UK
wildflowers, plants and trees—90 per cent of
the entire UK population. It aims to hold 10
per cent of flowering plants from the arid
regions of the world by 2010 and 25 per cent
by 2025. The Royal Botanic Garden in
Edinburgh (see p. 446) promotes conservation
programmes for rare plants in Scotland and
for coniferous trees worldwide, maintaining
genetically diverse populations in cultivation
at many sites, as pools for eventual
reintroduction to the wild.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree Preservation Orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands.
Once a tree is protected, it is, in general, an
offence to cut down or carry out most work to
it without permission. Courts can impose
substantial fines for breaches of such orders.
Where protected trees are felled in
contravention of an order or are removed
because they are dying, dead or dangerous,
replacement trees must be planted and local
authorities have powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes, including the Forestry
Commission’s Woodland Grant Scheme.
Consequently, the planting of broad-leaved
trees has greatly increased since the 1980s.
Major afforestation projects involving the
Forestry Commission, the Countryside
Agency and 58 local authorities include the
creation of 12 Community Forests in and
around major cities, covering 450,000 hectares
(1.1 million acres). The aims of these forests
are: to increase woodland cover near the cities
from 6.5 per cent to about 30 per cent; restore
areas scarred by industrial dereliction; create
sites for recreation, sport and environmental
education; and form new habitats for wildlife.
NAfW is developing a woodland strategy—
to be published in autumn 2000—which will
focus upon community woodlands, the
environmental management of existing
woodland, and the contribution that woodlands
make to rural, social and economic development.
The Woodland Trust is a voluntary body
which protects existing woods, and plants new
areas of woodland. It owns woods across the
UK covering about 17,700 hectares (43,070
acres) and, since 1976, has planted over 3.25
million trees.
International Action
The UK’s international obligations to
conserve wildlife include membership of the
World Conservation Union and of several
international Conventions. Under the EC
Wild Birds Directive, 216 UK sites have been
designated as Special Protection Areas (SPAs).
Under the EC Habitats Directive, 340 sites in
the UK have been put forward to the
European Commission as candidate Special
Areas of Conservation (SACs). Collectively,
SPAs and SACs form the European Union
network of nature conservation sites known as
Natura 2000.
The UK is party to the Ramsar
Convention, an intergovernmental treaty
which aims to stem the progressive
encroachment on, and loss of, wetlands. The
Convention covers all aspects of wetland
conservation and use, recognising wetlands as
ecosystems that are extremely important for
biodiversity conservation and for the
wellbeing of human communities. By March
2000, 147 Ramsar sites covering 680,000
hectares had been established within the UK.
In addition, there are a further ten sites in the
British Overseas Territories: seven in
Bermuda and one each in the British Virgin
Islands, the Cayman Islands and the Turks
and Caicos Islands, collectively covering over
55,000 hectares.
The Darwin Initiative, launched at the
1992 ‘Earth Summit’ in Rio de Janeiro, is
designed to bring British expertise to bear on
the biodiversity needs of developing countries.
Eight rounds of funding have so far been
approved for about 200 projects at a total cost
of £24 million. The latest round of 20
projects, announced in March 2000, includes
work to conserve big mammals, small
invertebrates, tropical rainforests and soil
diversity. The projects will examine:
• how to assess the impact of invasive
species;
• the effect of tourism on the environment;
• exploring practical measures with
indigenous people on how they can best
use their local natural resources; and
• raising public awareness of biodiversity
issues.
The UK is also party to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which
strictly regulates trade in endangered species
by means of a permit system. During 2000 the
UK led an international mission to tiger
habitats and to countries where trade of tigers
occurs, to promote efforts to conserve the
species. The mission’s recommendations,
320
20: ENV IRONMENTAL PROTECTION
which included the setting up of a global
Tiger Enforcement Task Force, were agreed
by the CITES conference in April 2000. The
conference also endorsed a UK paper on
Bushmeat (meat for human consumption
derived from wild animals) and the
Government announced that it would provide
£30,000 towards the establishment of an
international working group to identify ways
to manage the trade. In September 2000 a UK
listing of the basking shark came into force;
this bans global trade in basking sharks taken
from UK waters.
In November 1999 the latest Conference
took place of the Parties to the Bonn
Convention (the Convention on the
Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild
Animals). The Convention co-ordinates
international action on a wide range of
endangered migratory species. The UK was
responsible for putting forward a resolution
which commits all Parties to tackle the
problem of fisheries by-catch (any species
which are not part of the quota system) which
is a particular risk to endangered migratory
seabirds, turtles, and cetaceans.
Buildings and Monuments
In England lists of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest are compiled
by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS) with advice from English
Heritage. In Scotland and Wales buildings are
listed by Historic Scotland and Cadw: Welsh
Historic Monuments, an executive agency
within NAfW. It is against the law to
demolish, extend or alter the character of any
‘listed’ building without prior consent from
the local planning authority or the appropriate
Secretary of State, Scottish minister or
NAfW. A local planning authority can issue a
‘building preservation notice’ to protect for six
months an unlisted building—which it
considers to be of special architectural or
historic interest and is at risk—while a
decision is taken on whether it should be
listed. In Northern Ireland, the EHS has
responsibility for historic buildings, following
consultation with the advisory Historic
Buildings Council (HBC) and the relevant
local district council.
Ancient monuments are protected through
a system of scheduling. English Heritage is
assessing all known archaeological sites in
England in order to identify those sites—of a
total 600,000—that should be afforded
statutory protection. English Heritage will
then make its recommendations to DCMS,
which maintains the schedule of ancient
monuments. Similar efforts are being made to
identify buildings and ancient and historic
monuments eligible for statutory protection in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In England details of all listed buildings are
contained in about 2,000 volumes which can
be inspected at the English Heritage offices in
Swindon (National Monuments Record
Centre) and London. The lists for particular
areas are also held by the relevant local
planning authorities, where they are available
for inspection, and at some public libraries. In
Wales records are kept at Cadw: Welsh
Historic Monuments in Cardiff, and in

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Scotland they are kept at Historic Scotland’s
head office in Edinburgh or the relevant local
planning authority. EHS’s Monuments and
Buildings Record in Belfast holds information
on all historic monuments and buildings in
Northern Ireland.
English Heritage is responsible for the
maintenance, repair and presentation of 409
historic properties in public ownership or
guardianship, and gives grants for the repair of
ancient monuments and historic buildings in
England. Most of its properties are open to the
public, and there were nearly 6 million visitors
to its staffed properties alone in 1999—2000.
Government funding for English Heritage is
£114 million in 2000-01.
In Scotland and Wales, Historic Scotland,
which cares for over 330 monuments, and
Cadw, with 130 monuments, perform similar
functions. There were nearly 3 million visitors
to Historic Scotland’s properties in
1999-2000. An Ancient Monuments Board
and the HBC advise the Scottish First
Minister and similar arrangements exist in
Wales. The DOE in Northern Ireland has 181
historic monuments in its care, managed by
the EHS (another 1,435 are scheduled). It is
also advised by a Historic Monuments
Council.
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 9,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are 504 in Wales, 602 in Scotland and 53
in Northern Ireland. These areas receive
additional protection through the planning
system, particularly over the proposed
demolition of unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
(NHMF) helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
objects and collections that are of outstanding
interest and of importance to the national
heritage. Trustees are responsible for
distributing the heritage share of the proceeds
from the National Lottery (see p. 117). By
August 2000, over £1.5 billion had been
awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund for
5,627 projects.
Many of the royal palaces and all the royal
parks are open to the public; their
maintenance is the responsibility of the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, and Historic Scotland. Historic Royal
Palaces and the Royal Parks Agency carry out
this function on behalf of the Secretary of
State in England.
The Local Heritage Initiative, devised by
the Countryside Agency, is an English
grant scheme that helps community
groups investigate, explain and care for the
local landscape, landmarks, traditions and
culture. It was set up in February 2000,
with £1 million funding from the
Nationwide Building Society and
£8 million from the Heritage Lottery
Fund, with a commitment to continue
funding until 2010. This money is
expected to help establish about 3,000
individual projects covering natural, built,
archaeological and industrial heritage, plus
traditions and customs. There are plans to
develop similar schemes for communities
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
As the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, the UK has a
rich industrial heritage, including such sites as
the Ironbridge Gorge, where Abraham Darby
(1677-1717) first smelted iron using coke
instead of charcoal (now a World Heritage
Site—see p. 323). Several industrial
monuments in Scotland are in the care of the
First Minister, including Bonawe Iron
Furnace, the most complete charcoal-fuelled
ironworks surviving in Britain; the working
New Abbey Corn Mill; and Dallas Dhu Malt
Whisky Distillery.
The UK pioneered railways, and has a fine
heritage of railway buildings and structures. A
large number of disused railway lines have
been bought by railway preservation societies,
and several railway museums have been
established.
Reminders of the UK’s maritime past are
also preserved. Portsmouth is home to HMS
Victory (Admiral Nelson’s flagship), HMS
Warrior (the world’s first iron battleship,
launched in 1860), and the remains of King
Henry VIII’s Mary Rose, the world’s only
surviving 16th-century warship.
322
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
A voluntary body, the Maritime Trust,
preserves vessels and other maritime items of
historic or technical interest. The Trust’s
vessels include the clipper Cutty Sark
(launched in 1869) at Greenwich, in London.
In all, about 400 historic ships are preserved in
the UK, mostly in private hands.
World Heritage Sites
The UK has 18 sites in the World Heritage
List (see map at the front of the book), which
was established under the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation’s (UNESCO) 1972 World
Heritage Convention to identify and secure
lasting protection for sites of outstanding
universal value.
The UK is seeking election in 2001 to
become one of the 21 members of the World
Heritage Committee. The UK has drawn up a
tentative list of potential World Heritage
sites. Nomination for World Heritage Status
will be drawn from the 25 sites included in
this list over the next five to ten years. Three
sites from the tentative list were formally
nominated in 1999: the Heart of Neolithic
Orkney in Scotland; Blaenavon Industrial
Landscape in south Wales; and the town of St
George in Bermuda. Four further sites—
Derwent Valley Mills in Derbyshire; Saltaire
in West Yorkshire; New Lanark in Central
Scotland; and the Dorset and East Devon
Coast—were nominated in June 2000.
The Voluntary Sector
Voluntary organisations are well represented
in conservation work. Although they are
funded largely by subscription, private
donations and entrance fees, many receive
government support and grants, sometimes in
recognition of statutory responsibilities that
they perform.
The National Trust, a charity with nearly
2.7 million members, owns and protects places
of historic interest and natural beauty for the
benefit of the nation. It looks after around
270,000 hectares (667,000 acres) of land in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
including: 200 historic houses; 160 gardens;
40,000 ancient monuments and archaeological
remains; forests; woods; fens; farmland;
downs; moorland, islands; nature reserves;
coastline; and 46 villages. Some 12 million
people visit National Trust ‘pay for entry’
properties each year and an estimated 50
million visits are made annually to its coasts
and countryside properties. The separate
National Trust for Scotland owns 125
properties and 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres)
of countryside.
Pollution Control
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. The central
administration makes policy, promotes
legislation and advises pollution control
authorities on policy implementation. In
England, the Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
general responsibility for co-ordinating the
work of the Government on pollution control.
Similar responsibilities are exercised in
Scotland by the Minister for Transport and
the Environment, in Wales by the National
Assembly Environment Secretary and in
Northern Ireland by the DOE.
Local authorities also have important duties
and powers. They are responsible for:
• collection and disposal of domestic wastes;
• keeping the streets clear of litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
premises and, in England and Wales,
from many industrial premises;
• review, assessment and management of
local air quality; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The Environment Agency and the Scottish
Environment Protection Agency (SEPA)
regulate the major pollution risks to air, water
and land, and waste. In Northern Ireland, the
EHS exercises similar functions.
There is an extensive framework of national
and EC legislation on the manufacture,
distribution, use and disposal of hazardous
chemicals. New and existing chemicals are
323
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
subject to notification and assessment
procedures under EC legislation. Pesticides,
biocides and veterinary medicines are subject
to mandatory approval procedures.
International controls on the movement of
hazardous waste were strengthened under the
Basel Convention in 1998.
The Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution is an independent standing body that
advises the Government on dangers to the
environment, and suggests ways of integrating
environmental objectives with other economic
and social objectives in order to achieve
sustainable development. It has produced 22
reports so far on a variety of topics; the most
recent, entitled Energy—the changing climate,
was published in June 2000. A report on
environmental planning is expected be
published in 2001.
In 2000 the Environment Agency published
Spotlight on Business Environment Performance,
its 1999 report which highlights good and poor
performance by industry in England and
Wales. The report provides league tables of
good performers that have reduced the
amount of pollution they produce and league
tables of poor performers which have been
fined and prosecuted for pollution offences.
Key achievements highlighted, include:
a 20 per cent cut in the chemical industries’
emissions of volatile organic compounds;
a 29 per cent cut in sulphur dioxide released
by fuel and power stations; a 20 per cent
reduction in particulate emissions from metal
production and processing industries; and a 10
per cent reduction in particulate emissions
from the mineral industries. In all, 566
businesses and individuals were prosecuted for
pollution offences in 1999. The average fine
imposed was £3,500—or £4,750 if the
£750,000 fine for the Milford Haven Sea
Empress disaster in 1996 is included.
Industrial Pollution Control
The Environmental Protection Act 1990
established two pollution control regimes for
Great Britain: Local Air Pollution Control
(LAPC), which regulates emissions to air; and
Integrated Pollution Control (IPC), which
regulates emissions to land and water, as well
as air.
In England and Wales, LAPC is operated
by local authorities and IPC by the
Environment Agency. In Scotland SEPA
operates both IPC and LAPC. In Northern
Ireland the EHS exercises broadly similar
controls, and a regime similar to IPC was
introduced in 1998.
At the beginning of 2000 the Environment
Agency published the fourth and final
report in a series of initial evaluations of
the state of the environment of England
and Wales. This publication reviews the
state of the atmosphere while the previous
three reports addressed the state of the
freshwater environment, the coastal
environment and the state of the land. The
reports are intended to both inform and to
highlight those areas in which the Agency
has a particular role to play. Within the
report on the state of the atmosphere, the
Agency lists its priorities which include:
continuing to reduce emissions from the
industrial and waste sectors by
encouraging them to self-improve; and
improving air quality information available
to the public by expanding the Pollution
Inventory (see p. 325).
A new Pollution Prevention Control (PPC)
regime, which implements an EC Directive on
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control
(IPPC), came into force in England and Wales
in August 2000, and in Scotland in September
2000. PPC will succeed IPC and LAPC and
will be fully established by 2007.
Under both regimes, regulators are
required to ensure pollution from industry is
prevented or reduced through the use of best
available techniques, subject to assessment of
costs and benefits. Both regimes require
regulators to take account of the special
characteristics of an installation and its local
environment.
Under PPC, the issuing of integrated
permits will apply to a larger number of
industrial activities. These include, for
example, animal rendering, currently
regulated under LAPC, as well as some, such
as food and drink and intensive livestock
installations, which have not been controlled
324
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
under this type of regime. Regulators are also
required to take into account a wider range of
environmental impacts (including noise,
energy efficiency and site restoration) when
issuing integrated permits. Those LAPC
installations not covered by the IPPC
Directive will continue to have emissions to
air only regulated under PPG.
Existing installations are being phased into
the new PPG regime on a sectoral basis until
2007. Regulators, with some exceptions,
continue to be responsible for those installations
they currently regulate under IPG and LAPC.
In Scotland, SEPA will continue to regulate all
installations falling within the regime.
In May 1999 the Environment Agency
launched a Pollution Inventory, which
provides details of emissions to air, water and
land from processes regulated under PPG and
their contributions to national emission levels.
In 2000 it published the results. The data is
updated annually and can be found on the
Agency’s website: www.environment-
agency.gov.uk.
Land, Waste, Recycling and Litter
Soil quality in the UK is relatively good, but
faces pressure from a range of factors,
including urbanisation, localised erosion,
declining organic content and contamination.
The DETR plans, jointly with MALE, to
publish a draft strategy for England to
promote the sustainable use of soil and to raise
public awareness of the importance of soil as
part of the environment.
The UK’s legacy of contaminated land
results from an industrial age that generated
wealth but also caused much pollution. The
Environment Agency estimates that some
300,000 hectares of land are contaminated in
Great Britain. Government policy emphasises
the importance of voluntary action to clean up
contaminated land, and most attempts to clean
up sites occur when they are redeveloped. A
strengthened regulatory regime for dealing
with contaminated land came into force in
England in April 2000, and in Scotland in July
2000.
Waste regulation in England and Wales is
the responsibility of the Environment Agency,
while local authorities in England and Wales
are responsible for the collection and disposal
of all household waste and some commercial
waste. In ‘two-tier’ areas district councils are
responsible for waste collection and county
councils for waste disposal, while in unitary
areas the council has both roles. In Scotland
local authorities carry out both roles and waste
regulation rests with SEPA, while in Northern
Ireland responsibility for waste regulation is
being transferred from district councils to the
DOE.
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as
amended) and the Waste Management
Licensing Regulations 1994 regulate waste
management. A waste management licence is
required by anyone wanting to deposit,
recover, or dispose of waste. Licences are
issued by the Environment Agency and
SEPA. A duty of care requires waste
producers, and anyone else with responsibility
for waste, to take all reasonable steps to keep
their waste safe. If they give their waste to
someone else they must be sure that those
people are authorised to take it and can
transport, recycle or dispose of it safely.
Failure to comply with either the licensing
requirements or the duty of care is an offence.
Policies on waste shipment into and out of the
UK are under review.
Final disposal, generally through landfill,
makes little practical use of waste, although
recovery of the landfill gas for energy
generation can occur. The Government has
said that it wants to reduce reliance on landfill
and in 1999 increased the standard rate of
landfill tax from to £ 10 a tonne, with a
further rise of £1 a tonne a year until at least
2004, to encourage less disposal of waste to
landfill and more recycling.
In May 2000 the Government published
Waste Strategy 2000for England and Wales,
explaining its views on managing waste and
resources better and setting out the changes
needed to deliver more sustainable waste
management during the next 20 years, as well
as significant reductions in the amount of
biodegradable waste sent to landfill in line
with the relevant EC Landfill Directive. Key
measures include:
• new plans to require government
departments to buy recycled products;
325
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
• statutory local authority recycling and
composting targets, which will double
recycling and composting by 2003;
• more use of the landfill tax credit scheme
to deliver an increase in recovery,
particularly of household waste;
• a new Waste and Resources Action
Programme for developing the new
markets and end uses for recycled waste;
• tradable permits, limiting the amount of
biodegradable municipal waste that local
authorities can send to landfill sites;
• extending producers’ responsibilities to
recover their product, for example
newspapers and direct mail; and
• continuing to raise public awareness,
working with the National Waste
Awareness Initiative.
By 2005 the Government aims to reduce
the amount of industrial and commercial
waste landfilled to 85 per cent of 1998 levels
and to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent
of household waste, increasing to 33 per cent
by 2015. To ensure that all local authorities
contribute to achieving these targets, the
Government has set statutory performance
standards for local authority recycling in
England. Nine per cent of municipal waste in
England and Wales, 5 per cent in Scotland
and 4 per cent in Northern Ireland were
recycled in 1998-99.
A similar waste management strategy in
Northern Ireland was launched in March 2000.
This strategy was designed as a framework
against which planning and developments will
be shaped to achieve sustainable waste
management and to meet the targets for
diversion away from landfill. The main goals
for the term of the strategy are: by 2010 a
reduction of 25 per cent for biodegradable
municipal waste going to landfill (set against
1995 levels); a reduction of 50 per cent by
2013; and a reduction of 75 per cent by 2020.
Scotland also has its own waste strategy,
launched in 1999. The strategy’s objectives
include: ensuring that waste is disposed of
without endangering human health and
without harming the environment;
establishing an integrated and adequate
network of waste disposal installations;
encouraging the prevention or reduction of
waste production and encouraging the
recovery of waste. SEPA aims to fulfil the
objectives set out in its waste strategy by a
number of measures, including:
• establishing an integrated waste
management data system to enable changes
in waste management to be monitored;
• greater investment;
• new markets for recycled goods;
• publishing guidance on general technical
requirements for particular wastes;
• encouraging producers of special waste to
minimise waste and undertake pre¬
treatment prior to disposal;
• supporting the use of targets as a method
of changing behaviour; and
• commissioning waste management
research.
Under the EC Directive on packaging and
packaging waste, at least 50 per cent of the UK’s
packaging waste must be recovered and at least
25 per cent recycled by the year 2001.
Regulations that came into force in 1998 in
Great Britain and in 1999 in Northern Ireland
stipulate, among other things, that all packaging
must be ‘recoverable’ through at least one of the
following: recycling; incineration with energy
recovery; composting or biodegradation.
Across the United Kingdom, banks are
available for the public to deposit various
waste material for recycling. In 1999 there
were over 14,000 bottle bank sites provided by
local authorities. In 1998 there were over
9,000 can banks accepting aluminium cans. A
variety of other materials, such as textiles,
paper and plastics, are also recycled. In
addition, some local authorities provide
kerbside collection of recyclable material.
Litter and Dog Fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum fine upon successful prosecution is
£2,500. The optional litter fixed penalty fine,
which discharges a person’s liability to
prosecution, is £25.
326
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Local authorities have a duty to keep their
public land free of litter and refuse, including
dog faeces, as far as is practicable. Members of
the public have powers to take action against
authorities which fail to comply with their
responsibilities. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland local authorities also have
powers to make it an offence not to clear up
after one’s dog in specified places, and may
issue a fixed penalty fine of £25 under the Dogs
(Fouling of Land) Act 1996. In Scotland it is an
offence to allow a dog to foul in specified places.
The Tidy Britain Group and Keep Scotland
Beautiful are the national agencies for tackling
litter in collaboration with local authorities and
the private sector. The environment agencies,
local authorities, police and the Tidy Britain
Group have been monitoring the incidence of
‘fly tipping’ (illegal dumping of waste) since the
introduction of the landfill tax and found that
fly tipping has increased since 1994-95. The
maximum penalty for fly tipping (and other
offences relating to waste) is up to five years’
imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.
Water
In the UK, 94 per cent of the population live
in properties connected to a sewer, and about
90 per cent of the population receive primary
treatment and above. In England and Wales
the water industry is planning an investment
programme of some £7.4 billion during the
period 2000 to 2005 for improvements to
water quality. Progressively higher treatment
standards for industrial waste effluents and
new measures to combat pollution from
agriculture are expected to bring further
improvements in water quality.
In Scotland responsibility for the provision
of all water and sewerage services lies with
three Water Authorities, covering the north,
east and west of the country. For details on
the water supply industry and the Drinking
Water Inspectorate, see pp. 505-7.
In the UK, all discharges to water require
the consent of the appropriate regulatory
authority. For England and Wales this is the
Environment Agency, which controls water
pollution through the regulation of all effluent
discharges into controlled waters
(groundwaters, inland and coastal waters).
The Agency maintains public registers
containing information about water quality,
discharge consents, authorisations and
monitoring. Applicants for consents to
discharge have the right of appeal if they are
dissatisfied with the Agency’s decision—most
of these appeals are dealt with by the Planning
Inspectorate, an executive agency of the
DETR. Trade effluent discharges to the
public sewers are controlled by the sewerage
undertakers. In Scotland controlling water
pollution is the responsibility of SEPA,
appeals are dealt with by the Scottish
Executive and trade effluent discharges to the
public sewer are controlled by the Water
Authorities. In Northern Ireland the EHS is
responsible for controlling water pollution.
The Environment Agency reported 17,863
substantiated water pollution incidents in
1998, of which 3,600 were industrial. The
biggest polluter was the construction industry,
with 625 incidents. In Scotland SEPA
reported 2,168 water pollution incidents in
1998—99, of which 188 were significant.
Pollution by sewage remained the most
important source of pollution, with 615
incidents. In Northern Ireland of 1,506
substantiated incidents, 438 and 347 were
attributed to the agricultural and industrial
sectors respectively.
In 1999 new regulations came into force to
further protect groundwater. The regulations
are aimed at ensuring that groundwater is not
polluted by disposals to land of a wide range of
dangerous substances. Under the regulations,
certain such substances may not be disposed
of to land, and others may only be disposed of
following prior authorisation. The regulations
also give the Environment Agency powers to
stop activities which might cause groundwater
pollution.
There are 68 Nitrate Vulnerable Zones
(NVZs) in England and Wales, designated
under the EC Nitrates Directive, covering
8 per cent of the total agricultural land area.
There are a further two zones in Scotland and
three in Northern Ireland. Farmers in NVZs
are required to follow rules on timing and rate
of application of fertilisers and organic
manures. The aim is to protect vulnerable
waters against agricultural nitrate pollution as
nitrates can disturb the natural ecological
327
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
balance of water systems if they become
overabundant. This can lead to eutrophication
(enrichment of water by nutrients causing
growth of algae) and—in drinking waters—
pose a risk to human health. Farmers in NVZs
are also required to keep formal records of their
cropping and stocking densities together with
details of fertiliser and organic manure use.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
Bathing water quality is influenced by natural
factors such as temperature, salinity and
sunlight, discharges from coastal sewerage
treatment works, the operation of combined
sewer overflows (CSOs) in wet weather, and
run-off from agricultural land. Over the past
11 years the overall quality of UK bathing
waters has improved considerably; 91 per cent
of waters complied with the mandatory
coliform standards of the EC Bathing Water
Directive in 1999, compared with 66 per cent
in 1988. The Thames region and Northern
Percentage of Bathing Waters
complying1 with the EC Bathing
Waters Directive, UK
Per cent complying
1 The small number of designated bathing waters in Scotland
(60 in 1999 and 23 previously) and Northern Ireland (16) causes
greater fluctuations in percentage compliance than in England
and Wales (over 400 sites).
Sources: Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency,
and Environment and Heritage Service, Northern Ireland
Ireland achieved 100 per cent compliance,
compared with the North West of England
which had the lowest compliance rate—just
over two-thirds of bathing waters met the
required standard. In 1999 the Government
announced measures designed to bring further
improvements to bathing water quality over
the next five years. There will be secondary
treatment for all significant sewage
discharges—higher levels of treatment where
this is needed to protect bathing waters—and
the process of improving CSOs will be
speeded up, with around 3,800 (80 per cent) to
be tackled by March 2005. These measures
will be implemented with the help of £600
million from the water companies of England
and Wales. Consistent compliance with the
mandatory standards of the Directive is
expected to increase from 91 per cent in 1999
to 97 per cent by 2005, with further
improvement in compliance, particularly at
major holiday resorts. A record 57 beaches in
the UK were awarded Europe’s ‘Blue Flag’ in
2000, a substantial increase on the 41 beaches
that received an award in 1999, and the
number of marinas gaining the award rose
from 26 to 29. Blue Flag awards recognise
bathing water quality, beach cleanliness, dog
control, wheelchair access and the provision of
life-saving equipment and other facilities. In
2000 the Tidy Britain Group gave Seaside
Awards to 272 beaches in the UK for meeting
appropriate standards of water quality and
beach management.
Marine Environment
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (see
p. 372) is responsible for dealing with spillages
of oil or other hazardous substances from
ships at sea. The various counter-pollution
facilities for which it is responsible include:
remote-sensing surveillance aircraft; aerial and
seaborne spraying equipment; stocks of oil
dispersants; mechanical recovery and cargo
transfer equipment; and specialised beach
cleaning equipment. The Agency has an
Enforcement Unit at its headquarters in
Southampton for apprehending ships making
illegal discharges of oil and other pollutants off
the British coast. In 1997, the maximum fine
for pollution from ships was raised to
328
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
£250,000 in cases which are heard in
magistrates’ courts.
Decisions about which areas of the UK
Continental Shelf should be made available for
petroleum licensing take account of advice
from the JNCC. Where areas are made
available for exploration and development,
special conditions may be imposed on the
licence holders to minimise or avoid any
impact on the marine environment. These
conditions are agreed with the JNCC.
Government policy is not to permit any
deposit of waste in the sea where there is a safe
land-based alternative unless it can be
demonstrated that disposal at sea is the best
practicable option. Under the OSPAR
Convention, the Government is working
towards achieving substantial reductions of
radioactive discharges to near background
values for naturally occurring substances and
close to zero for artificial substances. Disposal
of sewage sludge at sea ceased at the end of
1998. The only types of waste that are now
routinely considered for deposit in the sea are
dredged material from ports and harbours,
and small quantities of fish waste.
Air and the Atmosphere
Air quality has improved considerably since
the smogs of the 1950s. The first step towards
these improvements was the introduction of
the Clean Air Act in 1956, which controlled
smoke from industrial and domestic coal
burning, a major source of pollution at the
time. Since then, better regulation of industry
has led to considerable improvements in air
quality. For example, in 1971, almost 8.5
million tonnes of carbon monoxide and over
6 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide were
emitted into the air in the UK. By 1998 these
emissions had fallen to under 5 million and
under 2 million tonnes respectively.
Industrial processes with the greatest
potential for producing harmful emissions are
subject to IPC and the IPPC (see p. 324).
Processes with a significant but lesser potential
for air pollution require approval, in England
and Wales from local authorities, in Scotland
from SEPA and in Northern Ireland from the
EHS. Local authorities also control emissions
of black smoke from commercial and industrial
premises, and implement smoke control areas
to deal with emissions from domestic
properties. The Department of Trade and
Industry has a major influence on air pollution
through its regulation of company matters,
through licensing of electricity generation and
supply, and through promoting the
development of cleaner technologies.
A new UK-wide air quality strategy was
published in January 2000. This sets air
quality objectives for the air pollutants of main
concern to health: nitrogen dioxide, PM10,
sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead,
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. It sets out a
programme of action to reduce air pollution
and so protect people’s health, particularly the
elderly and those with conditions such as
asthma who are most vulnerable, and the
natural and built environment. Measures to
reduce pollution from road transport are seen
as being key to achieving the objectives.
Progressively tighter standards on fuels and
vehicle emissions mean that urban road
transport emissions of carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides and particulates are projected
to fall by around 70 per cent between 1995 and
2015 (see chart on p. 330).
The UK has an automatic air quality
monitoring network with sites covering much
of the country, in both urban and rural areas.
In recent years this network has undergone a
rapid expansion, and it now has 110
automated sites. Daily Air Quality Bulletins
make air pollution data from the monitoring
network available to the public. These give the
concentrations of the main pollutants,
together with an air pollution forecast. The
information features in television and radio
weather reports, and appears in many national
and local newspapers. Information on the
Internet may be accessed through the UK’s
National Air Quality Archive website
(www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq.aqinfo.htm).
Vehicle Emissions
All new petrol-engined passenger cars in the
UK must be fitted with catalytic converters,
which typically reduce emissions by over 75
per cent. Vehicle emissions standards are
governed by a series of EC Directives
enforced in the UK under the Motor Vehicles
329
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Construction & Use and Type Approval
Regulations. The latest EC Directives, which
came into force in January 2000, will further
reduce emissions from passenger cars and
light commercial vehicles. The European
Commission has set tighter standards for both
car emissions and fuel quality, to be
introduced in 2005.
A further directive, which will come into
effect in October 2000, is designed to cut
pollution from goods vehicles and buses by
60 per cent. As well as reductions in oxides of
nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide,
this involves cutting emissions of particulate
matter by 86 per cent by 2005. Lorries and buses
are responsible for 55 per cent of particulate
transport emissions (and 39 per cent of oxides
of nitrogen). The use of new ‘particulate traps’
will remove most of the smallest particles,
which pose the greatest health risk.
These measures to reduce vehicle emissions
from new vehicles have been accompanied by
improvements in fuel quality with, for
instance, reductions in components such as
benzene and sulphur which have an
environmental impact, and the phasing out of
leaded petrol.
Compulsory tests of emissions from
vehicles in use are a key element in the UK’s
strategy for improving air quality. Metered
emission tests and smoke checks feature in the
annual ‘MoT’ roadworthiness test (see
p. 363). Enforcement checks carried out at the
roadside or at operators’ premises also include
a check for excessive smoke. The Vehicle
Inspectorate (see p. 363) carried out 119,441
roadside emissions checks in 1999-2000 (on
cars, coaches, goods vehicles, buses and taxis),
of which 2,680 failed. Under a trial scheme
introduced in 1997, seven local authorities

Units - see note within graph

330
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
were given powers to enforce vehicle exhaust
emissions standards by random testing at the
roadside, with a £60 fixed penalty fine for
offenders causing avoidable pollution. A
consultation document, issued in June 2000,
proposes an extension of these powers to local
authorities in England and Wales which have
designated air quality management areas.
The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force was
established to encourage the manufacture,
purchase and use of vehicles which are more
fuel-efficient, quieter, cause less pollution and
also use less resources in their manufacture.
The Government, industry and non¬
governmental organisations worked together
in partnership in the Task Force, and in June
2000 it produced its final report and
recommendations entitled The Way Forward.
Progress on implementing the Task Force’s
recommendations includes:
• a £6 million programme to take forward
the recommendations on reducing
pollution from existing vehicles;
• an increase in funding of the Powershift
Programme to £10 million for 2000-01
(the Powershift Programme is a
programme of the Energy Saving Trust
(see p. 492), helping to establish a
sustainable market for alternative fuel
vehicles in the UK and encourage wider
uptake of cleaner fuels);
• a voluntary environmental label was
introduced by the motor industry to
provide buyers of new cars with
information on fuel consumption and
emissions of carbon dioxide (C02), local
pollutants and noise; and
• ‘Motorvate’, a government-backed
scheme which sets targets for business
vehicle fleets to cut their fleet travel costs
and at the same time help the
environment, was launched in June.
Climate Change
Several gases naturally present in the
atmosphere keep the Earth at a temperature
suitable for life by trapping energy from the
sun—the ‘greenhouse’ effect. Emissions from
human activities are increasing the
atmospheric concentrations of several
important gases, causing global warming and
climate change. The most significant
greenhouse gas in the UK is carbon dioxide,
followed by methane and nitrous oxide. Some
other greenhouse gases, such as
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), have high global
warming potential but comparatively low
levels of emissions. However, there is an
upward trend in HFC emissions from end
uses, as consumption of HFCs has risen in
response to the phasing out of ozone-depleting
substances under the Montreal Protocol (see
p. 332). HFCs were virtually unused before
1990, but their emissions accounted for 2 per
cent of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in
1995 at 4 million tonnes of carbon.
Globally the temperature rose by about
0.6°C during the 20th century. In England, the
1990s experienced four out of the five warmest
years since records began in 1659, with 1999
being the warmest year. Research at the Hadley
Centre, part of the Meteorological Office, is
focused on improving climate predictions and
investigating the cause of recent climate
change. Results from its latest climate model
suggest that, with current levels of increase in
greenhouse gases, the global mean sea level will
rise about 20 cm by the 2050s, and there will be
a rise in average global temperature of up to
3°C over the next 100 years.
The Government has set up the UK Climate
Impacts Programme to allow detailed
assessments of the impacts to be made, both at
UK and regional levels. In Britain there may be
more droughts in the south and east of England,
more flooding in the north and west of England,
more damage as a result of storm surges, threats
to the coast and low-lying agricultural land, and
changes in wildlife and habitats.
Solutions on a global scale require
international co-operation and action. The
first international action dealing with climate
change dates from the ‘Earth Summit’ in Rio
de Janeiro in 1992, where the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change called for the
stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level which would
prevent dangerous man-made interference
with the climate system.
At the third Conference of the Parties to
the Framework Convention, held in Kyoto
331
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
(Japan) in 1997, developed countries agreed
legally binding targets to reduce emissions of
the basket of six main greenhouse gases: C02;
methane; nitrous oxide; HFCs;
perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and sulphur
hexafluoride. The Protocol committed
developed nations to a 5.2 per cent reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels
by 2008-12 (in 1990, the UK emitted 168
million tonnes of C02, 20.8 million tonnes of
carbon equivalent of methane and 18 million
tonnes of carbon equivalent of nitrous oxide).
The EU agreed to a collective reduction target
of 8 per cent. At a subsequent meeting in June
1998, the EU and member states agreed to
share out the EU’s target to reflect national
circumstances. Individual country’s targets
range from a reduction of 28 per cent for
Luxembourg to a permitted increase of 27 per
cent for Portugal. The UK’s target is a
reduction of 12.5 per cent.
A key consultation document published in
early 2000 was the Climate Change Draft UK
Programme, which sets out how the UK
intends to meet its Kyoto target. It sets out a
framework for:
• moving the UK towards a more
sustainable lower carbon economy;
• moving towards a domestic goal of a
20 per cent cut in C02 emissions by the
year 2010;
• ensuring that all sectors of the UK’s
economy and all parts of the UK should
play their part; and
• ensuring that the main polluters do what
they can to cut emissions.
The integrated package of policies and
measures contained in the Draft Programme
include the climate change levy (see p. 490),
agreements with energy-intensive sectors to
meet challenging targets, extra money for
improving business use of energy, carbon
trading (where countries that have achieved
emissions reductions over and above those
required by their Kyoto target can sell the
excess to countries finding it more difficult to
meet their commitments), reform of the
building regulations, EU-level voluntary
agreements with manufacturers to increase
fuel efficiency in vehicles and the promotion
of energy efficiency in the domestic sector.
The final Climate Change UK Programme
will be published later in 2000, prior to the
sixth Conference of the Parties to the
Framework Convention due to be held in the
Netherlands in November 2000.
Stratospheric Ozone Layer
Stratospheric ozone forms a layer of gas about
10 km to 50 km (6 to 30 miles) above the
Earth’s surface, protecting it from the more
harmful effects of solar radiation. British
scientists first discovered ozone losses over
much of the globe, including a ‘hole’ in the
ozone layer over Antarctica, in 1985. This
‘hole’ has been growing steadily and its edges
now reach beyond the Antarctic continent to
the tip of South America. Similar but less
dramatic thinning of the ozone layer occurs
over the North Pole each year as well. Ozone
depletion is caused by man-made chemicals
containing chlorine or bromine, such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or halons,
which have been used in aerosol sprays,
refrigerators and fire extinguishers.
In an effort to repair this damage, over 170
countries have ratified the Montreal Protocol,
an international treaty for the protection of the
stratospheric ozone layer. This is currently
enforced in the UK by an EC Regulation.
From 1 October 2000 a new EC Regulation
will be introduced with tougher restrictions,
including controls on the use of most ozone-
depleting substances, production controls on
HCFCs, a ban on new substances listed
(currently bromochloromethane), trade
controls and an export licensing system.
Following the implementation of the
Protocol, total levels of CFCs in the lower
atmosphere are now declining from a recent
peak.
Acid Rain
The pollutant gases sulphur dioxide (S02)
(mainly from power stations), oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) (from road transport and power stations),
and ammonia (NH2) (mainly from livestock),
can be carried over long distances before being
332
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECT ION
deposited directly on to vegetation and soil or
being washed out as acid rain. Acidification
results when sensitive ecosystems are not
capable of neutralising the deposited acidity. In
the UK, the ecosystems that are most sensitive
to acidification are located in the northern and
western uplands. The damaging effects of high
levels of acid deposition on soils, freshwaters
and trees, and on buildings, have been
demonstrated by scientific research. Lower
emissions of S02 over the past 25 years have led
to the first signs of a decrease in acidification in
some upland freshwaters, particularly in some
lochs in Scotland.
The UK is a party to the UNECE (United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe)
Convention on Long Range Transboundary
Air Pollution, which was set up in 1979 in
response to evidence that acidification of lakes
in Scandinavia was linked to European
emissions of S02. Under the Convention,
there have been a number of protocols to
reduce emissions of acidifying pollutants. The
latest ‘Gothenburg’ Protocol, signed in
December 1999, tackles the three
environmental problems of acidification,
eutrophication (excess nitrogen deposition)
and ground-level ozone (summer smog).
Under the Protocol, the UK agreed annual
emission ceilings of 625 kilotonnes for S02,
1,181 kilotonnes for NOx and 297 kilotonnes
for NH3 to be achieved by 2010. By
comparison, UK emissions in 1998 were 1,615
kilotonnes for S02, 1,753 kilotonnes for NOx,
and 350 kilotonnes for NH3. The Protocol also
set a ceiling of 1,200 kilotonnes for volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) (for example,
solvents used in industry, domestic products,
dry cleaning and paints). This pollutant
contributes to the formation of ground-level
ozone.
Running in parallel to the UNECE
Gothenburg Protocol is the National Emission
Ceiling Directive (NECD), agreed in June
2000. The NECD aims to tackle the same
three key environmental problems arising
from transboundary air pollution and also sets
ceilings for 2010 for the same four pollutants.
The UK has committed to further cuts in S02
and NOx emissions; by reducing the ceilings
to 585 kilotonnes and 1,167 kilotonnes
respectively.
Noise
The Air and Environmental Quality Division
in the DETR is responsible for the co¬
ordination and development of policies and
the promotion of initiatives to address the
problem of noise in England and Wales and
act as the UK lead in negotiations on
environmental noise in Europe. In Scotland
the Air Quality Team, part of the
Environment Group in the Scottish
Executive, has equivalent responsibility.
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for ‘statutory nuisances’, including noise
nuisance from premises and vehicles, machinery
or equipment in the street. They must take
reasonable steps to investigate complaints, and
serve a noise abatement notice where it is
judged to be a statutory nuisance. There are
specific provisions in law to control noise from
construction and demolition sites, to control the
use of loudspeakers in the streets and to enable
individuals to take independent action through
the courts against noise nuisance.
The Noise Act 1996 strengthened the law in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland on action
that can be taken against noisy neighbours, and
the Housing Act 1996 gave local authorities
new powers to deal with anti-social behaviour
by tenants, including noise. However, these
two Acts do not apply in Scotland where action
against noisy neighbours is taken under earlier
legislation. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998
introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders in
England and Wales, which can be used against
any person who is causing harassment, alarm or
distress to others.
Compensation may be payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors,
including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads, railways and airports.
Highway authorities are required to make
grants available for the insulation of homes
when they are subject to specified levels of
increased noise caused by new or improved
roads. Equivalent regulations exist for
railways.
National Noise Action Day on 7 June 2000
was co-ordinated by the National Society of
the Impact of Environmental Noise Pollution
to develop working partnerships with national
organisations with an interest in noise to
promote a harmonious society.

The UK is committed to seeking further
improvements in international aircraft noise
standards with a target date for agreement of
2001. Under international agreements, noisier
subsonic jet aircraft are due to be phased out
by 2002. Already over 95 per cent of UK-
registered jets are the quieter ‘Chapter 3’
types. Various operational restrictions,
including at night, aim to reduce noise
disturbance at the UK’s major airports.
The National Noise Incidence Survey and
the National Noise Attitude Study are surveys
undertaken by DETR to establish a baseline
for, and monitor changes in, the noise climate
in Britain. The latest survey results are
expected to be published in 2001.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents about 15 per
cent of the total exposure to ionising radiation
of the UK population; most radiation occurs
naturally. A large proportion of the exposure
to man-made radiation comes from medical
sources, such as X-rays. This and other man¬
made radiation is subject to stringent control.
Users of radioactive materials must be
registered by the Environment Agency in
England and Wales, SEPA in Scotland and
DOE in Northern Ireland. The Health and
Safety Executive (HSE—see p. 160) is
responsible for regulating safety at civil
nuclear installations. The National
Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) advises
334
20: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
on health risks posed by radiation and how to
guard against them.
International Commitments
An EC Directive lays down basic standards for
the protection of the health of workers and the
general public against the dangers arising from
ionising radiation. The provisions of the
Directive are implemented in the UK through
a number of Acts including the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993.
The UK has also ratified and will be
implementing the International Joint
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive
Waste Management.
The contracting parties to the OSPAR
Commission, including the UK, agreed at
Sintra, Portugal, in 1998 to reduce radioactive
discharges to levels whereby the additional
concentrations of radioactive substances in
the marine environment are close to zero by
2020.
In May 2000 the Government published a
consultation paper, UK Strategy for
radioactive discharges 2001-2020, which
outlines the proposed framework of the UK to
meet the Sintra commitments.
Radon
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas
which can accumulate in houses and accounts
for half of the total average population
radiation dose. Long-term exposure to the gas
can increase the risk of lung cancer. The first
measures to deal with the problem of radon
were announced in 1987. In Scotland (where
two radon affected areas were designated in
1983) data on radon levels are being collected
to help draw up a detailed picture of the
position. In 1998—99 the Government
completed its programme of offering a free
radon measurement to all households with a
greater than 5 per cent probability of being
above the radon ‘Action Level’, and is now
working with local authorities to encourage
building works that reduce radon levels in
homes.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Currently all solid radioactive waste in the UK
is either disposed of safely in suitable facilities
on land or stored pending such disposal. The
UK has not disposed of any solid radioactive
waste at sea since 1982.
The disposal of such waste is regulated by
law. Under the Radioactivity Substance Act
1993, the Environment Agency is responsible
for regulating the use and keeping of
radioactive materials and disposal of the waste.
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature
and level of activity, and the methods of
disposal reflect this. Most solid low-level
waste—material of low radioactivity—is
disposed of at the shallow disposal facility at
Drigg in Cumbria. Some small quantities of
very low-level waste are disposed of at
authorised landfill sites. Intermediate-level
waste is stored at nuclear licensed sites,
usually those sites where it is generated. Most
of the UK’s inventory is at Sellafield in
Cumbria. High-level or heat-generating waste
is stored in either raw (liquid) or vitrified
(glasslike) form. Once vitrified it will be stored
for at least 50 years to allow it to cool to a safe
temperature for disposal.
Environmental Research
Several government departments—such as the
DETR and MAFF, the Department of Health
and the Scottish Executive—have substantial
environmental research programmes. In
1999-2000 they commissioned about 140
research contracts, with a total value of £19
million. An increasingly important area is
research into the environmental effects of
genetically modified crops and micro¬
organisms (see pp. 442 and 454).
The European Wildlife Division within the
WACD manages a significant research effort,
of which the biggest element is the Countryside
Survey 2000. This is the fourth survey—
carried out every ten years—of habitats and
landscape features in Great Britain. However,
this will be the first survey to combine both
the latest satellite image analysis techniques
with traditional field survey to obtain full
national coverage and detailed information on
vegetation, soils and freshwater. The results
335
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
are expected to be published in a report
towards the end of 2000.
Among the other organisations that carry out
environmental research are the Meteorological
Office (including the Hadley Centre); the
Environment Agency, whose R&D budget for
2000-01 is £10.7 million; the Natural Resources
Institute of the University of Greenwich at
Chatham (Kent); and the Climatic Research
Unit at the University of East Anglia. Around
100 British universities and colleges run courses
on environmental studies or natural resource
management; many also carry out research. In
addition to research funded directly by SEPA
and the EHS, the Scotland and Northern
Ireland Forum for Environmental Research also
commissions research.
Most of the government-funded Research
Councils (see pp. 440-3) have a role in
environmental science research, but the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) takes the lead. NERC funds and
carries out scientific research in the sciences of
the environment and trains the next
generation of scientists. It carries out research
into five environmental and natural resource
issues of priority to the UK: biodiversity;
environmental risks and hazards; global
change; natural resource management; and
pollution and waste.
The UK is working on implementing
the EC Directive on zoos, which came into
operation in 1999 and which must be
implemented in UK domestic legislation by
April 2002. A zoos forum was set up in 1999
to advise ministers on all zoo matters and
one of its first duties was to consider new
standards for zoos, giving greater emphasis
to animal welfare, conservation and
education.

There are growing pressures on land use in the United Kingdom as a result of
an increase in the population and the demands of a growing economy. The
United Kingdom is a relatively densely populated country, with 245 people per
sq kilometre in the UK in 1999. The number of dwellings in the UK was
estimated at 25.0 million in 1998. The number of households in England is
projected to increase from 20.2 million in 1996 to 24.0 million in 2021.
LAND USE PLANNING
Planning systems regulate the development of
land use and contribute to the Government’s
strategy for promoting a sustainable pattern of
physical development in cities, towns and the
countryside.
Land use planning is the direct
responsibility of local authorities in Great
Britain. The Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
responsibility for the operation of the system
in England, and in Wales and Scotland control
now rests with the National Assembly for
Wales and the Scottish Executive respectively.
In Northern Ireland, the Planning Service, an
executive agency within the Northern Ireland
Executive, is responsible for the
implementation of government policies for
town and country planning in consultation
with the district councils.
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) issues
national planning policy guidance in England
on housing, economic development, transport,
retail and town centres, the countryside, green
belts, sports and recreation, minerals and waste,
and other topics. The DETR also provides
guidance on the operation of the planning
system at regional and local levels. Working
with the Government Offices for the Regions
(GORs), it ensures that regional planning
guidance, local authorities’ development plans
and decisions on planning applications are
consistent with national policies.
The National Assembly for Wales is
responsible for the development of national
planning policy in Wales. It ensures that
development plans and decisions on planning
applications are consistent with its national
planning policy.
338
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
The Planning Inspectorate serves both the
Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions in England and the
National Assembly for Wales on appeals and
other casework under planning, housing, the
environment, highways and related legislation.
It also provides information and guidance to
appellants and other interested parties about
the appeal process. In 1999-2000, over 12,600
planning appeal cases were determined. A
review of the Planning Inspectorate was
announced in March 2000 to look at its
organisation and identify means of improving
efficiency.
The Government is committed to
modernising the planning system. In general,
in England the responsibility for regional
planning is shifting from central government
to the regions. Regional planning guidance
(RPG) is issued by the Secretary of State and
sets out policies for land use and development
across the English regions. Although the RPG
has no statutory force, it provides the
framework for local authorities’ preparation of
development plans and local transport plans.
Draft planning policy guidance, issued in
1999, on regional planning issues places a
greater responsibility on the regional planning
bodies to work together with the Government
Offices, including the Regional Development
Agencies (see p. 394) and the public to resolve
planning issues at the regional level. The
planning policy guidance provides advice on
the main policy areas to be covered by the
RPG. Draft RPGs are subject to a
‘sustainability appraisal’ (SA) to determine
whether they deliver sustainable development.
An SA considers the potential economic and
social impacts of the plan, together with any
environmental effects. It is expected that by
the end of 2001 the majority of revised RPGs
will have been issued in England.
The Greater London Authority Act 1999
introduced new arrangements for planning in
London (see p. 63). The new Mayor has
responsibility for the production of a ‘spatial
development strategy’ that has a framework
for development, regeneration and transport
issues in London, and the strategy will require
changes to the legislative background against
which the unitary development plans are
prepared.
The Government issued its revisions to
South East local authorities draft regional
planning guidance in March 2000. The
revisions provide a framework for the
planning, management and monitoring of
future housing developments in the South
East. Outside London, the Government
proposes that the local authorities should
plan to provide an additional 43,000
dwellings a year, subject to a regular
review no less than every five years. Based
on the advice of the London Planning
Advisory Committee, the Greater London
Authority should plan to provide 23,000
new homes a year, the vast majority of
which will be on ‘brownfield’ (previously
developed) sites. The revisions also
include an extension of the Thames
Gateway area that would become a hub for
development and regeneration with fast
links to London and the continent of
Europe. Development projects previously
undertaken in the Thames Gateway area
include the Greenwich Millennium
Village.
In both Wales and Scotland, operation of
the planning system—including the
determination of most planning applications,
and the preparation of development plans—is
the responsibility of local planning
authorities.The National Assembly for Wales
and the Scottish Executive regulate and
provide guidance on the operation of planning
systems. The Scottish ministers approve
structure plans and take decisions on planning
applications that raise issues of national
importance. In Northern Ireland, the Planning
Service is responsible for issuing planning
guidance, for determining planning
applications and for preparing development
plans.
Land Use Development
The revised Planning Policy Guidance Note 3
on Housing, providing national planning
guidance on the future of housebuilding and
development in England, was issued in March
2000. The policies aim to take account of
339
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
changing lifestyles and the projected increase
in single—person households in the future.
The guidance sets out proposals for planning
authorities to recycle brownfield sites and
empty properties in preference to ‘greenfield’
sites; for using land more efficiently; for
assisting with the provision of affordable
housing in both rural and urban areas; and for
promoting mixed-use developments which
integrate housing with shops, local services
and transport.
A Planning Advice Note entitled Improving
Town Centres was issued in Scotland in
November 1999 providing advice on the
future regeneration of town centres.
The Government’s national target is that,
by 2008, 60 per cent of additional housing
in England should be provided on
previously developed land or by re-using
existing buildings. In 1998 the proportion
of new dwellings built on previously
developed land or provided by conversions
of existing buildings was 57 per cent. Over
the period 1994 to 1998, the average
density on previously developed land was
28 dwellings per hectare, compared with
22 dwellings per hectare on land not
previously developed.
Green Belts
Green Belts are areas of land that are intended
to be left open and protected from
inappropriate development. They aim to
control the unrestricted sprawl of large built-
up areas, prevent towns from merging with
one another, preserve the heritage of historic
towns and encourage the recycling of derelict
and other urban land, thereby encouraging
urban regeneration. Not all Green Belt land is
countryside. It can cover small villages
comprising a mixture of residential, retail,
industrial and recreational land as well as
fields and forests.
The first major Green Belt was established
around the fringes of Greater London, under
the London and Home Counties Green Belt
Act 1938. Green Belts have also been
established around Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, Greater Manchester, Merseyside
and the West Midlands, as well as several
smaller towns. In 1997, there were 14 separate
designated Green Belt areas in England,
amounting to 1.65 million hectares, about 13
per cent of the land area. In Scotland there
were six Green Belt areas totalling 156,000
hectares. There are no Green Belts at present
in Wales, but their creation is under
consideration. Development on Green Belts is
only permitted under exceptional
circumstances.
Where greenfield development is necessary
to accommodate housing growth, the
Government prefers extending existing urban
areas. The potential for investigating the
further development of two areas in the South
East—Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire
and Ashford in Kent—and a study to examine
the longer-term possibility of major growth in
the area around Stansted and the Ml 1
corridor in Essex were proposed under the
Government’s draft changes to the draft
revised planning guidance lor the South East.
National Land Use Database
The National Land Use Database is a
partnership project between the DETR,
English Partnerships (see p. 353), the
Improvement and Development Agency
(representing the interests of local
government) and Ordnance Survey. It aims to
establish a complete, consistent and detailed
geographical record of land use in England.
The first phase of the project focused on
previously developed vacant and derelict land
and other previously developed land which
may be available for redevelopment. 4 his
provided a snapshot for 1998, which showed
an estimated 57,710 hectares, in England, of
previously developed land that was unused or
potentially available for redevelopment, of
which 27,320 hectares either had planning
permission for housing or was judged suitable
for housing. According to density assumptions
current at the time, it was estimated that this
land could accommodate over 733,000 new
dwellings. The previously developed land
comprised 14,860 hectares of vacant previously
developed land, 19,340 hectares of derelict
land and buildings, 4,310 hectares of land
340
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
occupied by vacant buildings, 10,960 hectares
of land in current use but allocated in the local
plan for a change of use or with planning
permission for housing, and 8,240 hectares of
land with known development potential but
without planning permission.
Development Plans
Development plans play an integral role in
shaping land-use development in an area, and
provide a framework for consistent decision¬
making. Planning applications are determined
in accordance with relevant development plan
policies unless ‘material considerations’
indicate otherwise. In England, local planning
authorities are required to prepare
development plans in line with the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990. Regulations,
which took effect in January 2000, provide a
statutory framework for new procedures
designed to improve the delivery of
development plans. The Government expects
plans to be prepared and updated more quickly
and efficiently than they were in the past.
Planning Policy Guidance Note 12 (December
1999) emphasises that plans should be clear
and succinct, and highlights the importance of
integrating sustainable development and
transport with land-use policies in
development plans. Unless justified by specific
local considerations, plans should not conflict
with either national or regional policies.
In England, outside metropolitan areas and
certain non-metropolitan unitary authority
areas, the development plan comprises:
• structure plans, which are produced by
county councils, some unitary authorities
and National Park authorities (in many
cases on a joint basis) and set out the key
strategic policies and provide a
framework for local plans;
• local plans, which are produced by
district councils, some unitary authorities
and National Park authorities in which
more detailed policies are set out to guide
development in a particular local
authority area. The plans cover the whole
of a local authority area and may include
proposals for specific sites; and
• minerals and waste local plans, which are
produced by county councils, some unitary
authorities and National Park authorities
(which are usually the development
control authorities for these issues).
Within metropolitan areas and in some non¬
metropolitan unitary authorities, the
development plan comprises a single unitary
development plan (UDP). There are two parts
to the UDP: Part I consists of the local
authority’s strategic policies for the
development and use of land in its area, and
forms the framework for the detailed
proposals for the use and development of land
set out in Part II. By the end of 1999, 79 per
cent of local authorities had a local plan or
UDP in place.
All unitary authorities and National Park
authorities in Wales are preparing their first
unitary development plans based upon the
requirement in the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990, as amended by the Local
Government (Wales) Act 1994, for each local
planning authority to prepare a UDP for its
area. The UDP will be the development plan
for each county or county borough council
and each National Park, replacing the
structure plan, local plan and any other
existing plan. It is expected that adopted
UDPs will be reviewed in full at least once
every five years and partial reviews may be
more appropriate (for example on particular
topic areas) on a more frequent basis.
The planning system in Scotland is governed
by the Town and Country Planning (Scotland)
Act 1997. Development plans are prepared by
councils and consist of structure and local plans.
Councils are also responsible for making
decisions on most applications for planning
permission and for taking action against
development that has not been approved. In
November 1999, the Minister for Transport
and the Environment in Scotland announced
proposals designed to improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the planning process. The
Planning Audit Unit has been reviewing how
local authorities handle planning applications
with a view to improving performance and
disseminating practical advice.
In Northern Ireland, the Planning Service
put in place the Development Plan
341
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Programme in 1998. The programme is
reviewed and rolled forward annually, and is
designed to meet the development planning
needs of all districts.
Development Control
Most development requires specific planning
permission. Applications are dealt with on the
basis of the development plans and other
relevant considerations, including national and
regional guidance. In England, 480,000
planning applications were determined in
1999-2000, of which 63 per cent were decided
within eight weeks. The Government’s target is
for 80 per cent of applications to be dealt with
within this time frame, with the remainder
within three months. In Wales, 26,000 planning
applications were received of which over 67 per
cent were decided within eight weeks. In
Scotland, 65 per cent of applications had been
processed within two months in 1998-99, when
Scottish councils decided 42,400 planning
applications. In Northern Ireland, 20,000
district planning applications were received in
1998-99, of which 70 per cent were decided
within eight weeks.
If a local authority refuses to grant planning
permission, grants it with conditions attached
or fails to decide an application within eight
weeks, or two months in Scotland, the
applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary
of State in England, the National Assembly in
Wales and Scottish ministers in Scotland. In
August 2000, a package of revised rules and
guidance was introduced aimed at speeding up
decisions on planning appeals in England.
New arrangements are expected to come into
effect in Wales in early 2001. In Northern
Ireland, the applicant has the right of appeal to
the Planning Appeals Commission.
A pilot study undertaken by the Planning
Inspectorate during December 1998 and
December 1999 investigated the use of
mediation to resolve planning disputes
between local authorities and developers or
housebuilders. The study held 48
mediations, of which 65 per cent achieved
a successful outcome, and in 73 per cent of
cases there were no subsequent appeals.
In England, a small number of planning
applications are called in by the Secretary of
State each year for his decision, rather than
being decided by the local planning authority.
Generally this only happens where the
planning issue is of national or regional
importance. A small number of cases end up
as public inquiries; for example, the public
inquiry that began in June 2000 into
Railtrack’s Thameslink 2000 project, which
aims to expand and enhance the existing
North-South rail network affecting London,
the South East and East of England.
In certain circumstances, some categories of
planning application will have to be notified to
the appropriate ministerial authority; for
example, those involving a significant
departure from the approved development
plan. In Wales, a small number of cases are
called in for determination by the National
Assembly.
In Scotland, the Scottish Executive Inquiry
Reporters Unit is responsible for the
determination of the majority of planning
appeals and it organises public local inquiries
into planning proposals and related matters.
In Northern Ireland, major planning
applications can be referred to a public inquiry
in certain circumstances.
Certain projects must be accompanied by
an ‘environmental assessment’, which should
identify the likely environmental effects and
describe measures to minimise any adverse
effects. Before planning permission can be
granted, local planning authorities must
consider the assessment and any
representations received. New environmental
impact assessment regulations came into force
in Scotland in 1999.
The Architects Registration Board,
together with the architects’ professional
bodies, exercises control over standards in
architectural training, and encourages high
standards in the profession. The Royal Town
Planning Institute carries out similar functions
for the planning profession.
HOUSING
In England, the Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
responsibility for determining housing policy
342
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
and supervising the housing programme.
Responsibility for housing policy in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland has passed,
respectively, to the National Assembly for
Wales, the Scottish Executive and the
Northern Ireland Executive.
In Great Britain, the Government works
with local authorities (which are responsible
for preparing local housing strategies) and
with the private and voluntary sectors. In
England, the DETR also works with the
Housing Corporation, which regulates
registered social landlords (RSLs—see p. 348)
and provides financial support to help them
supply affordable housing. In Wales, the
National Assembly for Wales has
responsibility for funding and regulation of
RSLs. In Northern Ireland, the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) is
accountable to the Department for Social
Development and is the single housing
authority in the Province.
Housing Stock and Housebuilding
It was estimated that there was a stock of 25.0
million dwellings in the UK at the end of
1998. Completions of dwellings in Great
Britain numbered 169,700 in 1998 and rose by
1 per cent to 171,400 in 1999.
I he number of households in England is
projected to increase from 20.2 million in 1996
to 24.0 million in 2021, an increase of 19 per
cent over the 25-year period, according to
household projections produced by the
DETR. The biggest increase is expected in
the number of one-person households which
are projected to grow by 2.7 million, from 5.8
million in 1996 to 8.5 million by 2021—71 per
cent of the total increase in the number of
households. The size of the projected
increases in the number of households varies
across England. The South East, East of
England and the South West are all projected
to have around a quarter more households in
2021 than in 1996. For London and the East
Midlands growth is around a fifth and in other
areas projected growth is significantly lower.
The North East has the lowest projected
growth of just 8 per cent. In Wales, the
number of households is projected to increase
from 1.2 million in 1996 to 1.3 million in 2021.
The administrations across the UK have
set out their respective draft strategies for
housing policies for the future. In
England, the Housing Green Paper—
Qiiahty and Choice: A Decent Horne for
All—was published in April 2000. The
policies are aimed at improving the
provision, maintenance and management
of homes and include:
• a new Starter Home Initiative to
provide special target support for key
workers on lower incomes to help
them into home ownership in high
price, high-demand areas. Some
£250 million will be provided for this
initiative over the next three years
(2001-02 to 2003-04);
• increased help with housing costs to
assist unemployed people back to
work;
• action to prevent landlords neglecting
their responsibilities;
• assistance to homeowners for
maintenance and modernisation;
• short-term and long-term reform of
the Housing Benefit (see p. 178) and
rent systems to improve efficiency
and fairness and reduce fraud and
error;
• raising the standard of social housing
within ten years; and
• assistance for a wider group of
homeless people such as 16-17 year
olds and those who are vulnerable
because they are leaving care.
In Scotland, the number of households is
projected to increase by 12 per cent from 2.2
million in 1998 to 2.4 million in 2012. One-
person households accounted for an estimated
32 per cent of all households in 1998 and this
proportion is projected to increase to 38 per
cent by 2012.
In 1998-99, 22 per cent of households in
the United Kingdom lived in a detached
home, while 30 per cent and 28 per cent lived
in semi-detached or terraced accommodation
respectively (see chart on p. 345). A further

14 per cent lived in a purpose-built flat or
maisonette.
Home Ownership
At the end of 1998, it was estimated that the
number of owner-occupied dwellings in
England was 14.2 million, 68 per cent of all
dwellings. Homes rented from local
authorities or new town corporations
represented 16 per cent; those rented from
private owners or attached to a job or business
11 per cent; and those rented from registered
social landlords 5 per cent.
In England, provisional data for 1998 show
owner-occupation was highest in the South
East, at 75 per cent, followed by the South
West (73 per cent) and the East (72 per cent),
while the lowest level was in Greater London
(56 per cent). Owner-occupation was 71 per
cent in Wales and Northern Ireland, while in
Scotland, where owner-occupation has
traditionally been lower, the proportion was
61 per cent in 1998.
There are a number of schemes that exist
which aim to increase low-cost home
ownership. In England, these include the
Right to Buy, Right to Acquire and Voluntary
Purchase Grants, which offer tenants in social
housing a discount against the market value of
the homes they rent if they choose to buy
them. In addition, funding to support low-cost
ownership is also provided through the
Housing Corporation and local authorities,
including:
• Conventional Shared Ownership, which
allows people to part buy and part rent
homes developed by RSLs. The scheme
allows people to increase their share of
ownership in their home over time;
• Do-It- Yourself Shared Ownership, which
enables people to select a house in the
private market and then part own and
part rent it, with the RSL taking on
ownership of the rented share of the
property;
• Homebuy, which allows people to buy a
home in the private market with an
interest-free equity loan from an RSL for
25 per cent of the value of the property.
The loan is repayable, at 25 per cent of
the current market value, when the home
is sold; and
• the Cash Incentive Scheme, where local
authorities offer cash grants for the
purchase of a home in the private market.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home
ownership scheme allowing purchasers to buy
a home for 70 per cent of its value, the balance
being secured as a charge on the property.
Scottish Homes operates a scheme to
encourage private developers to build for
owner-occupation in areas they would not
normally consider. The Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association administers
the ‘buy half, rent half (shared ownership)
scheme operating in the Province.
Mortgage Loans
A feature of home ownership in the UK is the
relatively high proportion of homes purchased
with a mortgage. Most people buy their homes
with a mortgage loan, using the property as
security. In 1999 loans for home purchase
were obtained mainly through banks (756,000)
and building societies (304,000), with 122,000
loans being obtained from other lenders. Some
companies offer low-interest loans to their
employees.

Lenders differ in the amount they will lend
relative to annual income but will commonly
be prepared to lend up to three times earnings.
There are two main types of mortgage: a
repayment mortgage, which provides for
regular monthly repayments so that, over the
life of the mortgage (usually 25 years), the
debt, together with interest, is entirely repaid.
The second type of mortgage is the
investment-linked mortgage. With this type of
mortgage, only the interest on the loan is paid
from the beginning, so that the capital sum
borrowed does not decrease. Usually the
borrower makes a long-term investment at the
same time as taking out the mortgage which
should produce a capital sum sufficient to
repay the mortgage loan. Different types of
investments can be taken out including
endowment policies, personal pensions or
ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts). In
addition to the different ways in which a
mortgage loan can be repaid, there are also a
number of ways that the interest is charged:
• fixed rate, where the interest rate remains
fixed for a period of time, after which it
changes to the current variable rate or to
a new fixed rate;
• variable rate mortgage, where payments
vary according to mortgage rate changes.
Some lenders adjust the amount that is
paid on an annual basis, so that changes
which occur during the year are
incorporated when calculating the
following year’s repayment;
• discounted rate mortgage, where a discount
to the lender’s standard variable rate of
interest is offered. Some lenders also
offer cashbacks where a specified sum of
money is returned to the borrower on
completion of the mortgage; and
• cap-and-collar mortgage, where the
maximum and minimum rates of interest
which may be charged on the loan for a
given term are fixed.
Other types of mortgages exist for those
who wish to retain flexibility over their
345
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
payments to allow for variations in their
personal circumstances, and accelerated
schemes to provide the opportunity to repay
the debt more quickly.
Endowment mortgages have recently
become less popular with borrowers because of
the possibility that investments may not grow
fast enough to repay the capital borrowed. In
1988, endowment policies reached a peak of
popularity when 83 per cent of new mortgages
for house purchase were of this type. By 1999,
this had fallen to 27 per cent. Since 1988 there
has been a revival of the repayment mortgage.
Around 46 per cent of new mortgages were
repayment mortgages in 1999. The take-up of
interest-only mortgages has also increased since
1992 to 27 per cent in 1999.
There has also been an increase in the take-
up of fixed-rate loans and a greater willingness
to remortgage in order to take advantage of
price differentials between lenders. Over one-
third of loans in 1999 were at a fixed rate. In
October 1999, the Government announced
measures aimed at improving the home
buying and selling process in England and
Wales. The proposals include a requirement
for sellers to provide a pack of standard
documents and information for prospective
buyers before the property is marketed for
sale. The components of the seller’s
information pack were tested in a pilot study
of around 200 home sales in Bristol. The study
began in December 1999 and finished in
August 2000. Further measures to improve
the home buying and selling process include
changes to the law to permit electronic
conveyancing, encouraging local authorities to
increase the speed of the search process and
asking lenders to accelerate the provision of
deeds and the processing of mortgage
applications. The proposals seek to reduce the
time between offer acceptance and contractual
commitment, the period during which
gazumping (whereby the seller raises the price
of a property after having accepted an offer by
an intending buyer) and other problems most
commonly occur. Different arrangements for
home buying and selling operate in Scotland,
where the contract of sale becomes binding
once an offer has been accepted.
Under the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000, the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) will have statutory responsibility from
2001 for regulating certain aspects of mortgage
lending for residential purposes. The FSA
will authorise lenders to carry out mortgage
lending, regulate mortgage advertising and
require lenders to disclose the main features of
loans clearly and openly. The FSA will also
have a statutory objective to improve public
awareness and understanding of all financial
products.
New benchmark standards for variable rate
and fixed or capped rate mortgages to enable
borrowers to identify mortgage products
which meet minimum standards on charges,
access and terms (CAT) were introduced by
HM Treasury in April 2000. The CAT
standards for mortgages are voluntary.
In 1998-99, average weekly mortgage
payments for owner-occupiers ranged from
£38 in Northern Ireland to £88 in London.
Average weekly housing costs for all owner-
occupiers were also lowest in Northern Ireland
and highest in London. The average sale price
of dwellings in London rose by almost 17 per
cent between the last quarter of 1998 and
1999, while over the same period prices in the
North East rose by 6 per cent (see Table 21.2).
Rented Sector
At the end of 1998, 21 per cent of all homes
were rented to tenants by public sector and
non-profit-making bodies (such as housing
associations) in England, compared with 20
per cent in Wales and 25 per cent in Northern
Ireland. The highest level in the United
Kingdom was in Scotland, with around 30 per
cent of homes.
Private Rented Sector
The Government wants to see a healthy private
rented sector. It funds two independent
statutory housing services in England. The
Rent Service Agency, which was established in
October 1999 as an executive agency of the
DETR, provides impartial rental valuations,
which are designed to be fair to tenants and
landlords. Rent Assessment Panels deal mainly
with appeals against rent officers’
determinations and disputes between

leaseholders and their landlords. A report on a
review of the Panels in England was published
in July 2000, recommending a range of
measures for improving the quality and
effectiveness of the Panel service.
The Government published a draft Bill on
leasehold reform, for consultation in summer
2000, which included a range of proposals to
improve the rights of leaseholders to purchase
their freehold and protect themselves against
abuse by unscrupulous landlords.
Social Housing
Much of the Government’s expenditure on
social housing (rented housing at below
market rent) is provided as subsidies to local
authorities to help pay for the costs of over
3 million rented council homes. More than
2,000 housing associations (most of them
RSLs) provide other social housing. The
RSLs manage and build new homes for rent
and sale with the aid of government grants.
Most social housing in England is provided
by local housing authorities that are
responsible for preparing local housing
strategies. The finance for authorities’ housing
capital programmes comes partly from local
authorities’ own resources (mainly from
receipts from sales of assets not used to repay
debt and from contributions from the
authorities’ Housing Revenue Account and
general fund) and partly from central
government. In recent years, around £1
billion (about 40 per cent) of housing capital
expenditure by local authorities has been
financed by their own resources.
Central government resources are allocated
annually through the housing investment
programme (HIP) in England, based on
indices of the relative need for housing
investment in each authority and assessments
by Government Offices for the Regions of the
quality of authorities’ housing strategies and
their performance in delivering housing
services. Allocations for 2000-01 total just
under £2.1 billion, around 50 per cent more
than the 1999-2000 total. The extra resources
have been provided mainly to improve the
quality of local authority housing, but they can
also be used to fund private sector renovation
grants or to support the building or
acquisition of homes by housing associations
where this is a local priority.
The Housing Inspectorate has been
established to assess local authorities’
347
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
performance in achieving ‘best value’ in the
provision of housing services. It will inspect
all local authorities in England and Wales over
a five-year cycle commencing in 2000-01.
From April 2001, the Housing Revenue
Account will be in a new more transparent
form, based on resource accounting (see
p. 404), as part of a new financial framework
for local authority housing.
Between 1988 and 2000, 103 local
authorities in England transferred all or part
of their housing stock to new landlords, with
the support of tenants and the approval of the
Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions. The transfers,
involving over 457,000 dwellings, generated
over j£3.75 billion in capital receipts, and
raised over £7.59 billion of private finance.
Plans for the housing transfer programme for
2000-01 involving 22 local authorities were
announced in March 2000. It is expected that
the programme will involve over 160,000
dwellings in large-scale voluntary transfers,
generating capital receipts of over £940
million.
Housing revenue accounts are kept separate
from other council funds. The Government
grants English and Welsh local authorities
Housing Revenue Account Subsidy, planned
at £3.1 billion in England and £188 million in
Wales in 2000-01. In Scotland, Housing
Support Grant of £9.6 million and £272
million grant-in-aid to Scottish Homes are
planned for 2000-01.
Local authorities in Wales own around
200,000, or approximately 16 per cent, of all
Welsh homes. By law they have to manage their
own stock efficiently and in consultation with
their tenants, address current housing needs in
their area and plan to meet future needs and
demands. Planned provision for local housing
capital expenditure in 2000-01 is £194 million.
The Scottish Executive has provided local
authorities with nearly £155 million in capital
allocations for 2000-01. Public housing in
Scotland is also provided by Scottish Homes
whose main purpose is to help provide housing
and contribute to the regeneration of local
communities. It works in partnership with local
authorities, housing associations, the voluntary
sector, private developers, economic
development agencies, financial institutions and
local communities to tackle Scotland’s housing
problems. Funded through an annual grant
from the Scottish Executive, rental income, and
receipts from the sale of its own houses,
Scottish Homes plans to invest substantially in
its housing development programme in
2000-01. Investment will fund the provision of
around 6,600 new and improved homes by
housing associations and private developers.
Scottish Homes currently manages its own
12,000 social rented houses. Arrangements are
being made to transfer these to other landlords.
Newr Housing Partnership projects are
making an impact in urban and rural Scotland.
Around £170 million has been set aside
between 1998 and 2002 to develop community
ownership proposals and tackle outstanding
debt. A further £200 million has been invested
in development and regeneration partnerships.
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive
(NIHE) is the landlord of nearly one-third of
homes in Northern Ireland—over 128,000
properties. The Housing Executive, as the
strategic housing authority in Northern
Ireland, is responsible for the assessment of the
need for, and arranging for the supply of, social
housing while construction is undertaken by
housing associations. The NIHE’s capital
programme is financed mainly by borrowing
from government and receipts from house
sales; in 2000-01 plans for borrowing are
£18 million. Revenue expenditure is funded
from rental income and by a government grant,
which in 2000-01 is about £197 million.
Registered Social Landlords
Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) are the
major providers of new subsidised homes for
those in housing need. They own and manage
1.4 million self-contained units in England
and are diverse bodies, ranging from small
almshouses to very large housing associations
managing many thousands of homes. They
also include large-scale voluntary transfer and
local housing companies, set up to own and
manage council houses transferred out of local
authorities.
In England, RSLs are regulated by the
Housing Corporation, a non-departmental
public body sponsored by the DETR. RSLs are
non-profit-making bodies run by voluntary
348
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
committees, and over 2,100 are registered with
the Housing Corporation. The Housing
Corporation gives capital grants to RSLs to
provide homes for rent and for sale under
shared ownership terms. The rental programme
includes building new homes and the purchase
or rehabilitation of existing dwellings. The
home ownership initiatives help tenants (and
other first-time buyers) to buy homes of their
own. The capital comes from the Approved
Development Programme (ADP). In
1999-2000, the ADP provided over 25,000
homes for rent and sale to those in housing
need, and the transfer of 97,000 dwellings
generated more than £650 million in capital
receipts for local authorities and raised nearly
£1.2 billion in private finance.
Similar arrangements apply in Wales with
the National Assembly’s Housing department
and in Scotland with Scottish Homes.
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive
has continued to transfer its new build
programme to registered Housing Associations.
The 2001-02 transfer programme involves 29
schemes, representing a total of 519 dwellings.
The Housing Executive only builds where the
housing associations are unwilling to do so.
Tenant Participation
Local authority tenants in England, Wales and
Scotland have security of tenure and statutory
rights, which are set out in the Council
Tenant’s Charter. All local housing authorities
in England are expected to have been
introducing tenant participation compacts
since April 2000. These are agreements
between local councils and their tenants on
how tenants can be involved in decisions about
managing their homes in a way that meets
their needs and priorities. In 2000-01, £6
million of extra funding has been provided to
local authorities in England, with a further £6
million being made available in 2001-02 to
help them develop compacts with their
tenants. In Wales, RSLs are expected to
establish compacts by April 2001.
Rural Housing
If a clear need exists for low-cost housing in
rural areas, local authorities can permit housing
in localities where development would normally
not be allowed, as long as the new housing can
be reserved to meet that need. The Housing
Corporation finances a special rural programme
to build houses in villages with a population of
3,000 or less; funding for the building of almost
17,000 such homes was approved between
1989-90 and 1999-2000. The National
Assembly for Wales supports the development
of housing in rural areas if it is regarded as a
strategic priority by the local authority. In
Scotland, the Rural Partnership for Change
Initiative, announced in March 2000, is a pilot
scheme, bringing together Highland Council,
Scottish Homes and local housing providers.
The scheme is designed to tackle rural housing
problems and target resources more effectively.
The Scottish Homes Development Programme
was increased for 2000-01 by over 10 per cent
to £45 million. Funding will provide over 1,550
new homes and improved homes across rural
Scotland, of which 1,250 are planned for social
rent. A further 1,500 new or refurbished homes
are planned to be provided by attracting new
private investment into former council housing.
In Northern Ireland, a revised rural housing
policy was introduced in April 2000. This policy
reflects a wide range of topics related to rural
housing, including assessment of need,
improving housing conditions and closer
working with rural communities. It includes a
programme of around 260 new rural dwellings a
year, improvement or replacement of some 900
rural cottages over the next three to five years
and provision of central heating in some 7,000
rural dwellings within three years.
Improving Existing Housing
Slum clearance and large-scale redevelopment
used to be major features of housing policy in
urban areas in the UK. The modernisation
and conversions of sub-standard homes in
order to help maintain existing communities is
now undertaken wherever practicable. In some
cases, however, clearance may still occur. To
help overcome objections to clearance, local
authorities can pay a discretionary relocation
grant together with home loss and disturbance
payments to those with an interest in the
property to help them to buy a comparable
home in or near the same area.
349
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Social Housing
Most of the capital expenditure on housing
goes towards renovating and improving
existing council housing. In July 2000 the
Government announced an additional £1.8
billion for investment in housing. This is on
top of the extra £5 billion already being made
available through the Capital Receipts
Initiative and Comprehensive Spending
Review. These extra resources are expected to
help to bring all social housing up to a decent
standard by 2010. A new major repairs
allowance will be introduced from April 2001
to ensure that authorities have the resources
necessary to maintain their stock. In Wales,
£140 million of the £200 million capital
expenditure is spent on private renovation
grants.
Rundown estates are being improved
through various initiatives including Housing
Action Trusts, Estate Action, the Single
Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund (see
p. 352). Where a local authority’s housing
strategy includes the transfer of negative value
stock and tenants support this, the authority
may consider funding it through its main
housing investment programme or seek to
fund it from the New Deal for Communities
Programme (see p. 352) or the Single
Regeneration Budget. The Private Finance
Initiative is another important option for
improving local authority housing. The
DETR’s new spending plans provide £160
million in 2001-02 to fund eight existing
schemes and an extra £600 million over the
following two years to fund new schemes. In
Wales, Estate Partnership was set up to assist
local authorities in tackling the worst
problems on local authority housing estates by
co-ordinating efforts to raise the quality of the
housing stock, along with social and
environmental improvements. Options
include transferring ownership to the private
sector.
Private Housing
Local authorities in England have powers to
help home owners and tenants to improve the
worst quality housing and to assist with the
regeneration of communities. Local
authorities are expected to invest about £275
million in private housing renewal in 2000-01
providing repairs for some 75,000 households.
Local authorities also pay disabled facilities
grants (DFG) to disabled people so that they
can live more independently. Subsidy of £72
million, generating £120 million of local
authority investment, is expected to provide
adaptations for over 25,000 households.
In Scotland, local authorities have powers
to provide grants for the improvement and
repair of private sector housing. Scottish
Homes also has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
private house renewal. In Northern Ireland,
funding is allocated through the house
renovation grants scheme, administered by the
NIHE, on a similar basis to that in England
and Wales. In rural areas, financial assistance
to replace isolated dwellings that cannot be
restored is also on offer.
Home Improvement Agencies
Home improvement agencies (HIAs) provide
independent advice and help to assist elderly
people, people with disabilities and those on
low incomes to carry out repairs, improvements
and adaptations to their properties. They are
usually small-scale bodies operating on an
authority-wide basis. HIAs are managed by a
variety of organisations, often housing
associations but also local authorities and
independent bodies such as Age Concern.
Local authorities in England have been
allocated £6.7 million for 2000-01 to support
agencies operating in their areas. In Scotland a
Care and Repair service provides similar
assistance to that provided by HIAs. The
scheme is overseen by Scottish Homes.
Homelessness
Local authorities have legal duties to provide
housing assistance for families and vulnerable
people who are eligible for assistance,
unintentionally homeless and in priority need.
The priority need group includes households
with dependent children or containing a
pregnant woman; people who are vulnerable as
a result of old age, mental or physical illness or
350
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
disability or other special reason; and people
who are homeless in an emergency.
In 1999-2000, local authorities in England
made a total of 243,600 decisions on
applications for housing from households
eligible under the homelessness provisions of
the 1985 and 1986 Housing Acts. They
accepted around 105,500 households as
meeting the conditions of eligibility for
assistance. Over a quarter of all households
accepted as homeless in England were in their
situation because parents, other relatives or
friends were no longer able or willing to
accommodate them. A further quarter arose
following a relationship breakdown.
The Government’s target is to reduce rough
sleeping in England to as close to zero as
possible, and by at least two-thirds by 2002,
compared with the level of 1999. The Rough
Sleepers Unit has a budget of ^160 million for
London over three years, of which nearly
£88 million is administered by the Housing
Corporation for capital and revenue projects
for re-housing rough sleepers. Outside
London, where the local authorities are
responsible for developing local strategies, the
Unit has a programme of grants for the
voluntary sector of around £36 million. A
government strategy for homelessness in
England, Coming in from the Cold, was
published in December 1999. The strategy
proposed a new approach to helping vulnerable
rough sleepers off the streets, preventing new
rough sleepers and rebuilding the lives of
former rough sleepers. Between June 1998 and
June 2000, there was a reduction of more than
one-third in the numbers of rough sleepers.
Responsibility for rough sleeping initiatives
in Scotland and Wales has been devolved to
the Scottish Executive and National Assembly
for Wales respectively. The Homelessness
Task Force was established in 1999 to review
the causes and nature of homelessness in
Scotland, to examine current practice in
dealing with cases of homelessness, and to
make recommendations on how this can best
be prevented and, where it does occur, tackled
effectively. Funding is provided through the
Rough Sleepers Initiative which received an
additional £12 million funding in June 2000,
on top of £30 million already allocated to
projects to March 2002. In addition, a further
£6 million has been made available to reduce
the use of ‘bed and breakfast’ temporary
accommodation for the homeless. In Wales,
£1.85 million has been allocated in 2000-01 to
support voluntary organisations. The funding
will establish emergency night-shelters,
outreach support, bond schemes (a guarantee
fund held by the National Assembly for Wales
and managed by the Housing and Community
Renewal Division), tenancy support schemes
and direct access hotels.
REGENERATION
Regeneration policies aim to enhance
economic development and social cohesion
through effective regional action and
integrated local regeneration programmes.
These programmes work through partnership
between the public and private sectors and
involve a substantial contribution from the
latter. They support and complement other
programmes tackling social and economic
decline, and initiatives such as Sure Start (see
p. 121), Health Action Zones (see p. 190), the
Crime Reduction Programme (see p. 213) and
the work of the Cabinet Office Social
Exclusion Unit (see p. 113). Rundown areas in
the UK benefit from European Union
Structural Funds, notably the European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF) which
assists a wide variety of projects in the least
prosperous urban and rural areas of the
European Union. Around £10 billion of total
structural funds, with £3 billion covering
Objective 1 areas (see p. 396) have been
allocated to the UK for the period 2000—06.
England
In England, government departments and
public agencies work together to develop
national regeneration policies. The
government and the new Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs) set out the
priorities for regeneration and ensure that
programmes aim to enhance and complement
those already in place.
Eight RDAs in the English regions outside
London were established in 1999, and the
ninth in London was created in July 2000.
351
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Regeneration objectives are administered by
the DETR and the GORs and many
programmes are delivered by the RDAs (see
p. 394). In April 1999, the first eight RDAs
took over responsibility for administering
several regeneration programmes, including
the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) from
the GORs, the land and property budgets
from English Partnerships and the Rural
Development Commission’s rural
regeneration programme. The new Mayor for
London, supported by the London
Development Agency, assumed responsibility
for the SRB in London in July 2000. The
RDAs are also responsible for co-ordinating
inward investment in their own regions.
Following consultation, RDAs outside
London prepared their regional strategies
which provide a regional framework for
economic development and regeneration.
The Government Offices for the Regions
liaise with the RDAs on behalf of the
Government in providing advice as to
whether strategies are consistent with national
policies. They are also responsible for
administering regeneration programmes
including the New Deal for Communities and
Estate Action.
The SRB provides funding for regeneration
schemes, which are developed and
implemented by local partnerships, and it
supports a range of economic, physical and
social regeneration activities. It is seen by the
Government as an important instrument in its
policy of tackling social exclusion.
Regeneration partnerships, consisting of
key local organisations including the voluntary
sector, are able to bid for resources from the
SRB at annual bidding rounds. The successful
bids from the first five rounds of the SRB are
expected to involve expenditure of more than
£17.6 billion over their lifetime, including
more than £4.4 billion from the SRB, £6.5
billion from other public service support and
an estimated £6.7 billion of private sector
investment. The 163 successful fifth round
bid schemes, announced by the Government
in July 1999, have more than £1 billion to
spend over their lifetime of up to seven years
and are expected to create or safeguard
118,000 jobs. Sixteen of the 163 successful
bids are major new SRB schemes in the most
deprived areas. A target of the funding of 50
new major projects by March 2002 has been
set. It is projected that funding from the first
five rounds will see the creation or
safeguarding of 696,000 jobs, with 775,000
people trained and obtaining qualifications;
over 87,000 business start-ups; nearly 310,000
dwellings built or improved; and 136,000
voluntary groups supported. A sixth SRB
round was launched in December 1999 and
the announcement about the successful bids
was made in August 2000. This round has
focused 81 per cent of its resources on
England’s most deprived areas. The £931
million of SRB schemes outside London will
help to secure a further £1.2 billion from the
private sector and more than £2 billion from
other public sector programmes, including
European funds. London’s £300 million will
help to secure £700 million of private sector
funding and £430 million from other public
sector and European funds.
As part of the Government’s strategy to
tackle social exclusion, 17 partnerships were
set up at the end of 1998 under the New Deal
for Communities (NDC); a further 22 areas
were invited to bid for funding in November
1999 as part of the second round. The NDC
programme builds on the Social Exclusion
Unit’s report Bringing Britain Together: a
national strategy for neighbourhood renewal.
The NDC programme plans vary according to
local circumstances, but in the main focus on
unemployment, crime, educational under¬
achievement and poor health; for example,
several Partnerships plan to introduce
neighbourhood warden schemes, to provide a
community presence on the streets. Resources
of £800 million are available to support the
NDC over the three years 1999-2000 to
2001-2002.
In April 2000, the Government issued a
consultative document containing a draft
strategy to tackle some of the worst problems
experienced in neighbourhoods. This plan
suggests ways to tackle many of the issues
surrounding social deprivation, such as crime,
unemployment and lack of services.
Consultation on the document ended in June
2000 and a summary of the responses is
expected to be published by the end of the
year.
352
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Manchester Millennium is a task force of
public and private sector partners set up to
help the redevelopment of Manchester’s
city centre after the terrorist bomb
explosion in June 1996. The city centre
was officially reopened in November 1999
and further work will continue over the
next two years. The majority of funding
for the redevelopment comes from the
private sector (£438 million), with public
expenditure of around £83 million,
including £44 million from the DETR, 25
million ECU from the European Regional
Development Fund and a £20 million
Millennium Commission scheme.
Urban Renaissance
The Urban Task Force was formed in April
1998 to examine the causes of urban decline
and recommend ways of encouraging people
to return to urban neighbourhoods. The
report Towards an Urban Renaissance,
published in June 1999, included over 100
recommendations for improving towns and
cities. Following the Task Force’s
recommendation for setting up urban
regeneration companies (URCs), three pilot
URCs were launched in 1999 in Liverpool,
East Manchester and Sheffield. A preliminary
assessment of the potential impact on the
regeneration of each area has been carried out.
Another recommendation of the Task Force
was for the setting up of Home Zones, which
aim to improve the quality of life in residential
areas. Nine pilot Home Zones have been
established. The Government has also
published a revised Planning Policy Guidance
Note 3 (Housing), which addresses a number
of the Task Force’s recommendations on the
management of land supply.
The Government has announced plans to
publish a White Paper on urban policy
towards the end of 2000, which is intended to
address many of the Task Force’s
recommendations.
English Partnerships
By working together with central and local
government, the RDAs, local authorities and
other partners in public and private sectors,
English Partnerships seeks to create new jobs
and investment through sustainable economic
regeneration and development in the English
regions. EP has promoted, in partnership with
the public and private sectors, job creation,
inward investment, creation of workspace and
environmental improvement, through the
reclamation of vacant, derelict or
contaminated land in areas of need throughout
England. EP has provided support to the pilot
urban regeneration companies, launched the
Network Space programme (see p. 354) and
continues to develop and co-ordinate the
Millennium Communities Competition
Programme. EP has been funded through
grant-in-aid and through its own activities.
Direct expenditure in 2000-01 (including that
provisionally set aside for the London
Development Agency) is planned to be in
excess of £500 million. Following a European
Commission decision that the EP’s current
Partnership Investment Programme (PIP)
needs to be amended to comply with the
European Commission rules on state aid, the
Government announced in December 1999
that it would produce new proposals for how
projects aimed at regenerating deprived areas
could use Public-Private Partnerships. The
PIP, managed by EP and delivered by the
RDAs, supports non-commercially viable
regeneration projects where the cost of
development exceeds the likely final
value. Under the present arrangements,
payments made are the minimum necessary to
allow regeneration schemes to proceed.
During 1998-99, PIP provided over £200
million of support to projects, which over
their lifetime are expected to secure £567
million of private investment, regenerate 1,300
hectares of land, create or safeguard 29,000
jobs, help build 7,500 housing units and create
860,000 sq metres of industrial or commercial
floorspace.
Coalfields Regeneration
The Coalfields Regeneration Trust, an
independent grant—giving body, provides
support for coalfield communities, projects
which generate work and training
opportunities and support community
353
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
enterprise, provides welfare advice and
supports credit unions. It was set up as part of
the Government’s major long-term
programme of action for coalfield areas, in
response to the Coalfields Task Force Report.
An investment package for the areas worth
over £354 million over three years was
announced in 1998. The Trust is being
provided with more than £50 million for
regenerating communities in former mining
areas across England, Scotland and Wales.
The Network Space programme, a
public/private partnership venture between
English Partnerships and Langtree Group pic,
will provide new managed workspace for small
businesses across English coalfield areas. Over
45,000 sq metres of workspace will be
developed on up to 17 sites, providing more
than 1,000 jobs over three years.
The Coalfields Enterprise Fund, under
development by EP, will support small and
medium-sized firms with high growth
potential in the English coalfield areas. It aims
to secure funding of more than £50 million in
partnership with the private sector. The
Government will invest £15 million in the
fund over three years.
Groundwork
Groundwork consists of a national co¬
ordinating body, Groundwork UK, and over
40 independent trusts, operating throughout
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
organisation supports programmes covering
physical environmental improvements,
education and community involvement, and
integration of the economy with the
environment. In 1999—2000, £12.9 million of
private sector funding was attracted which
helped to support almost 4,000 projects
undertaken by nearly 3,000 private and
voluntary sector partners.
Rural Regeneration
Although most problems arising from
dereliction and unemployment occur in urban
areas, some rural areas have also been affected
as employment in traditional sectors, such as
mining and rurally based defence
establishments, has declined. Low wages and a
decline in local public transport and other
services have caused problems for some rural
residents. The movement of people into the
countryside has increased the demand for
housing and local services. However, some
rural areas have been successful in recent years
in attracting high-technology industries, while
the spread of modern telecommunications
facilities and information technology has made
it easier for people to work from home. The
Government will set out its objectives and
policies for rural areas in a White Paper to be
published later in 2000.
Since April 1999, the RDAs outside
London have been responsible for rural
regeneration. Funding of over £22 million is
allocated to the rural development programme
(RDP) for 2000-01. Previously, the Rural
Development Commission (RDC) had acted
both as the Government’s statutory adviser on
the economic and social development of
England’s rural areas and as lead provider of
regeneration projects. Rural challenge, one of
the former RDC programmes, has been
absorbed into the SRB (see p. 352). The
RDAs manage both rural and non-rural
aspects of the SRB and it is estimated that in
addition to the RDP funds, the fifth round of
SRB resulted in some 7 per cent of its funding
(some £70 million over seven years) being
allocated to either wholly rural schemes or the
rural parts of mixed area schemes.
Parts of the former RDC were merged with
the Countryside Commission to form the new
Countryside Agency in April 1999 (see
p. 314), which also inherited the RDC’s
advisory role. The Agency promotes and
advises on conserving and enhancing the
countryside, people’s access to the countryside
for recreation, and the economic and social
development of England’s rural areas. The
Agency set out its policies in Tomorrow's
Countryside—2020 Vision. It works with local
communities to promote social inclusion, by
helping to improve the mobility of, and
services available to, the less well-off sections
of the community and by tackling the
problems of a lack of job opportunities, low
wages and relative economic weakness in more
isolated areas.
354
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Wales
Parts of Wales have been adversely affected by
the decline in traditional industries, especially
the coal industry.
The Welsh European Funding Office was
set up in April 2000 as an executive agency of
the National Assembly for Wales to manage all
aspects of European Structural Fund
Programmes in Wales, the Rural Development
Plan and the Local Regeneration Fund. Wales
will receive up to £1.4 billion from the
European Union to fund a variety of
programmes until 2006. These include
Objective 1 (see p. 396) for the west of Wales
and the Valleys and Objectives 2 ‘Supporting
the economic and social conversion of areas
facing structural difficulties’ and 3 ‘Supporting
the adaptation and modernisation of policies
and systems of education, training and
employment’ in East Wales. This money will
be allocated in line with plans agreed with the
European Commission. The programmes will
be aimed at developing a stronger, more
sustainable economy (especially with an
expanded small and medium-sized company
sector), better infrastructure, a more highly
skilled workforce, and at securing the
regeneration of urban and rural communities.
The Assembly plans to regenerate rural
communities by encouraging new forms of
rural enterprise, including forestry, and
assisting farming families to diversify through
the Rural Development Plan. The Plan is
based on ten possible measures, including
agri-environment, support for Less Favoured
Areas, the wider adaptation and development
of rural communities, and processing and
marketing of agricultural products.
The new Local Regeneration Fund has
been established by merging the Welsh
Capital Challenge with the Local Authority
Rural Scheme, which will be phased out over
the next two years. The National Assembly for
Wales has allocated £36 million for 2000-01.
Wales is contributing £3.5 million over three
years to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust.
There are currently four Groundwork
Trusts operating in five local authorities in
Wales. The Trusts aim to promote
conservation, and improvement of the
environment, and have been involved in the
improvement of many derelict and run-down
areas. They work with local partnerships,
particularly local communities, in developing
and implementing local projects. Groundwork
Wales has been established as an umbrella
body to co-ordinate activities and promote the
Groundwork movement in Wales. The
National Assembly for Wales provides a
contribution to the funding of the Welsh
Groundwork Trusts and Groundwork Wales.
The Groundwork Trusts’ funding is provided
via the local authorities in which they are based
and operate.
The Rural Partnership for Wales is an
advisory body that contributes to the future
development of rural policies and programmes
in Wales. It comprises 27 organisations
including the National Assembly for Wales,
the Welsh Development Agency, the Welsh
Local Government Association, the farming
unions and others active in the field of rural
development. It covers economic, social,
environmental, equal opportunities and
cultural issues of concern to rural Wales. In
1999, the Partnership published its statement
Rural Wales.
There are four economic fora in Wales, for
north Wales, south-west Wales, south-east
Wales and mid-Wales. They aim to promote
economic growth and development by
developing close working relationships
between the primary economic agencies, and
between the private and public sectors. The
fora are completely independent of the
National Assembly.
The Welsh Development Agency
contributes to economic regeneration across
Wales. Its programmes include physical and
environmental regeneration activities, such as
land reclamation, urban, rural and
environmental improvements; activities to
provide site development works to assist with
business infrastructure; and financial support
for community initiatives such as the Market
Towns Initiative and the Small Towns and
Villages programmes.
Funding is also provided through the
People in Communities programme, which
was launched in June 1998 with a budget of
£750,000 as a response to tackling social
exclusion in deprived communities in Wales.
Eight deprived communities across Wales
were selected to take part in the Programme.
355
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
During 1999-2000, million was allocated
to enable the eight existing projects to expand
and develop their work. A second round,
involving a further eight projects, was
announced in June 2000.
Communities First is a new approach
designed to meet the needs and priorities
determined by communities. Consultation on
the programme has begun and it is expected
that communities will be identified by the
start of 2001, with implementation in
April 2001.
Scotland
The Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP)
programme was established in April 1999, and
now involves a network of 48 local partnerships
tackling the problems that disadvantaged
groups and communities face across rural and
urban Scotland. The SIPs are multi-agency
partnerships, consisting of all relevant local
public agencies, the voluntary and private
sectors, and representatives from the
community. The 48 SIPs are supported by
£150 million over the three years from 2000-01
from the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund.
The Coalfields Regeneration Trust will receive
funding of £4.5 million from the Scottish
Executive over the three years from 1999—2000.
Funding is also provided through the
Working for Communities and Listening to
Communities programmes. These
programmes are testing and developing new
models for delivering integrated local services
in deprived areas, and for developing the
capacity of excluded communities to influence
decisions about their lives.
Local Enterprise Companies (LECs, see
p. 149), working as part of the Highlands and
Islands Enterprise Network (in the north of
Scotland) and the Scottish Enterprise
Network (in the south), have a range of
powers and functions to engage in
regeneration and encourage business and
employment in their areas. A wide range of
regeneration projects are ongoing around
Scotland. For example, in Edinburgh, a
partnership between Scottish Enterprise
Edinburgh and Lothian and the City of
Edinburgh Council, Waterfront Edinburgh
Limited, has been established to co-ordinate
and promote the regeneration of Edinburgh’s
waterfront. It is expected that the 15-year
project, with public funding of over £33
million, will lead to private sector investment
of £500 million providing 5,000 new homes,
new business and retail developments, two
new schools, a university college campus and a
new marina. It is anticipated that the project
will support between 4,000 and 7,000 new
jobs.
In Lanarkshire, the site of the former
Ravenscraig steelworks, which closed in 1992,
and the adjacent site of another former
steelworks form the largest single derelict site
in the UK, and one of the biggest brownfield
sites in Europe. Since its closure, the Corns
Group (formerly British Steel) has spent over
£20 million clearing and de-contaminating the
site. In January 2000, work began on the first
stage of a regeneration plan for Ravenscraig
which has been prepared by Scottish
Enterprise Lanarkshire, North Lanarkshire
Council and the Corns Group working
together as the Ravenscraig Regeneration
partnership. The initial stage has funding of
over £12 million and will include the
construction of a 2.5-kilometre road with
public footways and a cycleway.
Northern Ireland
The Department for Social Development
(DSD) has been created as part of the new
departmental arrangements for the devolved
administration (see p. 18). It amalgamates
some of the agencies and functions previously
associated with the Department of Health and
Social Services and the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland. The aim
of the Department is to promote individual
and community wellbeing of the people of
Northern Ireland through integrated social
and economic action.
The Urban Generation and Community
Development Group is responsible for the
establishment of policy and strategy,
implementation of programmes targeting
resources to areas of social need, addressing
the social, economic and physical regeneration
of cities, towns and villages in Northern
Ireland and promoting partnership between
the Government and the voluntary and
356
21: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
community sector. Over .£40 million has been
allocated for expenditure on urban
regeneration and community development,
including grants to voluntary bodies, certain
grants-in-aid and on other services for the
year ending 31 March 2001.
The Northern Ireland Partnership board
was established in 1996 as one of the
intermediary funding mechanisms for the
delivery of the European Union Special
Support Programme of Peace and
Reconciliation in Northern Ireland. The
overall aim of the programme is to help build a
stable society, develop the economy and
encourage cross-community and community
relation based activities. There are 26
partnerships, one for each district council
area, which are composed of one-third elected
representatives, one-third from the
community and voluntary sector, and one-
third from the business, trade union and
statutory agency sector. By January 2000,
around £35 million had been spent by district
partnerships.
The Belfast Regeneration Office is
responsible for the functions previously carried
out by Belfast Development Office and Making
Belfast Work. Making Belfast Work was
launched in 1988 to advance efforts being made
by community interests, the private sector and
the Government to address problems faced by
the most disadvantaged areas of Belfast. The
Londonderry Development Office, which is
also part of the DSD’s Urban Generation and
Community Development Group aims to play
a leading role in promoting comprehensive
social, economic and physical regeneration and
the redress of disadvantage in Londonderry. A
new programme by Business in the
Community to help develop the role of the
private sector in regeneration partnerships in
Belfast and Londonderry was launched in
September 1999.
Regeneration of the centre of Lisburn
announced in June 2000 will involve
investment of more than £60 million on
projects such as the Historic Quarter, Lisburn
Square and the new Civic Centre.

Following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly
for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly, responsibility for a range of
transport functions has been transferred from the UK Government to the
devolved administrations. In July 2000 the UK Government announced a ten-
year investment plan, involving public and private expenditure of £180 billion,
for modernising the nation’s transport system. This primarily relates to
investment in England, although it also covers investment in the railways in
Scotland and Wales. The plan sets out the Government’s intention to provide
greater investment in railways and light rail systems, more by-passes and road
widening schemes, and measures to encourage greater use of buses.
Telecommunications services are expanding rapidly, and now more than half
the population—over 33 million people—have a mobile telephone, while use of
the Internet is also rising quickly and nearly half of adults have accessed it at
some time.

TRAVEL TRENDS
Passenger travel was 728 billion passenger-
kilometres in Great Britain in 1999 (see Table
22.1). Travel by car, van and taxi has more
than doubled in the past 30 years, but recently
the rate of growth has slowed, and car traffic
grew by just 1.7 per cent in 1999. On the other
hand, motorcycling was 16 per cent higher in
1999 than in 1998. Cycling also rose in 1999,
being 6 per cent higher than in 1998, reversing
the previous decline, which had averaged 4
per cent a year between 1995 and 1998. d ravel
by bus has shown a steady decline since the
1950s. Rail travel rose by around 6 per cent in
1999-2000, and is at its highest level since
1946, while travel on the various light
rail/supertram systems is also growing. Air
travel, particularly international traffic, is
continuing to grow substantially.
Travel by car accounted for 85 per cent of
passenger mileage within Great Britain in
1999. Over the last ten years, the proportion of
households with regular use of one car has
remained relatively constant, at 45 per cent
(see chart on p. 118), but there has been an

increase in households with two cars (from 18
per cent in 1989 to 22 per cent in 1999), while
in 1999, 5 per cent of households had regular
use of three or more cars. Most freight is
carried by road, which accounts for 81 per
cent of goods by tonnage and 65 per cent in
terms of tonne-kilometres.1
At the end of 1999 there were 28.4 million
vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great
Britain, according to the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency, which maintains official
records of drivers and vehicles in Great Britain.
There were 24.0 million cars (of which 2.4
million were company-owned); 2.4 million vans
and light goods vehicles; 415,000 goods vehicles
over 3.5 tonnes; 760,000 motorcycles, scooters
and mopeds; and 84,000 public transport
vehicles with nine or more seats.
TRANSPORT POLICY
In 1998 the Government issued a White
Paper, A New Deal for Transport: Better for
Everyone, setting out its policy for creating an
integrated transport system to tackle the
growing problems of congestion and pollution
1 A tonne-kilometre is equivalent to 1 tonne transported for
1 kilometre.
by improving all types of transport. The
White Paper’s approach covered the whole of
the UK, but complementary White Papers/
policy documents have been issued for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and a
selection of the main points and recent
developments is given below. Transport safety
is a high priority, and measures have been
taken to improve safety in several sectors,
including road safety (see p. 363) and railway
safety (see p. 369). The Commission for
Integrated Transport was set up to provide
independent advice to the UK Government
on implementing an integrated transport
policy, review progress towards meeting
government objectives, and identify best
practice on transport issues from the UK and
overseas. Public-Private Partnerships (see
p. 405) will have an increasingly important
role in transport, notably for the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link, the London Underground
and air traffic control.
The Transport Bill, now before Parliament,
contains provisions to implement some of
these measures, including:
• establishing the Strategic Rail Authority
(see p. 367);
• requiring local authorities to prepare
five-year plans to improve their local
transport;
359
the: environment and transport
• enabling local authorities to introduce
road charges or a levy on workplace
parking, to tackle congestion and
pollution;
• giving local authorities new powers to
improve local bus services, and requiring
them to offer concessionary fares for
pensioners; and
• providing for a new Public-Private
Partnership for air traffic services (see
p. 375).
The powers allocated to local authorities
under the Bill would cover only those
authorities in England and Wales. Local
transport plans have already been drawn up on
a provisional basis by local authorities in
England and Wales; in Scotland there are local
transport strategies. In England full local
transport plans were submitted in July 2000
for consideration by the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR). In London a second round of
interim transport plans has been submitted to
Transport for London (set up by the Greater
London Authority—see p. 63), which took up
its new powers in July 2000. The new Mayor
of London and the London Assembly are
responsible for delivering integrated transport
in London, and the Mayor has responsibility
for producing a transport strategy covering all
modes of transport to, from and within
London. In Wales full local transport plans
were submitted to the National Assembly in
August 2000.
Wales
The integrated approach to transport policy in
Wales, now being taken forward by the
National Assembly for Wales, envisages
improved public transport in both urban and
rural areas—grants of £5 million are available
in 2000-01 to support non-commercial bus
services and £250,000 is available for
community transport schemes in rural areas.
Both schemes are under review to see how
they can be refined so that services more
closely match community needs, and a revised
approach will take effect from 2001—02. To
reduce congestion, the Assembly is
encouraging employers to develop travel
Ten-year Plan
In July 2000 the Government issued its ten-
year transport investment plan.2 It envisages
investment in transport of some £180
billion: £60 billion for railways in Great
Britain, £59 billion for local transport in
England, £25 billion for transport in
London, £21 billion for strategic roads in
England and £15 billion on future projects
and other sectors. The total includes capital
investment of £121 billion, which the
Government intends should be delivered
through a partnership between the private
and public sectors. The investment is
intended to:
• provide 100 new by-passes, enable
580 kilometres (360 miles) of the
motorway and trunk road network to
be widened, and eliminate a backlog
of road maintenance and reduce road
congestion;
• modernise and upgrade the railway
network;
• improve services on the London
Underground and London buses;
• provide up to 25 new tram lines in
major cities and conurbations;
• improve rural transport; and
• make the transport system safer and
more secure.
plans, and the adoption of traffic management
measures. Funding is also provided to
schemes which reduce use of the car for
journeys to school. The Assembly is
considering a report issued in June 2000 on
improving transport links between north and
south Wales. The report’s recommendations
include improvements to the strategic trunk
road network, new direct rail services, better
car parking facilities at railway stations, better
connections between trains and local buses,
and further investigation of a north-south
coach service.
2 Transport 2010: The 10 Year Plan focuses on surface
transport, and improvements in surface access to ports and
airports. It mainly covers England, although for the railways
the plan covers the network in Great Britain.

The National Cycle Network
THE NATIONAL CYCLE NETWORK
The National Cycle Network is a UK-wide project supported by £43.5 million
of National Lottery funding from the Millennium Commission and co-ordinated
by the civil engineering charity Sustrans. Some 400 local authorities and other partners have
been involved in developing the network which, by 2005, will comprise
10,000 miles (16,000 km) of cycle route. The first 5,000 miles (8,000 km)
were officially opened for use in June 2000. The network is made up of approximately
I per cent lightly trafficked or calmed minor roads and 40 per cent traffic-free routes which are
often also suitable for pedestrians, wheelchair users and horse riders.
TRAMS AND LIGHT RAILWAYS
Blackpool: The first electric trams in Great Britain ran in Blackpool in 1885.
The 18 km Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway has remained in continuous operation
since the line to Fleetwood opened in 1898. Up to 65 trams operate
during Blackpool’s summer season and the service runs throughout the year.
Tram 660, ‘Coronation Car’,
built for the Queen’s Coronation by Roberts
of Wakefield. Entered service in 1952.
Tram 626, single decker
in service since 1937.
Tram 606, ‘open boat’ design, entered service in 1939
and left Blackpool Transport in 2000 to be displayed
in a Transport Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.
Trams 700 and 711, double deckers in service since 1934.
Manchester: Officially opened in 1992,
Manchester’s Metrolink became Britain’s
first modern street operating light rail
system. By early 1998 the expanded route
network, linking the city centre with
Altrincham and Bury, was carrying
around 14 million passengers a year.
It is estimated that Metrolink has saved
about 2 million car journeys a year,
reducing vehicle emissions by around
3,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 487 tonnes
of carbon monoxide and 15 tonnes of
nitrous oxide.
Birmingham: The Metro in
Birmingham, opened in 1999,
follows the route of the former
Great Western Railway line
connecting five towns between
Wolverhampton and Snow Hill.
In its first year of operation the
Metro has carried over 5 million
passengers.
Croydon: Work on Croydon’s
Tramlink system was completed
in spring 2000, bringing trams
back to the town for the first time
since 1951. The network has 38 stops
and currently operates 24 trams,
21 of which are in service during
the peak period. Each tram can
carry over 200 passengers and has
a maximum speed of 80 km per hour.
22: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Scotland
The Transport (Scotland) Bill, now being
considered by the Scottish Parliament, would
provide local authorities with additional
powers to enable them to obtain an integrated
transport system at the local level. The Bill
would allow:
• Scottish ministers to require designated
public bodies to prepare a joint plan for
particular transport issues;
• the establishment of statutory bus
‘quality partnerships’ and ‘quality
contracts’ between local authorities and
bus operators;
• local authorities to introduce statutory
ticketing schemes and set minimum
standards of information for bus
passengers;
• Scottish ministers to establish a national
minimum level of concessionary fares for
pensioners and people with disabilities;
and
• local authorities to introduce local road
user charging and workplace parking
schemes to tackle congestion in cities,
with all the revenue to be set aside for
transport.
Expenditure on transport of £283 million is
planned in 2000-01, rising to £311 million in
2001—02. Following a review of strategic
roads, the Scottish Executive announced that
over the next three years construction work
would start on five major trunk road schemes,
with an estimated capital cost of £140 million.
These schemes are part of a two-year package
costing £444 million of improvements and
repairs to the motorway and trunk road
network.
Rail services in Scotland receive an annual
subsidy of over £200 million. The Public
Transport Fund is providing £90 million over
the three years to 2001-02 to assist local
authorities in improving the provision of
public transport across Scotland. Projects
supported have included new railway stations,
‘park and ride’ facilities, and bus priority
schemes.
The Scottish Executive is also providing
£14.6 million over the three years to 2000-01
through the Rural Transport Fund to help
improve transport in rural Scotland. The fund
has supported over 350 new and improved
public transport services, 71 community
transport projects and 18 refurbished petrol
stations. Support is also being given to
essential services to the Scottish Islands,
including a £3 million contribution towards
the cost of replacing airport terminals at
Kirkwall (Orkney) and Stornoway and
installing an instrument landing system at
Kirkwall.
Northern Ireland
The transport policy statement for Northern
Ireland Moving Forward, published in
November 1998, acknowledged that much
needed to be done to deliver a sustainable and
inclusive transport system for Northern
Ireland. The statement contained an interim
regional transport plan, designed to continue a
programme of measures arising from a
previous statement. The Department for
Regional Development has now begun
preparing a regional transport strategy to
facilitate the future development of local
transport plans and consider how they can be
adequately resourced. Until this strategy
comes into effect, the Department’s policy is
to follow the principles of Moving Forward
through the implementation of the interim
regional transport plan.
A task force, established to look at a range
of strategic options for the future of the
railway network, reported to the Minister for
Regional Development in September 2000.
ROADS
The total road network in Great Britain in
1999 was 371,900 kilometres (231,100 miles).
Trunk motorways3 accounted for 3,316
kilometres (2,060 miles) of this, less than 1 per
cent, and other trunk roads for over 12,150
kilometres (7,550 miles), or 3.3 per cent.
However, motorways carry 18 per cent of all
traffic, and trunk roads another 17 per cent.
3 That is, those motorways that are the direct responsibility
of the central administration rather than the local authority.

Combined, they carry over half of all goods
vehicle traffic in Great Britain. In Northern
Ireland the road network is over 24,000
kilometres (15,000 miles), of which motorways
represent 114 kilometres (71 miles).
Motor traffic in Great Britain was 1.7 per
cent higher in 1999 than in 1998, rising to an
estimated 467 billion vehicle-kilometres (see
Table 22.2). Traffic on motorways was up by
3 per cent, to 83.6 billion vehicle-kilometres.
Road Programme
The Highways Agency—an executive agency of
the DETR—is responsible for maintaining,
operating and improving the national road
network in England, except for London where
responsibility has been transferred to the
Greater London Authority. In Wales the
motorway and trunk road network is the
responsibility of the National Assembly. In
Scotland responsibility rests with the Scottish
Executive. In Northern Ireland responsibility
rests with the NI Assembly. The Roads Service,
an agency within the Department for Regional
Development, maintains and improves the road
network on behalf of the Assembly.
The Highways Agency is responsible for
about 70 per cent of the motorway and trunk
road network in England, with the other 30
per cent being the responsibility of local
authorities. Its budget is £1.5 billion in
2001-02 when it expects to spend £672
million on motorway and trunk road
maintenance, £494 million on major network
improvements and £208 million for making
better use of the network. In addition, local
authorities have a budget of nearly £2.2 billion
for maintaining local roads.
The ten-year plan envisages public
investment of £21.3 billion in the Highways
Agency’s strategic road network, together with
£2.5 billion of private capital investment.
Investment will help to tackle the main
congestion pressures. Extra capacity will be
provided through 30 trunk road by-passes, 80
major schemes to tackle bottlenecks at
junctions, and the widening of some 5 per cent
of the strategic road network and associated
junction improvements. For example, one
major scheme is planned to widen to 12 lanes
the sections of the M2 5 near Heathrow Airport,
the most heavily used sections of the UK
motorway network. Some £130 million a year
will be spent on smaller-scale improvements,
while new technology will be extended to
provide better network management to reduce
traffic delays (see p. 364).

Private sector finance is playing a role
through ‘Design, Build, Finance and Operate’
(DBFO) contracts, under which the private
sector provides the funding for construction
and maintenance, and receives government
payments linked to usage and performance.
About 25 per cent of current and new major
schemes are expected to be built using DBFO
contracts. Work on the privately financed A55
across Anglesey is due for completion early in
2001 and work on the Birmingham northern
relief road is due to start in late 2000.

• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver),
motorcycles and goods vehicles not over
3.5 tonnes maximum authorised mass
(MAM);
• 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,
but not over 7.5, tonnes MAM; and
• 21 for passenger-carrying vehicles with
more than nine seats and goods vehicles
over 7.5 tonnes MAM.
New drivers of motor vehicles must pass
both the computer-based touch screen theory
test and the practical driving test in order to
acquire a full driving licence. In 1999, 1.2
million driving tests were conducted in Great
Britain by the Driving Standards Agency
(DSA), the national driver testing authority.
The average pass rate was nearly 44 per cent.
About 32.7 million people hold a car full
driving licence. The DSA also supervises
professional driving instructors, the
compulsory basic training scheme for learner
motorcyclists and a voluntary register for
instructors of drivers of large goods vehicles.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles are
allowed on the roads, they must meet safety and
environmental requirements, based primarily on
standards drawn up by the European Union
(EU). The Vehicle Certification Agency is
responsible for ensuring these requirements are
met through a process known as ‘type
approval’.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles,
through their annual testing. It also uses
roadside and other enforcement checks to
ensure that drivers and vehicle operators
comply with legislation. In Northern Ireland
the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency is
responsible for testing drivers and vehicles.
Road Safety
Since 1981-85 there has been a significant
decline in road deaths and serious casualties in
Great Britain, by 39 per cent and 48 per cent
respectively, while road traffic has risen by
59 per cent. In 1999 there were 235,000 road
accidents involving personal injury in Great
Britain, 2 per cent fewer than in 1998, of
which 36,400 involved death or serious injury.
There were 3,423 deaths in road accidents,
39,100 serious injuries and nearly 277,800
slight injuries.
In March 2000 the Government launched
Tomorrow's Roads: Safer for Everyone, its new
road safety strategy. It has set a target of
reducing the number of people killed or
seriously injured on the roads of Great Britain
by 40 per cent by 2010, compared with the
average levels for 1994—98. A higher target
reduction, of 50 per cent, has been set for
deaths and serious injuries to children.
Measures include:
• creating more 20 mph (32 km/h) zones
around schools and in residential areas;
• enforcing road traffic law more effectively,
with greater use of speed cameras;
• improving driver training;
• consulting on the mandatory fitting of
seat belts in new coaches and minibuses;
• setting appropriate speed limits for local
conditions;
• supporting the development of safer car
design; and
• improving road safety education.
In June 2000 the Government announced a
new approach to its road safety campaign, on
which it spends about £9 million a year. The
363
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
campaign aims to create greater public
awareness of all road safety issues and
encourage everyone to use the roads safely.
Local authorities in England and Wales are
now required to plan specific road safety
measures as part of their local transport
plans, while local authorities in Scotland
are expected to set out in their local
transport strategies their plans for
reducing road casualties. The DETR has
funded a £5 million project in Gloucester
to test a strategic approach to road safety
in an average-sized local authority. Work
began in 1996 and is due to be completed
in 2001. The objective is to cut casualties
in the city by a third; initial results in
certain areas affected by the scheme show
an average fall of 60 per cent.
Congestion
About 7 per cent of the Highways Agency’s
network experiences regular heavy peak and
occasional non-peak congestion, and a further
13 per cent sees heavy congestion on at least
half the days in the year. Traffic congestion
also occurs in many towns and cities in the
main morning and evening peak periods and
for much of the day in central London.
Traffic management schemes aim to reduce
congestion through measures such as traffic-
free shopping precincts, bus lanes and other
bus priority measures, and parking controls.
In London a 512-km (318-mile) network of
priority ‘red routes’, with special stopping
controls, is designed to improve traffic flow.
Under the Greater London Authority Act
1999 and the Transport Bill, local authorities
in London and the rest of England and Wales
respectively would be able to introduce
congestion charging schemes for road users
and a levy on workplace parking, as part of
their local transport plan, and to retain the net
revenue generated from charges for at least ten
years, provided that these are used to fund
local transport improvements. The Transport
(Scotland) Bill provides for similar powers in
Scotland, but would not involve any time limit
on the retention of revenue. Local authorities
would need to consult local people and
businesses and to make improvements to
public transport before starting such schemes.
Leeds and Edinburgh will host the first full-
scale demonstrations of electronic road user
charging equipment in the UK, starting
around the end of 2001.
The Government is encouraging major
employers to adopt travel plans to reduce car
use for travel to work and on business, for
example, by promoting alternatives such as car
sharing, cycling and use of public transport.
Traffic Information
Traffic information is provided throughout
Great Britain by a variety of means, such as
the media, roadside signs and in-vehicle
systems. Information originates from a range
of sources, such as roadside sensors, the traffic
police and highway authorities. It is collated
by motoring organisations, such as the
Automobile Association (AA) and the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC), and by information
service providers, such as Integrated Traffic
Information Services (ITIS), Metro Networks
and Trafficmaster. Local traffic control
centres across Great Britain help to manage
traffic and provide information about traffic
conditions. Centres covering wider areas exist
in Scotland and Wales. A new national traffic
control centre planned for England is due to
enter service in 2001 and to be fully
operational by 2003. In the next ten years the
Highways Agency intends to introduce new
roadside monitoring and communications
equipment to improve traffic management on
the strategic road network in England to
ensure more reliable journey times and
improve safety.
Cycling
The National Cycling Strategy, launched in
1996, aims to increase the number of cycling
journeys fourfold by 2012. The National
Cycling Forum is co-ordinating the
implementation of the strategy which has been
endorsed by the Government. The DET R
announced its own target of trebling the
number of cycling journeys by 2010, as part of
its ten-year transport investment plan. Local
364
22: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
authorities are expected to develop local
cycling strategies and incorporate them in
their local transport plans and strategies. The
cycling strategies will set out measures to give
greater priority to cycling, such as establishing
safe and convenient cycle routes.
The first 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometres) of
the National Cycle Network (see map
opposite p. 360), which is being developed
by the transport charity Sustrans, were
officially opened in June 2000. When
completed in 2005, the network will cover
10,000 miles (16,000 kilometres). Funds of
up to £43 million from the Millennium
Commission are contributing towards the
cost. Nearly two-thirds of the network will
follow existing roads, with traffic calming
and cycle lanes being implemented where
necessary. Over a third of the network will
be entirely free from motor traffic by
utilising old railway lines, canal towpaths,
river paths and derelict land. Information
on the network is on the Sustrans website
(www.nationalcyclenetwork.org.uk).
Walking
People in the UK are walking significantly less
than in the past, with fewer journeys on foot
and many more by car. The Government
wishes to reverse this trend, and is expecting
local authorities to give more priority to
walking by providing, for example, wider
pavements, pedestrianisation schemes and
more pedestrian crossings.
The DETR is monitoring the effectiveness
of nine pilot schemes for ‘home zones’, and a
similar study monitoring four sites in Scotland
is about to start. Home zones aim to improve
the quality of life in residential areas by
making them places primarily for people and
not just for traffic.
Road Haulage
An operator’s licence is required for operating
goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross weight in
the UK. About 88 per cent of the 111,000
licences in issue are for fleets of five or fewer
vehicles, and there are around 424,000 heavy
goods vehicles. Road haulage traffic by heavy
goods vehicles amounted to 149 billion tonne-
kilometres in Great Britain in 1999, 14 per
cent more than in 1990. Road hauliers are
tending to use larger vehicles carrying heavier
loads—85 per cent of the traffic, in terms of
tonne-kilometres, is now carried by vehicles of
over 25 tonnes gross weight.
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1999 about 2.2 million road goods
vehicles travelled by ferry or the Channel
Tunnel to mainland Europe, of which 563,000
were powered vehicles registered in the UK. In
1999 UK vehicles carried 15.9 million tonnes
internationally, and about 96 per cent of this
traffic was with the EU.
In 1999 the Government issued a long-term
strategy for freight in the UK, with the aim of
promoting a competitive and efficient
distribution sector to support future economic
growth while minimising the effects on society
and the environment. The strategy seeks to
reduce the extent to which economic growth
generates additional lorry movements, by
improving efficiency, making the most of rail,
shipping and inland waterways, and
improving interchange links between the
different types of transport. Following a
report by the Commission for Integrated
Transport in March 2000, the maximum
weight for lorries on domestic journeys with
six or more axles will be raised from 41 to
44 tonnes in February 2001.
Bus Services
In 1998—99 some 4,248 million passenger
journeys were made on local bus services in
Great Britain, nearly 19 per cent fewer than
in 1988—89. Usage has been declining in
nearly all areas, although in London (which
accounts for nearly a third of bus journeys in
Great Britain) passenger journeys in 1998-99
were higher than ten years earlier. There are
around 80,000 buses and coaches in Great
Britain, of which 32 per cent are minibuses or
the slightly larger midibuses (which are
becoming more widespread) and 22 per cent
double-deckers.
Most local bus services are provided
commercially, with 83 per cent of bus mileage
365
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
outside London operated on this basis. Local
authorities may subsidise services which are
not commercially viable but are considered
socially necessary.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by private sector concerns, apart
from 17 bus companies owned by local
authorities. In July 2000 Transport for
London (see p. 63) succeeded London
Transport as the authority responsible for
providing or procuring public transport in
London. It oversees about 750 bus routes run
by about 30 companies under contract.
Five main groups operate bus services:
Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group,
National Express and Stagecoach. Most of
these groups have diversified into running
other transport services, such as rail services
and airports, while some have also expanded
into transport services in other countries,
notably the United States.
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are operated by subsidiaries
of the publicly owned Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company (NITHC),
collectively known as ‘Translink’. Citybus Ltd
operates services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd
runs most of the services in the rest of
Northern Ireland, carrying respectively
21 million and 48 million passengers a year.
Services
The Transport Bill and the Transport
(Scotland) Bill would introduce, subject to
parliamentary approval, a new statutory
framework which aims to improve bus services
other than in London. Local authorities in
England and Wales would be required to
develop bus services as part of their local
transport plans. In Scotland there would be no
such statutory requirement, but the Scottish
Executive would expect local authorities to set
out their views on bus services in their local
transport strategies. The Bills would also
provide statutory backing for ‘bus quality
partnerships’ and ‘quality contracts’, between
local authorities and bus operators. Similar
partnerships have been developed voluntarily
in around 130 towns and cities, and have led to
better services with higher-quality buses, and
increased passenger use of typically 10 per
cent to 20 per cent. At the first National Bus
Summit in November 1999 the industry
agreed new targets on reliability and quality,
including a target of reducing the average age
of buses to eight years by 2001.
Extra funding for rural bus services has led
to 1,800 new or improved services in England.
In addition, a ‘rural bus challenge’ has been
held in England to stimulate the development
of innovative services in rural areas, and over
100 schemes have been introduced. A similar
challenge fund is now being developed to
support improved public transport links to
deprived urban estates.
The Bills include measures to improve bus
ticketing and information. Later in 2000
‘Traveline’, a telephone service providing
integrated timetable information on all public
transport modes from a single national
number, will be launched. This will be
followed by the development, involving
transport operators, local and central
government, of a more extensive system,
known as ‘Transport Direct’, and by 2003 this
is expected to be available on the Internet.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes,
are becoming more extensive, while in some
areas innovative measures, such as guided
busways (with buses travelling on segregated
track), are being adopted, and there is growing
interest in expanding tram or light rail services
(see p. 370). Around 70 park and ride
schemes, in which car users park on the
outskirts of towns and travel by public
transport to the central area, are in operation
in England and are being increasingly used to
relieve traffic congestion in busy urban
centres; up to 100 new schemes are envisaged
over the next ten years.
Coaches
Coaches account for much of the non-local
mileage operated by public service vehicles—
this rose by about 6 per cent in 1998-99 to
1,657 million vehicle-kilometres. Organised
coach tours and holiday journeys account for
about 60 per cent of coach travel in Great
366
22: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Britain. High-frequency scheduled services,
run by private sector operators, link many
towns and cities, and commuter services run
into London and some other major centres
each weekday. The biggest coach operator,
National Express, has a national network of
scheduled coach services and in 1999 carried
19 million passengers.
Taxis
There are about 63,000 licensed taxis in
England and Wales, mainly in urban areas,
around 9,000 in Scotland, and about 11,000 in
Northern Ireland. In London (which has over
19,000 taxis) and several other major cities,
taxis must be purpose-built to conform to
strict requirements. In many districts, taxi
drivers have to pass a test of their knowledge
of the area.
Private hire vehicles with drivers
(‘minicabs’) may be booked only through the
operator and not hired on the street. Outside
London, private hire vehicles are licensed;
there are about 66,000 in England and Wales
outside the capital and 8,000 in Scotland.
Implementation of the Private Hire Vehicles
(London) Act 1998, which for the first time
provides the basis for regulating minicab
operators, drivers and vehicles in London, is
in progress.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway in
the world to be worked by steam power.
Privatisation of railway services in Great
Britain was completed in 1997.
Railtrack is responsible for operating all
track and infrastructure in Great Britain. Its
assets include 32,000 kilometres (20,000 miles)
of track; 40,000 bridges, tunnels and viaducts;
2,500 stations; and connections to over 1,000
freight terminals. Apart from 14 major
stations operated directly by Railtrack, nearly
all stations and passenger depots are leased to
the 25 passenger train operating companies
which run passenger services under franchise.
Operators with two or more franchises include
National Express, Prism Rail (which is being
taken over by National Express), Virgin Rail,
FirstGroup, Connex, Arriva and Stagecoach.
The operators lease their rolling stock from
the three main rolling stock companies: Angel
Trains, HSBC Rail and Porterbrook Leasing.
Four companies run freight services. There
are a number of infrastructure maintenance
companies.
There are also over 100 other passenger¬
carrying railways, often connected with the
preservation of steam locomotives. Services
are operated mostly on a voluntary basis and
cater mainly for tourists and railway
enthusiasts. They generally run on former
branch lines, but there are also several narrow-
gauge lines, mainly in north Wales.
Rail Regulation
Under the Transport Bill, a new Strategic Rail
Authority (SRA) would be established to
promote rail use, plan the strategic
development of the rail network, work closely
with transport providers and promote
integration between different types of
transport. The SRA would subsume OPRAF
(the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising) and
the British Railways Board, which are
currently operating as the Shadow Strategic
Rail Authority (SSRA). It would also acquire
the consumer protection functions of the
Office of the Rail Regulator, including
responsibility for sponsoring the rail users’
consultative committees that represent the
interests of passengers. The Rail Regulator’s
other current functions include licensing the
railway operators, dealing with agreements
governing access by operators to track and
stations, and enforcing competition law in
connection with the provision of rail services.
The SSRA is currently responsible for
negotiating, awarding and monitoring the
franchises for operating rail services. Financial
support for passenger rail services amounted
to approximately £1 billion in 1999-2000.
Most franchises are for around seven years,
but some are for ten, 12 or 15 years. In June
2000 the SSRA announced changes to the
franchise map for Great Britain, in connection
with the development of a 20-year strategy for
the railways. Three main service groupings

London commuter services, and regional
services) are being created, which will
eventually result in a reduction in the number
of franchises to 22. The SSRA’s objective is to
establish stronger train operating companies
with longer franchises and the ability to invest
to provide extra capacity to meet the growing
demand for travel by rail. Renegotiation of the
shorter-term franchises, due to expire by
2004, is expected to be completed by the end
of 2001.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local and regional services; and
commuter services in and around the large
conurbations, especially London and the
South East. Passenger traffic is growing (see
Table 22.3) and on the national railways rose
by 5.5 per cent in 1999—2000 to 38,300 million
passenger kilometres, the highest level for
over 50 years, representing some 947 million
passenger journeys.
Investment
The Government’s ten-year plan envisages
substantially increased rail investment to
provide a large expansion of rail services to
meet the growing demand and improve the
quality of service to passengers. Over £34
billion of capital investment is envisaged from
the private sector and nearly £15 billion from
the public sector, of which £7 billion will be
provided through the Rail Modernisation
Fund. The Fund will allow the SR A and the
railway industry to formulate a long-term
investment programme and is designed to
encourage a much greater level of private
sector capital investment. Investment will go
towards new rolling stock, modern signalling,
safety improvements and the provision of
greater capacity by removing bottlenecks.
Major projects include modernising the West
Coast and East Coast main lines, the
Thameslink 2000 project to increase the
capacity of north-south services through
London, and improved rail links to airports
(such as Heathrow and Stansted).
Freight
Rail freight traffic totalled 18.4 billion tonne-
kilometres, representing the carriage of 102.8
million tonnes, in 1999-2000. Over 80 per
cent of traffic by volume is bulk commodities,
mainly coal, coke, iron and steel, building
materials and petroleum. The two largest
operators are English, Welsh & Scottish
Railway (EWS), which also runs trains
through the Channel Tunnel to the continent
of Europe; and Freightliner, which operates
container services between major ports and
inland terminals.
The UK Government and the devolved
administrations are keen to encourage more
freight to be moved by rail, to relieve pressure
on the road network and to bring
environmental benefits. Grants are available to

22: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Safety
In October 1999 two trains collided at
Ladbroke Grove, near London’s
Paddington station, resulting in 31 deaths
and 227 injuries. A public inquiry into the
accident is now in progress. The industry
is implementing a number of safety
measures in the light of two rail safety
summits convened by the Government,
the report of the public inquiry into an
earlier fatal rail accident at Southall in
1997, and regulations already being
implemented by the Government. Action
includes:
• the fitting of the train protection and
warning system (TPWS), which is
designed to reduce the risk associated
with signals passed at danger, to the
Railtrack network by the end of 2003;
• the introduction of automatic train
protection (ATP) as lines that are
included in the European high-speed
network are upgraded;
• the removal of all Mark 1 rolling
stock (which does not meet the crash
resistance standards of modern rolling
stock) by the end of 2002, with some
modified stock allowed to remain in
service until the end of 2004, by
which time all trains with slam doors
but without central locking doors will
also have been phased out;
• more consistent and better standards
for driver training;
• development of a new national safety
plan to improve safety management
and ensure best practice across the
rail network; and
• the transfer from Railtrack to the
Health and Safety Executive of
responsibility for deciding whether
train companies are safe to operate.
encourage companies to move goods by rail or
water rather than by road. In 1999-2000, 14
grants were awarded in England and Wales
(representing support of nearly £12.5 million).
Since July 1999 in Scotland the Scottish
Executive has awarded seven grants totalling
about £13 million.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland
Railways, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
NITHC (see p. 366), operates the railway
service on about 336 kilometres (211 miles) of
track and handled 6 million passenger journeys
in 1999-2000. A review of rail safety, published
in March 2000, found that safety levels were
not unreasonable but made a number of
recommendations for improvement. In view of
the substantial investment required to
implement these recommendations, a task force
was set up to advise on the options for the
future of the rail network in Northern Ireland.
An interim report was published in September
2000 and provided advice on four options,
which are being considered by the Minister for
Regional Development.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel was opened to traffic in
1994. It cost about £9 billion and was
undertaken by TML (Transmanche Link) on
behalf of Eurotunnel, a British-French group,
under an operating concession from the
British and French governments.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel operates a drive-on, drive-off
shuttle train service, with separate shuttles for
passenger and freight vehicles, between
terminals near Folkestone and Calais. In 1999
the service carried nearly 3.3 million cars (54
per cent of car traffic on the Dover/
Folkestone-Calais route), 839,000 goods
vehicles (39 per cent of freight traffic) and
82,000 coaches (34 per cent of coach traffic).
Eurostar Passenger Services
Eurostar high-speed train services are
operated jointly by Eurostar (UK) Ltd,
French Railways and Belgian Railways under
the commercial direction of Eurostar Group.
369
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Frequent services connect London (Waterloo)
and Paris or Brussels, taking less than 3 hours
and 2 hours 40 minutes respectively. Trains
also serve Ashford (Kent), Calais, Lille,
Disneyland Paris and, during the winter,
Bourg St Maurice in the French Alps.
Eurostar handled 7 million passengers in 1999.
The first section of the Channel Tunnel
Rail Link is under construction between the
Channel Tunnel terminal and Ebbsfleet, near
Gravesend (Kent), and should be completed
in 2003. Construction work on the second
section, from Ebbsfleet to St Pancras
(London), is due to begin in summer 2001,
and is due for completion by 2007. The whole
project is forecast to cost some £5.2 billion.
Eurostar trains will be able to travel at speeds
of 300 km/h (180 mph), reducing the times
for the London—Paris and London—Brussels
services to 2 hours 20 minutes and 2 hours
respectively.
Underground Railways
In 1863 the world’s first Underground railway
opened in London. Today London
Underground is a major business, serving 275
stations over 408 kilometres (253 miles) of
railway. London Underground Ltd will
become part of Transport for London in 2001.
In 1999-2000, 927 million passenger journeys
were made. In 1999 the Jubilee Line
Extension was opened, providing a fast link
from central London to Stratford (east
London) via Docklands and the Millennium
Dome at North Greenwich, and is expected to
play a major role in the continuing
regeneration of the Docklands area.
Under a proposed Public-Private
Partnership (PPP), responsibility for
maintaining and upgrading London
Underground’s infrastructure would transfer to
the private sector, while London Underground
would continue to have responsibility for safety
and all aspects of operating passenger services
across the Underground network. The private
sector would work under contract to London
Underground for a 30-year period, after which
all the assets would return to the public sector.
The PPP is expected to deliver about
£8 billion of investment in the network and up
to £5 billion of maintenance over 15 years.
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 10-km (6-mile)
loop in central Glasgow.
Light Railways and Tramways
Tramways carried over 1 billion passengers
in the UK (including Ireland) in 1900, but
by around the middle of the 20th century
nearly all the tramways had closed, leaving
two operators, in Blackpool and Llandudno.
However, there has been a revival of
interest in tram/light rail services, and the
ten-year plan indicates a growing role for
tramways, with the provision of up to 25 new
lines in major cities and conurbations. A
selection of pictures is given between pp. 360
and 361.
The latest operation, opened in May 2000,
is the Croydon Tramlink, a 28-km (18-mile)
light rail network in south London, linking
Wimbledon, Beckenham, Elmers End and
New Addington with Croydon town centre.
Tramtrack Croydon Ltd (a private sector
consortium) built and is operating the
network, as a joint undertaking with
Transport for London. Also in London the
Docklands Light Railway (DLR) connects
Docklands with surrounding areas, and is
operated under franchise by Docklands
Railway Management Ltd. A £200 million
extension to Lewisham opened in 1999,
extending the network to 26 kilometres (16
miles) with 36 stations. A link to London City
Airport is planned and could be opened by
2004.
Four other light rail systems are in
operation: the Tyne and Wear Metro,
Manchester Metrolink, Stagecoach Supertram
(in South Yorkshire) and the Midland Metro.
The first stage of the Midland Metro, between
Birmingham and Wolverhampton, opened in
May 1999, and the extension of the
Manchester Metrolink to Salford Quays and
Eccles was completed in July 2000. DETR
approval has been given for the £100 million
extension of the Tyne and Wear Metro to
Sunderland, and for the £180 million
Nottingham Express Transit system, which
will run for 13 kilometres (8 miles) and link
Hucknall to the centre of Nottingham from
2003. Approval has also been given for three

further extensions, costing over £500 million,
of the Manchester Metrolink to Manchester
Airport, Oldham and Rochdale, and to
Ashton-under-Lyne.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are now used mainly for
leisure and general recreation, but they also
have a number of other important roles: as a
heritage and environmental resource, as a
catalyst for regeneration and in land drainage
and water supply. Some inland waterways still
carry freight.
The inland waterways are managed by
about 30 navigation authorities. British
Waterways, a public corporation sponsored by
the DETR and the Scottish Executive, is the
largest, responsible for some 2,600 kilometres
(1,600 miles) of fully navigable waterways (see
map opposite p. 72), about half the UK total.
In June 2000 the DETR issued Waterways
for Tomorrow, a policy document setting out
the Government’s proposals for the future of
the waterways. The DETR envisages greater
recreational use of, and enhanced access to,
the waterways; their wider use as a catalyst for
regeneration; encouragement for the transfer
of freight from road to waterway; and closer
links between British Waterways and other
navigation authorities. Waterways for
Tomorrow encourages partnerships between
navigation authorities and the private and
The Millennium Link project, the largest
heritage project in Scotland, will reopen in
2001 the Forth & Clyde Canal and the
Union Canal to navigation. New sections
of canal are being created, locks
refurbished, bridges constructed and a
tunnel is being built. The 35-metre high
‘Falkirk Wheel’ will allow boats to pass
between the two canals, so connecting
Glasgow and Edinburgh by canal. The
total cost of the project is some £78
million, of which £32 million is being
financed by a grant from the Millennium
Commission and £16 million comes from
Scottish Enterprise.
voluntary sectors. British Waterways is
developing a number of Public-Private
Partnerships, including a project to transfer
water from the wetter areas in the north-west
to drier regions in the south-east of England in
times of drought. The Waterways Trust has
been created as a charitable trust to promote
waterways and raise funds for restoration. The
Scottish Executive is planning to publish a
policy document for Scottish waterways in
2001. For some examples of waterway use and
restoration see the picture section between pp.
72 and 73.
SHIPPING
It is estimated that about 95 per cent by
weight (75 per cent by value) of the UK’s
foreign trade is carried by sea. The UK fleet
has declined considerably in tonnage terms in
the last 25 years, reflecting changing trade
patterns, removal of grants, and greater
competition.
At the end of 1999 there were 617 UK-
owned merchant trading ships of 100 gross
tonnes or more, with a total tonnage of 7.2
million deadweight tonnes. There were 155
vessels totalling 2.7 million deadweight tonnes
used as oil, chemical or gas carriers, and 428
vessels totalling 4.4 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships
or other types of cargo ship, together with 34
passenger ships. In all, 70 per cent of UK-
owned vessels (and the same percentage by
tonnage) are registered in the UK, the Crown
Dependencies or British Overseas Territories
such as Bermuda.
The Government is implementing a
series of measures which aim to revive the
shipping industry and reverse the downward
trend in the UK fleet. The Finance Act 2000
provides for a new fiscal regime, under which
shipping will be taxed on the basis of
tonnage, as occurs in a number of other
countries. Other measures include more
training and career opportunities for seafarers,
and a new ‘minimum training obligation’,
involving a formal commitment by shipping
companies to train seafarers as a condition
of owners’ eligibility for the new tax on
tonnage.
371
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Cargo Services
International revenue earned by the UK
shipping industry in 1999 was £3.4 billion:
£2.7 billion from freight—£2.3 billion on dry
cargo and passenger vessels and £429 million
on tankers and liquefied gas carriers—£177
million from charter receipts and £463 million
from passenger revenue.
Nearly all scheduled cargo-liner services
from the UK are containerised. British
tonnage serving these trades is dominated by a
relatively small number of companies. Besides
the carriage of freight by liner and bulk
services between the UK and the rest of
Europe, many roll-on, roll-off services carry
cars, passengers and commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
Over 50 million passenger journeys a year
take place on international and domestic ferry
services linking the UK with Ireland and
with mainland Europe. Domestic passenger
and freight ferry services run to many of
Britain’s offshore islands, such as the Isle of
Wight, Orkney and Shetland, and the islands
off the west coast of Scotland. Traffic from
southern and south-eastern ports accounts
for a large proportion of traffic to the
continent.
P&O Ferries is the UK’s largest ferry
operator, with a fleet of 50 ships operating on
18 routes around the UK coast. Cross-
Channel services are operated by roll-on, roll¬
off ferries, high-speed catamarans and high¬
speed monohulls. Capacity has been reduced
following the merger in 1998 of P&O’s cross-
Channel operations with those of Stena Line
to form P&O Stena Line.
Maritime Safety
The DETR’s policies for improving marine
safety and pollution control are implemented
by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency
(MCA), which inspects UK ships and foreign
ships using UK ports to ensure that they
comply with international safety, pollution
prevention and operational standards. In
1999-2000, 106 foreign-flagged ships were
detained in UK ports.
In 1999 MCA was alerted to 12,220
incidents, of which 6,721 were accidents
requiring search and rescue assistance. In an
emergency HM Coastguard co-ordinates
facilities, such as its own helicopters; cliff rescue
teams; lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body); aircraft,
helicopters and ships from the armed forces;
and merchant shipping and commercial aircraft.
Some locations around the UK are
potentially hazardous for shipping. Measures
to reduce the risk of collision include the
separation of ships into internationally agreed
shipping lanes, as applies in the Dover Strait,
one of the world’s busiest seaways, which is
monitored by radar from the Channel
Navigation Information Service near Dover.
There are over 1,000 marine aids to navigation
around the UK coast and responsibility for
these rests with the general lighthouse
authorities: Trinity House Lighthouse Service
(for England and Wales), the Northern
Lighthouse Board (for Scotland and the Isle of
Man) and the Commissioners of Irish Lights
(which covers the whole of Ireland).
In March 2000 the Government launched
the Port Marine Safety Code, designed to
ensure the highest standards of marine safety
in UK ports. All harbour authorities are being
asked to implement the code by the end of
2001.
PORTS
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, while several
hundred small harbours cater for local cargo,
fishing vessels, island ferries or recreation.
There are three broad types of port: over 90
trust ports owned and run by boards
constituted as trusts; those owned by local
authorities (predominantly small ports, but
including a few larger ones, such as Sullom
Voe in Shetland and Portsmouth); and
company-owned facilities. Major ports
controlled by trusts include Aberdeen, Dover,
Milford Haven and Tyne.
Associated British Ports (ABP) is the UK s
largest port owner and operates 23 ports,
including Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Ipswich, Newport, Port Talbot,
Southampton and Swansea. Altogether they

when ABP invested £65 million in its ports
and transport business. Other major facilities
owned by private sector companies include

41 per cent of this type of traffic), while Dover
is the leading port for roll-on, roll-off traffic.
Dover is also the major arrival and departure
point, handling around half of international
sea passenger movements to and from the UK.
Northern Ireland has four main ports, at
Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
Warrenpoint. Belfast handles over 56 per cent
of Northern Ireland’s seaborne trade.
Port Traffic
In 1999 traffic through major UK ports (those
handling over 2 million tonnes a year)
amounted to 533 million tonnes: 194 million
tonnes of imports, 178 million tonnes of
exports and 161 million tonnes of domestic
traffic (which included offshore traffic and
landings of sea-dredged aggregates). Minor
ports handled an additional 33 million tonnes.
The main ports, in terms of total tonnage
handled, are shown in Table 22.4. Forth, Milford
Haven and Sullom Voe mostly handle oil, while
the principal destinations for non-fuel traffic are
London, Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham,
Tees and Hartlepool, and Liverpool.
Container and roll-on, roll-off traffic
through the major ports in the UK was 132
million tonnes in 1999 and now accounts for
85 per cent of non-bulk traffic. The number of
units handled rose by 5 per cent in 1999 to 9.8
million: 5.4 million road goods vehicles and
unaccompanied trailers, and 4.4 million
containers. By far the most important port for
container traffic is Felixstowe (which handles
CIVIL AVIATION
In 1999 UK airlines flew a record 1,381
million aircraft kilometres, 66 per cent higher
than in 1989: 947 million kilometres on
scheduled services and 434 million kilometres
on non-scheduled flights. They carried 65
million passengers on scheduled services and
33 million on charter flights. Passenger seat
occupancy was 76 per cent, being much higher
on charter flights (89 per cent) than on
scheduled services (71 per cent). It is also
higher for international flights (77 per cent)
than internal services (61 per cent). The
DETR is forecasting that demand for air
travel at UK airports will grow to between 348
million and 461 million terminal passengers in
2020, with the mid-point of 401 million
passengers representing an increase of 150 per
cent compared with 1998.
UK airlines are entirely in the private
sector, as are many of the major airports. Day-
to-day responsibility for the regulation of civil
aviation rests with the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA). A series of studies on
regional airports has been undertaken, and a
373
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
study of airport issues in south-east and east
England is in progress. These will contribute
to the development of a White Paper which
will provide a long-term framework for the
future of civil aviation and airports in the UK.
Airlines
British Airways
British Airways is the UK’s biggest airline and
one of the world’s largest international
airlines. During 1999-2000 its turnover from
airline operations was £8.9 billion, and the
British Airways group carried 46.6 million
passengers, achieving a passenger load factor
of 70 per cent on its main scheduled services.
The airline’s scheduled route network serves
188 destinations and its main operating bases
are London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports.
British Airways was one of the founders,
together with American Airlines, Canadian
International Airlines, Cathay Pacific and
Qantas, of the ‘Oneworld’ alliance in February
1999. The alliance now has nine member
airlines and serves 641 scheduled destinations
in 135 countries.
The British Airways group has a fleet of
366 aircraft, including seven Concordes, 85
Boeing 737s, 72 Boeing 747s, 53 Boeing 757s,
33 Boeing 777s and 27 Boeing 767s. Ten
Airbus A320s and 20 A319s are in service,
with a further 20 and 33 respectively on order.
Other UK Airlines
British Midland is the second largest
scheduled carrier and operates an extensive
network of scheduled services with 40 aircraft,
which carried 6.5 million passengers in 1999.
Britannia Airways is the world’s biggest
charter airline and carried 8.2 million
passengers in 1999 on its 28 aircraft. Virgin
Atlantic operates scheduled services to 20
overseas destinations with 29 aircraft. Low-
fare, ‘no-frills’ airlines are expanding their
services. Operators in the UK include Easyjet
(which operates 28 routes in six European
countries and has three European hubs—
Luton, Liverpool and Geneva) and the British
Airways subsidiary Go.
Airports
Of over 150 licensed civil aerodromes in the
UK, nearly one-quarter handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. In 1999 the
UK’s civil airports handled a total of 169.6
million passengers (168.5 million terminal
passengers and 1.2 million in transit), and 2.2
million tonnes of freight.
Passenger traffic has been growing at the
UK’s main airports (see Table 22.5).
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international travellers and is the UK’s most
important for passengers and air freight,
handling 62 million passengers (excluding

those in transit) and 1.3 million tonnes of
freight in 1999. Gatwick is the world’s sixth
busiest international airport and has the
world’s busiest single runway.
Ownership and Control
BAA pic is the world’s largest commercial
operator of airports. Its airports handle almost
200 million passengers a year. In 1999-2000
its seven UK airports—Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted and Southampton in southern
England, and Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Aberdeen in Scotland—handled 116.8 million
passengers. Overseas, BAA manages all or part
of eight airports: four in the United States,
Naples Airport in Italy, Melbourne and
Launceston airports in Australia, and
Mauritius. It also manages commercial
facilities at its airports, and is a major
international duty-free retailer.
The UK’s second largest operator is TBI,
which has an interest in 29 airports
worldwide, including Belfast International and
Cardiff. Manchester and Newcastle airports
are among those owned by local authorities.
All UK airports used for public transport
and training flights must be licensed by the
CAA for reasons of safety. Stringent
requirements, such as adequate fire-fighting,
medical and rescue services, have to be
satisfied before a licence is granted.
Stansted is the fastest growing major
airport in Europe. Traffic rose by over a
third in 1999 to 9.4 million passengers, and
has doubled in the last four years. It now
serves 90 destinations, including 25 new
routes added during 1999-2000. Five low-
cost scheduled carriers operate from the
airport, accounting for 53 per cent of
flights, and have made a significant
contribution to increased traffic. BAA is
investing over £200 million at Stansted in
the next five years to increase its capacity
to around 15 million passengers a year.
Work began in February 2000 on an
extension to the terminal and this is due to
open in 2002, while a further extension is
due for completion in 2004.
Among other large-scale improvements at UK
airports are:
• a major £260 million expansion plan at
Birmingham Airport, which will increase
its capacity to 10 million passengers a
year;
• a £54 million redevelopment programme
at Edinburgh Airport; and
• a £30 million expansion scheme at
Belfast City Airport over the next five
years.
Airport Development
Investment to expand passenger facilities is in
progress at many UK airports. At Heathrow
BAA has invested over £960 million in the last
five years. A £100 million redevelopment of
departure facilities at Terminal 3 is scheduled
for completion in 2002. BAA’s plans for a fifth
terminal, which could eventually cater for 30
million passengers a year, have been considered
by a public inquiry. If approval is granted, the
new terminal could be operational by 2007.
Expansion at Gatwick’s two terminals over the
next ten years is designed to raise annual
capacity to around 40 million passengers. A
second runway at Manchester Airport is
expected to be operational early in 2001.
Air Traffic Control
Civil and military air traffic control over the
UK and the surrounding seas, including much
of the North Atlantic, is undertaken by
National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS),
working in collaboration with military
controllers. NATS is currently a subsidiary of
the CAA. Under the Transport Bill, it would
be separated from the CAA (which would
retain responsibility for air safety regulation)
and established as a Public-Private
Partnership. The Government’s intention is to
sell 51 per cent of NATS to the private sector,
and this is planned for early 2001.
To cope with the rapid growth in air traffic,
NATS is planning to replace the three
existing UK centres for civil and military en
375
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
route air traffic control operations at
Prestwick, Manchester and West Drayton
(near Heathrow) by two major centres.
Swanwick (Hampshire) is due to open in 2002,
while a new Scottish centre at Prestwick will
replace the existing centre in 2006—07.
Air Safety
The CAA is responsible for safety standards
on UK airlines. It certifies aircraft and air
crews, licenses air operators and air travel
organisers, and approves certain air fares and
airport charges. To qualify for a first
professional licence, a pilot must undertake a
full-time course of instruction approved by
the CAA—or have acceptable military or
civilian flying experience—and pass ground
examinations and flight tests. Every company
operating aircraft used for commercial air
transport purposes must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate, which the CAA grants
when it is satisfied that the company is
competent to operate its aircraft safely. All
aircraft registered in the UK must be granted
a certificate of airworthiness by the CAA
before being flown. The CAA works closely
with the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), a
European grouping of aviation safety
regulation authorities.
The DETR’s Air Accidents Investigation
Branch investigates accidents and serious
incidents occurring in UK airspace and those
that happen overseas to aircraft registered or
manufactured in the UK.
Communications
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Telecommunications is one of the most
rapidly expanding sectors of the UK economy.
Growth has been particularly strong in new
services, notably mobile telephones and
services provided over the Internet. In the UK
nearly 400 licences have been issued to more
than 300 different providers. According to
OFTEL (see below), turnover of the UK
telecommunications market (including fixed
and mobile networks and telecommunications
equipment companies) was some £31.5 billion
in 1999-2000, 17 per cent higher than in
1998-99. The market has become more
competitive, with greater choice of suppliers
for consumers, an expanding range of services
and lower prices. Competitors to BT have
increased their share of the market, especially
the business market.
Services
Telephone traffic is growing quickly. Calls
from fixed links were 13 per cent higher in
1999-2000, at 196.6 billion call minutes, than
in 1998-99 (see Table 22.6). There are nearly
34 million fixed lines. A telephone is one of
the most widely available consumer durable
goods in the home. According to the 1998
ONS General Household Survey, an
estimated 96 per cent of households had a
telephone. In a survey for OFTEL, published
in April 2000, over 97 per cent of the UK
population had access to either a fixed or
mobile telephone at home. This survey found
that a significant and growing number of
people preferred to use a mobile telephone
rather than a fixed-line telephone as they
favoured the former’s flexibility and the ability
to be contactable at all times. Around
5 per cent of homes now have a mobile
telephone instead of a fixed line. By the end of
March 2000 there were over 27 million mobile
telephone users, 83 per cent more than a year
earlier (see Table 22.6), and by September
2000 the number had risen to over 33 million.
Regulation
OFTEL (the Office of Telecommunications),
a non-ministerial government department
headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, is the independent
regulatory body for the telecommunications
industry. Its functions include ensuring that
licensees comply with the conditions of their
licences and promoting effective competition.
Two major recent projects have been
encouraging the early introduction of high¬
speed information services and cheaper
Internet access for consumers.
Rapid developments in the sector are
changing the emphasis of OFTEL’s work. In
376
22: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
The use of the Internet in the UK is growing
very rapidly. According to the ONS Family
Expenditure Survey, over the first three
months of 2000 an average of 6.5 million
households (25 per cent of households) in the
UK could access the Internet from a home
computer, about twice the number a year
earlier. However, many more people use the
Internet, for example, at work, in education
establishments and in libraries; 98 per cent of
secondary schools and 86 per cent of primary
schools in England are connected to the
Internet, according to the Department for
Education and Employment.
According to a separate ONS survey, the
Omnibus Survey, conducted in July 2000,45
per cent of adults have accessed the Internet,
equivalent to 20.4 million adults. In this latter
survey, among those who had accessed the
Internet for personal use only, about seven in
ten had used the Internet for e-mail and a
similar proportion to find information about
goods and services, with just over a quarter
buying or ordering tickets, goods or services,
and around two-thirds had used the Internet
for general browsing or surfing.
There are over 400 Internet service
providers (ISPs). Freeserve is the biggest ISP
and has some 2 million registered users.
Internet access is now becoming available by
other means, for example, through the
television, while ADSL (asymmetric digital
subscriber line) technology will provide
residential and business customers with much
faster services.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
January 2000 it announced a new strategy for
regulation, looking particularly at
circumstances where some formal or informal
regulatory action is needed to protect
consumers’ interests.
Government proposals for changing the
regulatory framework will be included in a
White Paper on communications, due to be
issued later in 2000. The Government’s aim is
to create a dynamic market for the UK’s
broadcasting and telecommunications
industries and to promote their global
competitiveness (see p. 268).
Service Providers
The three largest UK telecommunications
companies are:
• 2? T, which became a private sector
company in 1984, runs one of the world’s
largest public telecommunications
networks, including about 20 million
residential lines and 8.5 million business
lines. It has over 6,000 local telephone
exchanges and an optical fibre network of
4.6 million kilometres, and employs
136,000 people. Turnover in 1999-2000
totalled £21-9 billion. In April 2000 it
announced a major restructuring of its
global operations, including creating six
new operations: Ignite (an international
broadband network); BTopenworld (its
international Internet business); BT
Wireless (international mobile
communications, including BT Cellnet—
see p. 379); Yell (international directory
enquiries and e-commerce operations);
BT Wholesale (the UK network
business) and BT Retail (serving UK
business and residential customers).
These new businesses operate both
within the UK and internationally,
working alongside Concert, BT’s global
venture with AT&T of the United
States. Concert’s global network reaches
a total of 237 countries and territories.
• Vodafone has become the UK’s biggest
company by market capitalisation (see
p. 386), following two main takeovers: the
acquisition in 1999 of the US mobile
telephone group AirTouch and the
takeover in February 2000 of the German
group Mannesmann. It is the UK’s largest
mobile telephone operator in terms of the
number of subscribers (see p. 379) and has
over 50 million customers worldwide
through its operations in 25 countries.
Turnover in 1999—2000 was £12.5 billion.
Vodafone is working on developing
advanced Internet application
technologies so that customers will be able
to access a much wider range of services
on its mobile telephones.
• Cable & Wireless has operations in 70
countries and employs over 35,000
people. The company has adopted a new
strategy to concentrate on the business
sector, especially in Internet Protocol
(IP), data and other advanced services,
and has sold other non-strategic parts of
the business, including its interest in
Hongkong Telecom and the consumer
business of Cable & Wireless
Communications. It now has three main
divisions: Cable & Wireless Global, as its
main operation for delivering services to
business customers in the United States,
Europe (including the UK) and Japan;
Cable & Wireless Optus (its Australian
business); and Cable & Wireless Regional
(for its businesses in the Caribbean and
other areas of the world). In May 2000 it
completed the first stage of its single
global high-capacity IP network for
delivering integrated IP, data, voice and
messaging communications. The
company has acquired 13 ISPs in Europe
as well as other IP-related assets, and
expects to have at least 20 web-hosting
centres in operation around the world
within two years, designed to provide
customers with faster and better websites
and advanced e-commerce applications.
Following a substantial consolidation
among the cable operators, the two main
companies are NTL (which acquired the
residential interests of Cable & Wireless
Communications in 2000) and Telewest. By
the end of March 2000 cable operators had
installed around 4.8 million telephone lines in
the UK, and over 12 million homes were able
to receive broadband cable services.
378
22: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Mobile Communications
Mobile telephony continues to grow strongly.
This rapid growth can be put down to the
introduction of easier methods of payment,
such as pre-paid, and the reduction in the cost
of handsets. Pre-paid telephones now account
for 80 per cent of sales, with a typical handset
selling for less than ^50. The first ‘wireless
application protocol’ (WAP) telephones,
which enable users to access the Internet and
information services, are now on sale.
There are four network suppliers:
• Vodafone (with 9.4 million customers in
mid-2000);
• BT Cellnet (8.1 million);
• Orange (7.2 million), which has been
acquired by France Telecom; and
• One 2 One (6.0 million), a subsidiary of
Deutsche Telekom.
In addition, there are around 50
independent service providers.
In 2000 the Government held an auction
for licences to run systems to provide the next
generation of mobile telephone services,
known as ‘third generation’. These will
provide users with high-speed access to the
Internet, e-mail facilities, video conferencing
and access to a large number of information
services. Bids for the five licences available
totalled £22.5 billion. Licences were won by
the four existing operators, with the licence
reserved for a new entrant going to a
subsidiary of TIW of Canada.
In 1999 Dolphin Telecommunications, the
fifth mobile operator, launched the first
mobile telephone network using the TETRA
(1 rans European Trunk Radio) technology,
which allows enhanced services and
functionality, including advanced speech, data
facilities and direct mode communications.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail. Today, its Royal Mail
service delivers to 26 million addresses in the
UK, handling around 80 million items each
working day. In 1999-2000 it processed 18.9
billion inland letters and 861 million outgoing
international letters. Mail is collected from
about 113,000 posting boxes, and from post
offices and large postal users. Its International
Services uses 1,400 flights a week to send mail
direct to 280 postal ‘gateways’ worldwide. The
Post Office employs 200,000 people.
The rapid growth of electronic
communications is having only a limited effect
on Royal Mail traffic, mainly in the consumer
market. The volume of domestic letters rose by
about 4.6 per cent in 1999, and direct mail was
up by 10 per cent. High-speed mail-handling
machinery—the Integrated Mail Processor—
has cut substantially the sorting time for
processing letters. Automatic sorting utilises
the information contained in the postcode; the
UK postcode system allows mechanised sorting
down to part of a street on a delivery round
and, in some cases, to an individual address.
Parcelforce Worldwide provides a door-to-
door overnight delivery service throughout the
UK and an international service to 239
countries and territories. It handles 140
million items a year. Parcelforce Worldwide is
modernising the facilities for handling parcels.
Two new sorting centres in Coventry—one
for international parcels and the other for
domestic traffic—were opened in autumn
1999 and April 2000 respectively. When fully
operational, they will form one of the largest
and most modern distribution centres in
Europe, handling some 50,000 items an hour.
In 1999 the Post Office acquired German
Parcel, the third largest private carrier in
Germany. In March 2000 it announced a joint
venture with TNT Post Group of the
Netherlands and Singapore Post to create the
world’s biggest international mail partnership;
the Post Office will have a 24.5 per cent stake
in the venture.
Postal Services Policy
Government reforms for the modernisation
of the Post Office and for giving it greater
commercial freedom were set out in a White
Paper in July 1999 and are being
implemented through the Postal Services Act
2000. The Act will establish the Post Office
as a public limited company under
379
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
government ownership, promote competition
and stronger regulation, and define the duties
and powers of a new independent regulator,
the Postal Services Commission. Other
measures in the Act will provide for the
protection of the obligation to offer a
universal postal service at a uniform tariff
with daily weekday deliveries to every UK
address, protect the nationwide network of
post offices, and create a new Consumer
Council for Postal Services.
Post Offices
The nationwide network of Post Office
branches handles a wide range of transactions,
with a total value of £160 billion in
1999-2000. It acts as an agent for Royal Mail
and Parcelforce Worldwide, government
departments, local authorities and Alliance &
Leicester Giro and other banks’ banking
services. There are about 18,400 post offices
in the UK, of w hich nearly 600 are operated
directly by the Post Office. The remainder are
franchise offices or are operated on an agency
basis by sub-postmasters. A £1 billion
investment programme in automation will
involve the installation of modern computer
systems in all post offices by spring 2001. In
June 2000 the Government announced
financial support for modernising the Post
Office network, including the creation of a
new Universal Bank aimed particularly at
those who do not currently have a bank
account, and support to prevent further
closures of post offices in rural areas and
deprived urban areas.
Private Courier and Express Services
Private sector couriers and express operators
are allowed to handle time-sensitive door-to-
door deliveries, subject to a minimum fee,
currently of £1. The Government has asked
the Postal Services Commission to advise on
the size of the ‘reserved area’ (that part of the
postal market which will require a licence
from the Commission).

Structure and Performance 381 Industrial and Commercial Policy 390
Economic Strategy 387 Corporate Affairs ' 398
The Government’s economic policies are directed towards the achievement of
high and stable levels of growth and employment, with the aim of increasing
opportunity and enabling everyone to share in rising living standards. From a
platform of economic stability, the Government is seeking to raise productivity
and sustainable growth—by increasing skills, promoting enterprise and
innovation, creating strong and competitive markets, and enhancing the legal and
regulatory framework for the protection of consumers.
Growth in the UK economy continued for the eighth consecutive year in 1999.
Gross domestic product (GDP) at constant market prices strengthened during the
year, with quarterly growth rising from 0.3 per cent at the beginning of 1999 to an
average of 0.9 per cent in the third and fourth quarters. Employment growth
remained firm throughout, even during the temporary slowdown in GDP growth
at the start of the year which stemmed, at least in part, from the global economic
slowdown in 1998. Retail price pressure remained subdued in 1999. Underlying
inflation was below the Government’s target from April onwards, and averaged
2.3 per cent in the year as a whole.
STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE
The value of all goods and services produced
in the UK economy for final consumption is
measured by gross domestic product. In 1999
GDP at current market prices—‘money
GDP’—totalled £891 billion. Average annual
growth in GDP at 1995 market prices over the
past five years has been 2.9 per cent a year (see
also Table 23.1). Values for two of the main
economic indicators, inflation and GDP, are
shown in the charts on p. 382.
Output
GDP grew by 2.1 per cent in 1999. Rapid
growth in domestic demand was partly offset
by a weaker net trade position. The actions of
the Bank of England in progressively reducing
interest rates from lx/i per cent in mid-1998 to
5 per cent in summer 1999 helped to buoy
consumer confidence at a time when global
and UK prospects had deteriorated.
HM Treasury, and independent
forecasters, expect higher growth in 2000:
GDP is forecast in the 2000 Budget to rise by
between 23/4 and 3'A per cent in 2000 as a
whole, and by between 2’A and 23A per cent in
both 2001 and 2002. Over the long term,
economic growth has averaged around 2'A per
cent a year.
In 1999, at constant basic prices—that is,
adjusted for inflation, and excluding taxes and
subsidies on products—the output of the

service industries increased by 2.9 per cent,
with particularly strong growth in transport,
storage and communication (7.7 per cent) and
business services and finance (3.7 per cent).
The situation in manufacturing, in contrast,
was less strong: although manufacturing
output grew in each of the three quarters after
the first quarter, output for 1999 as a whole
was unchanged on the previous year.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the service sector (see
chapter 30) and this pattern continued during
the 1990s. Manufacturing (see chapter 28)
now contributes around 22 per cent of GDP,
compared with over a third in 1950.
Over the past 25 or so years the UK has
experienced lower economic growth than its
major competitors. In the 1970s, according to
OECD figures, average annual GDP growth
was 1.9 per cent compared with 3.0 per cent in
the EU and 3.3 per cent in the G7 countries.
In the 1980s, annual growth of 2.7 per cent
was slightly above the EU average of 2.4 per
cent but a little below the G7 average of 3.0

same as for the EU, at 2.0 per cent a year in
the period 1990-97, although slightly below

Household Income and Expenditure
Total resources of the households sector—
including non-profit institutions serving
households—rose by 5.2 per cent in 1999 to
£874 billion. Gross disposable income—after
deductions, including taxes and social
contributions—totalled £600 billion. In 1995
prices, real households’ disposable income—
that is, the amount of money the household
sector has available for spending after taxes
and other deductions—was 3.4 per cent
higher, at over £543 billion, in 1999 than in
1998. Household net financial wealth grew
strongly in 1999, amounting to £2,233 billion.
Wages and salaries accounted for almost 60
per cent of household primary income in 1999
and rose by 6.2 per cent during the year.
In 1999, 95.0 per cent of after-tax
household income was spent. Households’
saving ratio—saving as a percentage of total
available households’ resources—fell slightly
between 1998 and 1999, from 5.8 to 5.0 per
cent, after the higher levels seen in previous
years.
Household final expenditure—that is,
spending by the household sector on products
or services to satisfy their immediate needs or
wants—accounted for just over 75 per cent of
the total £750 billion final consumption
expenditure in 1999, amounting to £564
billion at current market prices. In constant
price terms, it grew by 4.4 per cent.
Expenditure on services remained relatively
strong, rising by 4.3 per cent in 1999, and
expenditure on durable goods was 6.8 per cent
higher than in 1998.

Table 23.3 shows the changing pattern of
households’ final consumption expenditure.
Over the longer term, as incomes rise, people
tend to spend increasing proportions of their
disposable income on durable goods and
certain services. Spending on leisure pursuits
and tourism, communications, health and
financial services have all shown significant
growth in recent years. Declining proportions
are being spent on alcohol and tobacco, and
energy products.
Investment
Gross fixed capital formation represents
investment in assets which are used repeatedly
or continuously over a number of years to
produce goods, such as machinery used to
create a product. Following growth of 10.1 per
cent in 1998, investment at constant 1995
prices increased by 6.1 per cent in 1999 to
£153.3 billion (see Table 23.4). Business
investment, at constant prices, grew by 7.6 per
cent in 1999 to reach a record high proportion
of GDP, at 14.3 per cent. Within business
investment, the 24.9 per cent rise in private
sector other services more than offset a 14.7
per cent fall in manufacturing investment.
UK whole economy investment has
accounted for a smaller share of GDP than
other industrialised countries—around 17 per
cent of GDP, compared with the OECD
average of 21 per cent—but high levels of
business investment in recent years have
helped to narrow the gap.
General government investment rose by 3.1
per cent in 1998 and by 0.5 per cent in 1999,
and is forecast by HM Treasury to rise at
between 17.5 and 20 per cent in each of the
next three years, reflecting the Government’s

International Trade
International trade plays a key role in the UK
economy (see chapter 25). The UK is the fifth
largest exporter of goods and services, and
exports accounted for 25 per cent of GDP in
1999. Other EU countries took nearly 59 per
cent of UK exports of goods in 1999 and
supplied almost 54 per cent of imported goods.
T he UK’s current account deficit (see
p. 414) deteriorated sharply from £0.1 billion
in 1998 to £11.0 billion in 1999. This partly
reflected a reduction in exports to economies
affected by the South East Asia crisis, but
more recently strong imports as well. The
deficit on trade in goods rose to £26.8 billion,
but was partly offset by the combined effects
of surpluses on both trade in services
(£11.5 billion) and on investment income
(£8.1 billion).
Business Structure
The UK has around 3.7 million businesses.
They include many big companies. According
to a Financial Times survey of the top 500
European companies in January 2000, 146
were UK-based, with a market capitalisation
of some $2,269 billion (£1,380 billion). There
are around 3,500 UK businesses employing
over 500 people, representing 39 per cent of
total employment by UK businesses and 41
per cent of turnover. A small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a substantial proportion of
total production in some sectors. This is
particularly true for chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle assembly and
aerospace. Of the top 20 UK companies by
market capitalisation (as at 24 April 2000),
four are in the retail banking sector, five in
telecommunications and three in
pharmaceuticals (see Table 23.5).
Expenditure on company acquisitions
overseas by UK companies reached a record
level of £108.8 billion in 1999, almost double
the amount in 1998, which had itself been a
record. The largest reported transactions
included the acquisition of AirTouch
Communications Inc of the United States by
Vodafone Group pic and of Astra AB of
Sweden by Zeneca pic. Acquisitions in the
UK by overseas companies also reached a
record level—£60.1 billion—almost twice that
achieved in 1998, the major acquisition being
that of Orange pic by Mannesmann AG.
Mannesmann was subsequently acquired in

Small firms play an important part in the
UK economy: around 44 per cent of the
workforce work for companies employing
fewer than 50 people. Around 2.3 million
businesses are sole traders or partners without
employees, while a further 963,600 businesses
employ one to four people. Together these
3.3 million enterprises account for 89 per cent
of the number of businesses, over 23 per cent
of business employment and 16 per cent of
turnover.
Private sector firms predominate in the
economy. The public sector has become much
less significant following the privatisation
since 1979 of many public sector businesses,
including gas, electricity supply, coal and
telecommunications. The remaining major
nationalised industries are the Post Office,
BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) and the Civil
Aviation Authority.
Inflation
There are three main measures of retail price
inflation used in the UK:
• the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which is
the main domestic measure of inflation in
the UK. It measures the average change
from month to month in the prices of
goods and services purchased by most
households in the UK and is commonly
called ‘headline’ inflation;
• the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments (RPIX), which is used to
calculate ‘underlying’ inflation and is the
target measure set by the Government
(see p. 388); and
• the harmonised index of consumer prices
(HICP), which is calculated for each
member state of the European Union for
the purposes of European comparisons; it
is also used to derive inflation rates for
the eurozone and the EU as a whole.
Underlying annual inflation (RPIX) in the
last 20 years or so has fluctuated considerably,
with a peak of 20.8 per cent in the year to May
1980. However, it was much lower in the
386
23: THE ECONOMY
1990s, and since 1993 has been in a relatively
narrow range, from around 2 per cent to 3.5
per cent. In 1999 it averaged 2.3 per cent—the
RPI was only 1.5 per cent—and it has been
consistently below the Government’s target of
2.5 per cent since April 1999.
Producer input prices for materials and fuel
purchased by manufacturing industry rose by
12.5 per cent in the year to December 1999
having fallen by around 9 per cent in each of
the two previous years. Generally the index
has risen since then, and is approaching levels
last seen early in 1997, which largely reflects
rises in crude oil prices. Producer output price
inflation has been gradually rising since the
end of 1998, with prices of UK manufactured
goods rising at an annual rate of between 2'/2
and 3 per cent in mid-2000.
During 1999, the ‘all items’ RPI low
average percentage change reflected falling
prices for household goods, clothing and
footwear, leisure goods, fuel and light, and
food, some of which were lower than the
previous year. Housing costs also rose
considerably less than in 1998, mainly due to
reductions during the first half of the year in
mortgage interest payments. The higher levels
of duty and increases in manufacturers’ prices
counteracted these falls and gave above
average rises in prices for tobacco, and petrol
and oil. Towards the end of 1999 and the
beginning of 2000, mortgage interest
payments were increasing.
In 1999 inflation according to the HICP for
the UK was 1.3 per cent, compared with an
EU average of 1.2 per cent. During the first
half of 2000 the UK’s HICP was well below
the EU average, averaging 0.8 per cent
compared with 2.1 per cent in the EU as a
whole, partly as a consequence of the weak
euro.
Labour Market
Employment in the UK continued to grow in
the year to July 2000, with ongoing falls in
unemployment. Latest figures show that
employment—at 28.0 million in the three
months to July—was at a record high level,
354,000 higher than in the same period a year
earlier (see chapter 11). Economic inactivity
fell as more people found jobs or sought work.
Unemployment also continued to fall, and at
1,580,000 in the three months to July 2000
was 166,000 lower than a year earlier,
according to International Labour
Organisation (ILO) measures. This
represented 5.3 per cent of the workforce, well
below the latest figure currently available (8.3
per cent) for all European Union countries
and the lowest UK rate since 1984. Long-term
(over two years) and youth unemployment
have both declined.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
1 he main elements of the Government’s
economic strategy, set out in the November
1999 Pre-Budget Report, which is designed to
deliver high and stable levels of economic
growth and employment, are:
• delivering macroeconomic stability;
• meeting the productivity challenge;
• increasing employment opportunity for
all (see chapter 11);
• ensuring fairness for families and
communities; and
• protecting the environment.
HM Treasury is the department with
prime responsibility for the Government’s
monetary and fiscal frameworks. It is also
responsible for wider economic policy, which
it carries out in conjunction with other
government departments, such as Trade and
Industry; Education and Employment; and
the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
Government policy on UK membership of
the European single currency (see p. 79)
remains as set out by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in 1997, and restated by the Prime
Minister in February 1999. The determining
factor underpinning any government decision
is whether the economic case for the UK
joining is clear and unambiguous. The
Government has set out five economic tests
which will have to be met before any decision
to join can be taken. These tests are:
• sustainable convergence between Britain
and the economies of the single currency;
• whether there is sufficient flexibility to
cope with economic change;
387
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• the effect on investment;
• the impact on the UK financial services
industry; and
• whether it is good for employment.
The Government has said that making a
decision, during this Parliament, to join, is not
realistic. It intends to make another
assessment of the five economic tests early in
the next Parliament.
Economic Stability
The Government considers that economic
stability is vital for the achievement of its
central economic objective of high and stable
levels of growth and employment. It has
introduced new frameworks for the operation
of both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve
low and stable inflation and sound public
finances. In the Government’s view, the co¬
ordination of monetary and fiscal policy is
very important. The Government ensures co¬
ordination by setting mutually consistent
objectives for monetary and fiscal policies.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (see p. 511) is responsible for
setting interest rates to meet the
Government’s inflation target of 2.5 per cent,
as defined by the 12-month change in RPIX.
Interest rates peaked at 71/2 per cent in
1998, compared with a peak of 15 per cent in
1990 in the previous economic cycle. Interest
rates have remained at 6 per cent since
February 2000.
International Stability
The UK Government plays an active role in
international efforts to maintain global
prosperity, and prevent and resolve crises.
The G7 Declaration of October 1998, under
the UK presidency, provided a comprehensive
blueprint for reform of the international
financial architecture, designed to promote
economic and financial stability. The key
reforms include measures to:
• strengthen and reform the international
financial institutions, including the
International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and multilateral development banks;
• enhance transparency and promote best
practices, by implementing a range of
agreed codes and standards;
• strengthen financial regulation, including
the establishment of the Financial
Stability Forum (see p. 511);
• strengthen macroeconomic policies and
financial systems in emerging markets;
• improve crisis prevention and
management, and involve the private
sector; and
• promote social policies to protect the
poor and most vulnerable.
The G7 Finance Ministers’ report from
Fukuoka (Japan) in July 2000 shows that
much progress has been achieved. The UK is
committed to ensuring that the reform process
continues.
Fiscal Policy
The Code for Fiscal Stability, set up under the
Finance Act 1998, requires fiscal and debt
management policy to be carried out in
accordance with five key principles:
• transparency in setting fiscal policy
objectives, the implementation of fiscal
policy and the presentation of the public
accounts;
• stability in the fiscal policy-making
process and in the way that fiscal policy
affects the economy;
• responsibility in the management of the
public finances;
• fairness, including between present and
future generations; and
• efficiency in the design and
implementation of fiscal policy, and in
managing both sides of the public sector
balance sheet.
Consistent with these principles, the
Government established objectives for fiscal
policy as:
• over the medium term, to ensure sound
public finances and that spending and
taxation have an impact fairly, both
within and across generations; and
388
23: THE ECONOMY
• over the short term, supporting monetary
policy where possible through the
operation of the ‘automatic stabilisers’
and, where prudent and sensible, changes
in the fiscal stance.
To meet these objectives, the operation of
fiscal policy is guided by two strict rules, set
out in HM Treasury’s Economic and Fiscal
Strategy Report (see below), against which its
performance may be judged:
• the golden rule—over the economic
cycle, the Government will borrow only
to invest and not to fund current
spending; and
• the sustainable investment rule—public
sector net debt as a proportion of GDP
will be held over the economic cycle at a
stable and prudent level.
These rules aim to ensure that, over the
course of an economic cycle, each generation
pays for the public services they use, and that
public borrowing is kept under firm control.
The fiscal policy framework is being
strengthened by a new way of planning and
controlling public expenditure—Resource
Accounting and Budgeting (RAB). RAB will
ensure that the full economic cost of
government activities is measured properly by
including other costs not reflected in cash-
based accounts. RAB will, for the first time,
require departments to report systematically
on how their resources are allocated to their
aims and objectives, and on what is achieved
as a result. This is intended to provide the
Government with a better basis for deciding
on the allocation of resources and improve
transparency, by making it easier to see what
taxpayers are getting for their money.
The Budget
The Budget is the Government’s main
economic statement of the year and is usually
issued in March. In a major speech to
Parliament, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
reviews the nation’s economic performance
and describes the Government’s economic
objectives and economic policies it intends to
follow in order to achieve them. The 2000
Budget report comprised two documents:
• the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report,
setting out the Government’s long-term
strategy and objectives; and
• the Financial Statement and Budget
Report, providing a summary of each
Budget measure and an analysis of the
economic and public finance forecasts.
In advance of the spring Budget, the
Government now publishes a Pre-Budget
Report, usually in the previous November. As
well as setting out economic and fiscal
developments and prospects, it describes the
direction of government policy and sets out
for consultation measures under consideration
for the forthcoming Budget.
The Spending Review
In the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review,
the Government introduced a new framework
for public spending. The main elements of the
reforms (see also chapter 24) are set out below:
• the annual Public Spending Survey has
been replaced with firm plans set for three
years, through Departmental Expenditure
Limits. Where expenditure cannot be
planned on a multi-year basis, it is subject
to annual scrutiny as part of the Budget
process; such expenditure is denoted
Annually Managed Expenditure. This
gives departments greater certainty when
planning expenditure and allows the
Government to take a more strategic look
at the effectiveness of public spending;
• spending is separated into capital and
resource (formerly current) budgets with
tight controls on transfers from capital to
resource spending to ensure short-term
pressures do not squeeze out essential
investment;
• underspending within Departmental
Expenditure Limits in a given year can
be carried over to the following year,
assisting departments in managing their
budgets and avoiding wasteful end-of-
year spending surges;
• the National Asset Register and
departmental investment strategies will
help to improve the utilisation of existing
assets and the planning of new capital
389
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
investment and ensure that the public
sector does not hold on to assets which
are surplus to its requirements;
• public service agreements detail the
outcomes departments will deliver with
the funds provided; and
• cross-departmental reviews have been
introduced to tackle problems such as
crime, drugs and social exclusion, with
joint working across departments. Fifteen
cross-departmental reviews were
conducted in the 2000 Spending Review.
INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL
POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) aims to increase UK competitiveness
and scientific excellence in order to generate
higher levels of sustainable growth and
productivity. It has four specific objectives:
• to promote enterprise, innovation and
higher productivity;
• to make the most of the UK’s scientific,
engineering and technological capabilities;
• to create strong and competitive markets;
and
• to develop a fair and effective legal and
regulatory framework.
Measures to help achieve these objectives
are described below. DTI responsibilities on
export promotion are covered in chapter 25,
technology and innovation in chapter 26, and
consumer protection in chapter 30, while
those on industrial relations are described in
chapter 11.
Competitiveness
The Government set out its industrial policy
in the White Paper on competitiveness, Our
Competitive Future: Building the Knowledge
Driven Economy, published in 1998. The
Government’s aim is for UK business to close
the performance gap with its competitors,
both in terms of productivity and its ability to
produce innovative new products and create
high-value services.
In December 1999 the DTI published the
first in an annual series of UK competitiveness
indicators. The indicators are to be used to
track the UK’s performance as a knowledge-
driven economy and monitor progress in
closing the productivity gap with other
advanced economies. The first assessment
showed that in many respects the UK was
beginning to succeed as a knowledge-driven
economy, but in some areas it still had some
way to go to achieve the standards of the best.
Overall the assessment showed that the UK’s
GDP per head was around the EU average but
18 per cent below the average for the G7
group of countries. Although the UK had a
relatively good performance on employment,
its productivity performance was
disappointing. Among the UK’s strengths
highlighted in the report were:
• improved prospects for economic stability;
• an economy open to international trade
and investment;
• a high proportion of people in work;
• a strong science base, with UK research
highly regarded around the world;
• good performance in some key
knowledge-intensive sectors (such as
aerospace, pharmaceuticals and the
creative industries); and
• a growing recognition by business of the
importance of information and
communications technology (ICT) and of
investing in ICT.
Areas identified as having scope for
improvement included innovation
performance, management skills, basic skills
(such as literacy and numeracy), and attitudes
to entrepreneurship.
Enterprise, Innovation and Business
Support
The DTI promotes enterprise and innovation
through encouraging successful business
start-ups and offering businesses a number of
support services. Most support is designed to
assist business, especially small and medium¬
sized enterprises (SMEs), to expand and
invest, and to adopt best practice.
390
23: THE ECONOMY
The Small Business Service (SBS), a new
DTI agency, was established in April 2000. Its
main tasks are to:
• act as a strong voice for small businesses
within government;
• simplify and improve government
support for small firms; and
• help small businesses deal with
regulation, and ensure that their interests
are considered in future regulations.
The SBS is responsible for the future
development of the ‘Business Link’ network
of local partnerships that are the main
mechanism for delivering business
information, advice and support in England.
The network brings together the business
support activities of many chambers of
commerce, enterprise agencies, training and
enterprise councils (see p. 149), and local
authorities to provide a single local point of
access for integrated information and advisory
services tailored to the needs of businesses. It
has nearly 1,000 personal business advisers
and specialist counsellors for export
development, design, and innovation and
technology. From April 2001 the SBS will
have a network of 45 local outlets.
In the March 2000 Budget the Government
announced a £60 million series of measures to
encourage SMEs to adopt information
technology (IT) and electronic commerce (‘e-
commerce’). This includes £20 million for the
SBS to develop a new business advice service,
which will be available on the Internet and by
telephone from April 2001.
Elsewhere in the UK similar business
support arrangements apply:
• in lowland Scotland, the new Small
Business Gateway offers a package of
measures designed to improve on the
quality and consistency of public sector
support for new and small businesses in
the Scottish Enterprise area, while
network of business support and front¬
line advice centres; and
• in Northern Ireland small firms are helped
by the Local Enterprise Development
Unit’s network of regional offices.
Queen’s Awards for Enterprise
1 he Queen’s Awards Scheme was originally
instituted in 1966 to recognise outstanding
performance by UK firms. Following a review
in 1999, the Scheme was renamed The
Queen’s Awards for Enterprise. Under the
first of the new Awards, announced in April
2000, 116 companies received Awards: 77 for
International Trade, 32 for Innovation and
seven for Environmental Achievement (see
picture section between pp. 488 and 489 for
some examples of Award winners). Awarded
annually, they are valid for five years and are
granted by the Queen on the advice of the
Prime Minister, who is assisted by an advisory
committee consisting of senior representatives
from business, trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in the UK with at least two full-time
employees is eligible to apply so long as it
meets the Scheme’s criteria. Winners are
entitled to display the Award Emblem on their
goods, packaging, advertising and letter
headings.
Business Finance
An Enterprise Fund has been established to
provide financial support for SMEs with
growth potential. It consists of three elements:
• the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme
which, by offering a government
guarantee against default by the
borrower, aims to encourage banks and
others to lend to people lacking security
or a business track record;
Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
through its Business Information Source,
operates equivalent services to those that
are available through the Small Business
Gateway;
• in Wales, Business Connect covers all the
main business support agencies and has a
• a UK High Technology Fund to make
investments in existing funds that
support growth businesses in the high-
technology sector; and
• Regional Venture Capital Funds to
provide smaller amounts of equity
finance to growth businesses.
391
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Other measures aimed at improving small
firms’ access to finance include:
• providing capital to new and existing
Community Finance Initiatives—these
are usually local non-profit-making
organisations that lend to people starting
and running businesses in disadvantaged
areas who cannot obtain bank loans;
• supporting the National Business Angels
Network to enable it to become the
national network through which SMEs
seeking smaller equity investments can be
put in touch with informal investors, or
‘business angels’;
• consulting on a range of options for
supporting new knowledge-based
businesses (which, as they may not have
tangible assets to support them, face
particular difficulties in obtaining bank
finance and are generally too young and
small to be of interest to venture
capitalists); and
• working to raise awareness of corporate
venturing.
These initiatives are being taken forward by
the Small Business Service with the support
and advice of a Small Business Investment
Taskforce composed of representatives of
banks and other finance providers,
accountancy bodies, academics and
representatives of small firms.
Information and Communications
Technology
The Government is keen to ensure that the
UK benefits fully from the rapid
developments in ICT, including the growth of
the Internet (see p. 377) and of‘e-commerce’.
Already, the UK leads the world in some
areas, such as digital terrestrial broadcasting
and the implementation of third generation
mobile telephone services. Around 1.7 million
SMEs are online, compared with 600,000 in
1999.
The Government’s e-commerce strategy is
to ensure that the UK is the best environment
in the world to do business electronically, and
that, by 2005, there will be universal access
within the UK, with everyone who wants it
having access to the Internet. The Office of
the ‘e-Envoy’ was set up to take forward this
strategy. Its work will include developing and
reviewing strategic thinking on e-commerce,
involving business in facing the challenges of
e-commerce, spreading the benefits
throughout society, ensuring e-Government,
promoting the UK’s e-commerce strategy
overseas and monitoring progress.
Public services are being modernised to
take advantage of the benefits of ICT.
More services, such as NHS Direct (see
p. 189), are being provided online. A
Cabinet Office Performance and
Innovation Unit study of public services,
launched in September 2000, is looking at
how to accelerate the electronic delivery of
better services. Government purchasing
arrangements are increasingly using
electronic means (see p. 403). The Office
of the e-Envoy’s e-Communications Team
(which is responsible for the strategy and
marketing of the Government’s online
presence, ‘UK online’) is working closely
with other government departments to
improve the design, access to, and
navigation around government websites. A
portal, or a single electronic point of
access, for government information and
services—ukonline.gov.uk—will be
launched in autumn 2000.
The DTI is working to ensure that all UK
businesses make the best use of ICT to
enhance their competitiveness. Some £60
million is being invested to encourage more
SMEs to connect to the Internet. This
includes £30 million to develop a secure
electronic interface linking government,
business and the public and an extra £10
million for the DTI’s UK online for business
initiative (previously known as the
Information Society Initiative), which is
providing businesses with practical advice and
training to enable them to exploit the
opportunities for doing business
electronically.
Substantial investment in education and
training is being undertaken to improve the
level of skills and give everyone the opportunity
392
23: THE ECONOMY
to obtain the skills required for ICT. The
Government is providing £1.7 billion for its
national IT strategy, including support from
the New Opportunities Fund (see p. 117).
Many schools already have access to the
Internet, and by 2002 all the UK’s 23,000
schools should be connected, with training in
computers available for 400,000 teachers. Up to
1,000 ICT learning centres are to be
established, and all schools, libraries, colleges
and universities are to be linked via the Internet
through the National Grid for Learning (see
p. 131) by 2002. The University for Industry
(see p. 140), to be launched in autumn 2000, is
creating a national online and distributed
learning network aimed at both individuals and
businesses. Its initial priorities are basic skills,
ICT skills, and business skills for SMEs.
The Electronic Communications Act 2000
has modernised the law to facilitate the
development of electronic trading. By giving
legal recognition to electronic signatures, it
allows electronic communications and storage as
a substitute for pen and paper. It also creates a
voluntary approvals system for businesses
providing electronic signature and similar
services, to ensure that messages remain
confidential and cannot be changed in transit.
The Act contains reserve powers for the
Government to introduce a statutory scheme if
self-regulation does not work satisfactorily.
The Government is promoting a co¬
ordinated approach to e-commerce in the
European Union. The EU is working towards
having a basic regulatory framework
governing e-commerce in place by the end of

reviewing barriers to competition in e-

and enhance competition.
Design
The Design Council, funded by the DTI, is
the UK’s national authority on design. It is an
independent organisation promoting the
effective use of design and design management
techniques for the creation of successful new
products, services, processes and
opportunities. The Design Council’s activities
are directed towards developing tools and
initiatives for business, education and
Millennium Bug
Action was taken to deal with the
‘Millennium Bug’, the potentially serious
problem primarily affecting some older IT
systems and electronic equipment when
the year changed from 1999 to 2000. A
report by the Cabinet Office,1 published in
April 2000, outlined the detailed planning
across the Government and the national
infrastructure, and found that no material
disruption occurred in the UK. Central
government spent some £380 million, and
over 300,000 critical systems were
checked. Some 39 per cent of expenditure
was by the Ministry of Defence, where 35
per cent of systems needed to be fixed and
18 per cent required major work. The
Government also spent £58 million on
‘Action 2000’, a company which raised
awareness and provided practical advice to
businesses. Action 2000 set up a National
Infrastructure Forum bringing together
the major providers of essential services to
share best practice. The Cabinet Office is
now taking into account the experience
obtained in tackling the Millennium Bug
in pursuing the reforms in the
‘Modernising Government’ programme
(see p. 57).
government to enhance their design practice.
It works with Business Links, Scottish
Design, the Welsh Design Advisory Service
and the Northern Ireland Design Directorate
on national initiatives.
From 2000 onwards one of its main
initiatives will be ‘Sharing Innovation’, a
nationwide programme that aims to help
organisations learn from each other. The
programme is based on the analysis of over
1,000 ‘Millennium Products’, an initiative
launched in 1997 which demonstrates the range
of innovative British products and services.
The Millennium Products and the stories
behind them are being featured in international
exhibitions during 2000 and 2001.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Quality and Standards
Quality is important throughout the business
cycle—design, production, marketing and
delivery to customers. Conformity assessment
is a key part of the quality infrastructure
encompassing certification of products,
processes, services and personnel to indicate
that they meet certain criteria, such as
standards and technical regulations.
Conformity assessment conducted by third-
party organisations can provide an impartial
assessment, which is given greater emphasis
when these bodies are themselves accredited
by an authoritative body. In the UK the
United Kingdom Accreditation Service is
recognised by the Government as the sole
national accreditation body, and companies
that use accredited conformity assessment
bodies in certain areas are entitled to use the
national accreditation mark—the ‘tick and
crown’.
The DTI is responsible for policy relating
to the National Measurement System, which
provides many of the measurement standards
and associated calibration facilities necessary
to ensure that measurements in the UK are
made on a common basis and to the required
accuracy in order to meet the needs of UK
business, innovation and science (see p. 435).
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the
national standards body and is independent of
the Government. It works with business,
consumers and the Government to produce
standards relevant to the needs of the market
and suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes. The Kitemark is BSFs
registered product certification trade mark.
Government support for BSI is directed
particularly towards European and
international standards, which account for
over 90 per cent of its work.
Regional Development
The Government’s regional policy is designed
to promote economic growth and
competitiveness in all areas of the UK,
working in partnership with businesses, local
authorities, voluntary groups and others. A
key element is the promotion of inward
investment (see p. 423). Where additional
help is needed, it is focused on the Assisted
Areas.
Regional Selective Assistance (RSA), the
main instrument of government support to
industry in the Assisted Areas in Great
Britain, is now focusing support more on
high-quality, knowledge-driven projects
providing skilled jobs. In 1999—2000 the DTI
offered an estimated £111 million on RSA
grants in England, covering 838 projects with
the expected creation or safeguarding of
around 35,270 jobs; total investment in the
projects is expected to be £1.2 billion. A new
Enterprise Grant scheme has been established
in England, with a budget of £45 million over
three years to provide grants to growing
SMEs investing in the Assisted Areas and
other specified areas with particular needs.
Following a review of the Assisted Areas, the
new areas took effect in July 2000, covering
some 16.5 million people in Great Britain as
well as the whole of Northern Ireland.
England
Nine new Regional Development Agencies
(RDAs) are now operating in England (see
also chapter 2), including the London
Development Agency, which was established
in July 2000. Their statutory purpose is to
further enhance economic development and
regeneration; to promote business efficiency,
investment, competitiveness and employment;
to enhance the development and application of
skills and to contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development. The eight RDAs
outside London have developed regional
economic strategies demonstrating how they
plan to improve regional economic
performance. The strategies include proposals
for regional activity to support business
clusters and networks, to promote enterprise
and growing SMEs, to encourage inward
investment, to develop business-university
links, and promote e-commerce. RDAs are
working with other bodies, such as the
Government Offices for the Regions,
chambers of commerce, the SBS and Business
Links.
394
23: THE ECONOMY
Financial support available to the RDAs to
stimulate development includes:
• a Competitiveness Development Fund,
providing £10 million over the three
years to 2002, for RDAs to address
priorities for improving business
competitiveness in their regions;
• an Innovation Clusters Fund to provide
support of £50 million in 2000-02 for the
development of business ‘clusters’—
businesses can benefit from shared
infrastructure and close links to training
and research institutions, and clusters
tend to be conducive to the creation and
development of small start-up firms;
• a Regional Innovation Fund providing
£115 million in 2001-04 for RDAs to
promote regional competitiveness,
including key innovative clusters,
innovation and economic development; and
• new regional venture capital funding (see
p. 391).
Scotland
In Scotland the Scottish Executive Enterprise
and Lifelong Learning Department, which has
overall responsibility for development of the
Scottish economy, operates a range of schemes
to support business. Emphasis is given to the
links between education and enterprise. Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise
are the lead economic development agencies in
lowland and highland Scotland respectively,
operating mainly through the network of
LECs (see p. 149). Their duties include:
• promoting industrial efficiency and
competitiveness;
• attracting inward investment and
encouraging exports;
• giving financial and management support
to new businesses and helping existing
ones to expand;
• improving the environment by
reclaiming derelict and contaminated
land; and
• increasing job opportunities and skills.
In February 2000 the Scottish Executive
launched a wide-ranging review on the future
of the enterprise networks, including their
structure, functions and activities. In June
2000 it published the first Framework for
Economic Development in Scotland. The
interim conclusions of the review of enterprise
networks were presented to the Scottish
Parliament in July 2000. A strategy on
enterprise is to be produced, while access to
business support services will be improved
through the new Small Business Gateway (see
p. 391) and local economic forums will be
developed to consider local needs within the
national framework.
Wales
The purposes of the Welsh Development
Agency (WDA—see p. 355) are to further
economic and social development, promote
efficiency in business and international
competitiveness, and improve the environment
of Wales. It is focusing on developing stronger
regional ‘clusters’ of firms, increasing standards
and efficiency, and helping Welsh companies to
exploit new technology. The WDA’s
programmes are being developed in line with A
Better Wales (see p. 31) and the new national
economic development strategy, due to be
issued in the first half of 2001. It is co¬
ordinating an Entrepreneurship Action Plan,
with the aim of fostering a stronger enterprise
culture in Wales; this is being linked to the
Enterprise Insight campaign (see p. 400).
In January 2000 the National Assembly for
Wales announced a major review of business
support and development programmes. The
review is considering their effectiveness, the
roles of the WDA and Business Connect, how
to achieve the maximum benefit from inward
investment, and proposals for a development
bank and the financial needs of new and
growing businesses. The Assembly is currently
setting up a development fund, to be called
Finance Wales (which is expected to be in
operation by December 2000), to offer
appropriate finance and management support
to SMEs in Wales.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland support for industrial
development is implemented through:
395
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• the Industrial Development Board,
which deals with overseas companies
considering Northern Ireland as an
investment location, as well as the
development of local companies with
more than 50 employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, which provides advice and
assistance on R&D, innovation and
technology transfer; and
• the Business Support Division of the
Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Investment, which helps with in¬
company training and management
development.
European Union Regional Funding
The EU seeks to promote economic and social
cohesion, reducing disparities between the
regions and countries of the Union. The
principal responsibility for helping poorer
areas remains with national authorities, but
the EU complements schemes, targeting the
worst affected areas through its Structural
Funds, including the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF), which support
regional competitiveness, training, economic
development and innovation.
The UK is due to receive over ^10 billion
from the Funds in 2000 to 2006. Funding will
support a range of projects, designed to
encourage businesses to grow, create suitable
conditions for inward investment and new
jobs, assist the most disadvantaged areas and
the socially excluded, and help people to learn
new skills.
The highest level of assistance is available
to areas with ‘Objective F status, where GDP
is less than 75 per cent of the EU average. In
the UK about £3 billion is allocated to four
Objective 1 areas: Cornwall, Merseyside,
South Yorkshire, and West Wales and the
Valleys. In recognition of the special position
of Northern Ireland and the structural
problems faced by the Highlands and Islands,
both of which used to have Objective 1 status,
they are eligible for special transition
packages, with funding levels broadly
equivalent to Objective 1 status.
Aid is also available to areas qualifying for
‘Objective 2’ status, which cover industrial
and urban areas in need of regeneration,
declining rural areas, and depressed areas
dependent on fisheries. About 13.8 million
people in the UK are in Objective 2 areas and
a further 6 million benefit from transitional
programmes.
Competitive Markets
The Government seeks to improve the
openness and effectiveness of markets, both
within the UK and internationally, and
believes that effective competition is the best
stimulus to innovation and efficiency.
Competition Act 1998
The Competition Act 1998, which came fully
into effect in March 2000, strengthened
competition law. It is modelled on EC
competition law and provides a strong
deterrent against anti-competitive practices
and agreements such as cartels, and against
abuse of a dominant market position. The Act
prohibits agreements, practices and conduct
which have a damaging effect on competition.
Where necessary, anti-competitive action can
be halted while detailed investigations are
made. The main enforcement authority is the
Director General of Fair Trading (head of the
Office of Fair Trading—OFT). The Act is
also enforced by the utility regulators in their
sectors. A company found to be infringing the
Act may be liable to a maximum penalty of up
to 10 per cent of its UK turnover for each year
of the infringement, up to a maximum of three
years. Competing firms and customers
adversely affected by anti-competitive
behaviour in breach of the law are entitled to
claim for damages in the courts.
Agreements do not fall within the scope of
the Act unless they have as their object or
effect an appreciable prevention, restriction or
distortion of competition. In general, an
agreement is unlikely to be considered as
having an appreciable effect if the combined
market share of the parties to the agreement is
396
23: THE ECONOMY
less than 25 per cent, unless it is one of a
network of agreements that have a cumulative
effect on the market concerned. Agreements
to fix prices, to impose minimum resale prices
or to share markets are generally seen as
capable of having an appreciable effect even
where the combined market share is below 25
per cent. In determining whether or not an
undertaking is in a dominant market position,
the OFT, as a general rule, is unlikely to
consider an undertaking as dominant if its
market share is under 40 per cent.
The Competition Commission, which
replaced the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC) in 1999, has two main
arms:
• a reporting arm, which took on the
existing investigatory functions on
monopolies and mergers previously
exercised by the MMC; and
• an Appeal Tribunals arm, which hears
appeals against decisions of the Director
General of Fair Trading and the
regulators on the prohibitions of anti¬
competitive agreements and abuse of a
dominant position.
Monopolies
The framework under the Fair Trading Act
1973 for dealing with scale and complex
monopolies2 has been retained alongside the
Competition Act. The Director General of
Fair Trading and those utility regulators
which have parallel powers to apply the
monopoly provisions of the 1973 Act may
examine such monopolies and make a
reference to the Competition Commission to
establish whether a monopoly operates, or
may be expected to operate, against the public
interest.
2 A scale monopoly situation exists where a single
company (or a group of interconnected companies)
supplies or acquires at least 25 per cent of the goods or
services of a particular type in all or part of the UK. A
complex monopoly situation exists where a group of
companies which are not connected and together account
for at least 25 per cent of the supply of, or acquisition of,
any particular description of goods or services in all or part
of the UK engage in conduct which has, or is likely to have,
the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition.
The Competition Commission’s report on
the supply of cars, published in April
2000, found that prices of new cars in the
UK had recently been about 10 to 12 per
cent higher than in similar European
countries-—France, Germany and Italy—
and that, after taking account of discounts
and other finance deals, private car buyers
were paying about 10 per cent too much
for a new car. A complex monopoly
situation operated in favour of 17
suppliers, each with 1 per cent or more of
the total supply of new cars in the UK.
The Commission recommended
substantial changes to the distribution of
new cars, especially in the relationship
between manufacturers and dealers. In
response to the report, the Government
introduced measures, which came into
force in September 2000, to bring more
competition to the supply of new cars and
so help reduce prices. It is also discussing
with the European Commission some of
the issues raised, as there is an EC block
exemption which permits many of the
practices criticised by the Competition
Commission.
Mergers
A merger generally qualifies for investigation
if it involves the acquisition of assets of more
than £10 million or the creation or
enhancement of a 25 per cent share of the
supply or acquisition of a particular good or
service in the UK or a substantial part of it.
Qualifying mergers are considered by the
Director General of Fair Trading, who then
advises the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry on whether the merger should be
referred to the Competition Commission.
There is a voluntary procedure for pre¬
notification of proposed mergers. In general,
the Secretary of State will make a reference to
the Competition Commission where the
merger raises competition concerns. In rare
cases a merger reference may be based on
other public interest issues. Alternatively, the
Secretary of State may ask the Director
General to obtain suitable undertakings from
397
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the companies involved to remedy the adverse
effects identified. Most mergers are cleared
without being referred to the Competition
Commission.
If the Competition Commission finds that a
merger could be expected to operate against
the public interest, the Secretary of State can
prohibit it, allow it, or allow it subject to
certain conditions being met. Where the
merger has already taken place, action can be
taken to reverse it. There are special
provisions for newspaper and water company
mergers.
In October 2000 the Goverment published
its response to the consultative document
issued in 1999 on reforming the regulation of
mergers. It confirmed that, as proposed in the
consultative document, it will reform the
system so that decisions will normally be taken
by the competition authorities against a
competition-based test. Ministers will only be
involved in making decisions in a small
minority of cases where specified exceptional
public interests, such as national security, are
at issue.
Certain mergers with an EC dimension,
assessed by reference to turnover, come under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the European
Commission. The Commission can ban
mergers if it concludes that they would create
or strengthen a dominant position which
would significantly impede effective
competition within the EU or a substantial
part of it; alternatively, it may negotiate
undertakings to correct the adverse effect.
Utility Competition and Regulation
The Government is reforming competition
and regulation among the privatised utilities,
with the aim of promoting the interests of
consumers and delivering further price
reductions. The Government expects the
Utilities Act 2000 to deliver these aims in the
electricity and gas industries (see p. 499);
changes are also being made to the regulatory
arrangements for the railways (see p. 367).
EU Single Market
The Government is working with the
European Commission and other member
states to ensure effective competition within
the single market. It is looking to improve the
functioning of the single market (see p. 420)
through wide-ranging economic reforms,
which target ‘weak areas’ (those areas where
the single market does not work as well as it
could) identified by the Commission. On the
transposition of EC legislation into UK law,
the Government is working towards meeting
its target of implementing 98 per cent of single
market measures by the end of 2000.
CORPORATE AFFAIRS
Corporate Structure
There are just over 1.5 million ‘live’ companies
registered in Great Britain with the Registrar of
Companies. Companies incorporated overseas
with a place of business or branch in Great
Britain must also register. Most corporate
businesses are ‘limited liability’ companies,
where the liability of members is restricted to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding (or to their guarantee where
companies are limited by guarantee). The
Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 will
allow firms the flexibility to incorporate with
limited liability while organising themselves as
partnerships; the legislation is likely to come
into force in early 2001.
Companies may be either public or private;
just over 15,000 are public limited companies
(pics). A company must satisfy certain
conditions before it can become a pic. It must
be limited by shares and meet specified
minimum capital requirements. Private
companies are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Company Law and Corporate
Governance
Company law is designed to meet the need for
proper regulation of business, to maintain
open markets and to create safeguards for
those wishing to invest in companies or do
business with them. It takes account of EC
Directives on company law, and on company
and group accounts and their auditing.
The DTI has initiated a fundamental
review of company law to produce a modern
398
23: THE ECONOMY
framework which encourages both
competitiveness and accountability. The
review is overseen by an independent steering
group of experts, which will present its final
report and recommendations to the
Government in spring 2001. In March 2000
the steering group issued its second strategic
consultative document. It contained proposals
on company governance (the main rules
governing the operation and control of
companies, including directors’ duties, the
role of shareholders in company governance,
and the accounting and reporting regime) for
reforming the law for private companies and
for a separate form of incorporation for
charitable companies.
The Government is proposing to improve
the arrangements for company insolvency.
Under the Insolvency Bill now before
Parliament, small firms in short-term financial
difficulties would be given time to produce a
rescue plan for their creditors without fear of
legal action, and the process of disqualifying
unfit company directors would be speeded up.
In April 2000 the Government announced
proposals to modernise the law on bankruptcy,
to distinguish between the dishonest and those
who fail to save their business for reasons
beyond their control (such as insufficient
funds) despite their best efforts; for the large
majority of bankrupts whose failure is honest,
a much earlier discharge from bankruptcy is
envisaged.
Regulation of Business
In its Modernising Government White Paper,
issued in 1999 (see p. 57), the Government
announced a new policy on removing
unnecessary regulation. The proposed
Regulatory Reform Bill would provide a new
mechanism for reforming regulatory regimes
affecting business and other sectors. The
Cabinet Office’s Regulatory Impact Unit
ensures that all proposals for regulations are
fully assessed before their introduction and that
the benefits justify the costs. Each government
department has a minister responsible for its
regulatory reform programme, and these
ministers are called to account by the Panel for
Regulatory Accountability, which is chaired by
the Minister for the Cabinet Office. An
The Government believes that greater
business involvement in corporate social
responsibility (CSR) can make an
important contribution to addressing social
problems, can help to tackle deprivation
and promote a fairer, more inclusive
society. Some businesses have found that
greater involvement in CSR can be linked
to improved competitiveness. Many
government departments are engaged in
work to promote CSR. In March 2000 one
of the DTI’s ministers was given
additional responsibilities for work across
government to promote Corporate Social
Responsibility, help make the business
case for CSR; and co-ordinate activity
across the Government to promote CSR.
independent Better Regulation Task Force
advises the Government on action to improve
the effectiveness and quality of existing
regulations, while making sure that they
remain necessary, are fair, affordable, and
simple to understand and administer.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is
the largest business organisation in the UK.
With a membership comprising companies and
trade associations, it directly and indirectly
represents some 200,000 firms which employ
some 7.5 million people. The CBI’s objective is
to help create and sustain the conditions in
which business can compete and prosper.
Examples of its work include lobbying to
minimise the burden of regulation and
campaigning to spread best practice. The CBI
also offers a wide range of advisory services,
including a series of regular surveys on the
outlook for the UK economy. It is the British
member of the Union of Industrial and
Employers’ Confederations (UNICE). In
addition to its London headquarters, the CBI
has 13 regional offices and an office in Brussels.
Chambers of commerce represent business
views to the Government at national and local
levels. They promote local economic
development, for example, through
399
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
regeneration projects, tourism, inward
investment promotion and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. The British
Chambers of Commerce represents about
120,000 businesses through 60 approved
chambers of commerce. It offers commercial
and export-related services to its members.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has around
53,000 members in the UK. It provides
business advisory services on matters affecting
company directors, such as corporate
management, insolvency and career counselling,
and represents the interests of members to
authorities in the UK and EU. In May 2000 it
announced a plan to provide business centres
for SMEs in over 20 UK cities; the first is
expected to open in Bristol in autumn 2000.
The Federation of Small Businesses is the
largest pressure group promoting the interests
of the self-employed and small firms. The
Federation has 155,000 members, and
provides them with expert information and
guidance on subjects such as taxation,
employment, health and safety, and insurance.
Enterprise Insight
Enterprise Insight is a new initiative
launched in 2000 to encourage more
entrepreneurial attitudes among young
people aged five to 30 and develop their
entrepreneurial skills. The initiative,
which is supported by the Government, is
led by a company owned jointly by the
British Chambers of Commerce, the
Institute of Directors and the
Confederation of British Industry. Up to
1,000 ‘ambassadors’ from business will
help to develop closer links between
schools and the business community.
Trade associations represent companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members in dealings with
government departments. For information on
trade associations and trade unions see
chapter 11.

Main Programmes 401 Main Sources of Revenue 406
Debt Management 405
The UK public sector is forecast to spend around £372 billion in 2000-01, about
39 per cent of national income. Plans for public expenditure to grow by 3‘A per
cent a year in real terms in the three years to 2003-04 were set out in the
Spending Review in July 2000. Above average rises in expenditure are planned in
the Government’s priority areas, including health, education, law and order,
transport, and tackling deprivation.
MAIN PROGRAMMES
The Spending Review (SR) 2000 rolled forward
the three-year planning cycle, established in the
Comprehensive Spending Review in 1998, and
set new departmental spending plans for
2002—03 and 2003—04. Current spending is
planned to grow by 2x/i per cent a year in real
terms, in line with the UK’s economic growth
rate, while net public sector investment is
expected to rise to 1.8 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP) by 2003-04.
The Government is allocating more to key
public services (see p. 402), reflecting the
relatively low growth in social security
spending and tax credits (one of the main
elements of public expenditure) and the lower
cost of interest payments on government debt.
For the first time the SR was conducted on
a resource budgeting basis (see p. 404), taking
account of all the resources used by
departments. A feature was the holding of 15
cross-departmental reviews in issues involving
more than one department (such as
government intervention in deprived areas,
crime reduction and illegal drugs). These
identified ways of improving
interdepartmental co-operation and
co-ordination.
The main categories of expenditure are
shown in the chart on p. 403. Social security is
the biggest single element, involving
expenditure of £103 billion (nearly 28 per cent
of spending) in 2000-01, followed by spending
on the National Health Service (NHS) of £54
billion and on education of £46 billion.
Local authorities are estimated to spend
about £86.7 billion in 2000-01, around a
quarter of public expenditure. The main
categories of expenditure are education, law
and order, personal social services, housing
and other environmental services, and roads

Key Government Priorities
Significant improvements in key public
services are planned in areas including:
• education, where expenditure will rise
by 5.4 per cent a year on average in real
terms over the next three years with
the aim of modernising schools and
improving attainment in literacy,
numeracy, science, and information
and communications technology;
• health, where there is provision for
average annual real growth in spending
of 6.1 per cent over the four years from
1999-2000, which is intended to help
to reform and modernise the National
Health Service and implement the
NHS Plan (see p. 184), also announced
in July 2000;
• transport, where substantially higher
investment is envisaged to implement
the first stage of the ten-year plan (see
chapter 22);
• law and order, which will see an
average annual increase in spending on
the police of 3.8 per cent in real terms
over the next three years;
• deprived areas, where a new strategy
will be adopted to tackle the problems
experienced by these areas and a
Neighbourhood Renewal Fund will be
established (see chapter 21); and
• science, where a £1 billion Science
Research Investment Fund, in
partnership with the Wellcome Trust,
will renew outdated science laboratories
and equipment (see chapter 26).

The auction of five licences allowing
spectrum use by third generation mobile
telephone companies (see p. 379) will raise
£22.5 billion, substantially more than
originally expected. The Government has
indicated that the proceeds, representing
about £1 billion a year over the life of the
licences, will be used to reduce net
government debt.
Control of Spending
1 he main concept in the measurement of
public expenditure is Total Managed
Expenditure (see Table 24.2). Within this
concept, current and capital expenditure are
planned and managed separately. Around half
of 1 otal Managed Expenditure is managed
through Departmental Expenditure Limits,
involving a tightly drawn control figure for
each department. The other half is Annually
Managed Expenditure, covering expenditure
such as social security benefit payments, which
cannot reasonably be subject to limits covering
more than one year. However, this type of
expenditure is subject to rigorous scrutiny each
year as part of the Budget process.
Other reforms have been introduced with
the aim of improving the effectiveness of
public spending. In connection with the SR
2000, departments have prepared new public
service agreements (PSAs), listing specific
targets for improving service delivery and
departmental efficiency. Departmental
performance against the targets is scrutinised
by a Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
supported by a Public Services Productivity
Panel of experts from outside government.
From autumn 2000 new service delivery
agreements will be set for every government
The Office of Government Commerce
(OGC) was established as an office of HM
Treasury in April 2000. It aims to work
with civil departments, agencies and non-
departmental public bodies as a catalyst to
achieve best value for money in their
commercial activities; these activities
involve annual expenditure of around £13
billion. The OGC’s current activities
include development of best practice, the
management of strategic suppliers, wider
use of‘e-procurement’, improving the
management of major projects, and raising
the professionalism and skills of the
Government’s staff involved in
procurement and projects.

department, setting out how the PSAs will be
delivered. Each department has produced its
own investment strategy, to demonstrate that
capital investment is being used efficiently and
effectively. These strategies are taken into
account in the allocation of resources from the
Capital Modernisation Fund.
Government Accounts
Under the Government Resources and
Accounts Act 2000, new ‘resource accounting’
and budgeting procedures are being adopted,
applying the financial reporting practices of
the private sector and much of the rest of the
public sector to government departments’
accounts, Estimates and Budgets. The changes
are designed to improve efficiency and focus
more on departmental objectives and outputs
in terms of resources used rather than the
money available for spending. Eventually the
principles of the new system will be applied to
the consolidated accounts covering the whole
public sector. The 2000 Spending Review was
conducted on the new resource basis.
Examination of Public Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the activities of
particular government departments and
question ministers and officials. The Public
Accounts Committee considers the accounts of
government departments, executive agencies
and other public sector bodies, and reports by
the Comptroller and Auditor General on
departments and their use of resources.
Audit of the Government’s spending is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of
the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO’s
responsibilities include certifying the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies, and those of a wide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinising the efficiency
and effectiveness of their operations; examining
revenue accounts and inventories; and
reporting the results of these examinations to
Parliament. In February 2000 the Government
announced a review of central government
audit arrangements, taking account of factors
404
24: PUBLIC FINANCE
including the ‘Modernising Government’
programme (see p. 57), the implications of
devolution and the relationship with other
audit and regulatory bodies.
Public-Private Partnerships
The Government sees Public-Private
Partnerships as a key factor in the delivery of
high-quality public services, by bringing in
private sector management, finance and
ownership with the intention of improving the
value for money, efficiency and quality of these
services. The partnerships cover a variety of
arrangements, including joint ventures;
outsourcing; the sale of equity stakes in
government-owned businesses; and the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI), in which the public
sector specifies, in terms of the outputs
required, the service needed, and private sector
companies compete to meet the requirements.
In March 2000 the Government issued
Public Private Partnerships: The Government’s
Approach, its strategy for increasing
investment in the public sector. The
Government expects that this will involve a
£20 billion expansion of the partnerships over
the next three years, bringing to £32 billion
the level of capital investment allocated since
mid-1997. Capital investment will be
concentrated on the Government’s priority
areas of health, education and transport.
Existing projects in progress include the
Channel Tunnel Rail Link and 35 major
hospital projects. Additional projects
envisaged include:
• a scheme to modernise the London
Underground (see p. 370), in which
private sector partners will become
responsible for the infrastructure and
undertake some £8 billion of investment
over a 15-year period;
• the sale of 51 per cent of the National Air
Traffic Services (see p. 375) to the
private sector through a flotation or trade
sale, with the new company taking
responsibility for an estimated £1 billion
modernisation programme;
• a new partnership for the Defence
Evaluation and Research Agency (see
p. 435), involving the transfer of around
three-quarters of the current Agency to a
new company which would eventually be
sold;
• over 60 new education projects;
• 25 new health projects; and
• 12 other transport projects.
In June 2000 Partnerships UK was set up
to help the public sector to build more
effective partnerships with the private sector.
It is building on the work previously carried
out by a task force within HM Treasury and,
in due course, will itself become a public-
private partnership, as a joint venture, with
the public sector owning a majority stake and
the private sector having a minority interest.
DEBT MANAGEMENT
The Government finances its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private
sector. At the end of March 2000 public sector
net debt was £339 billion, 36.6 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP), compared
with 39.6 per cent at the end of March 1999
and it has been falling since 1996-97 (see chart
on p. 406). Significant repayments of
borrowing contributed to the fall in the net
debt ratio in 1999—2000 when there was a net
repayment of £17.3 billion.
The Government’s debt management
policy is to minimise the cost of meeting its
financing needs over the long term, taking risk
into account. Major changes in the
management of government debt have been
implemented, w ith the transfer of government
responsibility for debt and cash management
from the Bank of England to HM Treasury.
Responsibility now rests w ith a Treasury
agency, the United Kingdom Debt
Management Office (DMO).
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument, government
bonds, is known as gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’) as
there is no risk of default. Gilts are widely
traded, with pension funds and life assurance
companies having the largest holdings. The
annual Debt Management Report sets out the
framework for issuing gilts in the coming year.
405
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS

Percentage of Gross Domestic
Product, UK
Per cent of GDP

Gilt issues are primarily by auction. This
used to be broadly monthly, but the frequency
has been reduced, reflecting lower government
borrowing. Gilts include ‘conventionals’, which
generally pay fixed rates of interest and
redemption sums; and index-linked stocks, on
which principal and interest are linked to
movements in the Retail Prices Index. At the
end of March 2000 holdings of marketable gilts
were estimated at £283 billion: over £217
billion of conventional gilts and £66 billion of
index-linked gilts. The DMO is continuing
with a series of reforms designed to improve
the efficiency of the gilts market.
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
Government revenue is forecast to be £376
billion in 2000-01. The main sources of
revenue (see chart on p. 403) are:
• taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue
tax;1
1 The windfall tax, a one-off tax on the excess profits of the
privatised utilities, was levied in 1997, but collected in two
equal parts in 1997 and 1998, bringing in some £5.2 billion
which financed the Welfare-to-Work programme (see
p. 151).
• taxes on capital, which include
inheritance tax, capital gains tax, council
tax and non-domestic rates;
• taxes on expenditure, which include
VAT (value added tax) and customs and
excise duties; and
• National Insurance contributions (see
chapter 12).
Taxation Policy
The primary aim of tax policy is to raise
sufficient revenue for the Government to pay
for the services that its policies require, and to
service its debt, while keeping the overall
burden of tax as low as possible. The
Government has based its tax policy on the
principles of encouraging work, raising
investment, and promoting fairness and
opportunity.
The March 2000 Budget included:
• action designed to increase productivity
and boost enterprise, including reforms
to capital gains tax (see p. 410) and steps
to support electronic commerce (see
p. 409);
• support for families and children,
including increases in the new tax credits
(see p. 408), and for pensioners (see
chapter 12); and
• measures to tackle climate change,
improve air quality, regenerate urban
areas and protect the countryside (see
chapter 19).
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects
taxes on income, profits and capital, and
stamp duty, and its Contributions Office is
responsible for collecting National Insurance
contributions. HM Customs and Excise
collects the most important taxes on
expenditure (VAT and most duties). Local
authorities collect the main local taxes, such as
council tax.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
system whereby tax is deducted and accounted

24: PUBLIC FINANCE
The Budget contained a package of
measures designed to improve incentives
for people to give to charity and to make
the tax system more suitable for charities
(see p. 115), including:
• abolition of the £250 minimum limit
on donations under the Gift Aid
scheme—in future, relief will apply
to any donations;
• abolition of the £1,200 maximum
limit on the Payroll Giving Scheme,
under which employees authorise
their employer to deduct charitable
donations from their earnings and
receive tax relief on the donation at
the highest rate of tax;
• encouraging the take-up of Payroll
Giving through a promotional
campaign and a 10 per cent
supplement, paid for by the
Government, on donations;
• a new tax relief on gifts of certain
shares and securities to charity; and
• measures to simplify and ease both
the administration and tax burdens of
charities.
for to the Inland Revenue by the employer, in
a way which enables most employees to pay
the correct amount of tax during the year.
Under the self-assessment system for
collecting personal taxation, over 8 million
people—primarily higher-rate taxpayers, the
self-employed and those receiving investment
income (particularly where this is paid without
tax being deducted)—are required to complete
an annual tax return for the Inland Revenue.
Taxpayers may calculate their own tax
liability, although they can choose to have the
calculations done by the Inland Revenue if
they return the form by the end of September.
Electronic transmission is already used to a
limited extent in the collection of taxes and
duties. To encourage greater use, in February
2000 the Government announced tax
discounts for electronic filing of tax returns
and payment of tax:
• individuals who file their tax returns over
the Internet in 2000-01 and pay
electronically any tax due will receive a
discount of £10; and
• from April 2001 small businesses that file
their VAT returns or PAYE end-of-year
returns over the Internet and pay
electronically the tax due will receive a
discount of £50, or £100 for both PAYE
and VAT.
The UK has agreements governing double
taxation with over 100 countries, the largest
network of tax treaties in the world. They are
intended to avoid double taxation arising, deal
with cross-border economic activity, and
prevent fiscal discrimination against UK
business interests overseas, and they include
provisions to counter tax avoidance and
evasion.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
In general, income tax is charged on all
income originating in the UK—although
some forms of income, such as child benefit,
are exempt—and on all income arising abroad
of people resident in the UK. Income tax is
imposed for the year of assessment beginning
on 6 April. The tax rates and bands for
1999—2000 and 2000-01 are shown in Table
24.3. Recent changes have included a new 10
per cent starting rate of income tax, which
took effect in April 1999, and a reduction in
the basic rate from 23 to 22 per cent from
April 2000, representing the lowest basic rate
for nearly 70 years. Of around 28 million
income taxpayers, 2.7 million are expected to
pay tax only at the starting rate of 10 per cent
in 2000—01, 21.4 million at 22 per cent and 2.7
million at 40 per cent, while 1.1 million
‘savers’ will have a marginal rate of 20 per cent
or 10 per cent.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an
individual’s income tax liability. All taxpayers
are entitled to a personal allowance against
income from all sources, with a higher
allowance for the elderly (see Table 24.3). One
of the most significant reliefs covers
employees’ contributions to their pension
schemes, which is designed to encourage
people to save towards their retirement.
407
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Informal Economy
According to a report to HM Treasury
published in March 2000, substantial sums
have been lost to the Exchequer from the
informal economy. For example, the
report estimated that 120,000 people were
working while claiming to be unemployed,
while other people concealed income or
sales in order to evade income tax and
VAT, and HM Customs and Excise has
estimated the loss of £2.5 billion a year of
revenue as a result of illegal smuggling
into the UK of tobacco.
The report recommended measures to
help people move into legitimate work,
prevent people joining the informal
economy (such as tightening the
registration requirements for those starting
up in business and for issuing National
Insurance numbers), improve the
detection of offenders, and increase the
effectiveness of punishment through, for
example, creating a new statutory offence
of fraudulent evasion of income tax, to be
tried in magistrates’ courts. The
Government has adopted a range of
measures designed to ensure that both
individuals and businesses pay their fair
share of taxes and duties. For example, in
March 2000 it announced a strategy to
tackle tobacco smuggling through
deploying extra Customs officers,
additional specialist investigators, X-ray
scanners to examine lorries and freight
containers, tougher penalties, and
introducing a public awareness
campaign.
Personal tax-free saving is also encouraged
through the Individual Savings Account (ISA)
(see p. 520).
In line with its policies of improving work
incentives, promoting a fair and efficient tax
system, and supporting families, the
Government is changing the system of
allowances and introducing a series of tax
credits. Mortgage interest relief, which used
to be 10 per cent on loans used for house
purchase up to a limit of £30,000, was
withdrawn in April 2000. Except for couples
where at least one of the spouses was aged 65
or over on 5 April 2000, the married couple’s
allowance was also abolished. It will be
replaced from April 2001 by a new Children’s
Tax Credit (CTC), which will provide an
allowance worth up to £442 a year to families
with one or more children under 16 living
with them. To target this on the most needy
families, the credit will gradually be
withdrawn where the person claiming the
credit is liable to tax at the higher rate. The
Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC)
replaced Family Credit in October 1999 (see
chapter 12) and is designed to provide a
guaranteed minimum income for working
families. From 2003 a new integrated child
credit will bring together the support for
children in the WFTC, the CTC and Income
Support. A new employment tax credit will
also be introduced in 2003, to extend the
principles of the WFTC to people without
children.
Corporation Tax
The UK rate of corporation tax, payable by
companies on their income and capital gains,
is the lowest among major industrial countries.
The main rate of tax is 30 per cent. A reduced
rate of 20 per cent is levied on small
companies (those with profits below £300,000
in a year), and from 2000-01 a new starting
rate of 10 per cent will apply to the smallest
firms (those with annual profits of up to
£10,000). Marginal relief is allowed for
companies with profits between £300,000 and
£1.5 million, so that their overall average rate
is between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate, and from 2000-01 similar
marginal relief will apply to firms with profits
between £10,000 and £50,000.
Some capital expenditure—on machinery
and plant, industrial buildings, agricultural
buildings and scientific research, for
example—may qualify for relief in the form of
capital allowances. To boost investment in
manufacturing and services, the Government
has made permanent the 40 per cent first-year
allowance, which had been due to expire in
July 2000, for expenditure on machinery or
plant by small or medium-sized businesses. In
addition, to encourage more companies to

in April 2000, benefiting small and medium¬
sized firms by reducing the cost of R&D.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT), deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production—as
opposed, for example, to the refining—of oil
and gas in the UK and on its Continental
Shelf under licence from the Department of
Trade and Industry. Each licensee of an
oilfield or gasfield is charged at a rate of 50 per
cent on the profits from that field after
deduction of certain allowances and reliefs.
New fields given consent for development on
or after 16 March 1993 are not liable to PRT.
Taxes on Capital
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by
individuals and trusts on gains realised from
the disposal of assets. It is payable on the
409
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
amount by which total chargeable gains for a
year exceed the exempt amount (£7,200 for
individuals and £3,600 for most trusts in
2000-01). Gains on some types of asset are
exempt from CGT, including the principal
private residence, government securities,
certain corporate bonds, and gains on holdings
of Personal Equity Plans and ISAs. For
individuals, CGT in 2000-01 will be payable
at 10, 20 or 40 per cent, according to a
person’s marginal income tax rate.
CGT taper relief, introduced in 1998 to
succeed the previous system of indexation relief
to take account of inflation, reduces the amount
of the chargeable gain depending on how long
an asset has been held. For a business asset the
percentage of the gain that is chargeable is
reduced from 100 per cent for assets held for
less than one year to 25 per cent for assets held
for ten years or more. For non-business assets
the chargeable gain falls from 100 per cent for
assets held for less than three years to 60 per
cent for assets held for ten years or longer.
In the March 2000 Budget the Government
announced changes to the CGT taper relief
with the intention of boosting productivity,
stimulating employee share ownership, and
encouraging outside ‘business angel’ investors
to provide risk capital for growing companies.
The holding period for relief for business
assets will be reduced from ten years to four
years, and the definition of business assets will
be extended by reducing current qualifying
thresholds. All shareholdings in unquoted
trading companies (companies which have no
shares or securities listed on a recognised stock
exchange) will qualify for the business assets
taper, while in quoted companies all employee
shareholdings will qualify, as will
shareholdings held by outside investors above
a 5 per cent threshold.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is charged on estates at the
time of death and on gifts made within seven
years of death; most other lifetime transfers
are not taxed. There are several important
exemptions, including transfers between
spouses, and gifts and bequests to UK
charities, major political parties and heritage
bodies. In general, business assets and
farmland are exempt from inheritance tax, so
that most family businesses can be passed on
without a tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40 per
cent above a threshold: £234,000 in 2000—01.
Only about 4 per cent of estates a year become
liable for an inheritance tax bill.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax (VAT)
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax,
which is collected at each stage in the
production and distribution of goods and
services. The final tax is payable by the
consumer. The standard rate is 17.5 per cent,
with a reduced rate of 5 per cent on domestic
fuel and power, on the installation of energy¬
saving materials in homes and, from 1 January
2001, on women’s sanitary products.
The annual level of turnover above which
traders must register for VAT was raised to
£52,000 from April 2000. Certain goods and
services are relieved from VAT, either by being
charged at a zero rate or by being exempt.
• Under zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but reclaims
any VAT paid to suppliers. Among the
main categories where zero rating applies
are goods exported to other countries;
most food; water and sewerage for non¬
business use; domestic and international
passenger transport; books, newspapers
and periodicals; construction of new
residential buildings; young children’s
clothing and footwear; drugs and
medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people;
and certain supplies by or to charities.
• For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any VAT but is
not entitled to reclaim the VAT on goods
and services bought for his or her
business. The main categories where
exemption applies are many supplies of
land and buildings; financial services;
postal services; betting; gaming (with
certain important exceptions); lotteries;
much education and training; and health
and welfare.

24: PUBLIC FINANCE
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EU in accordance with its
Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise duty and
VAT are charged in the member state of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Mineral oils used as road fuel are subject to
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes, although there are reduced rates to
encourage the use of more environmentally
friendly fuels, such as ultra low sulphur
petrol, ultra low sulphur diesel, and gas used
as road fuel. Kerosene not used as road or
motor fuel, most lubricating oils and oils used
for certain industrial, horticultural and marine
uses are free of duty or attract very low rates.
Fuel substitutes are taxed at the same rate as
the corresponding mineral oil.
The annual vehicle excise duty (VED) on a
privately owned motor car, light van or taxi is
£155, with a lower rate of £100 for small cars
with engines up to 1,100 cc. From March
2001 the rates will be £160 and £105
respectively, with the latter applying to cars
with engines up to and including 1,200 cc. A
graduated VED system will apply to new cars,
with four VED bands according to the rate of
carbon dioxide emissions and a discount of
£10 within each band for cars using cleaner
fuels and technology. The Government is also
reforming from April 2002 company car
taxation with the intention of helping to
protect the environment, for example, by
removing incentives to drive extra miles on
business.
The VED on goods vehicles is levied on the
basis of gross weight and, if over 12 tonnes,
according to the number of axles. The March
2000 Budget contained a series of cuts in VED
on certain lorry weights, with the intention of
boosting the competitiveness of the UK road
haulage industry. Duty on taxis and buses
varies according to seating capacity, and duty
on motorcycles according to engine capacity.
Cigarette duty is charged partly as a cash
amount per cigarette and partly as a percentage
of retail price. Duty on other tobacco products
is based on weight. In the Government’s view,
there is a strong case for annual increases in
tobacco duty in real terms. It has decided that
the extra revenue raised from such increases will
be allocated for NHS expenditure.
Duties are levied on spirits, beer, wine,
cider and other alcoholic drinks according to
alcoholic strength and volume. Spirits used for
scientific, medical, research and industrial
processes are generally free of duty.
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
amusement machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. HM Customs
and Excise is reviewing general betting duty
levied on bets placed with off-course
bookmakers, in the light of the rapid growth of
offshore bookmakers offering services over the
Internet and telephone. On the National
Lottery (see p. 117) there is a 12 per cent duty
on gross stakes, but no tax on winnings.
Insurance premium tax is levied on most
general insurance at a rate of 5 per cent, with a
higher rate of 17.5 per cent on travel insurance
and on insurance sold by suppliers of cars and
domestic appliances.
Air passenger duty is charged at £10 for
flights to internal destinations and to those in
the European Economic Area (EEA) and £20
elsewhere. A new structure will take effect
from April 2001, introducing a differential
between standard and economy flights, so
that, for example, the duty on economy flights
to EEA countries will be reduced to £5. The
duty on flights from airports in the Highlands
and Islands of Scotland will be removed in
recognition of their remoteness and
dependence on air travel.
A landfill tax is levied at £11 a tonne, and
this will rise by £1 a tonne each year until 2004
when it will be reviewed; a lower rate of £2 a
tonne applies for inert waste. The Government
has decided to introduce from April 2002 an
aggregates levy of £1.60 a tonne on the
extraction of sand, gravel and crushed rock.
The climate change levy will be introduced
in April 2001. It will apply to sales of
electricity, gas, coal and liquefied petroleum
gas to the business and public sectors. It is
411
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
designed to improve energy efficiency in, and
decrease carbon emissions from, these sectors.
Revenues from the levy will be recycled back
to business through a reduction in employers’
National Insurance contributions and
additional support for energy efficiency
measures (see chapter 29).
Stamp Duty
Some transfers are subject to stamp duty.
Transfers of shares generally attract duty at
0.5 per cent of the cost, while certain types of
document, such as declarations of trust,
generally attract a small fixed duty of £5.
Transfers by gift and transfers to charities are
exempt. Recent Budgets have raised the rate
of stamp duty on the transfers of land and
property worth over £250,000. Duty on land
and property is now payable at 1 per cent of
the total price when above £60,000, 3 per
cent above £250,000 and 4 per cent over
£500,000.
Other Revenue
National Insurance Contributions
Details of the five classes of National
Insurance contribution and the rates of
contribution are given in chapter 12 on
p. 171.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
central government; council tax; non-domestic
rates (sometimes known as business rates); and
sales, fees and charges. About 75 per cent of
expenditure (excluding sales, fees and charges)
is financed by government grants and
redistributed non-domestic rates.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years. The non-domestic rate is set
nationally by the central bodies in England,
Wales and Scotland, and collected by local
authorities. It is paid into a national pool and
redistributed to local authorities in proportion
to their population.
Domestic property in Great Britain is
generally subject to the council tax. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value (the amount it
might have sold for on the open market) in April
1991. Discounts are available for dwellings with
fewer than two resident adults, and those on low
incomes may receive council tax benefit of up to
100 per cent of the tax bill (see p. 178).
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes based on the value of the
property—are collected by local authorities.

Balance of Payments 413 Government Services 424
International Trade Policy 420
Trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for hundreds of years.
Although it has less than 1 per cent of the world’s population, the UK is the fifth
largest trading nation, accounting for around 5.6 per cent of world trade in goods and
services in 1998. As one of 15 member states of the European Union (EU), the world’s
largest established trading group, 53 per cent of the UK’s trade in goods and services
in 1999 was with fellow EU members. The UK has a higher degree of inward and
outward investment than any of the other G7 economies, relative to gross domestic
product (GDP), and was second only to the United States as a destination for
international direct investment in 1998. Within the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), the UK is calling for a new round of negotiations aimed at lowering tariffs,
eliminating non-tariff barriers and liberalising world markets, as well as supporting
work on international competition policy principles and investment liberalisation in
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The UK exports more per head than the United
States and Japan. Its sales abroad of goods and
services were just over 20 per cent of gross final
expenditure in 1999. Receipts from trade in
services (such as financial services, business
services, travel, transport and communications)
and investment income make up about half of
total British external earnings, and the UK
consistently runs large surpluses on these
accounts. The UK was the world’s second
biggest foreign investor in 1998 and UK direct
investment abroad significantly exceeds direct
investment in the UK.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The United Kingdom balance of payments
measures the economic transactions between
UK residents and the rest of the world. It also
draws a series of balances between inward and
outward transactions, provides an overall net
flow of transactions between UK residents and
the rest of the world, and reports how that flow
is funded. Economic transactions include:
• exports and imports of goods, such as oil,
agricultural products, other raw
materials, machinery and transport
equipment, computers, white goods,
such as refrigerators and washing
machines, and clothing;
• exports and imports of services, such as
international transport, travel, financial
and business services;
• income flows, such as dividends and
interest earned by non-residents on
investments in the UK and by the UK
investing abroad;
413
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• financial flows, such as investment in
shares, debt securities, loans and
deposits; and
• transfers, such as payments to, and
receipts from, EU institutions, foreign aid
and funds brought by migrants to the UK.
The balance of payments classification
comprises the following groups of accounts:
• the current account, which comprises
trade in goods and services, income
(compensation of employees and
investment income) and current
transfers;
• the capital account, which comprises
capital transfers and the acquisition and
disposal of non-produced, non-financial
assets (such as copyrights);
• the financial account, which covers direct,
portfolio and other investment and
reserve assets; and
• the international investment position,
which measures the UK’s stock of
external financial assets and liabilities.
Table 25.1 summarises the UK’s balance of
payments position over recent years. In 1999
the current account moved into deficit, at
£11.0 billion, the highest since 1990,
compared with a very small deficit of £0.1
billion in 1998. There were sharp
deteriorations in both the deficit on goods and
services and in the surplus on income. The
capital account surplus rose from £473 million
in 1998 to £776 million in 1999.
Trade in Goods and Services
Table 25.2 summarises the UK’s trade in
goods and services over recent years. More
detailed analyses for 1999 can be found in
subsequent tables. In 1999, exports of UK
goods amounted to £165.7 billion and imports
£192.4 billion, giving a deficit on trade in
goods of £26.8 billion, up from £20.5 billion
in 1998 and the largest deficit on record. The
trade in services surplus in 1999 of £11.5
billion was slightly lower than the record
£12.6 billion achieved in 1998.
Commodity Composition
UK exports of goods are dominated by
manufactures—finished manufactures and
semi-manufactured goods. In 1970 they
accounted for 84 per cent of UK exports of
goods. Although the advent of North Sea oil
meant their share declined in the 1970s, they
have subsequently recovered and by 1999
stood at 86 per cent of goods (see Table 25.3).
Historically the UK was an importer of
foods and basic materials. However, over the
last 30 years, imports of manufactures have
grown rapidly. Between 1970 and 1999 the
share of finished manufactures in total imports
rose from 25 per cent to 61 per cent, while the
share of basic materials fell from 15 per cent to
just 3 per cent. The percentage of food,
beverages and tobacco has been dropping
since the 1950s, down to under 9 per cent in
1999. The UK has not had a surplus on
manufactured goods since 1982.

85 per cent of UK exports were to other
OECD countries, and over 82 per cent of
imports came from the same countries. The
proportion of export trade with the European
Union was almost 59 per cent, while imports
from the EU accounted for around 54 per cent
of the total. Western Europe as a whole took
almost 63 per cent of UK exports in 1999.
EU countries accounted for eight of the
UK’s top ten export markets in 1999—the
United States and Japan took the other two
places—and seven of the top ten leading
suppliers of goods to the UK (see Table 25.5);
the other three places were taken by the
United States, Japan and Switzerland. The
United States maintained its position as the
UK’s largest external market for the third year
running and was again the UK’s second
largest single supplier, with Germany the
largest supplier. Total exports were little
changed from the level seen in 1998, although
they were around 12 per cent higher to both the
United States and the Irish Republic, and
almost 9 per cent higher to Belgium and
Luxembourg. Within the EU, however, UK
exports to Italy fell by almost 10 per cent and
were over 1 per cent lower to Germany. In
South East Asia, growth in 1999 was strong, but
export levels were still below those seen in 1997.
Services
There has been a surplus recorded for trade in
services every year since 1966. In 1999 this
was £11.5 billion (see Table 25.6), slightly
down on the £12.6 billion surplus achieved in
1998. Exports of services grew by 4.2 per cent
to £64.0 billion in 1999, with particularly
strong growth in insurance, computer and
information services, and communications.
Imports of services grew by 7.5 per cent to
£52.4 billion, with exceptionally strong
growth in the government sector and, to a
lesser degree, in financial services,
communications, and travel.
Income and Transfers
Earnings on UK investment assets overseas
fell marginally to £108.1 billion in 1999, while
debits (earnings of foreign-owned assets in the
UK) increased by 6.2 per cent to £100.0
billion, giving a surplus of £8.1 billion (see
Table 25.7), down significantly on the record
surplus of £14.3 billion in 1998. The surplus
on direct investment income of £11.5 billion,
down £8.8 billion from the record £20.3
billion surplus in 1998, was partly offset by a
deficit of £4.7 billion on other investment
income, the lowest since 1990. Earnings on
reserve assets in 1999 at £1.2 billion were little
changed from 1998. The deficit on current
transfers fell from £6.4 billion in 1998 to
£4.1 billion in 1999.
Financial Account and International
Investment Position
The financial account (see Table 25.8) shows
that UK direct investment abroad was £125.3
billion in 1999, and foreign direct investment
in the UK was £52.3 billion. These levels

represent very significant growth over 1998

many of these deals were financed by the issue
of equity to the original shareholders of the
foreign companies, resulting in a significant
rise in portfolio investment in the UK—up
from £17.9 billion in 1998 to a record £115.6

investment in the UK fell sharply from
£63.4 billion to £18.1 billion. Reserve assets
decreased slightly by £0.6 billion in 1999.
Table 25.9 shows the UK’s international
investment position. At the end of 1999, direct
investment in the UK stood at £243.1 billion,
while direct investment abroad amounted to
£418.5 billion, giving a net balance of £175.4
billion. Inward portfolio investment stood at
£882.9 billion, while the stock of UK portfolio
investment abroad amounted to £771.6
billion. In total, UK external liabilities
exceeded assets by £148.3 billion.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY
Government policy is to promote open world
markets in goods and services and the further
liberalisation of international direct
investment, and to improve the transparency
of international trade agreements and the
World Trade Organisation (WTO). The UK
plays an active role in achieving these
objectives through work in the WTO, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
OECD, as well as the EU.
European Union
The promotion of the Single European
Market (SEM) (see p. 79) has been one of the
key policies of the European Union. Although
progress has been made in abolishing barriers
to trade, the Government’s view is that
further reform is needed in several important
areas, including utilities, public procurement,
state aid, and financial and other services.
This and the improvement in the level of
transposition and enforcement of single
market legislation across the EU remain the
UK’s priorities. The Government is
continuing to work with other EU member
states and the European Commission to make
the SEM a top priority within the EU’s
economic policy. The framework for its
development over the next five years is set out
in the Commission’s Strategy for the Internal
Market, which aims to make the SEM work
more effectively. The EU’s approach in this
area is based on four strategic objectives:
• improving the quality of life of citizens;
• enhancing the efficiency of EU product
and capital markets;
420
25: INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT
• improving the business environment; and
• exploiting the achievements of the single
market in a changing world.
In December 1997 the Commission’s
‘Single Market Scoreboard’ publication was
introduced. This shows progress in
implementing single market measures across
the EU. Areas already identified in which the
SEM could operate more strongly include
financial services, public procurement and
mutual recognition of standards. The
Government is promoting a process of
economic reform in the EU, with the goal of
further improvements in productivity,
investment and growth. It is also promoting
the principles of competitiveness and the
economic reform agenda to the EU applicant
countries. Through the agreements each
applicant has with the EU, these countries
already enjoy many of the benefits of the
single market in industrial goods, and the
Government is working to ensure that by the
time of entry each country has adopted the
measures required of EU membership, and
has the necessary administrative
infrastructure.
The Treasury’s Euro Preparations Unit is
helping British business adjust to the
introduction of the euro in 11 EU member
states (see p. 79).
World Trade Organisation
The level of industrial tariffs in developed
countries has fallen dramatically since 1948.
This is one of the main outcomes of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), which helped establish a multilateral
trading system through successive rounds of
trade negotiations. The eighth GATT Round
(the Uruguay Round) of 1986-94 led to the
formation of the World Trade Organisation
and a new set of agreements, including the
establishment of a dispute settlement system.
Although the WTO Ministerial Conference
in Seattle in November 1999 was unable to
reach agreement on the agenda and scope for
further multilateral trade negotiations, the UK
and its EU partners will continue to push for
the launch of a comprehensive round of trade
negotiations as soon as possible, with parallel
work on reform of WTO operations. The
Government, in partnership with UK
businesses, has identified a number of priority
areas for inclusion in such a round, including a
further substantial reduction of tariffs, the
removal of other barriers to trade, the
simplification of trade procedures and the
opening of global government procurement
markets.
The DTI monitors actions by third
countries which represent obstacles to UK
exports and seeks to resolve problems
bilaterally in conjunction with EU partners
and ultimately through the initiation of WTO
dispute settlement action. It seeks to ensure
that bilateral agreements between the EU and
third countries are established and
implemented in a way which secures open
markets. A similar approach is adopted in the
negotiations with countries seeking to join the
WTO, including the People’s Republic of
China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the Ukraine.
Relations with Other Countries
The UK places great importance on
developing strong relations with third
countries, in particular through the EU.
Examples include:
• the Transatlantic Economic Partnership
(TEP), where at the US/EU summit in
1998 the two partners agreed to reinforce
their close relationship. The TEP has led
to agreement on the establishment of an
early warning system to highlight
potential problems and prevent them
from becoming damaging trade disputes.
The private sector is fully involved in
this process through the Transatlantic
Business Dialogue;
• the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM),
which provides a forum for wide-ranging
dialogue between 25 Asian and European
countries together representing one-half
of global wealth. The challenge for
ASEM in the run-up to ‘ASEM 3’ in
Seoul in October 2000 is to reinforce the
pledge made at the London Leaders
Summit, ASEM 2, in April 1998 to
maintain open markets and reject
protectionist pressures and to secure
421
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
tangible improvements in the trade and
investment climate in the two regions.
Business input to the ASEM process is
provided via the Asia-Europe Business
Forum (AEBF), which meets annually—
its meeting in Vienna in September 2000
fed directly into ASEM 3 the following
month; and
• the DTI works closely with the
Department for International
Development (DFID) to ensure that
developing countries benefit more from,
and participate more fully in, the world
trade system. The EU is committed to
implementing duty- and quota-free access
for virtually all exports from the Least
Developed Countries no later than 2005.
Special Trading Arrangements
The multilateral trading system provides the
foundation for the EU’s common commercial
policy. However, the EU has preferential
trading arrangements with a number of
countries. These fall into three main categories:
• Those that prepare countries in Central
and Eastern Europe for possible EU
membership. Europe (Association)
Agreements (see p. 83) are designed to
facilitate closer political and economic
ties and the eventual liberalisation of
trade with a view to these countries
becoming full members of the EU.
• The EU has association and co-operation
agreements with virtually all non¬
member countries with a Mediterranean
coastline, plus Jordan. These provide for
the eventual setting up of a free trade
area between the EU and these countries
by 2010.
• Those that provide an economic
dimension to its assistance to former
dependent territories. Trade relations
with these countries (known as ACP
countries), which were formerly
beneficiaries of the Lome Convention,
are now governed by the EU/ACP
Partnership Agreement signed in
Cotonou, Benin, which gives them tariff-
free access, subject to certain safeguards,
to the EU for industrial and agricultural
products. The EU also operates a
Generalised System of Preferences which
is available to nearly all developing
countries and applies to industrial
products, including textiles and certain
(mainly processed) agricultural products.
New trade relationships with countries and
regions of Latin America are being pursued. A
free trade agreement with Mexico came into
force on 1 July 2000, and negotiations for new
agreements with the Mercosur regional
economic area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay) and Chile are under way.
Partnership and co-operation (non-
preferential) agreements have been concluded
with ten states of the former Soviet Union.
Non-preferential co-operation agreements
have also been made with countries in South
Asia and Latin America, as well as the
People’s Republic of China, the Association of
South East Asian Nations, the Andean Pact,
and the Central American States.
Controls on Trade
Import Controls
Following the completion of the Single
European Market, all national quantitative
restrictions have been abolished. However,
some EU-wide quotas have been imposed on a
small range of products from the People’s
Republic of China, while EU imports of some
steel products from Russia, the Ukraine and
Kazakhstan are also restricted. Quantitative
restrictions on textiles and clothing stem from
the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), under
which there is a series of bilateral agreements.
Some quotas are also maintained for imports
from non-WTO countries. The MFA
restrictions will be eliminated by 2005 as part
of the Uruguay Round agreement.
Imports from certain countries remain
subject to sanctions or embargo agreed by, for
example, the United Nations. Imports of
certain other goods from all countries are
prohibited or restricted in order to protect
human, animal or plant life and health. These
include firearms and ammunition; nuclear
materials; certain drugs; explosives;
endangered wildlife and derived products;
422
25: INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT
pornographic material; and certain
agricultural, horticultural and food products.
Strategic Export Controls
Strategic export controls apply to a range of
goods, components, spare parts and
technology, including military goods, arms,
ammunition and related materials, dual-use
goods that can be used for civil and military
purposes, nuclear-related goods and goods
that can be used in weapons of mass
destruction and their delivery systems. Some
exports and other activities are only controlled
where particular destinations are involved, for
example where EU or UN trade sanctions or
arms embargoes apply.
Strategic export controls are imposed for a
variety of reasons, for example irresponsible
transfers of arms, ammunition and related
material contribute to internal repression or
regional instability, while goods intended for
civil purposes can also contribute to the
development of weapons of mass destruction
and the missiles to deliver them. Controls are
also imposed to meet various international
commitments.
Licences to export arms and other goods
controlled for strategic reasons are issued by the
DTI acting through its Export Control
Organisation (ECO). All licence applications are
circulated to other departments with an interest,
as determined by them in line with their policy
responsibilities, including the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry of
Defence and DFID. The ECO is also the
licensing authority for applications to export
most goods and services controlled because of
trade sanctions imposed by the EU or UN.
A White Paper on Strategic Export Controls
published in 1998 contained proposals for new
primary legislation and would, among other
things, provide for parliamentary scrutiny of
secondary legislation, and introduce powers
enabling government to impose controls on
the transfer of technology by intangible means
and trafficking and brokering.
Inward and Outward Investment
The UK has an open economy, and there are
no restrictions on the outward flow of capital.
Outward investment helps develop markets
for UK exports while providing earnings in
the form of investment income (see p. 417).
Inward investment is promoted by Invest-UK
(formerly the Invest in Britain Bureau), which
reports jointly to the DTI and the FCO.
Invest-UK (see p. 425) assists overseas
companies with comprehensive arrangements
for locating, relocating or expanding business
anywhere within the UK. This inward
investment is seen as a means of introducing
new technology, products and management
styles to the UK, and creating or safeguarding
employment.
Inward Investment
The UK was ranked second in the world at
attracting inward investment according to the
latest (1999) United Nations World
Investment Report. About 33 per cent of new
investment comes from companies that
already have a UK presence. North America
continues to be the largest source of inward
investment. Britain is the premier inward
investment location in Europe and inward
investment is a significant contributor to the
economy. It attracted 29 per cent of all inward
investment into the EU in 1998, and overseas
businesses investing in Britain generate an
estimated 40 per cent of UK exports. There
are nearly 18,000 foreign investors in the UK,
including 5,000 from the United States.
Inward investment into the UK has
reached record levels, according to Invest-UK.
In the year to March 2000, 757 inward
investment projects were reported from 30
countries, creating 52,783 jobs. The largest
single investor country was the United States,
with 48 per cent of projects, followed by
Germany (8.3 per cent), Japan (7.7 per cent),
Canada (6.3 per cent) and France (6.2 per
cent). The UK is particularly successful in
attracting investment in industries linked to
the knowledge-driven economy—computer
software, Internet, telecommunications and e-
business sectors—which, when taken together,
form the largest category of foreign direct
investment with some 205 projects (27 per
cent). Other main sectors for UK inward
investment are the automotive sector,
speciality chemicals and financial services.
423
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Britain is second only to the US in investment
in IT and communications equipment.
Recent inward investment announcements
have included:
• Toyoda Gosei of Japan is to invest £32
million by building its first European
manufacturing plant at Rotherham, South
Yorkshire, creating 400 new jobs. The
factory will supply rubber seals for car
doors and windows to Toyota plants in
Derbyshire and northern France;
• General Motors—£200 million will be
spent on a replacement for the Vauxhall
Vectra car, safeguarding 4,400 direct and
4,360 indirect jobs;
• MCI Worldcom, the US
telecommunications group, is
establishing a service and marketing
centre for Europe in central London,
creating 1,000 jobs;
• Computer Associates International is
investing US $160 million in a new
European headquarters near Slough,
Berkshire, which will be a centre for
training and software development
excellence across Europe; and
• Motorola is to invest US $2 billion in
Europe’s largest semi-conductor plant in
Dunfermline, Fife. This is the company’s
largest ever investment in Europe.
Motorola will also build a US $32 million
R&D software and design centre in
Livingston, Lothian.
Outward Investment
According to the latest United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) report, the UK was the world’s
largest outward investor in 1999 (US $212
billion), surpassing the United States for the
first time since 1988.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government provides a wide range of
advice and practical support to meet the needs
of exporters. This support is designed to help
businesses, especially small and medium-sized
enterprises, through all stages of the exporting
process.
British Trade International
British Trade International (BTI), established
in 1999, has lead responsibility within
government for trade development and
promotion services on behalf of British
business. It brings together the joint work of
the DTI and the FCO in support of British
trade and investment overseas, for both the
manufacturing and services sectors. It
combines in a single operation all trade
development and promotion work currently
undertaken in the English regions by the
Business Link network (see p. 391); trade
support services provided nationally; the
commercial work overseas of over 200
embassies and other diplomatic posts; and
central co-ordination of trade promotion
sponsored and undertaken by other
government departments.
The Chief Executive reports to the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry and the Foreign
Secretary, and to the Board of BTI, chaired
jointly by DTI and FCO ministers. A majority
of the Board’s members are from business and
have wide experience of international trade.
Key priorities over the next two years
include:
• putting in place a new structure which
will enable the team abroad and at home
to function as a single organisation;
• establishing a strong brand for trade
development and export promotion
services to make sure that businesses
know what BTI can offer to help them
win business overseas;
• implementation of changes to the
delivery of market information to British
businesses, including delivery of the
service through BTI’s website; and
• greater focus on sectoral needs and
development of a package of new trade
development initiatives for delivery
through the new regional and local
network.
An early task for the Board of BTI was the
preparation of a national trade development

SEASIDE PIERS
The history of piers began in the late 1700s when it became fashionable for the rich to visit
developing seaside towns. The success of spa towns such as Bath dispelled the fear of water and
people became fond of walking along jetties over the sea. During the 1860s and 1870s
an average of two piers were opened each year, the growth in the numbers reflecting
the rising popularity of the British seaside.
There are currently 55 pleasure piers in existence around the UK coastline.

working in support of Britain’s exporters and
overseas investors. This was published in
November 1999.
BTI has a remit for the entire United
Kingdom. Its strategy is a national one, and
the devolved administrations in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland have played a full
part in its development; each devolved
administration is represented on BTFs Board.
Invest- UK
Invest-UK was launched in July 2000 as the
new brand identity of the agency which
promotes the whole of the UK as the first
choice in Europe as an inward investment
location. It operates through its network of
offices in British diplomatic missions overseas
and its development agency partners in the UK
to assist new and existing investors with all
aspects of locating and expanding in the UK.
Trade Partners UK
Launched at the end of May 2000, Trade
Partners UK is a new unified brand for the
export and international trade services
provided to British business wishing to define
and develop business opportunities overseas.
The Trade Partners UK identity applies to all
government-supported services whether from
government departments with export
interests, Business Links, chambers of
commerce, export clubs or commercial sections
in British embassies and consulates abroad.
Export Insurance
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department), Britain’s official export credit
agency, is a separate government department
reporting to the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry. It helps exporters of UK goods
and services to win business, and UK firms to
invest overseas, by providing medium-term
and long-term export credit support for
capital goods and projects. It also provides
reinsurance for exports sold on short terms of
payment, and political risk insurance for
overseas investments. ECGD plays a key role
in the Government’s export strategy, and it
works closely with BTI and other government
departments involved in export promotion.
In 1998-99, ECGD issued guarantees for
new business (exports and overseas
investments) of ^3.7 billion. It also made a
cash contribution to the Exchequer of £363
million, achieved recoveries of £442 million
and experienced a continued fall in claims to
£143 million. ECGD aims to be flexible and
innovative in developing solutions to
individual problems, and offers simple
packages for the more straightforward deals.
ECGD has an extensive network of co¬
operation agreements with export credit
agencies in other countries.

More Nobel Prizes for science (over 70) have been won by scientists from
Britain than any country except the United States. The UK is responsible for
about 4.5 per cent of global expenditure on science, produces about 8 per cent of
scientific publications and receives 9 per cent of citations. UK scientists
claimed about 10 per cent of internationally recognised prizes in the 20th
century. Government policy aims to reinforce the UK’s international scientific
standing, and maximise the contribution of science, engineering and
technology (SET) to economic competitiveness and the quality of life by
promoting innovation.
BACKGROUND
The public sector is the prime funder of basic
science in Britain. As well as playing a crucial
part in advancing scientific knowledge and
producing well-trained people, such research
can often lead to exploitable results. Business
has the prime responsibility for researching
and developing new and improved products
and services. The Government’s aim is to
create a knowledge-driven economy by
building on the UK’s science base and
promoting the right climate to encourage
innovation and the exploitation of new ideas.
The Government’s policies for science,
engineering and technology were set out in the
July 2000 White Paper Excellence and
Opportunity—a science and innovation policy for
the 21st century. The White Paper set out the
actions being taken by the Government to
ensure that UK science remains world class, to
open up opportunities for innovation
throughout the economy and to increase
public confidence in science. The Spending
Review in July 2000 (see p. 401) provided for
an average increase of 5.4 per cent a year in
real terms between 2000—01 and 2003—04 for
spending in this area. The European Union
(EU) launched the Fifth Framework
Programme, a further round of its
collaborative research and development
(R&D) programme, in March 1999. UK
companies, higher education institutions and
research organisations are playing an active
role in this transnational collaborative research
programme. EU proposals to create a
European Research Area are expected to offer
new opportunities for the UK to compete as
part of the EU in global markets.
The Sanger Centre at Hinxton in
Cambridgeshire funded mainly by the
426
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Wellcome Trust has contributed a third of the
sequence data to the international Human
Genome Project, while the Medical Research
Council (MRC) Human Genome Mapping
Project Resource Centre on the same site also
played a major role in supporting work on the
human genome. The working draft of the
human genome sequence was announced in
June 2000 and has involved scientists working
at 16 research institutes in six countries (see
p. 441). The UK has been at the forefront of
many other world-class advances in science.
For example, in the latter part of the 20th
century there was the discovery by Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC)
British Antarctic Survey scientists of the hole
in the ozone layer over the Antarctic. Earlier,
researchers at the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology, Cambridge, had produced the first
monoclonal antibodies—proteins with
enormous potential in the diagnosis and
treatment of disease. Among British
breakthroughs in genetics research are the
identification of the gene in the Y
chromosome responsible for determining sex,
and of other genes linked to diseases such as
cystic fibrosis and a form of breast cancer. The
world’s first pig with a genetically modified
heart was bred by scientists at Cambridge
University. In 1997 scientists at the Roslin
Institute in Edinburgh announced that they
had succeeded in ‘cloning’ a sheep (‘Dolly the
Sheep’) using a cell from an adult sheep’s
mammary gland. Professor Sir Harold Kroto
of Sussex University shared the 1996 Nobel
Prize for chemistry with two US scientists for
discovering in 1985 the fullerene molecule—
60 carbon atoms arranged in a symmetrical
cage. Potential uses for fullerene and for
materials derived from it include high-
temperature superconductors, drugs, ultra¬
strong fibres, super-slippery lubricants,
lightweight magnets and electronic
superconductors.
Notable areas of UK achievement in R&D
include biotechnology, materials, chemicals,
electronics and aerospace. Among the British
research achievements reported in the first
half of 2000 are:
• The discovery by scientists at the NERC
Southampton Oceanography Centre that
young mussels living in the toxic,
scalding waters of hot springs at
hydrothermal vents—deep on mid-ocean
ridges—are able to repair damage to their
DNA quickly. DNA damage is one cause
of ageing and cancers in humans and
understanding how mussels repair their
DNA may suggest ways to enhance
human DNA repair.
• Chemists at The Queen’s University,
Belfast, have developed a faster way of
detecting the illegal drug ecstasy
(MDMA) in tablets. A technique called
Raman scattering measures the spectrum
of a laser beam bounced off the tablet
being investigated. The characteristic
spectra of several variants of MDMA
have been identified. This test can be
applied immediately to a suspect tablet,
compared with existing methods which
involve crushing and dissolving tablets
and analysis by gas chromatography.
• Work at the MRC National Institute for
Medical Research on malaria has
demonstrated that a gene family, thought
to be involved in red blood cell invasion,
also allows the malaria parasite to adapt
to changes in the (human) host
environment as well as to evade the
immune system. The parasite’s ability to
evade the host’s immune system is one of
the main problems in the development of
an effective malaria vaccine.
• Researchers have realised that a gamma-
ray camera originally developed for
investigating the night sky could have
another role, that of finding out how far
breast cancer has spread within a
patient’s body and possibly eliminating
the need for major surgery. The Particle
Physics and Astronomy Research
Council has awarded funding for the
development of an item of medical
equipment to take this idea forward.
• British scientists working with an
international team from the United
States, Italy and Canada have conducted
an experiment that enabled them to
create picture maps of the early Universe
showing the pattern of hot spots and cold
spots that collapsed to form clusters and

obtained the maps by flying a robotic
telescope on board a very large balloon
which travelled around Antarctica for 11
days.
• Research at Oxford University has shown
how genetically modified bacteria could
help to clear some chlorobenzenes that
contaminate derelict industrial
‘brownfield’ sites. The process changes
chlorinated benzenes into phenols which
can then be destroyed by common soil
bacteria.
• Researchers at the John Innes Centre in
Norwich have found a natural variant of a
gene in the tiny weed thale cress that
limits the plant’s height. The significance
of this is that it offers plant breeders a
way of converting any locally adapted
low-yielding variety of a crop into a
higher-yielding form, without disturbing
the plant’s adapted background.
• Collaborative research between scientists
at Oxford University and the Institute of
Animal Health has helped to determine
the structure of the Bluetongue virus
which affects livestock. This information
is providing new insight into how this
virus, which is endemic in many parts of
the world, attacks and penetrates cells.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EXPENDITURE
Gross domestic expenditure in the UK on
R&D in 1998 was ^15.6 billion, 1.8 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP). Of this, £13.2
billion was on civil R&D, with the rest going
to defence projects.
Industry provided 47 per cent of total
funding of R&D and government 32 per cent in
1998; a further 17 per cent came from abroad.
Other contributions were also made by private
endowments, trusts and charities. As well as
financing R&D carried out within industry
itself, industry supports university research and
finances contract research at government
establishments. Some charities have their own
laboratories and offer grants for outside
research. Contract research organisations (see
p. 444) carry out R&D for companies and are
playing an increasingly important role in the
transfer of technology to British industry.
Total spending on R&D in industry
amounted to £10.2 billion in 1998. Of this
total, industry’s own contribution was 66 per
cent, with 12 per cent coming from
government and the rest from overseas. The
three biggest investors in R&D (see Table
26.1)—AstraZeneca, Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKIine Beecham—all operate in the
pharmaceuticals sector, and pharmaceuticals
account for 40 per cent of UK R&D
428
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
expenditure. The electronics and aerospace
sectors are also big investors in R&D.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science, engineering and technology (SET)
base issues are the responsibility of a Cabinet
minister at the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI), assisted by a Minister for
Science; they are supported by the Office of
Science and Technology (OST). A Ministerial
Science Group has been created across
government to ensure that SET issues are
taken into account in the development of
government policy. The OST, headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, is
responsible for policy on SET, both nationally
and internationally, and co-ordinates science
and technology policy across government
departments. The Chief Scientific Adviser
also reports directly to the Prime Minister. An
independent Council for Science and
Technology advises the Prime Minister on the
strategic policies and framework for science
and technology in the UK. Its members are
drawn from academia, business and charitable
foundations/institutions. The policy and
management of some aspects of science and
technology are reserved to the UK
Government, while in other instances this has
been devolved to the new administrations in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in
establishments operated by the Research
Councils (see pp. 440-4), together with the
national and international central facilities
(such as CERN—see p. 439) supported by the
Research Councils and available for use by
British scientists and engineers. There are also
important contributions from private
institutions, chiefly those funded by charities.
The science and engineering base is the main
provider of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to have
practical applications) carried out in the UK.
It also collaborates with the private sector in
the conduct of specific applied research.
The OST, through the Director General of
Research Councils, has responsibility for the
Science Budget, and for the government-
financed Research Councils. Through the
Research Councils, the Science Budget
supports research in the following ways: by
awarding research grants to universities, other
higher education establishments and some
other research units; by funding Research
Council establishments to carry out research
or provide facilities; by paying subscriptions
to international scientific facilities and
organisations; and by supporting postgraduate
research students and postdoctoral Fellows.
The Science Budget also funds programmes of
support to the science and engineering base
through the Royal Society and the Royal
Academy of Engineering. The other main
sources of funds for universities are the higher
education funding councils (see p. 444).
Strategy and Finance
Planned total government expenditure on SET
(both civil and defence) in 2000-01 is £12
billion. This represents an increase of about
6 per cent in real terms over the estimated
outturn of expenditure in 1999-2000. Of the
2000-01 total, ^4.3 billion is devoted to civil
science, including £1.6 billion for the Science
Budget.
In 1998 the Government announced that it
would provide an additional £1 billion for the
science and engineering base between 1999
and 2002—£700 million through the Science
Budget and £300 million through the
Department for Education and Employment.
A further £400 million is being provided by
the Wellcome Trust. About £700 million of
the extra funding, including £300 million of
the Wellcome contribution, is devoted to
upgrading university laboratories and other
essential equipment (see p. 431). Another
£400 million is being used by the Research
Councils to support research in priority areas
such as life sciences (including genetic
research, medical science and biotechnology).
In July 2000 a further £1 billion investment
partnership with the Wellcome Trust—for
the years 2002-03 and 2003-04—was
announced (see p. 431) as part of the
Spending Review.
Key features of the Spending Review of
July 2000 and the associated White Paper,

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Excellence and Opportunity—a science and
innovation policy for the 21st century, are:
• an average increase in spending on
science and engineering of 5.4 per cent in
real terms over the three years 2001-02
to 2003-04;
• a Science Research Investment Fund, in
partnership with the Wellcome Trust, of
£1 billion over two years (see p. 431);
• through the Higher Education
Innovation Fund, increasing funding to
£140 million over three years, to help
universities to work with business to help
create jobs and wealth from the science
base;
• an extra £250 million to boost key
research areas—genomics, e-science,
nanotechnology, quantum computing
and bioengineering;
• in partnership with the Wolfson
Foundation and the Royal Society, a
fund, initially of £4 million a year, to
help in the recruitment of up to 50 top
researchers;
• an annual £50 million Regional
Innovation Fund to enable Regional
Development Agencies (see p. 394) to
support business incubators and clusters
and new clubs of scientists,
entrepreneurs, managers and financiers
to collaborate more closely in the regions;
and
• a new Small Business Research Initiative
to encourage more high-technology small
firms to start up or develop their research
expertise by bidding for government
research contracts.
The Foresight Programme
The funding and organisation of British SET
aim to create a close partnership between
government, industry and the scientific
community in developing strengths in areas of
importance to the future economic well-being
of Britain. In particular, the Government’s
Foresight Programme encourages the public
and private sectors to work together to
identify opportunities in markets and
technologies likely to emerge over the next ten
to 20 years that would support sustainable
growth, and the actions needed to exploit
them. Government priorities in SET
programmes, and in overall policy, regulation
and education and training, are being guided
by the Programme.
The Foresight Programme is co-ordinated
by a joint industry/academic steering group
headed by the Chief Scientific Adviser.
Building on the first round (1994—99), a
second Foresight round was launched in April
1999. This has three thematic panels and ten
sectoral panels, made up of people from
industry, academia and government. The
panels will produce visions of the future which
might drive wealth creation and shape the
quality of life. The thematic panels are
addressing the issues of ageing population,
crime prevention and manufacturing in 2020.
The sectoral panels are looking at business
sectors or broader areas—they are carrying
forward the work of earlier panels and tackling
new issues.
Government departments, universities and
higher education funding councils, as well as
the Research Councils, are reflecting
Foresight priorities in their research spending
allocations. The private sector is being
encouraged to take account of the priorities
both in its participation in collaborative
research programmes and in its own strategic
planning. The Government provided £30
million over four years for the first round of
the Foresight Challenge Competition, to fund
collaborative R&D projects which address
Faraday Partnerships are intended to
improve the exploitation of SET in the
UK. The partnerships bring together
universities, independent research
organisations, industry associations and
manufacturers. Four new Faraday
Partnerships were announced in 2000
following a competition. They are in the
areas of plastics, aerospace and automotive
materials, technical textiles, and the
application of mathematics and computer
science. It is intended to have a national
network of about 20 Faraday Partnerships
by 2003.

priorities identified by the Foresight panels.
This was complemented by a further £62
million from private sector project
participants. In addition, more than £400
million has already been channelled into other
Foresight initiatives.
A new Foresight fund, initially of up to £15
million, has been announced to implement the
best ideas from the current round quickly.
A ‘Knowledge Poof has been established as
an integral part of the second round of
Foresight. This is an electronic library of
strategic visions, information and views about
the future which can be accessed through the
Internet at the www.foresight.gov.uk website.
LINK
The LINK scheme provides a government¬
wide framework for collaborative research in
support of sustainable growth and
improvements in the quality of life, in line
with Foresight priorities. LINK aims to
promote partnerships in commercially
relevant research projects between industry
and higher education institutions and other
research base organisations. Under the
scheme, government departments and
Research Councils fund up to 50 per cent of
the cost of research projects, with industry
providing the balance.
Since 1988, 68 LINK programmes have
supported over 1,300 projects with a total
value of more than £600 million (over half of
which comes from industry) and involving
some 1,900 companies. Over 800 of these
projects have been completed. The latest
programmes deal with future integrated
transport, applied genomics, optical systems,
and people at the centre of communication
and information technologies. Within LINK,
Foresight Link Awards support projects
outside areas covered by LINK programmes.
New awards, with a total value of £16 million,
include: reducing the environmental impact of
wash from high-speed ships through hull
design and ship operation; a new technique to
enable strong human tissues, such as cartilage
or bone, to be grown; ‘smart-wired’ houses
with computer sensors to provide help for
elderly people; and research into new types of
plastic-encapsulated solar cells to reduce
energy costs for portable electronics and
domestic equipment.
Joint Research Equipment Initiative
The Joint Research Equipment Initiative
brings together the higher education funding
councils, the Department of Higher and
Further Education, Training and
Employment in Northern Ireland and the
Research Councils. It directs funds for
research equipment in strategic priority areas.
Since 1996 over £275 million of public and
private money has been committed for
‘leading edge’ equipment for UK universities
and colleges.
Joint Infrastructure Fund
The Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF) is a
programme to address the infrastructure
problems of universities and was created by
the Wellcome Trust and the DTI, each
contributing £300 million. The Higher
Education Funding Council for England has
also contributed £150 million, raising the total
fund to £750 million. In the first round of
awards in May 1999, £150 million was
allocated to over 20 universities. By mid-2000,
109 projects had been awarded nearly £600
million. Successful bids have included an
optical/infrared telescope capable of mapping
huge tracts of the Universe, a state-of-the-art
vaccine centre, a fire safety engineering
research facility and a post-genomic research
centre to make advances in healthcare using
data amassed by the Human Genome Project.
A £1 billion initiative announced in July
2000 builds on the Joint Infrastructure
Fund (which will continue until 2001-02).
The Science Research Investment Fund—
a two-year partnership between the
Government and the Wellcome Trust—
will finance new infrastructure schemes
across the spectrum of science and
engineering during 2002-04. The
Government will provide £775 million and
the Wellcome Trust £225 million.

University Challenge Fund
The University Challenge Fund is a
competitive scheme which offers financing to
universities to help them in the early stages of
turning research into commercial products.
The first round involved over £65 million of
investment funds: the Government contributed
£25 million, the Wellcome Trust £18 million
and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation £2
million, with the remainder raised by
universities. Fifteen seed funds were
established, allowing 37 institutions (28
universities and nine institutes) access to
investment capital. A second round of the
University Challenge Fund competition was
announced in the Science and Innovation
White Paper in July 2000. In this round, £15
million will be available to provide seed funding
to develop researchers’ ideas to the stage where
they can be taken up by industry, or attract
venture capital to form a spin-off company.
Science Enterprise Challenge
The Science Enterprise Challenge was
launched in February 1999 as a £25 million
competition to establish up to eight centres of
enterprise in UK universities. Universities
were invited to submit proposals for
establishing world-class centres which would
foster the commercialisation of research and
new ideas, stimulate scientific
entrepreneurialism, and incorporate the
teaching of enterprise into the science and
engineering curricula. The winners of the
competition were announced in September
1999: the universities of: Bristol, Cambridge,
Glasgow, Imperial College of Science,
Technology and Medicine, London Business
School, University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology, Nottingham
Business School and Sheffield—some in
partnership with other universities. In a
further round of the competition worth
£4.5 million, four additional centres were
announced in June 2000—at Durham,
Warwick, Ulster and Oxford universities—
and some of these centres are also in
partnership with other universities.
Public Awareness
The Government seeks to raise the status of
SET among the general public, by increasing
awareness of the contribution of SET to the
UK’s economic wealth and quality of life.
Raising awareness is important in encouraging
young people to pursue careers in science and
engineering. To this end, the Government
supports activities such as the annual science
festival of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science (BAAS) and
National Science Week. The Committee on
the Public Understanding of Science
(COPUS), set up by the Royal Society, the
BAAS and the Royal Institution (see p. 445),
acts as a co-ordinator for those fostering
public understanding and promotes best
practice in the field.
More than 400 schoolchildren attended a
one-day event A Millennium oj British
Mathematics at the 200-year-old Royal
Institution in London in March 2000 to
mark World Mathematics Year.
Presentations at the event by eminent
British mathematicians included a display
of the butterfly effect in chaos theory,
‘illegal’ symmetries in crystalline
structures and the catastrophe theorem—
applications of this to the buckling of
beams, the biting of dogs, the behaviour of
nesting fish and a stock market crash were
illustrated. In September 2000 a festival,
‘creating Sparks’, celebrated creativity at
the frontiers of science and the arts,
featuring over 400 events.
Science festivals are also a growing feature
of local co-operative efforts to further
understanding of the contribution made by
science to everyday life. Schools, museums,
laboratories, higher education institutions and
industry contribute to a variety of special
events. The longest-established single-location
annual science festival is the Edinburgh
International Science Festival.
432
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Activities such as these are important in
assuring continued interest in SET among
young people making educational and career
choices. They also help to enhance the
public’s ability to relate to scientific issues in
general and to make informed judgments
about scientific developments. The
Government is increasing its understanding of
public attitudes to science through public
consultation. Examples are consultation on
developments in biosciences, held in 1999, and
a broader national survey on public attitudes
to science, conducted by the Government in
2000 in partnership with the Wellcome Trust.
Women
The Promoting SET for Women Unit within
OST at the DTI was established in 1994 in
response to a report which found that women
were under-represented in the SET sectors,
especially at senior levels. The Unit has
highlighted the benefits to business of providing
a working environment sensitive to the needs of
women scientists and engineers who combine a
career and family responsibilities. It seeks to
ensure that careers information for girls and
women is widely available and to promote good
employment practices, such as the provision of
childcare facilities and job sharing. A website
(www.set4women.gov.uk) has been launched
promoting SET for girls and women and giving
details of the Unit’s activities.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation
through the promotion of a national and
international system for the establishment of
intellectual property rights. These matters are
the responsibility of the Patent Office, an
executive agency of the DTI. The Office is
responsible for the granting of patents, and
registration of designs and trade marks. In
1999 it received over 30,000 applications for
patents and more than 84,000 applications for
trade marks. The Patent Office encourages
worldwide harmonisation of rules and
procedures, and the modernisation and
simplification of intellectual property law.
International patenting arrangements include
the European Patent Convention and the
Patent Co-operation Treaty. For trade marks
the European Community Trade Mark
System and the Madrid Protocol provide
means of extending rights beyond the borders
of the United Kingdom. The Patent Office
website and Central Enquiry Unit offer
detailed information about all aspects of
intellectual property rights to its customers.
R&D’s important role in a knowledge-
driven economy is further recognised in an
intellectual property rights action plan set out
in the Competitiveness White Paper (see
p. 390), which focuses on making these rights
more affordable and accessible. Further
impetus has been given to work on the
exploitation of public sector research through
the publication in August 1999 of the Baker
report, Creating Knowledge: Creating Wealth—
Realising the Economic Potential of Public Sector
Research Establishments. The key
recommendations were:
• overcoming the risk avoidance culture in
central government that inhibits
entrepreneurial behaviour;
• giving government laboratories greater
financial and management freedom; and
• reforming Civil Service conduct rules so
as to reward scientists for exploiting their
work.
The Government has welcomed the report.
In implementing its recommendations, it will
maintain the balance between pursuing
exploitation and preserving both propriety and
a continuing source of independent advice on
sometimes controversial scientific subjects.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
In 2000—01 DTFs planned expenditure on
SET is £380 million: £267 million on R&D
and £113 million on technology transfer.
Expenditure covers innovation and technology
for a number of industrial sectors, including
aeronautics, biotechnology, chemicals,
communications, engineering, environmental
technology, IT, space (see p. 437), and nuclear
and non-nuclear energy. DTI is committed to
433
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
helping UK businesses successfully exploit
their ideas, and to promoting a business
environment to encourage this. DTFs
Innovation Budget is being increased over
three years by some 20 per cent to nearly £230
million by 2001-02.
Innovation embraces the development,
design and financing of new products, services
and processes, exploitation of new markets,
creation of new businesses and associated
changes in management of people and
organisational practices. Through its
Innovation Unit, a mixed team of business
secondees and government officials, DTI
seeks to promote a culture of innovation in all
sectors of the economy. In Northern Ireland
the Industrial Research and Technology Unit
has a similar role to that of the DTI,
supporting industrial R&D, technology
transfer and innovation.
Technology and Knowledge Transfer
DTI aims to increase collaboration and the
flow of knowledge between the SET base and
businesses; improve access to sources of
technology and technological expertise;
improve the capacity of business to use
technology effectively; and increase the uptake
of the latest technology and best practice
techniques.
One example of a technology and
knowledge transfer mechanism is TCS
(formerly known as the Teaching Company
Scheme); this is funded by six government
departments and five Research Councils as
well as by the participating companies. At any
one time there are nearly 700 TCS
programmes, each involving one or more
graduates working in a company on a project
that is central to its business needs. Each TCS
programme lasts for at least two years and
projects are jointly supervised by personnel
from the knowledge base and the company.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
are involved in around 90 per cent of TCS
programmes. The Competitiveness White
Paper announced a commitment by DTI to
double its expenditure on TCS and the aim is
to increase the number of schemes to around
1,000 at any one time by 2002. The TCS
scheme now has a common advisory board
with LINK (see p. 431) to help increase the
number of TCS programmes following on
from LINK-funded research.
To help UK companies remain competitive
in an increasingly global market, the DTEs
International Technology Service (ITS)
enables UK companies to become aware of,
and gain access to, new technological
developments and management practices not
present in the UK. The ITS highlights
developments and opportunities overseas; and
assists companies to access technology, set up
licensing agreements and collaborative
ventures, and to gain first-hand experience of
new technology and leading management
practices.
Smart
The ‘Smart’ scheme helps individuals and
SMEs review their use of technology, access
technology, and research and develop
technologically innovative products and
processes. Traditionally, help has been
available for feasibility studies into innovative
technology and for development projects, to
develop up to prototype stage new products
and processes. During 1999, three new
elements were introduced to Smart:
• technology reviews, which provide grants
towards the consultancy costs of an
expert review of a company’s use of
technology compared to best practice in
its industry sector;
• technology studies, which provide grants
for a more in-depth consultancy to help a
business identify technological
opportunities leading to innovative
products and processes; and
• micro projects, which provide grants of
up to £10,000 to help individuals and
small firms with fewer than ten
employees to develop low-cost
prototypes of products and processes
involving technical advances and/or
novelty.
Business Links (see p. 391) have an
important role in providing advice on all
aspects of Smart, generating suitable
feasibility studies and development projects,
434
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
and in helping firms to submit applications.
Smart is managed in England by the Small
Business Service (see p. 391). Separate Smart
schemes are operated in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
Aeronautics
The DTPs Civil Aircraft Research and
Technology Demonstration Programme
(CARAD) supports research and technology
demonstration in aeronautics. In 2000-01 the
CARAD budget is £20 million. The
programme is part of the national aeronautics
research effort, with almost half of the
supported research work being conducted in
industry, and around a third at the Defence
Evaluation and Research Agency (see below).
Universities and other research organisations
receive about 7 per cent of funding. CARAD
and earlier programmes have supported a
range of projects, including aluminium and
composite airframe materials, more efficient
and environmentally friendly engines, and
advanced aircraft systems.
Measurement Standards
The DTI finances work on measurement
standards under the National Measurement
System (NMS—see p. 394) and materials
metrology programmes, contributing £38
million and £8 million a year respectively.
Although most of the work is carried out at
the National Physical Laboratory, the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist, the
National Engineering Laboratory and the
National Weights and Measures Laboratory,
the DTI is taking steps to increase competition
in these programmes and to work more closely
with business in order to identify its future
needs. The NMS provides the infrastructure
to ensure that measurements can be made on a
consistent basis throughout the UK.
Ministry of Defence
The Government has traditionally invested
considerable sums in technological research
for defence purposes, and about £450 million
is currently being spent in this area to ensure
that the UK’s armed forces stay ahead of
threats from potential adversaries. The MoD
has a research budget and also a much larger
equipment procurement budget. The latter
includes development—the design and
testing, which are normally carried out by
industry for the MoD, of specific
equipment—on which about £2 billion a year
is spent.
Currently almost all MoD research is
carried out through the Defence Evaluation
and Research Agency (DERA), the largest
single scientific employer in the UK. Its role is
to supply scientific and technical services
primarily to the MoD but also to other
government departments. DERA has set up
five dual-use (civil/military) technology
centres in subjects ranging from structural
materials to high-performance computing, to
enhance the degree of collaboration between
DERA, industry and the academic science
base.
DERA subcontracts some research to
industry and universities, and works closely
with industry to ensure that scientific and
technological advances are integrated at an
early stage into development and production.
This technology transfer is not just confined
to the defence industry but has also led to
important ‘spin-offs’ into civil markets, in
fields ranging from new materials and
electronic devices to advanced aerodynamics.
These spin-offs are encouraged through the
Defence Diversification Agency.
To enable DERA to continue to support
the MoD and the wider science base, in July
2000 the Government announced its intention
to adopt a Public-Private Partnership for
DERA which could potentially take effect in
2001. This would result in around 75 per cent
of DERA’s staff transferring to a new private
sector company, with the remaining 25 per
cent continuing to work for government.
Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR)
The DETR funds research in response to the
requirements of all its major policy
responsibilities: environmental protection;
housing; construction; regeneration; the
435
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
countryside; local and regional government;
planning; roads and local transport; and
railways, aviation and shipping. Total
expenditure for 2000—01 is £191 million
(including spending by executive agencies and
non-departmental public bodies—NDPBs).
Major programmes of industrial support aim
to benefit the construction sector and to help
British industry’s adoption of energy-efficient
technologies. Through the Darwin Initiative
(see p. 320), British expertise is being made
available to assist countries that are rich in
biodiversity but have insufficient financial or
technical resources to implement the
Biodiversity Convention.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAFF)
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with devolved administrations, the Research
Councils and other public bodies in related
areas. The programme supports the
Ministry’s wide-ranging responsibilities for
protecting the public in relation to farm
produce and animal diseases transmissible to
humans; protecting and enhancing the rural
and marine environment; reducing risks from
flooding and coastal erosion; improving animal
health and welfare; and encouraging modern,
efficient and competitive agriculture, fishing
and food industries. The budget for research
expenditure in 2000—01 is £118 million,
including support for the Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew (see p. 446).
Department of Health (DH)
The DH supports R&D to provide the
evidence needed to inform policy and practice
in public health, healthcare and social care. It
delivers this objective through:
• National Health Service (NHS) R&D
Funding, which supports projects funded
by other non-commercial R&D sources
(including charities) carried out in the
NHS, and also specific health and social
care projects meeting identified research
needs of the DH and the NHS;
• a Policy Research Programme (PRP),
directly commissioned by the DH; and
• ad hoc project funding from other DH
R&D budgets and support for NDPBs.
The DH expects to spend some £520
million on research in 2000-01: £449 million
on NHS R&D, £30 million on the PRP and
£41 million involving the NDPBs and ad hoc
budgets.
Department for International
Development (DFID)
DFID commissions and sponsors knowledge
generation in natural resources, health and
population, engineering, education and social
sciences. Financial provision for this in
2000-01 is about £120 million, covering
research projects addressing particular
development problems and projects to
improve research, and research capacity
relevant to particular countries. DFID also
contributes to international centres and
programmes generating knowledge on
development issues. These contributions
include support for the EU Framework
Programmes, which sponsor research and
technological development in renewable
natural resources, agriculture, health and
information technologies, and for the
Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
Scottish Executive
In many areas—electrical and electronic
engineering, medicine, agriculture and
biological sciences, fisheries and marine
science—Scotland’s science base has an
international reputation for research
excellence. The majority of the Scottish
Executive’s support for the science base is
disbursed by the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council. In total this amounts to
some £616 million for 2000—01, including
£313 million for research and £23 million to
support the strategic development of the
sector. A further £75 million encourages and
funds agricultural and fisheries research, and
related biological, food, environmental,
economic and social science—most of this
goes to the Scottish Agricultural and
Biological Research Institutes, the Fisheries
436
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Research Service and the Scottish Agricultural
College. In addition, about £1^5 million goes
to Scottish research institutions from the UK
Research Councils.
The Scottish Executive Enterprise and
Lifelong Learning Department encourages the
development of science-based industry, for
example, by promoting and administering
government and EU industrial R&D schemes.
The enterprise network in Scotland—Scottish
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise
and LECs (see chapter 11)—addresses the
need for innovation and technology transfer,
both through grant support for innovation and
through a wide range of initiatives.
Scottish ministers have announced plans to
produce a strategy for science in Scotland
early in 2001.
Space Activities
The UK’s civil space programme is brought
together through the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership of government
departments and the Research Councils.
BNSC’s key aims are to develop practical and
economic uses of space, to promote the
competitiveness of British space companies in
world markets, to maintain the UK’s position
in space science, to foster the development of
innovative technology and to improve
understanding of the Earth’s environment and
resources. These are realised primarily by
collaboration with other European nations
through the European Space Agency (ESA).
Through BNSC, the Government spends
around ^180 million a year on space activities.
About three-quarters of this is channelled
through ESA for collaborative programmes on
Earth observation, telecommunications and
space science, much of which returns to the
UK through contracts awarded to British
industry. The remaining quarter of the space
budget is spent on international
meteorological programmes carried out
through the European Meteorological Satellite
Organisation (EUMETSAT), developing
experiments (such as the Beagle 2 Mars
Lander) for ESA satellites, and on the national
programme, which is aimed at complementing
R&D supported through ESA. Around half of
the British space programme is concerned
with satellite-based Earth observation
(remote-sensing) for commercial and
environmental applications.
The UK is also a major contributor to
ESA’s latest Earth observation satellite,
ENVISAT, due to be launched in 2001. This
will carry a new generation of radar and
radiometer systems as well as other scientific
environmental instruments, some of which
have been either designed or constructed in
Britain. British companies are also active in
the development of microsatellites.
A quarter of the UK’s space budget is
devoted to space science led by the Particle
Physics and Astronomy Research Council, in
support of astronomy, planetary science and
geophysics. The UK is contributing
substantially to the SOHO mission to study
the Sun; to the Cluster mission (see p. 442)
launched in mid-2000 to study solar-terrestrial
relationships; to the Infrared Space
Observatory, which is investigating the birth
and death of stars; and to the Cassini Huygens
mission, a seven-year programme to send a
probe to Saturn and its moon Titan, launched
in 1997. It is also participating in XMM,
ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy mission launched
1 hree small satellite projects have been
announced under MOSAIC—BNSC’s
Small Satellite Programme. The projects
offer innovative ways of demonstrating
small satellite technology and may open up
new markets for their use. They could
make environmental disaster monitoring
faster and cheaper.
• TOPSAT aims to deliver low-cost,
relatively high-resolution images
direct to local users wherever they
need them;
• GEMINI will develop a low-cost
small geostationary satellite for
telecommunications; and
• the Disaster Monitoring
Constellation project will develop a
network of affordable microsatellites,
which could provide daily imaging of
disaster areas.
437
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
in December 1999 to investigate X-ray
emissions from black holes.
The UK is taking an active role in the
largest current international project in
ground-based astronomy. The Gemini project
involves building two 8 m telescopes at Mauna
Kea (Hawaii) and Cerro Pachon (Chile): the
former became operational in June 1999 and
the latter is expected to be fully operational in
August 2001. The other partners are the
United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil and
Chile. The UK has a 25 per cent stake in the
work, with major responsibility for the
primary mirror support system and much of
the control software.
ESA’s £400 million Living Planet
environmental research programme, to help
scientists understand and predict the Earth’s
environment and humankind’s effects upon it,
was launched in 1999. BNSC will contribute
£67 million to this programme. The first
project to benefit from the programme will be
the British CRYOSAT mission, to be
launched in 2002, which will study the effects
of global warming on the polar ice caps and
floating Arctic sea ice. UK environmental
scientists also have a significant interest in a
second mission, which will measure soil
moisture and ocean salinity.
Two new centres of excellence in Earth
observation will use satellites and models to
help forecast environmental change and play a
role in exploiting data from ENVISAT and
the Living Planet programme. The Data
Assimilation Research Centre will forecast
changes in the Earth’s systems, while the
Centre for Polar Observation Modelling will
measure changes in polar ice which could
cause rising sea levels and changes in ocean
circulation.
The UK is also developing the
Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget
instrument, which is intended to provide
accurate measurements of the energy source
for the Earth’s climate and, together with the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the High Resolution
Dynamics Limb Sounder, which will provide
measurements of upper atmosphere trace
chemicals and temperature.
The UK has many bilateral agreements for
scientific research with other countries, such
as Russia, Japan and the United States. For
example, British scientists contributed to the
high-resolution camera for Chandra (the
NASA X-ray satellite).
Another major area of British space
expertise is satellite communications and
navigation. In Europe, the UK is both a
leading producer and user of satellite
communications technology (see p. 486). It is
taking a leading role in preparations for future
ESA satellite communications missions,
including ARTEMIS, which will provide
important communications links for the
ENVISAT programme. Britain is also
contributing to the Galileo global navigation
satellite system.
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has operated a series of
R&D framework programmes, across a range
of disciplines and sectors, to strengthen the
scientific and technological basis of European
industry and support the development of EU
policies. The Fifth Framework Programme,
which runs for four years (1999-2002),
supports strategic and applied
multidisciplinary research targeted at tackling
pressing European problems, such as land
transport and marine technologies, the ageing
population, e-commerce and the ‘city of
tomorrow’. The Research Councils and the
British Council maintain a joint office in
Brussels to promote UK participation in
European research programmes. The UK is
actively engaged in the development of a
common European Space Strategy involving
the ESA, the EU and others.
Other International Activities
Over 800 UK organisations have taken part in
EUREKA, an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in
developing advanced products and processes
with worldwide sales potential. There are 30
members of EUREKA, including the 15 EU
countries and the European Commission.
Some 600 projects are in progress, involving
438
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
firms, universities and research organisations.
Over 500 projects have finished. One example
was of a project involving software used to
create special effects in films such as Notting
Hill and a number of television
advertisements.
The COST programme (European co¬
operation in the field of scientific and
technical research) is a multilateral agreement
involving 32 countries (including all the EU
member states, many Mediterranean, Central
European and Eastern European countries and
Israel). Its purpose is to encourage co¬
operation in national research activities across
Europe, with participants from industry,
academia and research laboratories.
Transport, telecommunications and materials
have traditionally been the largest areas
supported. New areas include physics,
chemistry, neuroscience and the application of
biotechnology to agriculture, including
forestry. The UK participates in the majority
of COST actions.
Another example of international
collaboration is CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics, based in
Geneva, where the proposed Large Hadron
Collider is due to be completed by 2005.
Scientific programmes at CERN aim to test,
verify and develop the ‘standard model’ of the
origins and structure of the Universe. There
are 20 member states. The Particle Physics
and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC—
see p. 442) leads UK participation in CERN
and the Council for the Central Laboratory of
the Research Councils co-ordinates the UK
research community’s involvement in the
CERN project. Britain also contributes to the
high-flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-
Langevin and to the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility, both in Grenoble.
The PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the
Arctic Circle, which conducts research on the
ionosphere. The Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC) has a major involvement in
international programmes of research into
global climate change organised through the
World Climate Research Programme and the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme.
It also supports the UK’s subscription to the
Ocean Drilling Program.
Through the Medical Research Council
(MRC), the UK participates in the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), at
Heidelberg. The European Bioinformatics
Institute, an outstation of the EMBL, at
Hinxton, near Cambridge, provides up-to-
date information on molecular biology and
genome sequencing for researchers
throughout Europe. The MRC pays Britain’s
contribution to the Human Frontier Science
Programme, which supports international
collaborative research into brain function and
biological function through molecular-level
approaches. It also pays Britain’s subscription
to the International Agency for Cancer
Research.
The Research Councils have a number of
bilateral arrangements to promote
international collaboration. For example, the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC) has agreements
with its equivalent organisations in France,
the Netherlands, the United States, Canada,
Japan, Korea and India, and provides travel
funding and fellowships to encourage
international linkages.
The UK is a member of the science and
technology committees of such international
organisations as the OECD and NATO, and
of various specialised agencies of the United
Nations, including the United Nations
Educational, Scientific arid Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO). The Research
Councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy are members of the European
Science Foundation, and a number of British
scientists are involved in its initiatives.
The British Government also enters into
bilateral agreements with other governments
to encourage closer collaboration in science,
engineering and technology. Staff in British
Embassies, High Commissions and British
Council offices conduct government business
on, and promote contacts in, SET between the
UK and overseas countries; and help to
inform a large number of organisations in the
UK about developments and initiatives
overseas. There are science and technology
attaches in British Missions in Washington,
Tokyo, Moscow, Ottawa, Paris, Bonn,
Munich, Rome, Beijing (Peking), Taipei and
Seoul, and the July 2000 White Paper
439
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
included a proposal to extend the network. A
number of British Council offices have
designated Science Officer posts.
The British Council promotes the creativity
and innovation of cutting-edge UK science
through events, partnership programmes,
seminars, exhibitions and information
provision. It balances one-to-one scientific links
with projects aimed at raising awareness of
scientific issues among overseas public
audiences through popular communication.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each Research Council is an autonomous
body established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and
government. The Councils support research,
study and training in universities and other
higher education institutions, and carry out
or support research, through their own
institutes and at international research
centres, often jointly with other public sector
bodies and international organisations. They
provide awards to about 15,000 postgraduate
students in science, social sciences,
engineering and technology. In addition to
funding from the OST, the Councils receive
income from research commissioned by
government departments and the private
sector.
Three Research Councils are sponsoring a
new interdisciplinary centre to help society
find sustainable solutions to the problems
caused by climate change. The Tyndall
Centre for Climate Change Research,
based at the University of East Anglia in
Norwich, will receive £10 million over five
years from the Natural Environment
Research Council, the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council, and
the Economic and Social Research
Council. Its research programme will
include modelling of climate and related
systems; assessment and regional analysis;
impacts of, and adaptation to, climate
change; energy technologies; and
greenhouse gases.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC)
The EPSRC, the Research Council with the
largest budget (£413 million in 2000—01), has
responsibility to promote and support high-
quality basic, strategic and applied research and
related postgraduate training in engineering
and the physical sciences. It also has
responsibility to provide advice, disseminate
knowledge and promote public understanding
in these areas. Its remit is delivered through
nine programme areas: physics, chemistry,
mathematics, the generic technologies of
information technology and materials, three
engineering programmes (general engineering,
engineering for manufacturing and engineering
for infrastructure, the environment and
healthcare) and the life sciences. This last
programme was set up in 1999 to cover
research and training at the interface between
the life sciences and all areas of engineering and
the physical sciences.
EPSRC ‘Partnerships for Public
Awareness’ awards were launched in 1998 to
improve public awareness of leading research
and its possible impact on society. The awards
encourage researchers to communicate the
value of their work to the public. In the first
two years, 47 projects received awards totalling
over £1.2 million. Two projects received
EPSRC’s ‘Year 2000’ accolade: a schools’ robot
league and an electron microscope which the
public can operate by remote control over the
Internet. The awards bring together scientists
with industry specialists, schools, artists, poets,
community groups and the media in a wide
range of activities.
A series of posters on mathematics is being
displayed on the London Underground
during 2000. They have been developed by
the Isaac Newton Institute for
Mathematical Sciences at Cambridge
University. Each poster shows the
contribution of mathematics to everyday
life. Themes chosen for the posters include
weather, medicine, economics, plants and
computer chips. The campaign is intended
also to contribute to UNESCO’s World
Mathematics Year.

Medical Research Council (MRC)
The MRC, with an overall budget of £345
million for 2000—01, is the main source of
public funds for biomedical and related
sciences research. It supports research and
training aimed at maintaining and improving
human health. The MRC advances knowledge
and technology to meet the needs of user
communities, including the providers of
healthcare and the biotechnology, food,
healthcare, medical instrumentation,
pharmaceutical and other biomedical-related
industries. About half the MRC’s expenditure
is allocated to its own institutes and units, the
rest going mainly on grant support of research
in universities, including training awards. The
Council has several large institutes, including
the National Institute for Medical Research at
Mill Hill in London and the Laboratory of
Molecular Biology in Cambridge; it also runs
the Clinical Sciences Centre at Imperial
College, London. It has more than 50 research
units and a number of smaller scientific teams
in the UK.
The Human Genome Project is an
international project to identify all the
genes of the human body and has involved
thousands of scientists working at 16
centres across the world. Completion of
the initial stage—mapping of 97 per cent
of the human genome (of which 85 per
cent has been accurately sequenced)—was
announced at the end of June 2000. Nearly
one-third of the genome was decoded by
scientists working at the Sanger Centre at
Hinxton in Cambridgeshire (see p. 427).
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC)
The NERC carries out Earth system science.
In 2000-01 it will spend its budget of £223
million in the following areas: biodiversity;
environmental risks and hazards; global
change; natural resource management; and
pollution and waste.
The Council supports research in its own
and other research establishments as well as
Autosub, NERC’s pioneering robot
submarine, has now operated on eight
autonomous missions, the first time any
autonomous underwater vehicle has
operated successfully beyond the range of
its support vessel. Its missions included
counting herring shoals with sonar;
measuring turbulence near the sea floor;
and detecting manganese in Scottish lochs.
Future scientific missions include going
under the Antarctic sea ice to measure ice
thickness and the abundance of krill.
Autosub has been awarded ‘Millennium
Product’ status by the Design Council.
research and training in universities. It also
provides a range of facilities for use by the
wider environmental science community,
including a marine research fleet. NERC
establishments are the British Geological
Survey, the British Antarctic Survey (which
has taken delivery of a new ship, RRS Ernest
Shackleton), the Centre for Ecology and
Hydrology, the Plymouth and Dunstaffnage
Marine and Proudman Oceanographic
Laboratories, together with a number of
university-based units. The Southampton
Oceanography Centre, a partnership with
Southampton University, undertakes
research, training and support activities in
oceanography, geology and aspects of marine
technology and engineering. The NERC’s
Research Ships Unit is located at the Centre.
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)
The BBSRC has a budget of £202 million for
2000-01. It supports basic and strategic
research and research training related to the
understanding and exploitation of biological
systems, which underpin the agriculture,
bioprocessing, chemical, food, healthcare,
pharmaceutical and other biotechnology-
related industries. The scientific themes are
biomolecular sciences; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences; agri-food; and engineering and
biological systems. As well as funding research
441
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
in universities and other research centres, the
BBSRC sponsors eight research institutes.
The BBSRC funds research that provides
the UK with world-class genetics resources,
databases and genomics technologies for a
variety of model laboratory species and for
important microbes, crops and livestock. This
research underpins many applications. For
example, greater precision in drug design and
in matching therapeutics to the genetic make¬
up of patients is expected to become possible,
crops and livestock can be bred to meet
environmental and welfare concerns, and
newly identified molecules will form a basis
for novel drugs, catalysts and fine chemicals
for manufacturers.
The BBSRC has established six specialist
Centres for Structural Biology, the science
that underpins understanding of, and ability
to predict how, the function of individual
biological molecules and large molecular
assemblies, such as virus particles, is
determined by their structure.
The Bioscience Business Plan competition
has been developed and piloted by the BBSRC
with support from the MRC and private
sector funding. It encourages the formation of
new bioscience ventures by enabling
participants to develop and submit ideas for
new start-up businesses.
Fundamental research into the nature of
genes, how they work and how they can be
transferred between organisms, has
underpinned the development of the
technology of genetic modification (GM).
As well as driving new applications of
GM, the research is providing basic
information about the behaviour of genes,
and of genetically modified organisms
(GMOs). In May 1999 the Government
announced a new framework for
overseeing developments in biotechnology.
The Agricultural and Environment
Biotechnology Commission and the
Human Genetics Commission have been
set up to advise on agricultural and
environmental issues and on human
genetics respectively. They are working
alongside the Food Standards Agency (see
p. 208) as part of the strategic framework.
Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council (PPARC)
The main task of the PPARC, which has a
budget of £200 million for 2000—01, is to
encourage and support a balanced and cost-
effective research programme into
fundamental physical processes. Its three main
areas of research are:
• particle physics—theoretical and
experimental research into elementary
particles and the fundamental forces of
nature;
• astronomy (including cosmology and
astrophysics)—the origin, structure and
evolution of the Universe, stars and
galaxies; and
• planetary science (including solar and
terrestrial physics)—the origin and
evolution of the solar system and the
influence of the Sun on planetary bodies,
particularly Earth.
The European Cluster II space mission,
launched in 2000 and comprising four
identical spacecraft, is part of an integrated
series of experiments to learn more about
how the Sun affects the Earth. The
spacecraft will spend the next two years in
close formation around the Earth,
gathering information about how the Sun
affects space weather—space weather has
an impact on the satellites used for
communications, navigation and weather
forecasting.
The PPARC’s support involves the
provision of funds to universities to undertake
research and the provision of facilities to
enable that research to take place. Facilities are
provided on a national and international basis,
the latter including membership of ESA and
CERN (see pp. 437 and 439).
A UK project at Boulby (North Yorkshire)
is undertaking experiments underground
to look for weakly interacting particles
which may provide more clues to improve
understanding of the total matter density
of the Universe.

26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC)
The ESRC, with an R&D provision of £71
million for 2000-01, supports research and
training to enhance the UK’s economic
competitiveness, quality of life, and the
effectiveness of public services and policy. All
research funded by the ESRC is conducted in
higher education institutions or independent
research establishments. The Council has nine
priority themes: economic performance and
development; environment and sustainability;
globalisation, regions and emerging markets;
governance, regulation and accountability;
technology and people; innovation;
knowledge, communication and learning;
lifespan, lifestyles and health; and social
inclusion and exclusion.
The ESRC has launched the Millennium
Cohort—a £2.2 million longitudinal study
of 15,000 people born in the period July
2000 to June 2001. Data will be collected
from this group of people over their
lifetime on all aspects of their lives,
providing a unique insight into the effects
of change over the first half of the 21st
century and beyond. It will also greatly
enhance the capacity of current
longitudinal studies to chart social change.
A major research programme on devolution
and constitutional change in the UK has been
launched. It will explore the political,
economic, social and geographical effects of
constitutional changes connected with the
creation of the Scottish Parliament, the
National Assembly for Wales, the Northern
Ireland Assembly, Regional Development
Agencies (see p. 394) and the London
Assembly and Mayor (see p. 63). The
programme’s aim is to increase understanding
of these processes of change and the
consequent effects on people’s lives.

and technical expertise primarily to meet the
needs of the research communities supported
by the other Research Councils. Its R&D
budget for 2000—01 is £115 million, of which
£86 million comes through agreements with
other Research Councils and another £24
million from contracts and agreements with
the EU, overseas countries, and other
industries and organisations. It covers a broad
range of science and technology, including
materials, structural and biomolecular science
using accelerators, synchrotrons and lasers,
satellite instrumentation and data processing,
remote sensing, electronics, sensor
technology, computing, mobile
communications, micro-engineering,
microsystems and particle physics.
A third generation synchrotron—
‘diamond’—will be the largest scientific
facility to be built in the UK for over 30
years. It will be built at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory and be funded by a
partnership of the UK Government, the
Wellcome Trust and the French
Government. Its function will be to
produce pinpoint ultraviolet and X-ray
light beams that will feed into a suite of
advanced instruments. The data from
these instruments are expected to enable
scientists and engineers to understand the
basic structure of matter and materials
with the intention of revealing, for
example, the detail of the building blocks
of life and the origin of Earth.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The CCLRC is responsible for three
research establishments: the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire; the
Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire; and the
Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire. These
centres provide facilities too large or complex
to be housed by individual academic
institutions. Among the facilities are ISIS (the
world’s leading source of pulsed neutrons and
muons), some of the world’s brightest lasers
and the pioneering Daresbury synchrotron
source.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
Universities carry out most of the UK’s long¬
term strategic and basic research in science
and technology. The higher education funding
councils provide the main general funds to
support research in universities and other
higher education institutions in Great Britain.
These funds pay for the salaries of permanent
academic staff, who usually teach as well as
undertake research, and contribute to the
infrastructure for research. The quality of
research performance is a key element in the
allocation of funding. In Northern Ireland
institutions are funded by the Department of
Higher and Further Education, Training and
Employment.
In November 1999 the Government
announced funding of £70 million for a
joint institute involving the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Cambridge
University. The Institute will undertake
education and research designed to
improve the UK’s entrepreneurship,
productivity and competitiveness, and
stimulate the development of technology-
based business out of the academic base.
Basic and strategic research in higher
education institutions are also financed by the
Research Councils. Institutions undertaking
research with the support of Research Council
grants have the rights over the commercial
exploitation of their research, subject to the
prior agreement of the sponsoring Research
Council. They may make use of technology
transfer experts and other specialists to help
exploit and license the results of their
research. The other main channels of support
are industry, charities, government
departments and the EU. The high quality of
research in higher education institutions, and
their marketing skills, have enabled them to
attract more funding from a larger range of
external sources, especially in contract income
from industry and charities.
Science Parks
The UK has a range of Science Parks—
business support and technology transfer
initiatives having formal or operational links to
a higher education institution or other major
research centre and encouraging and
supporting the start-up, incubation and
growth of innovation-led, high-growth,
knowledge-based businesses. The UK Science
Park Association numbers 60 such initiatives,
which between them host over 1,300 firms
employing over 26,000 people in total. Many
of these firms are spin-offs from the associated
institution or are start-up enterprises in fields
of high-technology such as software,
biotechnology, analytical services or
consultancy.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Research and Technology Organisations
(RTOs)
RTOs are independent organisations carrying
out commercially relevant research and other
services on behalf of industry, often relating to
a specific industrial sector. Others are contract
research organisations undertaking specific
projects for any client. The Association of
Independent Research and Technology
Organisations has 44 members which together
employ about 10,000 people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source
of funds for biomedical research in the UK.
444
26: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Their combined contribution in 1999-2000
was about £540 million. The three largest
contributors are the Wellcome Trust, the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the
Cancer Research Campaign.
Professional and Learned Institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned societies
in the UK, many of which promote their own
disciplines or the education and professional
well-being of their members. The Council of
Science and Technology Institutes has ten
member institutes representing biology,
biochemistry, chemistry, the environment,
food science and technology, geology, hospital
physics and physics.
The Engineering Council promotes and
regulates the engineering profession. It is
supported by 125 industry affiliates, which
include large private sector companies and
government departments, 34 professional
engineering institutions and eight affiliates. In
partnership with the institutions, the Council
accredits higher and further education courses
and advises the Government on academic,
industrial and professional issues. It also runs
a number of promotional activities. Some
285,000 individuals have satisfied the
Council’s regulations through their institution
for registration, as either Chartered Engineers,
Incorporated Engineers or as Engineering
Technicians.
Royal Society
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, is the
UK’s academy of science and has 1,200
Fellows and 100 Foreign Members. Many of
its Fellows serve on governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with
research. The Society has three roles: as the
national academy of science, as a learned
society and as a funding agency for the
scientific community. It offers independent
advice to government on science matters, acts
as a forum for discussion of scientific issues,
and fosters public awareness of science and
science education. Its government grant for
2000-01 is £25 million.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering,
which has 1,150 Fellows and 80 Foreign
Members. It promotes excellence in
engineering for the benefit of society, and
advises government, Parliament and other
official organisations. The Academy’s
programmes are aimed at attracting first-class
students into engineering, raising awareness of
the importance of engineering design among
undergraduates, developing links between
industry and higher education, and increasing
industrial investment in engineering research
in higher education institutions. It has a
government grant of £4 million in 2000-01.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
offering postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and
publishing journals. It also acts as a source of
independent scientific advice to the
Government and others.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, founded in
1831, is mainly concerned with science, while
the Royal Society of Arts, dating from 1754,
deals with the arts and commerce as well as
science. The Royal Institution, founded in 1799,
also performs these functions and runs its own
research laboratories. It also arranges public
programmes to bring science to a wider public,
including the Christmas Lectures and the Friday
Evening Discourses. Both programmes were
started in 1826 by Michael Faraday in the Royal
Institution’s Albemarle Street lecture theatre.
The Christmas Lectures now reach a worldwide
audience, being broadcast in Britain, other parts
of Europe, Japan and the United States.

is responsible for the Institute of Zoology,
which carries out research in support of
conservation. The Institute’s work covers topics
such as ecology, reproductive biology and
conservation genetics. ZSL also operates in
overseas conservation projects, and is concerned
with practical field conservation, primarily in
East and Southern Africa, the Middle East and
parts of Asia. Other well-known zoos in the UK
include those in Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,
Dudley and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in
1759, covers 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew
in south-west London and a 187-hectare (462-
acre) estate at Wakehurst Place (Ardingly, in
West Sussex). They contain one of the largest
collections of living and dried plants in the
world. Research is conducted into all aspects
of plant life, including physiology,
biochemistry, genetics, economic botany and
the conservation of habitats and species.
During 1998-2000 Kew has been building the
The Millennium Seed Bank Project is one
of the largest international conservation
projects ever undertaken. It aims to collect
and conserve seeds of 24,000 species (10

aims to collect and conserve seeds of the
entire UK native seed-bearing flora by the
end of 2000. The seeds are stored in large
underground vaults held at -20° C in the
Wellcome Trust Millennium Building at
Wakehurst Place. By August 2000 the
Seed Bank held 259,606,777 seeds. The
Millennium Commission is donating up to

The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
was established in 1670, and is the national
botanic garden of Scotland. Together with its
three associated specialist gardens, which were
acquired to provide a range of different
climatic and soil conditions, it has become an
internationally recognised centre for taxonomy
(classification of species); for the conservation
and study of living and preserved plants and
fungi; and as a provider of horticultural
education.
A national botanic garden and research
centre for Wales has been developed on a 230-
hectare (570-acre) site on the Middleton Hall
estate at Llanarthne, near Carmarthen and was
opened in May 2000—the first botanic garden
to be built in Britain for two centuries.

The Government’s long-term policy for agriculture is ‘to secure a more
competitive and sustainable industry with a stronger market orientation’. It
seeks to integrate the social, economic and environmental objectives that will
bring this about, and to encourage diversification. The Food Standards Agency
was established in 2000.
Agriculture
Major issues in 1999 were the continued low
level of farm incomes and the difficulties
facing the farming industry, caused by the
strength of the pound in relation to the euro;
the aftermath of the BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) crisis; and the fall in
international commodity prices. Among
government measures in response to these
problems are:
• a programme involving ^1-6 billion of
expenditure over 2000-07 on rural
improvement measures in England;
• an extra £60 million in support for hill
farmers;
• securing £528 million in EU funds
during 1999—2004 to compensate farmers
for the strength of the pound;
• £6 million to aid improvements in
marketing and development;
• an extra £10 million to aid organic
conversion;
• deferral of charges for cattle passports
(worth £22 million a year) and specified
risk material inspections (worth £18
million); and
• an aid package announced in March 2000
worth £203.5 million over three years
and including specific programmes to
help hard-hit pig and dairy farmers.
In December 1999 the Government set out
a strategy for the future of agriculture in the
UK, stressing a competitive, diverse and
flexible industry, responsive to consumer
wishes, environmentally responsible, and an
integral part of the rural economy. In Scotland
the Scottish Executive is responsible for
implementing UK-wide elements of the
strategy. The Government regards farming as
a vital part of the food chain, worth £55
billion a year, employing 3 million people.

(14.4 million acres) were used for rough
grazing, most of it in hilly areas.
Farming
In 1999 there were some 239,600 farm
holdings in the UK (excluding minor holdings
in Great Britain but including all active farms
in Northern Ireland). These holdings had an
average area of 66.6 hectares (164.6 acres).
About 47 per cent of them are smaller than
eight European size units (ESUs).1 About
two-thirds of all agricultural land is owner-
occupied; the rest is tenanted or rented.
Total income from farming (representing
income to those with an entrepreneurial
interest in the agricultural industry) was

estimated at £2.3 billion in 1999, 1.2 per cent
less in real terms than that of 1998. The value
of output (including subsidies directly related
to products) was 3.1 per cent lower than in
1998, despite a nearly 1 per cent increase in
output volume. This fall in output value was
offset by reduced costs. Productivity in the
industry improved by 2.6 per cent in 1999 as
farmers reduced inputs but maintained output
levels. Paid labour was significantly reduced;
as a result, labour productivity increased by
8.2 per cent.

sheep. Most of the beef animals and sheep are
reared in the hill and moorland areas of
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
northern and south-western England. Among
world-famous British livestock are the
Hereford, Welsh Black and Aberdeen Angus
beef breeds, the Jersey, Guernsey and
Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large White pigs and a
number of sheep breeds. Livestock totals are
given in Table 27.3.
Cattle and Sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute about 40 per cent
of the value of Britain’s gross agricultural
output. Dairy production is the largest part of
the sector, followed by cattle and calves, and
then sheep and lambs. Most dairy cattle in the
UK are bred by artificial insemination. In
1999 the average size of dairy herds was 73
(excluding minor holdings in Great Britain),

while the average yield of milk for each dairy
cow was 5,974 litres (1,314 gallons).
More than half of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Holstein Friesian breed
predominates. The remainder derives from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves, both in the hills and uplands and in
lowland areas. The traditional British beef
breeds (see p. 450) and, increasingly, imported
breeds, such as Charolais, Limousin,
Simmental and Belgian Blue, are used for beef
production. The size of the beef-breeding
herd expanded by 22 per cent during 1989-99,
while the dairy herd decreased by 13 per cent.
The value of beef and veal production grew
by 0.3 per cent in 1999 to £1,996 million as
increased cattle prices offset a reduction in
subsidy payments, but output fell by 2.8 per
cent in 1999 to 680,000 tonnes.
The UK has more than 60 native sheep
breeds and many cross-bred varieties. The size
of the British breeding flock rose slightly in
1999 but the value of sheepmeat production
fell by 11 per cent.
Pigs
The value of pigmeat production in 1999 was
£782 million, 11 per cent down on 1998.
Reductions in the breeding herd continued in
1999, and were particularly severe in some
regions, notably Northern Ireland. Abundant
supplies in Europe and the high value of the
pound led to increased imports and helped to
keep a downward pressure on UK prices. In
1999 UK pig farms made, on average,
significant losses, and there was a substantial
turnover of farms going out of pig production
(about 20 per cent) and farms coming in.
Poultry
The total UK bird population in 1999
consisted of 101.6 million chickens and other
table fowls; 29 million birds in the laying
flock; 9.4 million fowls for breeding; and 13.3
million turkeys, ducks and geese.
Poultry production in 1999 was 1.5 million
tonnes, a 2 per cent decrease on 1998, but
prices continued to fall, because of lower feed
prices, oversupply and cheap imports. The
value of hen eggs for human consumption was
10 per cent down.
Farm Animal Welfare
In 1999 the UK achieved its aim of protecting
laying hens by securing an EU Directive
which bans the battery cage from 1 January

2012. Among other advances during the year,
a UK ban on close confinement stalls and
tethers for pigs came into effect; new welfare
standards, adopted by the Council of Europe,
for ducks and geese, and for animals farmed
for their fur, are now in place. The Welfare of
Animals (Staging Points) Order 1998 lays
down standards for the construction and
operation of staging points in the transit of
animals. New EU standards for vehicles
carrying animals for over 8 hours were
implemented in the Welfare of Animals
(Transport) (Amendment) Order 1999.
The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order
1997 was reviewed in 1999. New arrangements
for pre-export inspections of food animals
destined for other EU member states were
introduced, to ensure that all animals are
healthy and fit to travel. Certifying
veterinarians are provided with clearer and
more transparent instructions, including
minimum inspection times. The State
Veterinary Service assessed compliance with
current legislation at livestock markets and the
Government began a review of the Welfare of
Animals (Markets) Order 1990.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. The
main crops are shown in Table 27.4. In the
UK in 1999, the area planted to cereals—
wheat, barley and oats—totalled 3.14 million
hectares (7.76 million acres), a decrease of
452
27: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
8.3 per cent on 1998, mainly because of the
increased compulsory set-aside area, raised
from 5 to 10 per cent (see p. 458). Production
was down by only 1.3 per cent to 22.5 million
tonnes. Total value of cereals fell by 6.1 per
cent to £2,349 million.
Large-scale potato and vegetable cultivation
takes place on the fertile soils throughout the
UK, often with irrigation. Principal areas are
the peat and silt fens of Cambridgeshire,
Lincolnshire and Norfolk; the sandy loams of
Norfolk, Suffolk, West Midlands,
Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire; the peat soils of south
Lancashire; and the alluvial silts by the river
Humber. Early potatoes are produced in
Shropshire, Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Devon,
Essex, Suffolk, Kent, Cheshire and south-west
Scotland. Production of high-grade seed
potatoes is confined mainly to east Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the northern uplands and
the Welsh borders. Total area for all potatoes
rose by 8.2 per cent in 1999, with an overall
increase in production of 11 per cent. The
value of potato production increased by 21 per
cent (£131 million) on 1998.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides
just over half of home needs.
Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS)
The AAPS, of which set-aside is a part and
which originally aimed to cut cereals support
prices, helps compensate farmers for these
cuts. They are paid for the land under arable
production, not the quantity of crop. To
qualify for subsidy, all but the smallest
farmers must set aside a proportion of their
land (10 per cent for the 1999 harvest) to
reduce cereals production. Where land is
eligible, the subsidy is paid on cereals,
oilseeds, proteins (including peas for
harvesting dry) and linseed.
Set-aside payments compensate farmers for
leaving part of their land fallow, while keeping
it in good agricultural condition. They are
encouraged to maximise the environmental
benefit of the scheme and are allowed to count
land entered into various environmental
schemes (see p. 458) against their set-aside
obligation. In addition to the compulsory set-
aside rate, growers may set aside, on a
voluntary basis, more than 50 per cent of the
area claimed under the AAPS provided all of
the set-aside land is used for the production of
multiannual crops, such as short-rotation
coppice, for biomass production. Farmers may
also get grants of up to 50 per cent of the costs
associated with the establishment of such
crops on set-aside land.
In 1999, 60,632 AAPS claims for 4.5 million
hectares (11.1 million acres) were received in
the UK; £1,053 million was paid out. Payments
were 14 pei^ent less than in 1998 owing to the
end of the green pound and adoption of the
euro. The Government and the devolved
administrations paid £170 million to producers
to compensate for the shortfall.
Horticulture
In 1999 the land used for horticulture
(excluding hops, potatoes, and peas for
harvesting dry) was 178,869 hectares (441,985
acres), compared with 178,249 hectares in
1998. Vegetables grown in the open accounted
for 70.4 per cent of this, orchards for 15.6 per
cent, soft fruit for 5 per cent, ornamentals
(including hardy nursery stock, bulbs and
flowers grown in the open) for 7.3 per cent
and glasshouse crops for 1 per cent. More than
one vegetable crop may be taken from the
same area of land in a year, so that the
estimated area actually cropped for
horticulture in 1999 was 202,600 hectares
(500,265 acres).
The output value of horticultural products
(including seeds and peas harvested dry) was
£1,899 million. Some 3.9 million tonnes of
fruit and vegetables was imported.
Under the reformed EU fruit and
vegetables regime, EU grants (up to 50 per
cent of eligible expenditure) are payable to
producer organisations (POs) which aim to
improve cultivation techniques, with emphasis
on environmentally sound practices, quality

improvements and marketing. Of 78 POs
recognised in the UK, 60 had programmes
running in 1999, with a total value of about
£30 million.
Agri-Industrial Materials
The Agri-Industrial Materials Branch (AIMS)
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAFF) seeks to encourage the
marketing of renewable energy raw materials
from crops. Under Agenda 2000 (ste p. 458),
farmers can continue to put all of their set-
aside into biomass production, and the area of
industrial crops planted on set-aside has risen
to 21 per cent of set-aside land. MAFF, which
promotes short-rotation coppice as an energy
crop and miscanthus as a crop for energy and
industry, intends to allocate £30 million to the
growing of energy crops as part of the EU’s
Rural Development Regulation (see p. 457) in
England.
Genetically Modified Crops
Now that the location and function of
individual crop genes are being discovered,
scientists have the chance to alter the genetic
make-up of plants by adding or removing
specific genes. Some 40 million hectares of
genetically modified (GM) crops are estimated
to have been planted throughout the world in
1999.
There is no general cultivation of GM
crops in the UK at present. An agreement was
reached between the Supply Chain Initiative
on Modified Agricultural Crops (SCIMAC, a
grouping of industry organisations) and the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions (DETR). A strictly limited
programme of farm-scale evaluations of GM
herbicide tolerant crops, on about 40 farms, to
test their effects on the farmland environment,
began in 1999 for spring and winter oilseed
rape and for maize. This will compare GM
with conventional crops for their effects on
farmland biodiversity. Farmers growing these
crops use SCIMAC guidelines, with MAFF
support. These are designed to ensure best
agricultural practice and that the crops are
grown safely. The Government believes that
they could form the basis of future legislation
and intends to work with its EU partners in
taking this forward.
The SCIMAC-DETR agreement, renewed
in November 1999, stipulates that no
unrestricted cultivation of GM crops can
proceed until farm-scale evaluations are
complete and that no direct commercial
benefit will be sought from these plantings by
the holders of consents for release or
marketing of the GM organisms. The
evaluations are expected to continue until
2002.
In May 2000 some 30,000 acres of Great
Britain were accidentally affected by 1 per
cent of herbicide resistant GM seed imported
from Canada. After taking legal advice the
Government directed the farmers concerned
to destroy their crops or to sell them outside
Europe. Advanta Seeds UK, the importing
company concerned, agreed a £3 million
compensation package for the 500 farmers
affected. MAFF also advised farmers that
oilseed rape, soya and maize seed imported
from countries such as the United States and
Canada should be regarded as potentially
contaminated.
Among the tasks of the independent
Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology
Commission, which will advise the
Government on a new GM strategy, are:
• to advise ministers on whether to
continue the three-year moratorium on
the commercial growing of GM crops in
the UK;
• to decide separation distances between
GM and non-GM crops; and
• to recommend the level of GM impurity
in seeds.
FOOD SAFETY
The Food Standards Agency (FSA), a non-
ministerial government department with
powers to protect food safety and standards
throughout the food chain, was launched in
2000. With an annual budget of £125 million,
it is the primary source of advice to
government throughout the UK on food
safety and standards. Its remit covers the
protection of public health and the interests of
consumers in relation to food, and also food
454
27: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
labelling and composition, and advice on
nutrition. EU food law harmonisation covers
food safety, fair trading and informative
labelling.
BSE
The decline in the number of UK cases,
starting in 1993, continues. In late 1999, about
45 suspect cases were being reported each
week, compared with over 1,000 at the peak of
the epidemic in early 1993. In October 2000
the Government published the report of an
independent inquiry into the handling of the
BSE epidemic between 1986 and 1996 and a
possible link between it and a variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans.
By 28 September 2000, the number of definite
and probable cases of death from vCJD was
77. Among the measures introduced by
government have been:
• a selective slaughter programme, to
accelerate eradication of BSE from the
national herd;
• introduction of an effective animal
identification and movement recording
system;
• legislation for removal of all mammalian
meat and bone meal from farms and
feedmills;
• strengthening and tightening controls on
slaughterhouses to ensure removal of
specified risk materials (SRM);
• a beef labelling scheme to provide
customers with reliable information
about the beef they buy; and
• effective implementation of the Over
Thirty Month Scheme to remove meat
from older bovine animals (of which
some 4 million have so far been
processed) from the food chain and
destroy it.
A ban on the retail sale of beef-on-the-bone
was lifted in December 1999, although the ban
on the use of bones in manufacturing food
products remains. Export from the UK of
deboned beef produced under the Date-based
Export Scheme (DBES) began in August
1999. A precondition was that the UK must
slaughter all offspring born to confirmed
BSE cases between 1 August 1996 and 25
November 1998, a process completed by June
1999. The UK is further required to slaughter
offspring of BSE cases confirmed since
25 November 1998 without delay.
Application of the EU prohibition of the
use of SRMs from cattle, sheep and goats over
12 months was postponed because of the
unforeseen impact of the legislation on the
supply of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, and
the failure of subsequent Commission
proposals to achieve qualified majority
support from member states, but is now in
place. The UK forbids the import of SRMs
except when delivered to approved premises
for manufacture of technical products, such as
bone china.
Tight hygiene rules on the production and
marketing of fresh meat implement EU rules
updated to allow hygiene controls to adapt to
modern production methods and to make it
possible to trace meat products back to their
source for public health control. The Meat
Hygiene Service (MHS) and its 1,700
veterinary surgeons and inspectors are
responsible for enforcing legislation on meat
hygiene, inspection, animal welfare at
slaughter and SRM controls in all licensed
abattoirs and cutting premises in Great
Britain. The MHS Hygiene Assessment
System score is a published guide to the
hygiene performance of plants measured over
a period. Irrespective of a plant’s score,
however, before any meat produced there
enters the food chain, it must be inspected and
health-marked as fit for human consumption.
In addition, businesses making, selling or
using animal feed additives have to apply for
official approval or registration.
The EU is to set up a monitoring
programme on a sample of animals that die on
farms; this involves compulsory post-mortems
on about 65,000 cattle over 2 years of age, a
move welcomed by the UK which has already
introduced such tests. The EU has also agreed
to bring in, between September 2000 and
January 2002, compulsory beef labelling, to
show not only the country where the animal
was slaughtered but also where it was born.
Labels on minced beef will also have to show
where the meat was processed.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
EXPORTS
Food, feed and drink exports in 1999 dropped
by 5 per cent to £8.8 billion (compared with
£17.3 billion for imports). EU countries
account for 63 per cent of all UK food and
drink exports. In 1999 the main markets were
the Irish Republic (£1.3 billion) and France
(£1.2 billion). Sales to the United States
increased by 10 per cent to £800 million and
to Asia by 15 per cent, to £858 million.
Sales of soft drinks increased by over 30 per
cent in 1999, fruit juices by 14 per cent,
prepared vegetables by 8 per cent, cheese by
7 per cent, general groceries by 6 per cent and
fish by 3 per cent. Beef exports were worth
£18.4 million. In March 2000 the European
Parliament ended a 25-year dispute between
the UK and some other EU countries by
approving the sale of British chocolate, made
with vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, in
Europe.
Export promotion for food and drink is
headed by Food from Britain (FFB), an
organisation funded by MAFF on behalf of
the four agricultural departments (£5.4
million in 1999-2000) and industry (£6.1
million), which provides business
development services for food and drink
companies seeking expansion in international
markets and within the UK speciality food
and drink sector. It co-ordinates the British
presence at ten or more international food and
drink exhibitions each year and organises the
annual FFB Export Awards. For all other
agricultural products, services, livestock,
machinery and processing equipment, the four
agriculture departments (see p. 457) co¬
ordinate export promotion, participate in
overseas trade fairs and arrange ministerial
trade missions to other countries.
The annual Royal Agricultural Show, held
at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire in early July,
enables visitors to see the latest techniques and
improvements in British agriculture. Some
160,400 visitors attended in 2000, of whom
9 per cent were from overseas. Other major
agricultural events include the Royal
Smithfield Show, held every other year in
London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcases; the Royal
Highland Show (June; 145,000 visitors in
2000) in Edinburgh, the largest trade
exhibition of agricultural machinery in Great
Britain; the Royal Welsh Show (late July) in
Builth Wells; the Welsh Winter Fair for
livestock and carcases (December), also at
Builth Wells; and the Royal Ulster
Agricultural Show (May) in Belfast.
MARKETING
The Government launched the Agriculture
Development Scheme 1999 for England to
improve competitiveness through better
marketing. Some £2 million is available under
this scheme and government funds must be
matched by at least equal funding from private
sources. In Scotland similar help is given
under the Marketing Development Scheme—
with some £0.9 million available in 2000—01—
which requires matching funding from the
private sector. MAFF has continued to help
the UK speciality food industry through FFB
and regional food groups. Speciality
companies have an annual turnover of about
£3.6 billion and a workforce of 52,000.
From June 2000 the British Farm
Standard label (a tractor logo in red and
blue), unveiled in over 4,000 supermarkets
mostly in England, has enabled shoppers
to support the British farming sector. It
tells them that food has been produced
under a farm assurance scheme and allows
them to identify fruit, vegetables and meat
produced to standards approved by the
National Farmers’ Union and to trace any
item back to the farm of origin, check a
beef herd’s health record or verify
pesticide use. Independent inspectors
monitor the scheme. In Scotland, separate
quality assurance marks, backed by
certification and inspection regimes,
already exist for beef, lamb, pork, cereals,
trout and salmon. The British Farm
Standard provides a complementary
additional marketing tool for those
Scottish companies that wish to use it
rather than a replacement mark.

ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
MAFF, the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs
Department (SERAD), the National
Assembly for Wales, and the Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD)
in Northern Ireland have varying degrees of
responsibility for agriculture and fisheries
matters. The Government has responsibility
for matters not devolved or transferred to the
devolved administrations, such as relations
with the EU and other international
organisations. Concordats between MAFF
and the new administrations cover
arrangements since devolution. The work of
MAFF’s nine Regional Service Centres in
England and SERAD’s eight areas in Scotland
relates to payments under domestic and EU
schemes, licensing and other services for
farmers and growers.
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
Developments
Reform of the CAP has not gone as far as the
UK would have liked. However, the EU’s
Agenda 2000 is still considered an important
step forward. It emphasises the need to
respond to further liberalisation of trade; a
shift from price support to direct payments
(accounting for about 60 per cent of the
European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund’s (EAGGF) £25 billion
annual budget), thus reducing the CAP’s
economic distortions; and an integrated rural
development policy, to bring about a change
from support for food production to
environmental and rural economy measures.
Cross-compliance (under the EU Horizontal
Measures Regulation) attaches environmental
conditions to support payments. The
Government looks for CAP reform to deliver
annual net savings to the UK economy of
£200 million in 2001, rising to £500 million in
2008: or £1 billion in savings to consumers
when all the changes have been implemented.
In December 1999 the Government
announced plans for England for a radical
redirection of support for agriculture and a
significant increase in expenditure under the
EU Rural Development Regulation (RDR).

2000-06 were submitted to the European
Commission. Similar plans have been drawn
up in Wales and Northern Ireland; in
December 1999 Scotland also submitted its
proposals under the RDR to the Commission.
The England Plan envisages regional
implementation of measures to support
marketing and processing of agricultural
products, training and rural development. A
system known as modulation will be
introduced, which is a deduction at a flat rate
from all direct payments to farmers under
CAP commodity regimes from 2001, starting
at 2.5 per cent, rising to 4.5 per cent in 2005
and 2006. Each pound contributed by farmers
will be matched in funds by the Government.
Among allocations to the Rural Development
plans are £140 million to organic farming, £85
million to woodlands and £150 million to a
new rural enterprise scheme. Proposed
expenditure over seven years is put at more
than £1.6 billion, of which about £1 billion
will support agri-environment measures.
457
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Among components of the Scottish Plan are
proposals for supporting Less Favoured Areas
(LFAs), forestry and diversification.
Agenda 2000
The main points in the Agenda 2000
agreement are:
• cereal support prices to fall by 15 per
cent, half in 2000—01, and half in
2001-02;
• the basic price of beef to fall by 20 per
cent in three steps, and the intervention
price2 by 25 per cent;
• dairy support prices to fall by 15 per cent
in three steps, beginning in 2005, and
quotas for milk production to increase by
1.5 per cent over three years from 2005,
with extra increases for the UK (for
Northern Ireland only), the Irish
Republic, Spain, Italy and Greece.
The cuts in price support aim to bring
market forces to bear on EU agriculture and
make farmers more responsive to consumer
wishes. Reductions in cereals support prices
set the normal rate of compulsory set-aside at
10 per cent during 2000-06. The cut of 20 per
cent for beef, though the most radical step
since the beef regime was instituted in 1968, is
not, in the UK’s view, enough to bring EU
beef prices to world levels, although at the
new level the EU will provide private storage
facilities, while not guaranteeing to buy in
meat as in the existing intervention
arrangements.
Under a system of‘national envelopes’, a
small part of the increase in direct payments to
farmers will be given to member states to
distribute according to national criteria suiting
farmers’ needs.
Agrimoney
Since 1 January 1999 CAP payments have
been paid in euros or sub-denominations
(participating currencies) in the 11 member
2 The price at which intervention authorities in member
states buy commodities when their prices fall below certain
agreed levels and store them for later resale.
states which have adopted the European single
currency. The new agrimonetary regime uses
daily market rates to convert CAP payments
into national currencies in the four non¬
participating countries: the UK, Denmark,
Greece and Sweden. The new measures allow
for compulsory compensation, 100 per cent
funded by the EU budget in 2000, for falls in
the 1999 direct payments resulting from the
transition. The Government announced
compensation for the industry in the UK of
£264 million in autumn 1999: £32 million to
sheep producers; £62 million to beef
producers; and £170 million to arable
producers. Up to a further £132 million will
be paid in 2000 and 2001.
Special Aid to Farmers
In March 2000 the Government announced
extra aid of £203.5 million (including £16
million from the EU) to UK farmers to help
towards offsetting recent losses in income:
• £26 million to the pig industry in the
first year of a three-year scheme;
• £22 million for dairy farmers;
• £44 million for beef and sheep farmers;
• £60 million for hill farmers; and
• £20 million compensation for cattle
banned from the food chain in the
aftermath of the BSE crisis.
This aid is in addition to other recent
government steps outlined above.
Agri-Environment Schemes
The UK’s agri-environment programmes
provide schemes to encourage
environmentally beneficial farming and public
enjoyment of the countryside. All are
voluntary and offer payments to farmers who
agree to manage their land for the positive
benefit of wildlife, landscape, resource
protection, historic features or public access.
The payments are based on the agricultural
income which farmers forgo by participating
in the schemes and are partly funded by the
EU. The Government normally evaluates and
reviews these schemes every five years.

Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs)
By the end of 1999 over 19,000 farmers
throughout the UK had signed ESA
management agreements to promote
environmentally beneficial farming. Payments
covering these agreements and conservation
plans totalled some £60 million in 1999-2000.
Sums range between £8 and £500 a hectare,
and are designed to compensate for reduced
profitability as a result of adopting less
intensive production methods. They are
generally funded half by the Government and
half by the EAGGF. In Wales the ESA
scheme closed to new applications in 1999. An
all-Wales agri-environmental scheme, Tir
Gofal (Land in Care), opened to applications
in April 1999.
Countryside Stewardship
Countryside Stewardship is the main
government incentive scheme for farmers in
England for the wider English countryside
outside the ESAs. Payments on over 8,600
agreements covering 152,800 hectares (377,570
acres) in operation at 31 March 2000 are
expected to total some £26.1 million in
1999-2000. In 1999, 84 agreements in the
Arable Stewardship pilot scheme aim to reverse
the decline in a number of wildlife species in
East Anglia and the West Midlands, with £0.5
million set aside for new agreements in each of
the three years of the scheme. Two more
experiments, to test an integrated approach to
economic and environmental issues in the
uplands, are taking place in Bodmin (Cornwall)
and Bowland (Lancashire).
Organic Aid
Sales of organic food in the UK are rising by
about 40 per cent a year, but 75 per cent is
imported. In early 2000 the area of UK
farmland organically managed or in the
process of conversion was about 500,000
hectares, twice as much as in early 1999 (3 per
cent of the agricultural area). The Organic
Farming Scheme (OFS) in England and
parallel schemes in Wales and Northern
Ireland, launched in 1999, raised the pay ment
rates to those farmers wishing to convert to
organic methods from £250 to £450 a hectare
over five years for most arable land and
temporary grass, and from £50 to £350 for
most improved land in the uplands. Total
expenditure on UK organic schemes in
1999—2000 was £15.7 million (of which Wales
accounted for £2.9 million, Scotland £1.8
million and Northern Ireland £170,000).
The Government also funds the Organic
Conversion Information Service, which
provides information and advisory visits to
prospective organic farmers in England and
Wales. The UK Register of Organic Food
Standards is charged with overseeing standards
of organic food production. MAFF’s budget
for R&D on organic agriculture was increased
to £2.2 million in 1999.
Other Schemes
The final round of the Nitrate Sensitive Areas
(NSA) Scheme in England (to run until
September 2003) attracted applications
covering 3,000 hectares (7,413 acres) and
brought the total area of land subject to NS A
459
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
undertakings to 28,000 hectares (69,190 acres),
with payments of £6.2 million in 1999-2000.
Under the UK Habitat Schemes, 1,616
farmers entered 17,143 hectares (42,360 acres)
into agreements. Successful elements of the
English Habitat Scheme were integrated into
Countryside Stewardship from 1 January
2000. The Welsh, Scottish and Northern
Ireland schemes have been closed to new
applicants.
In Scotland there are three agri¬
environment schemes: the ESAs, the Organic
Aid Scheme (OAS) and the Countryside
Premium Scheme, with provision for £20.2
million expenditure in 2000-01. Wales has the
ESAs, the OFS and Tir Gofal, with provision
for £9.5 million expenditure over 2000-01.
Northern Ireland has the ESAs, the OFS and
the Countryside Management Scheme.
The UK-wide Farm Woodland Premium
Scheme encourages farmers to convert
agricultural land to woodland by providing
annual payments for ten or 15 years to
compensate for income forgone. Payments are
50 per cent funded by the European
Commission under the CAP (75 per cent in
disadvantaged areas). From April 1992 to
March 2000 over 9,500 applications were
approved to convert over 66,700 hectares
(164,815 acres). Nearly 75 per cent of planting
is broadleaved trees.
The Rural Economy and EU Structural
Funds
Northern Ireland, the Highlands and Islands of
Scotland and Merseyside qualified for assistance
under Objective 1 of the EU Structural Funds
for the period 1994-99. This aims to help those
regions whose economic development lags
behind the EU average. For the period
2000-06, four areas have been designated for
Objective 1 support: Merseyside, Cornwall,
South Yorkshire and West Wales and Valleys.
Eleven areas in Great Britain (including
South West England, the English Northern
Uplands, 70 per cent of the landmass of
Wales, and Borders, Dumfries and Galloway
and parts of Grampian, rural Stirling and
Upper Tayside in Scotland) were eligible to
receive funds under Objective 5b of the EU
Structural Funds for the period 1994-99. This
aims to promote the economic development of
rural areas. To be eligible, areas must have a
high share of agricultural employment in total
employment, a low level of agricultural
income and a low population density. In
England by the end of 1999, 369 Objective 5b
projects had been approved and nearly £102
million in EU and national public funding had
been allocated to them. This included £4.83
million, comprising EU and MAFF and
other public and private sector funding, to go
towards the Bowland and Bodmin Moor
upland pilot projects (see p. 460). In
Scotland by the end of 1999, 100 marketing
and processing projects had been approved
and over £11.4 million committed, together
with 427 projects and over £7.7 million under
the Regional Development Programme. For
the period 2000-06 the designation of rural
areas falls under the new Objective 2
programme.
Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS)
The IACS, an EU-wide anti-fraud measure,
requires farmers claiming payment under area-
based CAP schemes to submit an annual
application for aid giving field-by-field details
of their farmed land. This provides the basis for
administrative and on-farm checks on their
entitlement to aid and for cross-checks between
claims under the agri-environment and IACS
schemes. Administrative verifications are done
by computerised database, while those on the
spot are done through farm visits by field
officers and the use of observation satellites.
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances
(HLCAs)
In LFAs, generally hills and uplands, farmers
have traditionally received headage payments
on breeding cattle and sheep to support the
continuation of livestock farming, thus
conserving the countryside and encouraging
people to remain in the LFAs. Under Agenda
2000, HLCAs will be replaced in 2001 by a
new area-based scheme which will have a
clearer environmental, as well as socio¬
economic, objective.

27: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Agricultural Trade Liberalisation
World Trade Organisation (WTO; see p. 421)
negotiations on agricultural trade liberalisation
in 2000 are likely to consider further
commitments to improve access for agricultural
products, cuts in subsidised exports and
reductions in domestic support.
Ecuador, the world’s largest banana exporter,
has asked the WTO for permission to impose
US$200 million-worth of trade retaliation
against EU goods and services because of what
it sees as the EU’s discriminatory banana import
regime. It accounts for 19 per cent of banana
imports to the EU, compared with a 36 per cent
average share in the rest of the world. The EU
has yet to propose a solution, compatible with
EU regulations, acceptable to its critics, while
the WTO has upheld the complaint of the
United States about the damage suffered by its
own banana companies. EU member states have
asked the Commission, after consultation with
all interested parties, including the United
States and Latin American, African, Caribbean
and Pacific suppliers, to draft legislation for
reform of the regime.
Hormone Growth Promoters
The UK, which has consistently voted against
the EU ban on meat from animals treated with
hormone growth promoters on the grounds
that it is not scientifically justified, continues to
work for a resolution of the dispute over meat
imports between the EU and Canada and the
United States which is based on sound science.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in the UK in 1999-2000 under
the CAP was £3,172 million, compared with
.£3,482 million in 1998—99; expenditure by the
agriculture and other departments (including
funding for special areas) on conservation
measures is estimated at £248.5 million, £36.1
million less than in 1998-99.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want
to farm on their own account. Councils may
lend working capital to them. At 31 March
1998 there were approximately 4,350
smallholdings in England and 780 in Wales.
Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Scottish Executive, which still
owns and maintains about 105,000 hectares
(259,455 acres) of land settlement estates,
comprising 1,400 crofts and holdings.
In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland,
much of the land is tenanted by crofters, who
enjoy the statutory protection provided by
crofting legislation and can benefit from
government agriculture and livestock
improvement schemes. Most crofters are part-
time agriculturalists, using croft income to
supplement earnings from other activities. The
Crofters Commission has a statutory duty to
promote their interests and to keep all crofting
matters under review. The Transfer of
Crofting Estates (Scotland) Act 1997 allows the
Government to move some of its own crofting
land to trusts set up by resident crofters, with
the aim of giving them more responsibility for
their own affairs. The Scottish Executive is
planning legislation to allow other crofting
communities to buy their own croft land.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About 34 per cent of agricultural land in
England and 21 per cent in Wales is rented.
The Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 provides
a simplified legal framework for new tenancies
entered into on or after 1 September 1995,
known as farm business tenancies, on which
landowners benefit from full income tax relief.
There is a similar proportion of rented land
in Scotland, much of it under crofting tenure,
including common grazings. The Scottish
Executive is committed to changing the law
relating to agricultural tenure.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows owners
not wishing to farm all their land to let it
annually to others. Conacre land, about one-fifth
of agricultural land, is used mainly for grazing.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales the Farming and Rural
Conservancy Agency provides services to
461
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
government on the design, development and
implementation of policies on the integration
of farming and conservation, environmental
protection, rural land use and the
diversification of the rural economy. In
England and Wales ADAS provides
professional, business, scientific and technical
services in the agriculture, food and drink, and
environmental markets. In Scotland the
Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) provides
professional, business, scientific and technical
services in the agriculture, rural business, food
and drink, and environmental markets. CAIS
is a free and integrated service for Wales;
DARD has a similar remit in Northern
Ireland.
Lantra is the UK National Training
Organisation for the land-based sector. It
represents about 1.5 million individuals and
400,000 businesses, mostly in rural areas. It
receives government support under contracts
to MAFF and the Scottish Executive.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain enforces controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including checks
on all individual consignments originating
from outside the EU and frequent checks on
those from other EU member states at
destination points. Measures can be taken to
prevent the import of diseased animals and
genetic material from regions or countries
affected by disease. Veterinary checks also
include unannounced periods of surveillance
at ports.
The British Cattle Movement Service
(BCMS) for Great Britain, at Workington
(Cumbria), has provided over 6 million cattle
with ‘passports’ since its launch in 1998. It has
also processed over 5 million passports of
slaughtered cattle and entered nearly 9 million
cattle movements on to the Cattle Tracing
System (CTS). The Government has met all
BCMS and CTS costs and has undertaken not
to introduce a central charge for passports
before 2004.
Bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, mainly
in parts of south-west England and the
Midlands, and south Wales, continues to
increase. The Government spends over £30
million a year on TB in cattle. Two-thirds of
this sum is spent on TB testing, slaughtering
cattle that react to the test and on
compensation. The other third is being spent
on a comprehensive research programme
aimed at reaching a better understanding of
what causes the disease and how it is
transmitted; on developing a vaccine; and on
investigating the contribution that badger
culling can make to reducing the incidence in
cattle herds.
Professional advice and action on the
statutory control of animal disease and the
welfare of farm livestock are the responsibility
of the State Veterinary Service. It is supported
by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(VLA), which also offers its services to the
private sector on a commercial basis. Similar
support is provided in Scotland by the SAC
and in Northern Ireland by DARD’s
Veterinary Sciences Division.
The Pet Travel Scheme
Dogs and cats from the EU and certain other
western European countries can, as long as
they meet certain conditions, now enter the
UK without quarantine under the Pet Travel
Scheme (PETS). Animals from other
countries will continue to be subject to
quarantine, although the scheme is to be
extended to certain rabies-free islands early in
2001. The position of dogs and cats from the
United States and Canada will be reviewed in
2001. To enter the UK under the scheme,
animals need to be resident in any of the
qualifying countries for at least six months and
be:
• microchipped;
• vaccinated against rabies;
• blood-tested at an approved laboratory;
• issued with an official PETS entry
certificate confirming that these
requirements have been met; and
• treated against certain parasites.
Animals can be brought into the UK under
PETS only on prescribed routes.

27: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Pesticides
The Pesticides Safety Directorate, an
executive agency of MAFF, is responsible for
the evaluation and approval of agricultural
pesticides in England. It also carries out
evaluations and approvals on behalf of the
devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. There is rigorous
evaluation of new and existing pesticides
under UK and EU legislation. Arrangements
are currently in hand to put before Parliament
regulations to strengthen enforcement and
provide greater public access to information.
Buffer zones for certain pesticides, to protect
aquatic life from spray drift, allow farmers
greater flexibility in the way the zones are
applied while maintaining high environmental
protection and encouraging the development
of low-drift spray technology.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate, also an
executive agency of MAFF, is responsible for
ensuring that veterinary medicines are
marketed only if they meet statutory standards
for safety, quality and efficacy. The
Government is advised by the independent
scientific Veterinary Products Committee on
the standards to be adopted in the
authorisation procedures and, for example, on
the use of organophosphorus (OP) compounds
in veterinary medicines. In December 1999,
the Government announced the withdrawal of
OP sheep dips from the market pending
improved container design to protect users
against potential health hazards when
handling the dip concentrate.
The Fishing Industry
The UK is one of the EU’s largest fishing
countries, taking about a quarter of the total
catch in major species and committing £10
million in 1999 to fisheries science and to
monitoring and developing stocks. It also has
an interest in more than 100 allowable catches
set by the Commission (see p. 464). In 1999
the British fishing industry provided about 40
per cent by quantity of total UK fish supplies,
and household consumption of fish in the UK
was provisionally estimated at 312,000 tonnes.
Fisheries departments are responsible for the
administration of legislation, in partnership with
the European Commission, concerning the
fishing industry, including fish and shellfish
farming. The Sea Fish Industry Authority, an
industry-financed body, undertakes R&D,
provides training and promotes the marketing
and consumption of sea fish.
Fish Caught
In 1999 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 48 per cent
by weight of total landings by British fishing
vessels, pelagic fish (caught near the surface)
for 38 per cent and shellfish for 15 per cent.
Landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon
and trout) by British fishing vessels into the
UK totalled 506,524 tonnes compared with
552,234 tonnes in 1998. Cod and haddock
represented 21 per cent and 20 per cent
respectively of the total value of demersal and
pelagic fish landed. The quayside value of
landings of all sea fish, including shellfish, by
British vessels in 1999 was £586 million.
Catches of crabs, lobsters, scampi and other
shellfish have increased to supply a rising
demand. In 1985 British fishermen landed
76,000 tonnes of shellfish worth about £66
million. By 1999, the figures were 135,000
tonnes worth £153 million. From 2000 a
national licensing scheme has limited the
shellfish fleet at 3,000, mainly small boats.
New minimum landing sizes for shellfish to be
introduced across Europe in 2002, and which
make it illegal to land a lobster smaller than
87 mm (3.4 in.), have applied in the UK
from 2000.
The Fishing Fleet
The UK fisheries departments currently
spend some £24 million a year on fisheries
enforcement, primarily on monitoring the
application of the Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP—see p. 464) and ensuring that measures
designed to conserve fish stocks are effective.
All British vessels fishing for profit must be
licensed by the fisheries departments. To help
463
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
conserve stocks and contain the size of the
fleet, only replacement licences are issued.
Quotas are allocated annually between
producer organisations and other groups of
fishermen, on the basis of the fixed quota
units of vessels in their membership.
A satellite monitoring system, to track the
movements of EU vessels over 24 m in length,
as well as those from third countries fishing in
EU waters, has been operating since 1 January
2000, as, since 5 January 1999, have new
controls over the landing of fish. It is a
condition of UK fishing licences that, subject
to derogations for landings at designated ports
during designated hours, at least four hours’
notice must be given of all landings into UK
ports by vessels 20 m in length and above.
Measures to strengthen and improve
standards of fisheries control throughout the
EU provide for greater transparency of action
taken by member states to monitor compliance
with the CFP.
Britain aims to achieve the EU target for
reducing its fleet through cutting its numbers
and limiting the time some vessels spend at
sea. At the end of 1999 the UK fleet consisted
of 7,448 registered vessels, including 323
vessels greater than 27 m (88.5 ft) overall
length, of which 196 are registered. There are
an estimated 15,961 professional fishermen in
Britain.
Fish Farming and Shellfish Production
There are over 1,000 fish and shellfish
farming businesses in the UK, on 1,400 sites
and employing more than 3,000 people. Total
value is about £300 million at first sale. The
main finfish species are salmon (115,000
tonnes, mainly in Scotland) and rainbow trout
(16,000 tonnes), with a limited production of
other species, such as carp and brown trout.
There is also interest in farming marine
species such as turbot and halibut.
Fishery Limits
British fishery limits extend to 200 miles or
the median line (broadly halfway between the
UK coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from
baselines on or near the coast of Britain.
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
The rise in demand for fish throughout the
world by a growing population, and intensive
fishing, have led over the years to overfishing
and dwindling supplies.
The EU’s CFP system for the management
of fishing resources sets total allowable catches
(TACs) each year in order to conserve stocks.
TACs are then allocated as quotas between
member states, taking account of traditional
fishing patterns. In December 1999, the EU
agreed substantial cuts in the number of fish
caught in the North Sea and other UK waters
to help rebuild stocks. These included a 60 per
cent cut in the TAC for Irish sea cod; a 38 per
cent cut for North Sea cod; and cuts of up to
20 per cent in English Channel catches.
In 1999-2000, new North Sea and Western
approaches TACs were introduced to help
conserve stocks of species hitherto less
popular in the UK, such as spur dogfish in the
North Sea.
The UK and Irish Republic have invoked
the Hague preference, a deal struck in 1976
which allows them to demand a share of other
countries’ quotas with no penalties. They have
also agreed to participate in a scheme to revive
cod stocks in the Irish Sea.
Since 1997 the number of over 10 m UK
vessels partly or wholly owned by overseas
interests has fallen from 160 to 122. From
1999 all vessels fishing against UK quotas
have been required, with Commission
approval, to show that a satisfactory economic
link is maintained with British coastal
communities: by landing at least 50 per cent of
their catch of quota stocks in the UK; by
employing a crew of whom 50 per cent are
resident in a UK coastal area; or by spending
50 per cent of operating expenses in UK
coastal areas.
British vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the British coast. Certain
other EU member states have historic rights in
British waters between 6 and 12 miles. British
vessels have similar rights in other member
states’ 6 to 12 mile belts. Between 12 and 200
miles, EU vessels may fish wherever they have
access rights. Non-EU countries’ vessels may
fish in these waters if they negotiate reciprocal
fisheries agreements with the EU.
464
27: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Technical conservation measures
supplement TACs and controls on the time
spent at sea. They include minimum mesh
sizes for nets and net configuration
restrictions, minimum landing sizes and closed
areas designed mainly to protect young fish.
Each member state is responsible for
enforcement of CFP rules on its own fishermen
and those of other member states in its own
waters. EU inspectors monitor compliance.
Fisheries Agreements
CFP provisions are supplemented by a
number of fisheries agreements between the
EU and third countries, the most important
for the UK being with Norway (for cod,
haddock and saithe), Greenland and the
Faroes. EU catch quotas, especially for cod,
have also been established around Spitsbergen
(Svalbard). New external waters licences are
available to enable UK vessels to fish in those
external waters not fully subscribed, in
accordance with international conventions and
agreements.
Salmon, Freshwater Fisheries and the
Aquatic Environment
There is no public right to fish in freshwater
lakes and non-tidal rivers in Great Britain.
Those wishing to fish such waters must first
obtain permission from the owner of the fishing
rights and, in England and Wales, a licence
from the Environment Agency. In Scotland
salmon fisheries are managed locally by District
Salmon Fishery Boards. In Northern Ireland
fishing for freshwater species is licensed by the
Fisheries Conservancy Board for Northern
Ireland and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish
Lights Commission in their respective areas,
and 62 public angling waters, including salmon,
trout and coarse fisheries, are available to
Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
permit holders.
Research
Departmental funding of R&D in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1999-2000 included £125
million commissioned by MAFF and £6
million conducted by DARD. In Scotland
about £50 million is invested in the
Agricultural and Biological Sciences-related
research programme and £30.5 million in
fishery research. Priority areas in the MAFF
programme are public health (covering food
safety, transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies and zoonoses) and
protection of the environment (improved
sustainability in production methods, with
benefits for the environment and agricultural
efficiency).
Research Bodies
The BBSRC (see p. 441) supports research in
biotechnology and biological sciences related
to food and agriculture. The Natural
Environment Research Council includes some
agricultural aspects in its remit. Research
institutes sponsored by these councils receive
income from work commissioned by MAFF,
industry and other bodies.
ADAS carries out R&D, at a network of
research centres and on clients’ premises, for
MAFF and other organisations and
companies. There are research centres across
England and Wales. MAFF receives scientific
expertise and technical support from its other
agencies, the VLA and the Central Science
Laboratory. Horticulture Research
International, a non-departmental public
body, transfers the results of its R&D to the
British horticulture industry and the wider
public.
SERAD support for agricultural, biological
and related sciences is primarily through
sponsorship of the five Scottish Agricultural
and Biological Research Institutes, the SAC
and the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.
It contracts additional research through these
bodies and provides funding for Education
and Advisory Services at the SAC. In
Northern Ireland DARD maintains an
integrated Science and Technology
programme to improve the economic
performance of the agri-food, fishing and
forestry sectors, to conserve the rural
environment and to strengthen the economy
and social infrastructure of disadvantaged
rural areas. Fisheries research is undertaken
465
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
by the Fisheries Research Service (FRS) in
Scotland and by the Centre for Environment,
Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS)
in England and Wales.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.7 million
hectares (6.6 million acres) in the UK: a little
less than 8 per cent of England, nearly 17 per
cent of Scotland, 14 per cent of Wales and
6 per cent of Northern Ireland. The EU’s
forests are estimated to be increasing by about
460 million cubic metres (17 billion cubic feet)
a year, while the annual harvest has fallen to
300 million cubic metres (11 billion cubic feet)
owing to cheaper imports and an over-supply
of timber.
Britain’s forestry programme aims to
protect and expand forest resources and
conserve woodland as a home for wildlife and
for public recreation. The UK imports 85 per
cent of its timber and wood products, which
costs about £7.5 billion a year. Promoting the
market for home-grown timber is an
important part of the forestry programme.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.3 million hectares (5.7 million
acres), just under 35 per cent of which is
managed by the Forestry Commission. The
rate of new planting (including natural
regeneration) in 1998-99 was 96 hectares (237
acres) by the Commission and 15,914 hectares
(39,323 acres) by other woodland owners, with
the help of grants from the Commission. In
1998-99, 12,456 hectares (30,779 acres) of
broadleaved trees were planted, both new
planting and restocking.
Forestry and primary wood processing
employ about 35,000 people. Great Britain’s
woodlands produced 9.02 million cubic metres
(319 million cubic feet) of timber in 1998,
15 per cent of total UK consumption. The
volume of timber harvested on Commission
lands in 1998-99 was estimated at 5.35 million
cubic metres (190 million cubic feet).
The Commission’s Woodland Grant
Scheme pays grants (£41.6 million in
1998-99) to help create new woodlands and
forests, and regenerate existing ones. Under
the scheme a management grant is available
for work in woods of special conservation and
landscape value or where the public are
welcome.
The Forestry Commission and
Forestry Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in
1919, is the government department
responsible for forestry in Great Britain. With
1.06 million hectares of land (2.6 million
acres), it is the UK’s largest land manager and
the biggest single provider of countryside
recreation. The Commissioners advise on
forestry matters and are responsible to the
Scottish First Minister, the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the
National Assembly for Wales.
The Commission provides grants to private
woodland owners for tree planting and
woodland management, controls tree felling,
and sets standards for forestry as a whole.
Forest Enterprise, an agency of the
Commission, develops and manages the
Commission’s forests and forestry estate,
supplying timber and opportunities for
recreation, and enhancing nature conservation
and the forest environment. Forest Research is
the R&D agency of the Commission.
Financed partly by the Government and
partly by receipts from sales of timber and
other produce, and from rents, the
Commission’s grant in aid for 1998-99 was
£51.3 million, from which £400,000 was
deducted for reimbursement of EU co-
financing of private woodlands grants.
During 1981-99, 239,194 hectares
(591,048 acres), worth £289.6 million, of
Forestry Commission land were sold, of which
over 62 per cent was forest land. The
Government has imposed a moratorium on
large-scale forest sales.
Forestry Initiatives
With an estimated 1,000 sq km (386 sq miles)
of damaged land to be developed, the initial
focus of the Commission’s Land Regeneration
Unit is on the creation of new woodlands (of
30 hectares—74 acres—or larger) in the
central English coalfields and on wider plans
to create working forests of about 800—1,200
466
27: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
hectares (1,980-2,970 acres). It has identified
175,000 hectares (432,400 acres) of derelict
land suitable for trees that will stabilise and
decontaminate the soil. The planned National
Forest in England (520 sq km—200 sq miles)
covers parts of Staffordshire, Derbyshire and
Leicestershire, with the aim of increasing
woodland from 6 per cent to a third of its
area—16,500 hectares (40,775 acres). For
Community Forests, see p. 320.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
Woodland and forest cover about 82,000
hectares (203,000 acres) of Northern Ireland.
State-owned forest constitutes 61,000 hectares
(150,700 acres).
Forest Service
The Forest Service is an executive agency
within DARD and promotes the interests of
forestry through sustainable management and
expansion of state-owned forests. It
encourages private forestry through grant aid
for planting. The Forest Service offered
342,000 cubic metres (12 million cubic feet) of
timber for sale during 1999-2000, with
receipts of £4.1 million. Forestry and timber
processing employ about 1,100 people.

28 Manufacturing and
Construction
Introduction 468 Construction
Sectors of Manufacturing 468
Manufacturing continues to play an important role in the modern economy,
even though services now generate about three times as much gross domestic
product (GDP) and four times as much employment. Important industries in
the UK include chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, electronics, motor
vehicles and components, aerospace, offshore equipment, and paper and
printing, where British companies are among the world s largest.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for 18.8 per cent of
gross value added (at current basic prices) in
1999 and for 14.7 per cent of employment
(just over 4 million people) in the UK at the
end of 1999. The East Midlands and West
Midlands have the highest proportion of
manufacturing employees (around 24 per
cent) and London the lowest (7 per cent).
Almost all manufacturing is carried out by
private sector businesses. Overseas companies
have a strong presence (see p. 423), being
responsible for about a quarter of
manufacturing output in the UK.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a
decline in manufacturing output, but it began
to rise again in 1993. By 1999, the volume of
output was 10.1 per cent above the level in
1991 and 1992, and rose a little into 2000.
Some industries, notably electrical and optical
equipment—where output was up by 54 per
cent between 1992 and 1999—but also
including chemicals, rubber and plastic
products, and transport equipment, have
achieved substantial growth following the
recession. However, output of other sectors,
including textiles, leather and wood products,
remains well below their 1990 levels.
The construction industry contributed 5.2
per cent of gross value added in 1999.
Following a period of marked decline as
recession affected the industry in the early
1990s, output has picked up since 1993 and
was 9.6 per cent higher in 1999 than in 1993,
although still below pre-recession levels.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of enterprises are shown in
Tables 28.1 and 28.2 and output and
investment by sector in Table 28.3. An outline
of the main manufacturing sectors follows. A
brief statistical summary is included for most
sectors, taken from the appropriate Office for
National Statistics (ONS) sector review. In
some circumstances, statistics in these

Food, Drink and Tobacco
Food and Drink
The UK’s food and drink manufacturing and
processing industry has accounted for a
growing proportion of total domestic food
supply since the 1940s. The largest
concentration of enterprises is to be found in
the production of bread, cakes and fresh
pastry goods, followed by those engaged in
processing and preserving fruit and
vegetables. The greatest number of food and
beverage manufacturing jobs are in Yorkshire
(13 per cent of the total for Great Britain), the
South East and London (12 per cent), and the
East Midlands (12 per cent). Spirits
production gives Scotland the highest
concentration of employ ment in the alcoholic
and soft drinks manufacturing industry (about
31 per cent of drinks manufacturing
employment), with a significant proportion of
jobs in its economically deprived rural areas;
the South East and London has the second
highest concentration (about 14 per cent) of
drinks-related jobs. In 1999 by far the biggest
food and drinks export category was alcoholic
drinks, which accounted for £2.7 billion of the
value of total food and drink sales overseas,
£8.7 billion; the largest food exporting sector
was biscuits and confectionery, worth £705
million.
Among the biggest companies involved in
food and drink manufacturing and processing
are Unilever, Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle,
Associated British Foods, Tate and Lyle,
Unigate (the company announced in August
2000 that it would change its name to Uniq),
Northern Foods, United Biscuits (part of
which has been acquired by Heinz and a
consortium, Finalrealm), Hillsdown Holdings,
Hazlewood Foods, Ranks Hovis McDougall
(RHM—see p. 470), Diageo and Allied
Domecq. Specialist small and medium-sized
firms in the food and drink manufacturing
industry thrive alongside these large concerns,
supplying high-quality ‘niche’ products, often
to small retail outlets, such as delicatessens.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience
foods, such as frozen potato products and
ready-prepared meals, fish and shellfish
dishes, salads and pasta, together with
yogurts, desserts and instant snacks, have
formed some of the fastest-growing sectors of
the food market in recent years. The trend
towards snacking—eating less, more often—
and higher consumption outside the home
means snacks are filling the gap left by the

Consumption of pre-prepared meals in the
UK was 5 kg a head in 1999, second only to
Sweden within Europe. Many new low-fat
and fat-free items are being introduced,
ranging from dairy products to complete
prepared meals, and organic foods are also
becoming more widely available. There has
been a substantial rise in sales of vegetarian
foods (both natural vegetable dishes and
vegetable-based substitutes of meat products,
where soya plays a big role). For genetically
modified foods, see chapter 27.
Just under one-third (30 per cent) of liquid
milk supplies in Great Britain are distributed
through a doorstep delivery system employing
about 13,600 people. However, the proportion
is declining (staff have declined by 60 per cent
since 1991) as supermarkets increase their
share of the market. Household consumption
of liquid milk per head—2.2 litres (3.9 pints) a
week—is among the highest in the world.
Consumption of skimmed and semi-skimmed
milk accounted for 58 per cent of total milk
sales in 1999. The British dairy industry
accounts for 81 per cent of butter and 63 per
cent of cheese supplies to the domestic
market, and achieves significant sales in
overseas markets.
Bread production in 1999 was 1.8 million
tonnes. The two largest producers are Allied
Bakeries, owned by Associated British Foods,
and British Bakeries which is part of RHM,
owned by Doughty Hanson which acquired it
from Tomkins in August 2000. The UK’s
largest plant cake producer (Manor
Bakeries/Mr Kipling/Lyons) is also part of
RHM. The morning goods market (including
rolls, croissants, scones and teacakes) had an
estimated retail value of ^1.1 billion in 1998.
A recent innovation—long-life bread—now
accounts for 5 per cent of the plant bread
market. Production of bagels grew by 50 per
cent between 1998 and 1999 with UK sales of
bagels worth £20 million in 1999. A feature of
the bread-making market is a move towards
production in in-store bakeries, notably in
supermarkets. Part-baked bread (which allows

example, to in-store bakeries and restaurants.
Sandwiches are the UK’s most popular fast
food, with consumers spending more on
commercially made sandwiches than any other
fast food. There has been a steady increase in
the varieties available, and they are sold
through major supermarkets, sandwich bars
and other outlets. In 1999 the market for
sandwiches was valued at £3.6 billion and is
growing at around 11 per cent a year.
The brewing industry has four major
national brewery groups—Scottish &
Newcastle, Bass, Whitbread (both Bass and
Whitbread brewery operations are being
acquired by Interbrew of Belgium) and
Carlsberg-Tetley—and 470 regional and local
breweries. Brewers throughout the world use
British malt, which is made almost entirely
from home-grown barley. In 1998 lager
accounted for 61 per cent of all beer sales, but
there is still a demand for the vast range of
traditional cask-conditioned and brewery-
conditioned ales and stouts. Recently there has
been a shift towards stronger bottled beers, a
significant proportion of which is imported.
Another recent trend has been a sizeable
import of beer bought on the continent of
Europe, mainly in Calais, by British travellers.
The main brewers are modernising their
brewing and distribution facilities to meet the
changing pattern of demand, while also taking
action to develop their public houses (pubs)
and restaurants, concentrating increasingly on
‘branded’ or ‘themed’ pubs and restaurants.
The Scotch whisky industry is one of the
UK’s top export earners, with overseas sales
worth £2.\ billion in 1999. About 90 per cent
of production is exported to 200 markets
worldwide, the European Union (EU) taking
40 per cent, the United States 13 per cent and
Japan 6 per cent by volume. Some 12,000
people work in the Scotch whisky industry
and a further 48,000 are employed in
associated sectors, for instance supplying
ingredients and materials. There are over 90
Scotch whisky distilleries in Scotland,
producing either malt whisky or grain whisky.
Most Scotch whisky consumed is a blend of
malt and grain. Examples of well-known
blended brands are J & B, Johnnie Walker,
Chivas Regal, Ballantine’s, Famous Grouse,
Bell’s and Teacher’s. Glenfiddich,
Glenmorangie, Glen Grant and Macallan are
some of the best-known single malt Scotch
whiskies. Gin and vodka production are also
important parts of the spirits industry.
In a highly competitive market, English and
Welsh wines have a distinctive local identity.
Some 382 vineyards (including 125 wineries),
mainly in the south, produce an average of 1.3
million litres of wine a year, most of which is
white. Quality continues to improve with a
combination of more experienced winemakers,
modern technologies and better winemaking
equipment. Cider is made primarily in south¬
west England, and in Gloucestershire,
Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
The soft drinks industry produces still and
carbonated drinks, dilutable drinks, fruit
juices and juice drinks, natural mineral waters,
and spring and table waters. The UK market
was worth £7 A billion by retail value in 1999,
with Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages the
largest supplier. It is one of the fastest-growing
471
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
sectors of the grocery trade, responsible for
introducing many innovative products each
year. Bottled waters have experienced the
fastest growth within the sector during the
period 1994 to 1999, averaging increases in
volume of 13 per cent a year and sales of £500
million in the UK in 1999. In 1999 UK
consumption of soft drinks was 11.26 billion
litres, compared with 8.33 billion litres in
1989—an increase of 35 per cent; there was a
rise of 16 per cent in 1999 in the volume of the
still fruit drinks market.
Tobacco
The British tobacco industry manufactures
around 90 per cent of the cigarettes and
tobacco goods sold legitimately in the UK. In
recent years there has been a rapid growth in
‘bootlegging’ and smuggling. The Government
acknowledges that since 1996 it has lost
revenue in excess of £5.6 billion and that in
1999, 18 per cent of cigarettes and 75 per cent
of handrolling tobacco were illegally sold.
Three major manufacturers—Imperial
Tobacco Ltd, Gallaher Ltd and Rothmans
(UK) Ltd (now part of British American
Tobacco)—supply the market. British
American Tobacco, which mainly markets its
products outside the UK, is now the second
largest tobacco company in the world. The
industry specialises in the production of
cigarettes made from flue-cured tobacco, and
achieves significant export sales—£102
billion in 1999. Europe, the Middle East and
Africa are important overseas markets. The
UK tobacco industry remains one of the top
ten balance of payments earners in the UK
economy.
Textiles, Clothing and Footwear
Annual turnover in the UK textiles, clothing
and footwear industry is around £20 billion,
and about 304,000 people were employed in
December 1999. The sector has been
significantly affected by a number of factors,
including imports from low labour-cost
suppliers, changing sourcing patterns in the
UK high street and the weakness of the euro
and related European currencies. In 1999 the
volume of sales was 16 per cent below the level
in 1995. To meet these challenges, UK textile,
clothing and footwear manufacturers have had
to modernise their domestic operations, and in
some cases have invested in production
facilities abroad. In addition, to compete on
areas other than price, firms are shifting into
higher-value products to benefit from the
UK’s strengths in fashion, design product and
process innovation and information
technology. New technologies, largely
designed to improve response times and give
greater flexibility in production, are being
used throughout the industry.
For textiles, there is a high degree of
regional concentration, reflecting the
traditional centres for this sector: cotton
textiles in the North West, fine knitwear in
Scotland, linen in Northern Ireland, woollens

and worsteds in Yorkshire and Scotland, and
knitted fabrics in the East Midlands. The
clothing industry is more dispersed
throughout the UK, but also has significant
concentrations in the Midlands, north and east
London and the North East.
The UK textile and clothing industry
comprises a few multi-process companies, but
in the main companies operate vertically.
However, small and medium-sized firms
dominate, some of which subcontract work to
other companies or to home workers. Two of
the mainstays of the UK’s textile and clothing
industry, Coats Viyella and Courtaulds
Textiles, have undergone radical changes over
the last 12 months. Courtaulds has now been
taken over by the US conglomerate Sara Lee
and Coats Viyella has taken a strategic
decision to withdraw from a number of
markets, including home furnishing and
contract clothing.
The principal textile and clothing products
are yarns, woven and knitted fabrics, interior
(including printed) textiles, technical textiles,
carpets and a full range of clothing (including
knitwear).
The UK has a long established woollen and
worsted sector, which remains well known for
its quality and is moving more and more
towards innovation. Worsted yarns are finely
spun for use mainly in suit fabric and fine
knitwear. As well as spinners, weavers and
knitters, the sector supports a number of other
processes, such as scouring of the raw wool
and dyeing and finishing of the wool, yarn or
fabric. British mills also process rare fibres
such as cashmere and angora. In addition, the
UK produces synthetic fibres, cotton/
synthetic mixed yarns and fabrics and has a
large dyeing and finishing sector (which
includes fabric printing).
In woven carpets (Axminster and Wilton
are the main types), the UK is recognised as a
key player due to its high quality, variety of
design and use of new technology. UK
companies are also continually improving their
capability in the manufacture of higher-
volume, lower-value tufted carpets.
Technical textiles are usually defined as
those for their performance characteristics.
They include non-wovens for filtration and
absorbency, textiles used in construction,
automotive textiles, sewing thread, rope and
medical textiles.
The clothing industry is more labour-
intensive than textiles. Although a broad range
of clothing is imported from overseas, British
industry still supplies nearly two-fifths of
domestic demand. Exports rose consistently
until 1997 as a result of the rising prominence
of the British fashion designer industry
throughout the 1980s, and traditional design
and high-quality production enabling branded
clothing companies such as Burberry and
Jaeger to compete successfully overseas. UK
firms have also had success in the growing
market for branded street and club-wear.
Exports have, however, fallen by over 15 per
cent between 1997 and 1999 to ^2.7 billion.
Output of footwear has been particularly
affected by the strength of sterling and
increasing competitiveness of imports. Footwear
manufacturers, with around 20,000 employees,
are predominantly found in Northamptonshire,
Leicestershire, Somerset and Lancashire. Nearly
60 per cent of production by value is exported,
with the UK particularly renowned for classic
men’s Goodyear Welted shoes and youth/street
fashion footwear.
Paper, Printing and Publishing
In total, the UK paper, printing and
publishing industry employed some 471,000
people in December 1999. The paper and
board sector has a relatively small number of
medium and large firms—98 paper and board
mills, employing 21,000 people—whereas
printing in particular has a very large number
of small businesses. Paper and board are
produced for further industrial processing,
corrugated paper, sacks, bags, cartons, boxes,
household goods, stationery and a host of
other articles. Production has been
increasingly concentrated in large-scale units
to enable the industry to compete more
effectively. Over half the industry is made up
of forestry product companies from
Scandinavia, North America, Australia and
elsewhere. Among the biggest British-owned
groups in terms of production are St Regis,
BPB Paperboard and Arjo Wiggins. There has
been a significant trend towards waste-based
packaging grades. Usage of recycled waste

paper is increasing, and recycled paper made
up over 55 per cent of the raw material for UK
newspapers in 1999 (including imports).
Much publishing and printing employment
and output is carried out in firms based in
south-east England. Mergers have led to the
formation of large groups in newspaper,
magazine and book publishing. Pearson
controls some of the world’s leading
educational publishing businesses. The British
book-publishing industry is a major exporter;
in 1999 it issued 83,997 new titles.
The UK printing industry has an annual
turnover of around 1-8 billion and employs
196,700 people in Great Britain. It is
undergoing significant technological change,
with digital technology enabling much greater
automation and standardisation, while colour
printing is becoming cheaper and more widely
available. Exports and imports are dominated
by books and periodicals.
Chemicals and Chemical Products
The chemicals industry is one of the UK’s major
manufacturing sectors, directly employing over
256,000 people in December 1999 in over
4,000 companies. It had total product sales of
£32 billion in 1999, of which over 70 per cent
was exported. The sector does, however, also
underpin much of the rest of UK manufacturing
industry, with chemicals being essential
feedstocks for most other industrial processes.
It is a diverse industry, with important
representation in all primary chemical
sectors—ranging from bulk petrochemicals to
low-volume, high-value specialised organics. It
includes key industrial materials such as
plastics and synthetic rubber, and other
products such as man-made fibres, soaps,
detergents, cosmetics, adhesives, dyes and inks,
and intermediates for the pharmaceutical
industry.
Bulk Chemicals
The UK’s North Sea oil and gas provide
accessible feedstocks for its large organics
sector, including such products as ethylene,
propylene, benzene and methanol. These
provide the basic building blocks for the
manufacture of many downstream chemical
products, including polymers used for the
manufacture of plastics products; and
synthetic fibres such as nylon, polyamide,
polyester and acrylics used in the textiles,
clothing and footwear industries.
There is substantial inorganics production,
including sulphuric acid, chlorine and caustic
soda, based upon minerals such as salt,
sulphur, and phosphate ores or reaction
between gases. These also serve many other
downstream chemical processes.
Formulated Products
The UK is also strong in the ‘formulation’ of
chemical products, in areas such as paints,
inks, soaps and detergents, and cosmetics and

perfumes. Home decorative products include
household names such as ‘Dulux’ (an ICI
brand) and Crown Paints. The industrial
coatings sector includes decoration on cans,
and anti-fouling marine coatings.
Speciality Chemicals
For the chemicals industry, the last few years
have brought increasingly rapid market and
technological changes. Imperial Chemical
Industries pic (ICI) is one of the world’s largest
producers of speciality products and paints,
with a turnover of more than £8 billion in 1999
(with 50,000 products from more than 200
manufacturing sites in over 55 countries). The
development of speciality chemicals to meet
specific needs through the application of
sophisticated ‘chemistry’ illustrates this
dimension. The pharmaceutical and
agrochemical sectors are at the forefront of such
innovation. In recent years, the application of
chirality1 in synthesis has allowed firms to make
drugs that are more closely tailored to targets.
Man-made Fibres
Synthetic fibres are supplied to the textiles,
clothing and footwear industries. The main
types of synthetic fibre are still those first
developed in the 1940s: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major synthetic
fibres like nylon polyamide, polyester and
acrylics. Extensive research continues to
produce a variety of innovative products;
antistatic and flame-retardant fibres are

examples. More specialist products include
the aramids (with very high thermal stability
and strength), elastanes (giving very high
stretch and recovery) and melded fabrics
(produced without the need for knitting or
weaving).
Pharmaceuticals
The UK pharmaceuticals industry, which is
largely based in the South East and North
West/North East England, is the world’s
second largest exporter of medicines,
accounting for about 13 per cent of the
developed world’s export market. It researches
and manufactures the complete range of
medicinal products—human and veterinary
medicines, medical dressings and dental
materials. In recent times, the largest growth
has been in medicines that act on the
respiratory system, followed by
cardiovascular, muscular and skeletal, anti-
infective and alimentary tract remedies.
Pharmaceutical exports in 1999 were £6.3
billion. The main overseas markets are
Western Europe, North America and Japan.
Over 300 pharmaceutical companies
operate in the UK, with indigenous and US
parent multinationals dominating production.
Glaxo Wellcome (employing some 13,400
people in the UK and 59,000 worldwide),
AstraZeneca and SmithKline Beecham feature
in the top ten UK-based companies (see
p. 386); Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham are merging in late 2000 to form
Glaxo SmithKline.
Some 55,000 people are directly employed
in the pharmaceutical industry, of whom about
a third are engaged in R&D; another 250,000
are employed in related sectors. The industry
invested approximately £2.7 billion in R&D in
475
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
1999, about 23 per cent of all UK commercial
R&D. R&D expenditure in the UK on
pharmaceuticals has grown by 108 per cent
between 1990 and 1998. AstraZeneca, Glaxo
Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are the
UK’s top three companies in terms of R&D
expenditure (see Table 26.1, p. 428) with Pfizer
(US), Merck (US) and Novartis (Swiss) among
the significant foreign investors.
Major developments pioneered in the UK
are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for ulcers, asthma, arthritis,
migraine, coronary heart disease and erectile
dysfunction (Viagra was developed in the UK
by Pfizer). The UK pharmaceuticals industry
has discovered and developed more leading
medicines than any other country apart from
the United States, including six of the world’s
current top 25 best-selling drugs. UK
laboratories place about 20 new
pharmaceutical products on the market each
year. Among the best-selling drugs produced
by the three largest UK-owned companies are:
• Glaxo Wellcome—Flixotide/Flovent
(asthma), Zantac (anti-ulcer) and Imigran
(migraine);
• SmithKline Beecham—Avandia
(diabetes), Augmentin (infections) and
Seroxat/Paxil (for depression); and
• AstraZeneca—Losec (anti-ulcer),
Nexium (successor to Losec) and Zestril
(heart disease).
Biotechnology
The UK biotechnology industry is second
only to that of the United States, employing
14,000 people directly; 25,000 more jobs
depend on providing services to the sector. As
well as AstraZeneca, Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham, there are some 275
smaller specialist dedicated biotechnology
firms—about 20 per cent of the number in
Europe—with particular strengths in
biopharmaceuticals. Of the potentially new
drugs under development in Europe, 70 per
cent are from publicly quoted UK companies.
Companies are clustered particularly around
Cambridge, Oxford and southern Scotland.
The industry benefits strongly from the UK’s
science base. Bioscience research in UK
universities is of world renown, and the major
research laboratories of leading
pharmaceutical multinationals are based here.
The UK has a number of world-class research
institutes, such as the Sanger Centre in
Cambridge which played an important part in
the Fluman Genome project (see p. 441).
Rubber and Plastics Products
In December 1999 almost 237,000 people were
employed by 6,740 enterprises in the rubber
and plastics industries. Rubber products
include tyres and tubes, pipes, hoses, belting
and floor coverings, and many have
applications in the automotive industry. The
largest firms in this sector are major tyre
manufacturers such as Goodyear and
Michelin. The highest concentrations of
plastics employment are in the West Midlands
(with 29.6 per cent of the total), the South
East, North West and the South West. Plastics
have a multitude of applications in the
packaging, building, electrical and electronic,
transport, medical, household goods and
clothing industries. The UK’s plastics
industry continues to be a world leader in
material specification and design, with new

processes allowing stronger plastics to replace
traditional materials and develop new
applications. Among the larger firms in a
sector characterised by many small and
medium-sized businesses is British Polythene
Industries, manufacturing products such as
carrier bags, sacks and shrink film. In the
moulded plastics sector, Linpac’s output
includes food packaging and components for
the automotive sector.
Glass, Ceramics and Building Materials
Almost 140,000 people were employed in this
sector in December 1999.
The UK is a world leader in the manufacture
of glass used in windows, doors and cladding.
Flat glass is made through the float process,
developed by Pilkington and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. About half
of Pilkington’s sales are in glass products for
buildings, while the company is the world’s
largest supplier of glass for cars, with about one-
quarter of vehicles containing its glass. The
manufacture and supply of windows and doors
are carried out by a large number of other
companies operating in one of three basic
product sectors—timber, metal (aluminium and
steel) and plastic (UPVC). The UK also has
several leading lead crystal suppliers such as
Waterford-Wedgwood, Darlington, Edinburgh
Crystal and Royal Brierley.
The ceramics industry manufactures
domestic ceramic tableware, as well as durables
such as sanitaryware, tiles and clay pipes for the
building trade. It is heavily concentrated in the
West Midlands. Domestic tableware production
includes fine china, bone china, earthenware
and stoneware. Tableware is produced
predominantly in Stoke-on-Trent. The UK is
one of the world’s leading manufacturers and
exporters of fine bone china: Wedgwood, Spode
and Royal Doulton are among the most famous
names. Research is being conducted into
ceramics use in housebuilding and diesel and jet
engines. Important industrial ceramics invented
in the UK include some forms of silicon carbide
and sialons, which can withstand ultra-high
temperatures.
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel
quarried by the aggregates industry (some 208
million tonnes in Great Britain in 1999) is
used in construction. In 1999, 2.94 billion
bricks were produced by, and 3.02 billion
bricks were delivered from, sites in Great
Britain. Portland cement, a 19th-century
British innovation, is the most widely used
chemical compound in the world. Blue Circle
Industries is the UK’s largest producer of
cement. Just over 91 million sq m of concrete
building blocks were produced in Great
Britain in 1999.
The UK is a major exporter of china clay, 80
per cent of which is used as coatings and fillers
in paper-making, the remainder going into the
ceramic, paint, rubber and plastics industries.
Output of kaolin was 2.0 million tonnes in
1999. It accounted for 88 per cent of china clay
output. The main producer is English China
Clays International (ECCI), part of the English
China Clays Group. ECCI was taken over by
the French company Imetal in 1999. Imetal
changed its name to IMERYS during 1999 and
all the company’s operations in Britain now
trade under the name IMERYS Minerals Ltd.
The combined company is the world’s leading
producer of high-quality kaolin.

iron and steel and heavy machinery. These
sectors remain important parts of the industrial
economy; some 520,000 people were employed
in December 1999. The major areas of steel
production are now concentrated in south
Wales and northern England, with substantial
processing in the Midlands and Yorkshire.
Major restructuring in the steel industry took
place during the 1980s and 1990s. Metals can
be recycled many times; every year the British
metals recycling industry processes about 8
million tonnes of scrap metal.
From total crude steel output of 16.3 million
tonnes, British producers delivered 15.1 million
tonnes of finished steel in 1999; nearly 50 per
cent is exported to some 160 countries. Nearly
three-quarters of UK steel exports go to other
EU member states. Germany is the UK’s
biggest market. In the last 15 years annual steel
industry exports have more than doubled to 7.6
million tonnes—worth £2 A billion in 1999.
British Steel merged with the Dutch steel
producer Koninklijke Hoogovens during 1999
to create an international metals group. As
Corns, it has become Europe’s biggest
steelmaker and the third largest in the world,
employing 64,000 people worldwide (of whom
34,000 are in the UK) and producing 88 per
cent of the UK’s total crude steel. Its worldwide
aluminium output is around 500,000 tonnes.
Corus’s UK steel output is based on strip mill
products, plate, sections, specialist engineering
steels, bars, wire rods and tubes. These are used
principally in the construction, automotive,
engineering, transport, metal goods, packaging
and energy industries. Corus owns 51 per cent
of Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless
steel group.
Products manufactured by other UK steel
companies include reinforcing bars for the
construction industry, wire rod, hot rolled
bars, bright bars, tubes, and wire and wire
products. The production of special steels is
centred on the Sheffield area and includes
stainless and alloy special steels for the
aerospace and offshore oil and gas industries.
Steel has had a notable success in UK
construction, with its market share of
buildings of two or more storeys more than
doubling from 30 per cent in the early 1980s
to 68 per cent today. It has 95 per cent of the
single storey market. Total iron and steel
sector sales are about £2.0 billion a year and
consumption of constructional steelwork over
1.1 million tonnes.
Several multinational companies, including
Alcan, Norsk Hydro, Kaiser, MIM and
Quexco, have plants in Britain producing non-
ferrous metals from both primary and recycled
raw materials. The aluminium industry, which
has raised its productivity and competitiveness
significantly in recent years, supplies customers
in the aerospace, transport, automotive and
construction industries. Other important non-
ferrous metal sectors are copper and copper
alloys, used for electrical wire and cables, power
generation and electrical and electronic
connectors, automotive components, plumbing
and building products, and components for
industrial plant and machinery; lead for lead
acid batteries and roofing; zinc for galvanising
to protect steel; nickel, used principally as an
alloying element to make stainless steel and
high temperature turbine alloys; and titanium
for high-strength, low-weight aerospace
applications. Despite an overall decline in the
castings industry, some foundries have invested
in new melting, moulding and quality control
equipment.
Fabricated metal products include pressure
vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for
chemical and oil-refining plant; steam-raising

boilers; nuclear reactors; water and sewage
treatment plant; and steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations. Other
products include central heating radiators and
boilers, cutlery, tools and general hardware.
Machinery and Domestic Appliances
Some 380,000 people were employed in this
sector in December 1999. The highest
concentrations are found in the West Midlands,
followed by the South East and the East region.
Mechanical machine-building is an area in
which British firms excel, especially internal
combustion engines, power transmission
equipment, pumps and compressors, wheeled
tractors, construction and earth-moving
equipment, and textile machinery.
The UK is a major producer of industrial
engines, pumps, valves and compressors, and
of pneumatic and hydraulic equipment. The
Weir Group is the world’s sixth biggest
producer of pumps. Companies such as
Mitsui-Babcock manufacture steam generators
and other heavy equipment for power plants.
ALSTOM, a global specialist in transport and
energy infrastructure, is the world’s leading
supplier of major components for complete
power station projects along with the
transformers and switchgear needed in
transmission and distribution of electricity. In
the UK the company’s strengths are steam
turbine manufacture, switchgear manufacture,
industrial gas turbines, and project design and
management. The mechanical lifting and
handling equipment industry makes cranes
and transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically controlled
and automatic handling systems. The
commercial heating, ventilation,
air-conditioning and refrigeration sector is
served to a great extent by small and
medium-sized firms, although several large
multinational companies have sites in Britain.
Tractors and equipment used in
agriculture, horticulture, forestry, sportsturf
and gardens achieved export sales of almost
£1.5 billion in 1999. Most exports were
supplied by three major multinationals with
tractor plants in Britain which, together with
JCB Landpower, export to nearly every
country in the world. A range of specialist
golf, parks and sports field machinery, lawn
and garden products, and agricultural
equipment complement the tractor business.
Machine tools, most of which are computer
controlled, are used in engineering, aerospace,
automotive and metal goods industries. The
global nature of the sector means that exports
are important to this industry. In 1999, total
turnover of the metalworking machine tools
industry was £867 million, of which exports
accounted for £382 million, or 44 per cent.
Total orders on hand at the end of 1999 were
around £200 million.
The mining and tunnelling equipment
industry leads the world in the production of
coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports, conveying
equipment, flameproof transformers,
switchgear, and subsurface transport
equipment and control systems. JCB, Europe’s
biggest construction equipment manufacturer,
is the world’s largest producer of backhoe
loaders and telescopic handlers, and a major
exporter. The UK possesses one of the largest
engineering construction sectors in the world.
It serves the whole spectrum of process
industries, although oil, gas and related
industries are areas of particular strength. Most
sales of textile machinery are to export markets.

British innovations include computerised
colour matching and weave simulation, friction
spinning, high-speed computer-controlled
knitting machines and electronic jacquard
attachments for weaving looms. British
companies also make advanced printing
machinery and ceramic processing equipment,
and other types of production machinery.
The domestic appliance sector manufactures
major appliances, such as washing machines,
cookers, microwave ovens, refrigerators, tumble
dryers and dishwashers, as well as heating,
water heaters and showers, ventilation products,
floor cleaners and vacuum cleaners, and small
appliances for the kitchen and bathroom. There
are around 100 companies of all sizes in the UK.
Energy efficiency and water conservation are
progressively improving in home laundry
products, and new technology is being applied
to all products. Visual design of what were
traditionally ‘white goods’ is changing, giving
a new look to kitchens, and modern design is
also being applied to vacuum cleaners and small
appliances such as kettles and toasters. The UK
is Europe’s largest manufacturer of tumble
dryers, with an annual trade surplus in this
product of around £22 million.
Electrical and Optical Equipment
In total, just over 504,000 people were
employed in this sector in December 1999.
There were 55,000 working in the office
machinery and computers sector, 174,000 in
electrical machinery, 128,000 in radio, TV and
communications equipment and 147,000 in
medical, precision optical equipment and
watches. Production of office machinery and
computers has more than trebled since 1990,
while radio, television and communications
equipment output is up by 74.9 per cent.
However, output of medical and optical
instruments fell by 7.3 per cent during the
1990s, while that of electrical machinery and
apparatus has fallen by 7.1 per cent.
Southern England provides a substantial
proportion of employment (especially sales
and administrative jobs) in these sectors, with
Scotland and Wales having become important
areas for inward investors. Scotland’s
electronics industry (‘Silicon Glen’—in reality
all of central Scotland) directly employed
about 42,500 people in 1997. In 1998 electrical
and instrument engineering accounted for
exports worth £10 billion, 54 per cent of
Scotland’s manufactured exports.
Many of the world’s leading electronics
firms have manufacturing plants in Britain.
IBM, Sony, Compaq, Panasonic, Toshiba,
NEC, Nortel, Seagate and Hewlett-Packard
are among overseas-based multinationals with
substantial manufacturing investment in the
UK. The main electronic consumer goods
produced are television sets. UK production is

concentrated in the high value market with an
increasing proportion of widescreen and
digital sets. High-fidelity audio and video
equipment is also produced.
The computer industry in the UK is the
largest in Europe, producing an extensive
range of systems for all uses. For information
on software, see p. 531. The multinational
computer manufacturers in the UK include
IBM, Compaq and Sun. Other companies,
such as Psion (a pioneer of the ‘palmtop’
computer), have concentrated on developing
new lines for specialised markets.
A broad range of other electrical machinery
and apparatus is produced in the UK by both
British and foreign companies, covering power
plant, electric motors, generators, transformers,
switchgear, insulated wire and cable, and
lighting equipment. The UK is a world leader
in the manufacture of generating sets. In the
cables sector, AEI, BICC and Pirelli produce
high-voltage transmission cables and optical
fibre cables for telecommunications; other large
cable manufacturers include Draka. TUG is the
UK’s largest manufacturer of lighting products.
The past ten years have seen the
development of electronic service providers
(contract electronic manufacturers) which
manufacture and assemble products to the
specification of another company. This global
trend has encouraged some multinational
producers to move away from manufacture to
become designers, developers, marketers or
sellers of their products. The UK is one of the
leading locations in Europe for this type of
business.
Communications Equipment
The domestic telecommunications equipment
market is worth over £3 billion a year.
Manufacturers have been investing heavily in
facilities to meet the rapidly increasing
demand for telecommunications services (see
chapter 22). The main products are switching
and transmission equipment, telephones and
terminals. Marconi pic is the UK’s foremost
telecommunications manufacturer, with
turnover of £3.8 billion in the year to March
1999. Its range includes PBXs (private branch
exchanges), payphones, transmission systems
and videoconferencing equipment.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables.
There has been remarkable growth in
mobile communications (see p. 376), where
the UK is among Europe’s leading markets
and manufacturing bases. The main
producers—Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson,
Panasonic, NEC and Lucent—all have UK
production or design centres. Fibre optics
(invented in the UK) and other optoelectronic
components are also experiencing rapid
growth; Hewlett-Packard, Nortel, Pirelli and
Corning have considerable UK facilities.
Another sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging
systems, alarms and signalling apparatus,
public broadcasting equipment and other
capital goods. Radar was invented in the UK
and British firms are still in the forefront of
technological advances. Racal Avionics’ X-
band radar for aircraft ground movement
control is in use at airports in several overseas
countries. Solid-state secondary surveillance
radar, manufactured by Cossor Electronics, is
being supplied to numerous overseas civil
aviation operators.
Medical Electronics
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in the UK stems from its
comprehensive healthcare system and
extensive clinical research and testing facilities
in the chemical, biological, physical and
molecular sciences. Important contributions
have been made by British scientists and
engineers to basic R&D in endoscopy, CT
(computerised tomography) scanning,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI—
pioneered in the UK), ultrasonic imaging,
CADiagnosis and renal analysis. UK medical
electronic firms are an integral part of the
medical devices sector. Firms in the UK
medical electronic sector continue their
tradition of developing and manufacturing a
range of medical equipment for domestic and
overseas health sectors. About two-fifths of
481
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the medium to large companies in the UK
have overseas parents.
Instrumentation and Control
A variety of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in the UK, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication materials, all for use in machine
tools. The instrument engineering industry
makes measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic items;
watches, clocks and other timing devices; and
medical surgical instruments. The UK
instrumentation and control sector has an
estimated annual output of £9 billion, £4.6
billion of which is exported, and a trade
balance of £884 million. The sector is diverse
and exceeds 3,000 firms, employing 79,000
people. It is the fourth most important
manufacturer of instrumentation and process
control equipment in the World behind the
United States, Japan and Germany.
Motor Vehicles
New car registrations in 1999 fell slightly by
2.2 per cent to 2.2 million, the fourth highest
figure on record. Car production, at 1.79
million, was 2.2 per cent higher, the highest
level since 1972, and has risen by about 38 per
cent since 1990. Vehicle manufacturers are
increasingly pursuing a global market, with
production no longer dominated by their
traditional home markets. This is reflected in
the rise in both UK exports and imports of
motor vehicles. Exports (including
components) were valued at £16.9 billion in
1999. A total of 1.14 million passenger cars
were produced for export in 1999, nearly three
times as many as in 1990. Commercial vehicle
production in 1999 was 186,000, significantly
down on the last few years; 75,000 units were
for export. Production is dominated by light
commercial vehicles.
Around 790,000 jobs are dependent on the
UK automotive industry, including 330,000
engaged in vehicle and component production
and manufacturing activities. There are
around 20 motor vehicle manufacturers in the
UK. Six overseas groups, accounting for 74
per cent of the total now dominate car output:
Ford (including Jaguar and Land Rover),
Vauxhall/IBC, Peugeot, Honda, Nissan and
Toyota. Rover, previously a subsidiary of the
BMW group, has now been sold to the British
Phoenix Consortium.
Despite the recent announcement of the
closure of Ford’s Dagenham, Essex, car plant,
there are still many companies making cars
and commercial vehicles in Britain. Table 28.4
shows 21 sites, many of them specialist
manufacturers.
Capital investment continues on a large
scale. Since 1997 motor vehicle manufacturers
have announced over £3 billion in new
investment in the UK. Since their arrival in
the mid-1980s, Nissan, Toyota and Honda
have invested substantial sums in the UK,
which is their main base for the European
market. All three are now producing at least
two models of car in the UK. A period of
major change has accompanied the arrival of
the three Japanese car manufacturers. In the
last 25 years UK vehicle production per person
employed has increased by over 110 per cent.

Rover Group ranges includes the highly
successful Land Rover four-wheel drive
vehicles and a full range of family cars. In
1998 Rolls-Royce began producing its first
totally new model for nearly 20 years—the
Silver Seraph—at its Crewe plant, and over
1,050 had been built by the end of 1999.
The main truck manufacturers are Leyland
Trucks and ERF. Dennis, based in Guildford,
Surrey, is also an important bus manufacturer.
British-based bus companies achieve
considerable sales in overseas markets.
London Taxis International recently launched
a new version of the famous London taxi.
The automotive components manufacturing
sector, with an annual turnover of billion and
employing 100,000 in Great Britain, is a major
contributor to the UK motor industry. There
are 1,265 companies (some 19 per cent of them
small and medium enterprises) involved, many
of which also supply other sectors. Well-known
British companies such as GKN, Pilkington,
Unipart, Automotive Products, Johnson
Matthey and TMD Friction have large
automotive plants, as do other multinationals
such as TRW, Federal Mogul, Valeo, Bosch and
Johnson Controls. In recent years the sector has
enjoyed strong growth and rising productivity.
The £3 billion of new investment announced
since 1987 is expected to create over 9,700 new
jobs in the UK car industry. This includes
investment of £150 million by Toyota at its
engine plant in Deeside, raising capacity to
400,000 engines a year; £ 189 million investment
by GM in its Vauxhall and IBC plants for the
new Vectra and van projects; four Unipart joint
ventures totalling over £80 million; and
investment of £128 million by Visteon on four
facilities in the UK.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
The UK merchant shipbuilding industry,
located mainly in Scotland and northern
England, consists of some 20 yards producing
ships ranging from tugs and fishing vessels to
fast ferries and large specialist craft for
offshore exploration and exploitation work.
The industry’s order-book is between 25 and
30 vessels generating around £200 million.
The merchant ship repair and conversion
industry, which has a strong presence in the
UK, consists of 30 companies employing
8,000 people. The turnover of the sector
amounted to some £300 million in 1999. The
three warship building and some of the repair
and conversion yards are looking to extend
their area of interest into the merchant vessel
sector. Overall, shipyards employ about
26,000 people and tend to concentrate around
the former major shipping and shipbuilding
centres in Southampton, Liverpool, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Glasgow and Belfast.
In addition, 1,000 firms are engaged in the
manufacture and repair of pleasure and
sporting boats. A few internationally known
builders dominate the sector. The UK marine
equipment industry has annual sales of about
£1 billion and is estimated to employ more
than 100,000 people in about 1,000 companies.
The changing structure of manufacturing
industry has resulted in a growing number of
companies serving both the marine sector and
other markets with their products. Production

ranges from traditional marine equipment to
sophisticated navigational and propulsion
systems, as well as the spectrum of equipment
and supplies for the cruise industry. About 80
per cent of output is exported.
Over 25 years of oil and gas exploitation in
the North Sea have generated a major offshore
industry (see p. 495). Shipbuilders and
fabricators build floating production storage
and offload vessels (FPSOs) and semi-
submersible units for drilling, production and
emergency/maintenance support; drill ships;
jack-up rigs; modules; and offshore loading
systems. Harland and Wolff of Belfast is a
world leader in the FPSO and drill ship fields,
with potential Ropax/Freey contracts; Vosper
Thornycroft and BAE Systems dominate
warship production; and A&P and Cammell
Laird are world leaders in the ship repair
sector. UIE Scotland, Highlands Fabricators,
John Brown and McDermott Scotland are
among the larger contractors employed by the
oil operators for the design and manufacture of
jack-up oil rigs and semi-submersibles. Many
other firms supply equipment and services to
the offshore industry, notably diving expertise,
consultancy, design, project management and
R&D. A number have used their experience of
North Sea projects to establish themselves in
oil and gas markets throughout the world.
Railway Equipment
There are several hundred UK companies
engaged in the manufacture of railway
equipment for both domestic and overseas
markets, mainly producing specialist
components and systems for use in rolling
stock, signalling, track and infrastructure
applications. Three large multinational train
builders—Adtranz (German-owned), Alstom
(UK-French) and Bombardier (Canadian-
owned)—have UK bases. After a period with
a low level of orders in the early 1990s, the
privatised rail operating companies are placing
large orders for new rolling equipment.
Aerospace and Defence
The UK’s aerospace industry is one of only
three in the world with a complete capability
across the whole spectrum of aerospace
products and technology. On a wider definition
of the aerospace industry, turnover in 1998 was
about £17.6 billion, of which approximately
£11.7 billion (66 per cent) was exported. The
industry contributed £2.1 billion to the UK’s
balance of payments in 1999. Around 104,000
people are directly employed in the industry in
Great Britain, with the North West, South
West and East Midlands providing the highest
number of jobs in 1998. The biennial
Farnborough International Exhibition and
Flying Display, organised by the Society of
British Aerospace Companies, is one of the
world’s premier airshows.
Among the leading companies are BAE
Systems—formed by the merger of British
Aerospace with the Marconi Electronic
Systems defence division of GEC—and Rolls-
Royce, both of which are among the UK’s top
five exporters. BAE Systems is a global
systems, defence and aerospace company. It
employs more than 100,000 people in nine
home markets around the world and has
annual sales of some £12 billion and an order
book of £37 billion. BAE Systems designs and
manufactures civil and military aircraft,
surface ships, submarines, space systems,
radar, avionics, guided weapons systems,
communications, electronics and a range of
other defence equipment.
Industry activities cover designing and
constructing airframes, aero-engines, guided
weapons, simulators and space satellites,
materials, flight controls including ‘fly-by¬
wire’ and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see
p. 486), avionics and complex components,
with their associated services.
The UK also has the Western world’s
second largest defence manufacturing industry
after the United States. Exports were estimated
at £4.8 billion in 1999, and the sector
supported some 355,000 jobs in 1997-98.
Civil Aircraft
BAE Systems has a 20 per cent share of the
European Airbus Integrated Company—
EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company) controls the other 80 per
cent. BAE Systems has responsibility for

designing and manufacturing the wings for the
whole family of Airbus airliners, from the
short- to medium-haul A320 series (the first
civil airliner to use fly-by-wire controls—see
p. 486) to the large long-range four-engined
A340. BAE Systems will also design and
manufacture the wings for the new A3XX
‘superjumbo’, expected to create 22,000 jobs
in the UK. Airbus and its related businesses
support 62,000 UK jobs and contribute about
£1.0 billion a year to the UK’s balance of
payments. In 1999 Airbus received firm orders
for 476 new aircraft worth a total of US $30.5
billion from 34 customers around the world,
and in the first half of 2000 it had 55 per cent
of the world market for large civil aircraft.
Short Brothers, owned by Bombardier of
Canada, employs about 6,000 people, mainly
in Belfast. The company is mostly engaged in
the design and production of major civil
aircraft sub-assemblies, advanced engine
nacelles and components for aerospace
manufacturers as well as the provision of
aviation support services.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
Among BAE Systems’ military aircraft is the
Eurofighter Typhoon, built by BAE Systems,
EADS and Alenia of Italy. The company also
has the Harrier, a vertical/short take-off and
landing (V/STOL) military combat aircraft,
and the Tornado combat aircraft (built jointly
by BAE Systems and EADS) and the Hawk
fast-jet trainer, being supplied to 17 customers
worldwide. BAE Systems is involved in the
Joint Strike Fighter programme teams of both
Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US.
BAE Systems is a major supplier of tactical
guided weapon systems for use on land, at sea
and in the air, having merged its missile
business with that of France’s Matra
Corporation to form Europe’s largest guided
weapons concern, Matra BAe Dynamics.
Shorts Missile Systems Ltd (SMS), which has
been acquired by Thomson-CSF of France,
operates in the area of very short-range air
defence systems.
Helicopters
Agusta Westland (formed by the merger of
GKN-Westland Helicopters and Agusta of
Italy) manufactures the multi-role EH 101
medium-lift helicopter for civilian and
military markets and the Super Lynx light
battlefield and naval helicopter. In addition, it
is currently building the Apache attack
helicopter for the UK Army, under licence
from Boeing. It also has strong business in
maintenance and support of its products,
including the Sea King medium-size
helicopter, which is no longer in production.
Agusta Westland is, after Boeing, now the
world’s second largest helicopter
manufacturer, when taking into account its
product line inherited from Agusta and the
manufacturing facilities in Italy.
Land Systems
The UK’s main armoured fighting vehicle
capability is concentrated in two companies:
Rolls-Royce, which acquired Vickers (Defence
Systems) in 1999, and Alvis. RO Defence, a
division of BAE Systems, is the UK’s only
indigenous ordnance company.
Engines and Other Aviation Equipment
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three prime
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
485

turnover in 1999 of £3.8 billion for its
aerospace business. More than 55,000 Rolls-
Royce engines are in service, in over 150
countries. Customers include more than 500
airlines, 240 corporate and utility operators
and 160 armed forces. Rolls-Royce is a partner
in the low-emission V2500 aero-engine, now
in service on the Airbus A320 family. Rolls-
Royce produces military engines for both
fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and is a
partner in the EJ200 engine project for the
Eurofighter and with GE on the alternative
US Joint Strike Fighter programme.
Manufacturers such as BAE Systems,
Cobham, Dowty Propellers, Dowty Aerospace,
GKN-Westland Aerospace, Hunting, Meggitt,
Messier-Dowty, Normalair-Garrett, TRW
(Lucas Aerospace), Racal, Smiths Industries
and Ultra provide aerostructures (doors,
windows and aircraft body parts), equipment
and systems for engines, aircraft propellers,
navigation and landing systems, engine and
flight controls, environmental controls and
oxygen breathing and regulation systems,
electrical generation, mechanical and hydraulic
power systems, cabin furnishings, flight-deck
controls and information displays. BAE
Systems is the world’s largest manufacturer of
head-up displays (HUDs). British firms have
made important technological advances, for
example, in developing fly-by-wire and fly-by¬
light technology, where control surfaces on the
wings and elsewhere are moved by means of
automatic electronic signalling and fibre optics
respectively. UK companies provide radar and
air traffic control equipment and ground power
supplies to airports and airlines worldwide (see
also p. 481).
Space Equipment and Services
Over 400 organisations employing more than
5,400 people are engaged in industrial space
activities (see pp. 437-8), with turnover of more
than £365 million in 1998-99. Through its
participation in the European Space Agency,
the British National Space Centre (see p. 437)
has enabled UK-based companies to participate
in many leading space projects covering
telecommunications, satellite navigation, Earth
observation, space science and astronomy. T he
industry is strong in the development and
manufacture of civil and military
communications satellites and associated Earth
stations and ground infrastructure equipment.
In the field of Earth observation, it plays a major
role in manufacturing platforms, space radar
and meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
The largest British space company is
Astrium Limited. Formed in May 2000 by the
merger of Matra Marconi Space and the space
divisions of Daimler Chrysler Aerospace, and
jointly owned by BAE Systems and EADS, it
is one of the world’s major space companies. It
has become the leading provider of direct
broadcast television satellites, and is involved
in all of Europe’s space science and Earth
observation projects and its launcher and
navigation programmes.
Other firms supply satellite subsystems, and
IGG is Europe’s leading procurer and tester of
space qualified components. UK companies
such as Surrey Satellite Technology and Space
Innovations are leaders in the field of micro
and mini satellites, which provide relatively
quick and cheap access to space. Major
suppliers of satellite ground stations, space
software and satellite imaging include Logica,
Science Systems, SEA, Vega and NRSC.
Construction
The total value of work done in the
construction industry in Great Britain during
1999 was £56.9 billion at constant 1995 prices,
of which £30.6 billion was new work and
£26.3 billion repair and maintenance. The
volume of output at constant 1995 prices grew
by almost 1 per cent. The main areas of
construction work within the UK industry are:
• building and civil engineering—ranging
from major private sector companies with

person enterprises carrying out domestic
repairs;

undertaking construction work ranging
from structural steelwork and precast
concrete structures to mechanical and
electrical services (including the design
and installation of environmentally

• the supply of building materials and
components—ranging from large
quarrying companies, and those engaged
in mass production of manufactured
items, to small, highly specialised
manufacturers; and
• consultancy work—companies or
individuals engaged in the planning,
design and supervision of construction
projects.
In December 1999, 1,167,000 people in the
UK were employed in the construction
industry, less than 5 per cent of the total
workforce; only about 15 per cent of
employees were females. A large number—
around 500,000—of people working in
construction are self-employed.
Project Procurement, Management
and Financing
Private and public sector projects are managed
in a variety of ways. Most clients invite
construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Alternative methods of project procurement
have become more common in recent years—
for example, contracts might include
subsequent provision of building maintenance,
or a comprehensive ‘design-and-build’ service
where a single company oversees every stage
of a project from conception to completion.
Financing of major projects has also been
changing. Traditionally, clients raised the
finance to pay for schemes themselves. Today,
they often demand a complete service package
that includes finance; as a result, larger
construction companies are developing closer
links with banks and other financial institutions.
In public sector construction the Government’s
Private Finance Initiative/Public-Private
Partnerships (see p. 405) have also heralded a
move away from traditional financing.
Major Construction Projects in the UK
Major building schemes in hand or recently
completed include the express rail link from
central London to Heathrow Airport; the
London Underground Jubilee Line Extension;
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (see p. 370); the
M60 motorway in Manchester; the Midland
Expressway; the refurbishment of GCHQ,
Cheltenham; and the refurbishment of the
Ministry of Defence Whitehall building.
The Channel Tunnel (see p. 369), which
opened to traffic in 1994, remains the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe. It is about 50 km (31
miles) long and 70 m (230 ft) below sea level at
its deepest. Associated projects included new
international stations at Waterloo in London
and Ashford (Kent), and an international
terminal at Folkestone (on the Kent coast).
In 1999, the public sector accounted for
22 per cent of construction industry contracts
in the UK by value.
Many construction and renovation projects
have received Millennium funding, and this
can be seen all round the country.
Housing
In 1999 the total value of new housing orders
in Great Britain was £6.9 billion, 1 per cent
lower than in 1998—the private sector
accounted for 86 per cent of the total
compared with 75 per cent in 1993. In 1999
construction of 188,900 dwellings was started
in the UK. Starts by private enterprise
concerns were 165,900, by registered social
landlords 22,600, and by the public sector 400.
New dwellings completed by sector are shown
in Table 28.5 on p. 488.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
UK companies operate worldwide and in any
one year British consultants work in almost
every country on the globe. Combined
overseas earnings are in excess of £6 billion a
year.
UK contractors have pioneered
management contracting and design and
build, and also the innovative financing
mechanisms that have been developed in the
domestic market through innovations such as
the Private Finance Initiative. The contractors
have been particularly successful in North
487
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
America and Hong Kong from where over 50
per cent of their new work came in 1999.
Recent major contracts include:
• Bhairab Bridge, Bangladesh;
• New Valley Pumping Station, Egypt;
• Kowloon Railway Station, Hong Kong;
• liquid natural gas tanks in India;
• social housing and rural water supply in
Romania;
• world leisure complex, Johannesburg,
South Africa; and
• a tunnel for the Alps Transit project.
In 1999 the three main regions from which
British consultants won new work were the
Far East—notably Hong Kong, China, Japan
and Korea—the Indian subcontinent and the
countries of the EU. The main categories of
work were structural commercial (roads,
bridges, tunnels, and railways); electrical and
mechanical services; chemical, oil and gas
plants; and water supply. Recent major
contracts include:
• Yokohama Airport in Japan;
• Marina Line in Singapore;
• Porto Metro in Portugal;
• a new rail tunnel in Sweden;
• Deep Bay Link and Route 9 in Hong
Kong; and
• the A4 motorway in Poland.
UK building products companies export
goods worth over £4 billion annually, with the
EU being the main market. With the onset of
globalisation, many of the major UK
companies have entered into joint ventures
with overseas companies, establishing
production overseas, or undertaking major
acquisitions to expand their scale and output.

UK energy production was up by 3.9 per cent and primary energy consumption
fell by 0.7 per cent in 1999. Oil production increased by 3.5 per cent to a new
record level, while production and consumption of gas rose by 9.7 per cent and
0.5 per cent respectively, mainly because of a 19 per cent growth in the use of
gas for electricity generation. The Government expects revenue from the
proposed climate change levy of about £\ billion in 2001-02. Energy intensive
sectors which agree energy efficiency targets will qualify for a discount on the
main levy rates.
In April 2000 the Government announced that it would seek permission from
the European Commission to pay up to £100 million of aid to the UK coal
industry, which was facing exceptional challenges as a result of low
international coal prices, coupled with changes in the UK electricity market.
Energy Resources
Production of coal continued to fall in 1999,
by 10 per cent on 1998, to 36 million tonnes.
Nuclear electricity output went down by 3.9
per cent to 96.2 terawatt hours. Production of
natural gas rose to 105 billion cubic metres—a
record level for the tenth consecutive year—in
response not only to the growing demand for
gas for electricity generation, but also to
increased activity through the interconnectors
to the Irish Republic and to Belgium, and to
falling imports. Coal still supplied a
significant, if declining, proportion of the
country’s primary energy needs: 29 per cent of
the electricity supplied in 1999 was from coal,
while gas supplied 40 per cent and nuclear 25
per cent.
For 1999, in value terms, total imports of
fuels were 12 per cent higher than in 1998,
largely owing to a 38.5 per cent increase in the
value of petroleum product imports. Exports
were 31.3 per cent higher, mainly because of a
33.6 per cent increase in the value of exports
of crude oil. These increases reflect the rise in
crude oil and petroleum product prices during
1999 (see p. 494).
Overall the UK remains a net exporter of
all fuels, with a surplus on a balance of
payments basis of £4.4 billion in 1999, nearly
489
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
£1.4 billion higher than in 1998. The trade
surplus in crude oil and petroleum products
was £4.6 billion. In volume terms, imports of
fuel in 1999 were 7 per cent lower than in
1998, while exports were 2.4 per cent higher.
The UK had a trade surplus in fuels of 46.9
million tonnes of oil equivalent—the seventh
year in succession that it has had a trade
surplus in volume terms.
ENERGY POLICY
The Government’s energy policy is to ensure
secure, diverse and sustainable supplies at
competitive prices by setting out the
framework in which competition can flourish,
markets can operate efficiently for the benefit
of suppliers and consumers, and the UK can
make best use of its indigenous resources. The
electricity market is open to full competition,
with the aim of giving consumers a choice
from a growing number of suppliers.
Commercial gas supply is already unregulated.
From 2001 UK domestic gas supply will no
longer be regulated.
The ‘climate change levy’—a tax on the
business use of energy—will come into force in
April 2001. The tax will be payable by energy
suppliers who can be expected to pass it on to
industrial and commercial customers. It is
designed to encourage businesses to use energy
more efficiently. The levy package itself,
including support for energy efficiency measures
and exemptions for electricity from renewables,
and for good quality Combined Heat and Power
(CHP—see p. 500), aims to cut carbon dioxide
(C02) emissions by an estimated 2.5 million
tonnes of carbon (mtc) a year. Further savings of
at least 2.5 mtc a year should be produced by the
levy’s negotiated agreements. The levy is
designed to contribute to meeting the
Government’s target under the Kyoto Protocol
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per
cent by 2008-12 (see p. 332).
The Government announced its intention
to introduce the levy in 1999. After
consultation with business and other
interested parties, a number of revisions to its
design have been made. It will now raise about
£1 billion annually (to be recycled to business,
primarily through cuts in employer National
Insurance contributions). In order to protect
the international competitiveness of energy
intensive industries, there will be an 80 per
cent discount to major users of gas and oil
willing to sign efficiency agreements, thus also
increasing the levy’s environmental
effectiveness. New renewables and good
quality CHP will be exempt. Changes
announced in 2000 include:
• a lower rate of levy for liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG; used in rural areas)
to discourage switching from LPG to
more environmentally damaging fuels;
• adding pipe insulation, refrigeration
equipment and thermal screens to the
technologies qualifying for enhanced
capital allowances for companies making
energy saving investments;
• an exemption of up to five years for
natural gas use in Northern Ireland, to
encourage the development of its gas
marketing; and
• financial help and discounts for the
horticultural sector to help its energy
efficiency and protect its competitiveness
while energy efficiency measures take
effect.
International Developments
Since 1999 the Fifth Framework Programme of
Research and Technological Development (see
p. 438) has been the focus of research,
development and demonstration of energy
technologies in the EU. It has a non-nuclear
budget of £120 million a year. The EU Energy
Council adopted the Energy Framework
Programme comprising the basic decision to
rationalise a range of energy programmes run by
DGTREN of the European Commission, and
six separate components: ETAP (shared studies
and analyses); SYNERGY (international co¬
operation); ALTENER (renewable energy);
SAVE (strategic action for vigorous energy
efficiency); SURE (safe transport of nuclear
materials and safeguards); and CARNOT (clean
and efficient use of solid fuels). The programme
has a total budget of 170 million ecu (£119
million) over five years (1998-2002). Since 1999
eight agencies, which conduct research into, and
promote, energy conservation, have been

established in the UK under the SAVE II
programme, which usually provides up to
150,000 euros of start-up funding.
The EC Oil Stocks Directive now requires
all EU member states to hold contingency oil
stocks. As an oil exporter, the UK is eligible
for a reduction in its stocking obligation,
which could save its oil industry about £10
million a year.
The EC collaborates with specialist
international organisations, such as the
International Energy Agency (IEA), which
monitors world energy markets on behalf of
industrialised countries and whose
membership consists of all OECD members
except Iceland and Mexico.
The EC Directive of February 1999 requires
all EU members to open at least 33 per cent of
their electricity supply markets to competition
by 2003. By May 2000, however, over 60 per
cent of the internal electricity market had been
legally opened. Great Britain, Finland,
Germany and Sweden have gone further and
have introduced the right of consumer choice
for all domestic, industrial and commercial
customers. Since August 2000, EU member
states have been required to open at least 20 per
cent of their gas supply markets, rising to 28
per cent by 2003 and 33 per cent by 2008. The
UK gas market has been fully open to
competition since May 1998.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
while in this period gross domestic product (at
constant market prices) rose by 80 per cent.
Energy consumption by final users in 1999,
allowing for losses in conversion and
distribution, and excluding non-energy use,
amounted to 156.8 million tonnes of oil
equivalent,1 of which transport took 34.3 per
cent, residential users 29.4 per cent, industrial
users 22.6 per cent, commerce, agriculture and
public services 12.1 per cent, and other users
1.6 per cent.
Primary energy demand in 1999 was 0.6
per cent lower than in 1998. Primary demand
for coal and other solid fuels was 11.6 per cent
lower than in 1998, reflecting the decline in
the use of coal for electricity generation.
Primary demand for oil fell by 1.5 per cent,
but gas rose by 6 per cent, following marked
increases in 1995-98. On a temperature
corrected basis, which shows what the annual
intake might have been if the average
temperature during the year had been the
same as the average for 1961-90, energy
consumption grew by 0.3 per cent in 1999,
compared with an average increase of 1.7 per
cent a year between 1995 and 1998.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Government funding on energy efficiency
programmes in the UK in 1999-2000 was
£114.5 million. Some £50 million of the
revenue from the climate change levy will go
In 1999 consumption of primary fuels in the
UK was only 7.2 per cent higher than in 1970,

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
to support energy efficiency measures and
renewables, including 100 per cent first-year
capital allowances for energy-saving
investments. They are an essential part of UK
strategy for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions (see p. 332). It has been estimated
that by 2010, in the domestic sector, savings of
up to 6.5 million tonnes of C02 a year could
be achieved by improving the energy
efficiency of buildings. The potential
contribution of commercial and industrial
buildings could be 5 million tonnes and of
public sector buildings 1.1 million tonnes.
These savings correspond to a reduction of
15-20 per cent on the estimated C02
emissions for 2010 for these sectors.
The Energy Efficiency Best Practice
Programme (EEBPP) is the prime national
source of independent authoritative
information and advice on energy efficiency.
Its target is savings of £800 million a year (at
1990 prices) by the end of 2000, or about
5 million tonnes of carbon, and it is currently
saving about £650 million (about 3.25 million
tonnes). Its budget was £16.6 million in
1999-2000.
The Energy Saving Trust (EST) was set up
by the Government and the major energy
companies. Its purpose is to work through
partnerships towards the sustainable and
efficient use of energy. In 1999-2000 it
received £24.5 million in direct government
funding for work with the domestic and small
business sectors and £3.6 million on
transport-related programmes, and its UK¬
wide programmes levered in an extra £99
million of investment. Under the government-
funded programme of work, more than
284,000 installations of energy-saving
measures have been made and advice given to
some 907,000 individuals and organisations up
to the end of March 2000. Since 1994 the
public electricity suppliers (see pp. 497-9)
have invested about £25 million a year in
energy efficiency under the EST’s Energy
Efficiency Standards of Performance
(EESOP). Since 1994 EESOP programmes
have resulted in more than 383,000 insulation
improvements and the sale of over 9.5 million
energy-efficient light bulbs.
The new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme
(HEES), with a budget of nearly £500 million
over 2001-04, is aimed at people who are most
at risk from ill health caused by fuel poverty:
the elderly and families on low incomes, and
the disabled and chronically sick. Data from
the 1996 English House Condition Survey
showed that there were at least 4.3 million of
these fuel-poor households in England. The
new HEES provides grants of up to £2,000 for
home heating and insulation improvements.
This includes central heating systems for low-
income households aged 60 and over.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION
The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS)
comprises those areas of the seabed and
subsoil beyond the territorial sea over which
the UK exercises sovereign rights of
exploration and exploitation of natural
resources. It has been extended since the mid-
1960s all around Great Britain, to over 300 km
north of Shetland and some 1,500 km beyond
the Hebrides into the North Atlantic. In 1999,
either through direct use or as a source of
energy for electricity generation, oil and gas
accounted for over 70 per cent of total UK
energy consumption, with UK production
supplying 99 per cent of gas consumed. In
1999, output of crude oil and natural gas
liquids (NGLs) in the UK averaged over 2.9
million barrels (about 384,100 tonnes) a day,
keeping it as the world’s ninth largest
producer.
Taxation
The North Sea fiscal regime is a major
mechanism for gaining for the UK the
economic benefit from its oil and gas
resources. The Government grants licences to
private sector companies to explore for and
exploit oil and gas resources (see p. 493). Its
main sources of revenue from oil and gas
activities are petroleum revenue tax (see
p. 409), levied on profits from fields approved
before 16 March 1993; corporation tax,
charged on the profits of oil and gas
companies—the only tax on profits from fields
approved after 15 March 1993; and royalty,
which applies only to fields approved before

Licensing
No seaward licensing rounds occurred in
1999. By the end of 1999, some 7,400 wells
had been, or were being, drilled in the UKCS:
2,100 exploration wells, 1,300 appraisal wells
and 4,000 development wells. Only 16
exploration wells were started in 1999, the
lowest number since 1965, compared with 47
in 1998. New appraisal wells numbered only
20, the lowest figure since 1971. The
Government must approve all proposed wells
and development plans.
Production and Reserves
Some 211 offshore fields were in production
in March 2000: 107 oil, 88 gas and 16
condensate (a lighter form of oil). Production
started at nine new offshore oil/condensate
fields during 1999, and nine new development
projects were approved. Offshore, these
comprised three oilfields and three gasfields;
onshore, two gasfields and one oilfield. In
addition, approval for nine incremental
offshore developments (elaborations to
existing fields) was granted.
Cumulative UKCS stabilised crude oil
production to the end of 1999 was 2,331
million tonnes, with Forties (324 million
tonnes) and Brent (246.5 million tonnes) the
largest producing fields. Britain’s largest
onshore oilfield, at Wytch Farm (Dorset),
produces 85 per cent of the total crude oils
and NGLs originating onshore. Possible
maximum remaining UKCS reserves of oil are
estimated at 1,665 million tonnes.
Offshore Gas
Natural gas now accounts for 40 per cent of
total inland primary fuel consumption in the
UK. In 1999 indigenous production amounted
to a record 105 billion cubic metres.
Production from the three most prolific
offshore gasfields—Leman, Indefatigable and
the Hewett area—has accounted for 36 per
cent of the total gas produced so far in the
UKCS. Associated gas,2 delivered by pipeline
to land via the Far North Liquids and
Associated Gas System (FLAGS), the
Scottish Area Gas Evacuation System (SAGE)
and the Central Area Transmission Sy stem
(CATS), accounted for 35 per cent of gas
production in 1999. The Southern Basin
fields, the Morecambe Bay field and the
Liverpool Bay fields in the Irish Sea produce
more gas in winter to satisfy increased
demand, with the North Sean and South Sean
fields also augmenting supplies to meet peak
demand on very cold days in winter. The

partially depleted Rough field is used as a gas
store for rapid recovery during peak winter
periods (see map at the end of the book).
Cumulative gas production to the end of
1999 is 1,490 billion cubic metres. Maximum
possible remaining gas reserves in present
discoveries now stand at just under 1,755
billion cubic metres.
Pipelines
Some 10,430 km (6,520 miles) of major
submarine pipelines transport oil, gas and
condensate from one field to another and to
shore. Nine landing places on the North Sea
coast bring gas ashore to supply a national and
regional high- and low-pressure pipeline
system some 273,000 km (170,625 miles) long,
which transports natural gas around Great
Britain. A pipeline (40 km; 25 miles) takes
natural gas from Scotland to Northern
Ireland; exports to the Irish Republic are
conveyed by the Britain—Ireland
interconnector. The pipeline (232 km; 145
miles) from Bacton to Zeebrugge in Belgium,
opened in 1998 and costing £420 million, has
a capacity of 20,000 million cubic metres a
year.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In December 1998 world oil prices hit a 50-
year low in real terms, with only £50 a tonne
received early in 1999; by late 1999 prices had
increased to £108 a tonne. The average price
received by producers from sales of UKCS oil
in 1999 was about £80 a tonne, a third higher
than in 1998. However, low levels of
investment led to uncertainty for the
contracting and supply sectors. In 1999
UKCS oil and gas production accounted for
1.8 per cent of the UK’s gross value added.
Total revenues from the sale of oil (including
NGLs) produced from the UKCS in 1999
rose to some £11 billion, while those from the
sale of gas fell slightly to £5.1 billion. Taxes
and royalty receipts attributable to UKCS oil
and gas remained at about £2.6 billion in
1999-2000.
The remit of the Oil and Gas Task Force,
set up by the Government, with industry
support, in 1998, was to recommend ways in
which the UK industry can maintain
competitiveness in the face of increasing
maturity of its oil reserves and low oil prices.
One recommendation was to increase the UK
share of the world supplies market, currently
worth £2.9 billion, by at least 50 per cent by
2005. Among the changes brought about by
the Task Force’s second phase, PILOT, have
been a streamlined and more transparent and
more predictable licensing process and longer
production consents for both old and new
fields, to increase company confidence when
investing and encourage funding commitment.
One of PILOT’S work groups aims to aid
commercial development of over 300 currently
undeveloped discoveries.
Since 1965 the oil and gas production
industry has generated operating surpluses
of some £250 billion, of which over £105
billion (including £23.5 billion of
exploration and appraisal expenditure) has
been reinvested in the industry, £90.9
billion paid in taxation, and about £54
billion retained by the companies. Total
income of the oil and gas sector rose to
over £19 billion in 1999.
Production investment in the oil and gas
extraction industry fell back to some £3.2
billion in 1999. Including exploration and
appraisal investment of a further £0.5 billion,
it formed about 13 per cent of total British
industrial investment and nearly 2.5 per cent
of gross fixed capital investment. Some 27,200
people were employed offshore by the
industry (which also supports about a third of
a million jobs in related sectors) in 1999.
PILOT has continued to build on the
collaborative partnerships initiated by the
joint industry/government Oil and Gas Task
Force. Initiatives such as LOGIC (Leading
Oil and Gas Industry Competitiveness); the
Industry Technology Facilitator and the
National Training Organisations Group;
together with the LIFT (Licence Information
for Trading) website; action on undeveloped
discoveries; and improvements to the licensing
and development approval processes, are
aimed at making the UKCS more attractive to
494
29: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
investors and sustaining activity through 2010
and beyond.
The Offshore Environment
Environmental impact assessments (under the
EC Environmental Impact Directive) are
mandatory for all field developments. An early
result of the Government’s public consultation
in 1999 on improvements to the offshore
environmental regime is Integrated Pollution
and Prevention Control, already in force for
large combustion plant operating on offshore
installations.
During 1999, 300 hours of unannounced
aerial surveillance of oil and gas rigs detected
minimal amounts of oil on the surface of the
sea. Offshore environmental inspections were
also carried out. The 1999 figure for accidental
oil spills (120 tonnes) was lower than that for
1998 (137 tonnes).
The Petroleum Act 1998 places a
decommissioning obligation on the co-venturers
of every offshore installation and the owners of
every offshore pipeline on the UKCS. Companies
have to submit a decommissioning programme
for ministerial approval and ensure that its
provisions are carried out. In 1998 the OSPAR
Commission (see p. 329) agreed rules for the
disposal of offshore installations at sea. There is
now a presumption that all installations will be
removed for re-use, recycling or final disposal on
land. Derogations, however, are possible for
concrete platforms and for the footings of steel
installations with a jacket weight above 10,000
tonnes. All installations put in place after
9 February 1999 must be completely removed.
Offshore Safety
Offshore health and safety are the responsibility
of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE—see
p. 160). Aberdeen University’s Petroleum and
Economic Consultants Ltd has evaluated the
offshore health and safety regime and will
recommend how it should be developed over
the period up to 2010.
Suppliers of Goods and Services
The oil and gas industry supply chain has
been seriously affected by the downturn in
investment in the UKCS, with the worst hit
sector—the fabrication industry—reducing
employment from about 20,000 jobs in the
early 1990s to nearer 1,000 towards the end of
2000. Many companies have needed to seek
work in other sectors and overseas, and the Oil
and Gas Industry Development Directorate of
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
has worked with the PILOT initiatives and by
other direct action to help the industry realign
to the changed market circumstances.
DOWNSTREAM OIL
Oil Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery consumption)
in 1999 included 21.5 million tonnes of petrol
for motor vehicles, 15.2 million tonnes of
DERV (diesel-engined road vehicles) fuel, 9.7
million tonnes of aviation turbine fuel, 6.8
million tonnes of gas oil (distilled from
petroleum) and 2.2 million tonnes of fuel oils
(blends of heavy petroleum).
Oil Refineries
In 1999 the UK’s 13 refineries processed 88.3
million tonnes of crude and process oils, a
decrease of 6 per cent on 1998. About 80 per
cent of output by weight is in the form of
lighter, higher-value products, such as
gasoline, DERV and jet kerosene. The UK is
much more geared towards petrol production
than its European counterparts; this accounts
for about a third of each barrel of crude oil,
compared with a European average of just
over a fifth.
Trade
In 1999, UK exports of refined petroleum
products (see p. 493) were worth £892
million. Virtually all exports went to its
partners in the EU and in the IEA, especially
France and Germany, and the United States.
Exports of UKCS gas were more than 2.6
times higher in 1999 than in 1998. Some 7.6
billion cubic metres went to the Netherlands,
from the British share of the Markham
495
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
transboundary field and the neighbouring
Windermere field, to the Irish Republic and to
Belgium through the UK-Belgium
interconnector. About 1.2 billion cubic metres
were imported from Norway, and from
Belgium via the interconnector, representing
1.3 per cent of total supplies in 1999,
compared with 1.1 per cent in 1998.
GAS SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Industry
The holder of a public gas transporter’s
licence may not also hold licences for supply
or shipping in a fully competitive market.3 Of
the two entirely separate companies formed
from the demerged British Gas, the supply
business is now part of the holding company
Centrica pic (which still trades under the
British Gas brand name in the UK), while the
pipeline and storage businesses, most
exploration and production, and R&D have
been retained within British Gas pic, renamed
BG pic. In March 2000 BG announced that
the regulated pipeline business and the R&D
side would be demerged to form a separate
company listed on the Stock Exchange.
The national and regional gas pipeline
network is owned by Transco, part of BG pic,
which retains responsibility for dealing with
leaks and emergencies, and also has a current
monopoly in gas metering, which the energy
regulator (see p. 499) plans to open to
competition. New gas trading arrangements
introduced in October 1999 involve a screen-
based on-the-day commodity market for
trading in wholesale supplies of gas; auctions
for the allocation of entry capacity into the
high-pressure national transmission system;
and commercial incentives for Transco to
operate and balance the system efficiently.
Competition
Since 1994 independent suppliers have
captured 83 per cent of the industrial and
3 Suppliers sell piped gas to consumers; public gas
transporters (PGTs) operate the pipeline system through
which gas will normally be delivered; shippers arrange with
PGTs for appropriate amounts of gas to go through the
pipeline system.
commercial gas market. Some 60 companies
are licensed to sell gas to the commercial
sector and 26 to domestic customers.
By December 1999 over 5.3 million (out of
20 million) domestic customers had switched
from British Gas, which still has just over 70
per cent of the household market, to one of
about 25 other companies now in it, and also
between these other companies. In 1999 the
changes were estimated to have brought each
standard credit customer average savings of
£53 a year on a gas bill.
Only companies which have been granted a
supplier’s licence are allowed to sell gas.
Licence conditions include providing gas to
anyone who requests it and is connected to the
mains gas supply. Special services must be
made available for elderly, disabled and
chronically sick people. Suppliers must offer
customers a range of payment options; they
are able to set their own charges, but have to
publish their prices and other terms so that
customers can make an informed choice.
The Director General of Ofgem (Office of
Gas and Electricity Markets) has powers to set
price controls for British Gas Trading and
Transco, to set and enforce standards of
performance, and to see that competitive
practices continue. In April 2000, Ofgem
introduced a one-year price control on BG
which is expected to reduce by £10 the typical
annual bill of a customer not paying by direct
debit.
Consumption
Natural gas consumption, at an estimated
994.6 terawatt4 hours (TWh) in 1999
(compared with 541.8 TWh in 1989), was up
6.7 per cent on 1998, with gas supplied for
electricity generation (amounting to 313.4
TWh) up 18 per cent. Sales to industry (204.3
TWh) were 6.9 per cent up and to the
commercial sector (121 TWh) 2.3 per cent up,
while domestic sales (356 TWh) were broadly
the same as in 1998. In 1999 UK industrial gas
prices were the lowest among the EU
countries. Between 1986 (when British Gas
41 TW = 1,000 gigawatts (GW). 1 GW = 1,000 megawatts
(MW). 1 MW = 1,000 kilowatts (kW).

29: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
was privatised) and 1999 average industrial gas
prices fell by 62 per cent in real terms; domestic
prices were reduced by 31 per cent (including
VAT). In Great Britain a typical standard
credit household’s annual gas bill fell in real
terms from £399 in 1986 to £271 in 1999.
COAL
The UK coal industry is entirely in the private
sector. The main deep-mine operators in the
UK are RJB Mining pic (in England); Mining
Scotland Ltd; Tower (a pit at Hirwaun in
south Wales); Hatfield Colliery in South
Yorkshire; and Betws, also in south Wales.
RJB Mining, Mining Scotland Ltd and Celtic
Energy, which operates in Wales, are the main
opencast operators. In August 2000 there were
29 underground mines in production,
including 17 major deep mines, employing
8,372 workers and 48 opencast sites, owned by
various companies throughout the UK,
employing 2,647. Opencast accounts for most
of the relatively low sulphur coal mined in
Scotland and south Wales, and contributes
towards improving the average quality and
cost of coal supplies.
Market for Coal
In 1999 inland consumption of coal, at 56
million tonnes, was down 12 per cent on 1998.
About 73 per cent was used by the electricity
generators, 15 per cent by coke ovens and blast
furnaces, 1 per cent by other fuel producers, 6
per cent by industry and 5 per cent by
domestic consumers. Exports were 762,000
tonnes, while imports amounted to 20.8
million tonnes—mainly of steam coal for
electricity generation and coking coal. Total
production from British deep mines fell by 16
per cent, from 25 million tonnes in 1998 to 21
million tonnes in 1999. Opencast output
remained at 15 million tonnes.
In April 2000, the Government announced
that it would be lifting the stricter gas
consents policy (in operation since 1998) when
the new electricity trading arrangements were
in place. Recognising that this would create
much uncertainty for the UK coal market and
that it would provide new challenges for the
coal industry, the Government also
announced that it would be seeking European
Commission approval for a subsidy scheme.
This is expected to provide short-term
transitional help to those parts of the UK coal
industry that are considered to have a viable
future, but that would face the risk of
premature closure in the next few years
without government support.
Clean Coal
Cleaner coal technologies reduce the
environmental impact of coal used for power
and industrial applications by increasing the
efficiency of converting it to energy and
reducing harmful emissions of particulates,
oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, which are the
cause of acid rain. Improvements in the
efficiency of coal-fired power stations lead
directly to reductions of C02, a major
contributor to climate change. The DTI
contribution of £12 million during 1999-2000
to 2001—02 to the cleaner coal R&D
programme aims to encourage collaboration
between UK industry and universities in the
development of the technologies and
expertise. The Coal Authority (see below) has
started work on developing a sub-commercial
underground coal gasification project to meet
government criteria on cleaner coal.
The Coal Authority
The Coal Authority is a public body
sponsored by the DTI. It has five main
responsibilities: licensing coal-mining
operations; repairing coal subsidence damage;
managing coalfield property; managing
minewater pollution and other environmental
problems of coal mining; and providing
information to house buyers about mining
activity near property.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
In December 1999, some 70 companies held
generation licences in England and Wales.
The major power producers are National
497
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Power, PowerGen, AES Electric, British
Energy, TXU Europe (which has taken over
Energy Group, which includes Eastern
Electricity), Edison Mission Energy, and
British Nuclear Fuels’ (BNFL) Magnox
Generation Group. They have sold electricity
to suppliers through a marketing mechanism
known as the ‘Pool’. The National Grid
(NGC) owns and operates the transmission
system, and is responsible for calling up
generation plant to meet demand.
Distribution—transfer of electricity from
the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) in England and
Wales. Supply—the purchase of electricity
from generators and its sale to consumers—is
fully open to competition; since June 1999 all
consumers in Great Britain, including 24
million homes and 2 million small businesses,
have been able to choose from whom they can
buy electricity.
Cross-border acquisitions and takeovers
have become a feature of the European power
market and eight of the 12 RECs are owned by
overseas companies. All the main UK
generators are being vertically integrated
through ownership of supply businesses.
British electricity companies continue to
invest overseas. In early 2000, for example,
PowerGen bought LG&E, the Kentucky-
based electricity company, for $3.22 billion
and National Power has split its international
and UK power businesses.
In 1999-2000, 7.8 GW of coal-fired plant
was sold by major generators to other
concerns. A further 2 GW was sold in March
2000. Coal-fired plant is now owned by five
unrelated companies and the total market
shares in generation of National Power and
PowerGen have fallen to 17 and 15 per cent
respectively.
Reform of Electricity Trading
New wholesale electricity trading
arrangements (NETA) will replace the Pool in
March 2001. NETA introduces greater
competition into electricity trading which
should ensure downward pressure on prices.
Generators, suppliers, traders and customers
are encouraged to enter into bilateral contracts
in forwards and futures markets and short¬
term power exchanges. Participants are free to
trade electricity until V/i hours ahead of real
time for any half-hour period. From that point
until real time, the market will be operated
through a balancing mechanism run by the
NGC—because of the need to balance the
system on a second-by-second basis. NETA
will take effect through new conditions
inserted into generation, supply and
transmission licences. These have been
designated by the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry under the Utilities Act 2000.
In June 2000 the UK Power Exchange
(UKPX) launched the country’s first
online trading of power contracts.
Although this is a core feature of NETA,
DTI and Ofgem have left the development
of power exchanges to market forces. In
addition to UKPX, a number of other
companies are developing power
exchanges.
Scotland
ScottishPower pic and Scottish and Southern
Energy pic generate, transmit, distribute and
supply electricity within their respective
franchise areas. They are also contracted to
buy all the output from British Energy’s two
Scottish nuclear power stations (Hunterston B
and Torness), until 2005. The over-100 kWh
market in Scotland comprises about 6,750
customers and accounts for about 45 per cent
of all electricity consumed. ScottishPower and
Scottish and Southern Energy have second-
tier licences which allow them to compete in
each other’s area. In 1999-2000, 29.5 per cent
of customers in the over-100-kWh market
obtained their power from holders of second-
tier supply licences. In 1999 Ofgem proposed
reforms (for implementation by 2002) to the
Scottish electricity market which would
include cutting distribution charges (by 13 per
cent by ScottishPower and 5 per cent by
Scottish and Southern Energy), separation of
generation, supply, transmission and
distribution interests to provide greater
transparency and reduce the potential for
498
29: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
market abuse, and increasing competition by
giving English and Welsh companies greater
access to the interconnector between England
and Scotland.
Northern Ireland
Three private companies, Nigen, Premier
Power and Coolkeeragh Power, generate
electricity from four power stations. They are
obliged to sell to Northern Ireland Electricity
pic (NIE), which has a monopoly of
transmission and distribution, and a right to
supply. From July 1999 supply to leading
industrial users (25 per cent of the total
market) has been open to outside competition.
Northern Ireland’s Energy Action Plan
(Vision 2010) envisages an all-Ireland energy
market which would widen the scale and
remove the relative isolation of a system in
which standard domestic consumers paid an
average 25 per cent more for electricity than
their counterparts in Great Britain in 1999.
Expansion of the cross-border power link
agreed in December 1999 is to be furthered by
enhancement of the capacity of the
north-south interconnector and of the two
stand-by links with the Irish Republic.
The Province has a power surplus, with a
peak demand of 1,500 MWh. The energy
regulator for Northern Ireland combines
responsibilities for electricity and gas.
Regulation and Other Functions
In June 1999, the Office of Gas Supply and
the Office of Electricity Regulation were
merged to form Ofgem. The Utilities Act
2000 has created a new legal structure for
Ofgem, which means that the statutory
responsibilities under the Gas Act 1986, the
Electricity Act 1989 and the Utilities Act 2000
will fall to an authority rather than (as has
until recently been the case) to an individual.
Ofgem’s principal objective is to protect the
interests of gas and electricity customers,
wherever appropriate, by promoting effective
competition. Other duties and objectives
include the need to maintain security of
supply and to ensure that electricity and gas
licensees are able to finance their statutory
obligations. Ofgem will be responsible for
setting performance standards for gas and
electricity companies, and price regulation of
companies where competition has not yet fully
emerged or where there is a natural monopoly.
Consumption
In 1999 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in the UK amounted to
308.1 TWh. Domestic users took 36 per cent
of the total, industry 32 per cent, and
commercial and other users the remainder.
In 1999 the average industrial electricity
price was lower in real terms than for any year
since 1970. UK prices have fallen in real terms
by 19 per cent for domestic customers and by
46 per cent for large industrial users since
privatisation in 1990. In 1999 an annual
electricity bill for a typical standard credit
household was £264. Average UK domestic
electricity prices, including taxes, in 1998
were the fourth lowest within the EU and
industrial prices the tenth lowest.

Source: Department of Trade and Industry
Non-nuclear power stations owned by the
UK’s major power producers consumed 49.7
million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1999, of
which coal and natural gas accounted for 48.6
per cent each and oil and hydro 2.4 per cent.
Other power companies (for which gas is the
most widely used fuel), and over 2,000 small
autogenerators (which produce power for their
own use), have equal access with the major
generators to the grid transmission and local
distribution systems. A ten-year programme
to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) through the installation of low-NOx
burners at 12 major power stations in England
and Wales is in progress. ScottishPower has
fitted low-NOx burners at Longannet power
station.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT)
In 1999, CCGT stations accounted for 34 per
cent of the electricity generated by major
power producers, compared with 16 per cent
in 1995. This increase has been balanced by a
fall in coal- and oil-fired generation. CCGT
stations, favoured by the smaller, independent
producers and using natural gas, offer cheap
generation, and give out almost no sulphur
dioxide and some 55 per cent less C02 than
coal-fired plant per unit of electricity. At the
end of March 2000, 33 such stations in the
UK (with a total registered capacity of 21.7
GW) were generating power. The
Government has indicated that restrictions on
the building of new CCGTs will be lifted with
the introduction of NETA (see p. 498).
Combined Heat and Power
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants are
designed to produce both electricity and
usable heat. They convert about 80 per cent of
fuel input into useful energy, compared with
conventional generation which wastes at least
half the energy content of the fuel and emits
considerably more C02. CHP thus benefits
the environment by reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases. It is also used for cooling
and chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy
sources. It offers particular benefits in
applications where there is a regular need for
heat as well as electricity—such as hospitals,
leisure centres and housing developments—
and can be provided on a local scale. About 83
per cent of CHP plants are less than 1 MW
capacity; large-scale plant (above 10 MW)
represents just over 80 per cent of total CHP
capacity. In 1999 over 1,300 CHP schemes
supplied more than 4,250 MW of generating
500
29: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
capacity, 5.5 per cent of the UK’s total
electricity (and 15 per cent of that used by
industry), with some 1,080 MW under
development; the Government aims to have at
least 10,000 MW by 2010. EU strategy is to
double CHP’s share of the electricity market
from 9 per cent to 18 per cent by the same year.
The Government is promoting CHP by
developing and administering a quality
assurance programme under the EEBPP—to
assess CHP schemes for exemption from the
climate change levy and for other benefits.
Trade
The NGC and Electricite de France run a
2,000 MW cross-Channel cable link, allowing
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. The link has generally been used to
supply ‘baseload’ power—which needs to be
generated and available round the clock—from
France to England. Imports met just over 4 per
cent of the UK’s electricity needs in 1999.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of
under 6 GW and generating capacity of over
9 GW. This additional available capacity (see
p. 498) is used to supply England and Wales
through transmission lines linking the Scottish
and English grid systems. This
interconnector’s capacity is now 1,600 MW,
with plans to increase it to 2,200 MW.
Construction of a 60-km (37.5-mile) 500 MW
undersea interconnector between Scotland
and Northern Ireland will allow further
exports of power from Scotland, with 125
MW supplied to NIE at less than the Great
Britain Pool price, by 2001.
Nuclear Power
Nuclear power generates about one-sixth of
the world’s energy and over a third of
Europe’s. It substantially reduces the use of
fossil fuels which would otherwise be needed
for generation. In the UK nuclear stations
generated 96.3 TWh in 1999 and contributed
26 per cent of total electricity generation.
The private sector company British Energy
owns and operates seven advanced gas-cooled
reactors (AGRs) and the pressurised water
reactor (PWR) at Sizewell B. British Energy’s
reactors have a rated output of 7,130 MW in
England and 2,440 MW in Scotland. British
Nuclear Fuels (BNFL; see below) and
Magnox Electric, which merged in 1998,
operate seven magnox power stations, together
with a further four magnox stations that are
being decommissioned.
In the absence of nuclear generation,
emissions of C02 in 1998 would have been
some 12 to 24 mtc higher in the UK,
depending on the mix of generation used to
replace it. However, there are currently no
proposals for new nuclear power stations in
the UK, principally because the cost,
compared to new generation from other
sources, is not currently competitive.
Concerns about radioactive waste disposal and
public acceptability are also likely to be
contributory factors. These issues are
common to many countries, including some
with an existing nuclear generation industry.
British Nuclear Fuels
BNFL is Britain’s primary provider of nuclear
products and services to both UK and
international customers. The company’s
turnover in 1999—2000 was just over
£1 billion, of which about a third came from
reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at its Thorp
plant at Sellafield (Cumbria). In September
1999 the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
(Nil) began an investigation after quality
checks on mixed oxide fuel (MOx)
manufactured at Sellafield were found to have
been falsified. In early 2000 both Japan and
Germany, two of BNFL’s biggest customers,
put contracts to buy large quantities of MOx
on hold. The Government has ordered BNFL
to make improvements and has delayed
consideration of a proposal to introduce a
Public-Private Partnership into the company
until at least 2002. BNFL has responded to
two Nil reports into working practices at the
Sellafield site and made changes to
management structures and safety procedures.
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
UKAEA’s main function is to maintain and
decommission safely and cost effectively its
redundant nuclear facilities used for the UK’s
501
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
nuclear R&D programme. UKAEA owns the
sites at Dounreay (Caithness), Culham and
Harwell (Oxfordshire), Windscale (Cumbria)
and Winfrith (Dorset), and is also
responsible for Britain’s fusion programme
(see below).
Fusion Research
Nuclear fusion in the UK is funded by the
DTI and Euratom (75 per cent and 25 per
cent respectively). The Government spends
£15 million a year on fusion research, of
which the main focus is magnetic
confinement, based at Culham science centre,
where Britain’s own nuclear fusion research is
carried out. The UK also operates the
experimental JET (Joint European Torus)
project, also at Culham. Through the EU the
Euratom/UKAEA Fusion Association
contributes to the international effort to
demonstrate the principle of power
production from fusion, currently embodied
in ITER (International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor).
Nuclear Safety
Responsibility for ensuring the safety of
nuclear installations falls to nuclear operators
within a system of regulatory control enforced
by the HSE.
The International Convention on Nuclear
Safety, in force since 1996, has been ratified
by 46 countries, including the UK, and each
has reported on how it has progressed towards
meeting its nuclear safety obligations. The
UK’s main contribution to the international
effort to improve safety in Central and
Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet
republics is channelled through the EU
PHARE and TACIS nuclear safety
programmes.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
ENERGY
R&D expenditure on renewables increased to
£14 million in 2000-01. Renewables play a
vital role in enabling the UK to meet its
environmental targets of reducing greenhouse
gases by 12.5 per cent by 2012 and C02
emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. The
Government’s targets are for renewable
energy to provide 5 per cent of UK electricity
supplies by 2003 and 10 per cent by 2010,
subject to the cost being acceptable to
consumers. Over 700 British companies are
involved in renewables, directly employing
some 3,500 people. UK renewables exports
are estimated to have risen to about £100
million in 1999-2000. The Government’s new
and renewable energy R&D programme
covers biofuels (including wastes), fuel cells,
hydro, solar, wave and wind. These accounted
for 2.6 per cent of all electricity generating
capacity in Britain in 1999; natural flow hydro
schemes provided about three-quarters of this
total.
The Government has announced that the
new Renewables Obligation will replace the
Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) and will
require all licensed electricity suppliers to buy
from renewable sources. The NFFO has
supported renewables-sourced power at above
the market price for conventionally generated
electricity, the difference being reimbursed
through the fossil fuel levy, paid by all
Britain’s coastal waters are the windiest
areas in Europe. It has the potential to
generate more than three times its
electricity consumption through offshore
wind turbines. The UK’s first offshore
wind farm, a 2 MW scheme off the
Northumberland coast, developed at a cost
of £4 million by Royal/Dutch Shell and
PowerGen under NFFO-4 and an EU
THERMIE grant, will generate enough
power to satisfy 3,000 homes. National
Power has spent £1 million rebuilding the
Croesor hydro plant at Blaencwm in
Snowdonia, built in the late 19th century
to serve slate quarries, but disused since
the early 1950s. It supplies 500 kW,
enough to power 500 homes. In 1999, Unit
Energy, the UK’s first independent power
trader to deal exclusively in green
electricity, launched its service to sell
electricity to domestic consumers and
small businesses.

Since 1990 the NFFO has provided over £600
million of support for renewables. In Scotland
an associated Renewables (Scotland)
Obligation will replace the Scottish
Renewables Obligation.
At 31 March 2000, under five Renewables
Orders for England and Wales, three for
Scotland and two for Northern Ireland, 933
projects have been contracted, with a declared
net capacity of 3,639 MW; 317 of these were
‘live’ and generating 762 MW. The cost of
renewable energy under successive Orders has
fallen significantly—from 6.4 pence a kilowatt
hour under NFFO-1 to an average 2.73
p/kWh under NFFO-5.

water from upland sources. Northern Ireland
also has plentiful supplies for domestic use
and for industry.
Water put into the public supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in
England and Wales averaged 15,144
megalitres a day (Ml/d) in 1998-99, of which
average daily consumption per head was about
160 litres. An average of 2,165 Ml/d was
supplied in Scotland in 1998-99. In Northern
Ireland the figure was 692 Ml/d.
Some 35,144 Ml/d were abstracted from
surface waters (for example, rivers and
reservoirs) in England and Wales in 1998, of
which public water supplies accounted for
11,723 Ml/d. The electricity supply industry
took 15,955 Ml/d; fish farming 5,182 Ml/d;
and agriculture 11 Ml/d, with spray irrigation
accounting for a further 144 Ml/d.
The UK is virtually self-sufficient in
construction minerals, and produces and
exports several industrial minerals, notably
china clay, ball clay, potash and salt. The
Boulby potash mine in north-east England is
the UK’s most important non-energy mineral
operation. Production in 1998 was down from
a record 1.03 million tonnes in 1996 to 1.01
million tonnes, of which 57 per cent was
exported. Sales of china clay (or kaolin), the
largest export, increased by 1.4 per cent to 2.4
million tonnes, of which 88 per cent of output
was exported.
The largest non-energy mineral imports are
metals (ores, concentrates and scrap—valued
at £1.5 billion in 1998), refined non-ferrous
metals (£3.8 billion) and non-metallic mineral
products (£4.5 billion, of which rough
diamonds account for £2.6 billion).
Water Supply
About 75 per cent of the UK’s water supplies
are obtained from mountain lakes, reservoirs
and river intakes; and about 25 per cent from
underground sources (stored in layers of
porous rock). South-east England and East
Anglia are more dependent on groundwater
than any other parts of the UK. Scotland and
Wales have a relative abundance of unpolluted
England and Wales
Water Companies
There are currently 25 water companies across
England and Wales with statutory
responsibilities for public water supply,
including quality and sufficiency. Ten of these
companies are also responsible for public
sewerage and sewage treatment.
The Water Industry Act 1999 prohibited
water companies from disconnecting
households, as well as other premises vital to
the community. It also introduced regulations
to protect water customers vulnerable to
hardship owing to high-measured water bills.
These groups have been defined as those with
meters who are in receipt of tax credits or
benefits and who have certain medical
conditions requiring high water use or have
three or more children under 16. Since 1989
water bills have risen by more than a third in
real terms. The Government also plans to
introduce a Water Bill which would comprise
provisions to encourage the efficient use of
water, including changes to the licensing
system for water abstraction, and provisions to
improve the regulation of the water industry
and promote the interests of consumers.
Over the next five years the Government
will require the water companies to pay for a
capital investment programme costing an
505
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
estimated £15 billion,5 including £7 A billion
on improving water quality and on meeting
new UK and EU environmental standards up
to 2005. It also wants to ensure that customers
do not have to face unreasonably high bills.
The Director General of Water Services,
who heads Ofwat (Office of Water Services),
the industry’s regulatory body, determined
that the companies’ efficiency improvements
would fund the investments specified and
offer average price cuts in real terms of 12.3
per cent from April 2000.
About 17 per cent of households and 87 per
cent of commercial and industrial customers
are charged for water on the basis of
consumption measured by meter. Most homes
are charged according to the rateable value of
their property. The Government has given
customers increased choice over whether or not
to be charged according to a water meter. As a
result, all water companies now supply free
meters to households on request. Average water
and sewerage bills for households without a
meter, at £268 in 1999-2000, are expected to be
£18 lower in real terms by 2005.
Of some 2.8 million tests on drinking water
in England and Wales in 1999, 99.82 per cent
met standards that are in some cases stricter
than those in the 1980 EC Drinking Water
Directive. A new EC Directive, adopted in
1998, requires member states to meet a
number of even more stringent standards, for
example an obligation to ensure maximum
concentrations of lead in water of 25
microgrammes per litre within five years and
10 pg/1 within 15 years.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI)
checks that water companies meet the
drinking water quality regulations.
Enforcement action is taken when there are
infringements of standards. The DWI also
investigates incidents and consumer
complaints about quality, and initiates
prosecution if water unfit for human
consumption has been supplied.
5 The programme includes dismantling what remains of
Victorian sewerage systems; tanks to prevent sewage
overflows; removal of lead from supply pipes; and
replacement of iron water mains, which cause
discoloration. The Government has accepted the
conclusions of a review on the provision of new sewers.
Competition
The Government has been undertaking a
review of the scope for extending competition
in the water industry in England and Wales
and published a consultation paper in April
2000. The Government favours competition,
provided it does not compromise water
quality, public health and wider social policies.
By September 2000 water industry
competition amounted to eight ‘inset
appointments’, under which a water company
can seek to be appointed to supply customers
in the area of another appointed water
company. Five of these involved Anglian
Water, and one a new entrant. Since April
2000 water companies have been subject to the
Competition Act 1998, which could result in
others using their pipe networks to supply
customers. In August 2000 the Government
lowered the ‘inset’ threshold allowing
customers to seek alternative suppliers from
users of 250 million litres a year to 100 million
litres. This means that some hospitals and
universities, for example, could go to another
supplier.
Ensuring Supplies
The Director General of Water Services set
the companies mandatory targets to reduce an
average leakage of some 200 million gallons a
day by 26 per cent between 1996 and 2000.
The industry spent £816 million on leakage
repair and £1.7 billion on mains rehabilitation
and replacement over 1998—2000.
Scotland
Responsibility for the provision of water and
sewerage services rests with three public
bodies—the North, West and East of Scotland
Water Authorities. The Water Industry
Commissioner for Scotland promotes
customer interests and advises the Scottish
Executive about the level of the authorities’
charges. Water Industry Consultative
Committees for each of the authorities advise
the Commissioner about customer interests.
Modernisation of the water industry is in
progress, with the authorities investing some
£1.8 billion over 1999-2002, including
506
29: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
projects worth about £700 million in
partnership with the private sector. New water
treatment plants are being built and all major
towns are expected to benefit from new waste
water treatment works by the end of 2000.
Prices for water services depend on the type of
consumer: domestic consumers presently pay
amounts based on their council tax band (see
p. 412) or in very few cases metered charges;
and non-domestic consumers pay non¬
domestic water rates, or metered charges and
trade effluent charges.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Executive envisages
expenditure of up to £2.5 billion over 15-20
years to bring water and sewerage services up
to standard and to meet increasing demand.
(Some of the main sewers of Belfast date from
Victorian times and may be at risk of collapse.)
An extra 10 per cent in water rates bills would
be necessary to pay for these improvements.

The service sector in the United Kingdom is continuing to grow and now
contributes over 70 per cent of gross value added at current basic prices and 75
per cent of employment. Over 21 million people had jobs in the service sector
at the end of 1999, a rise of nearly 800,000 in two years.
Financial services make a major contribution to the UK economy, and
London is by far the largest international Financial centre in Europe.
Technological change is having a significant impact in many areas, for
example, in the spread of telephone-based services and the growing use of the
Internet. New Internet banking services are being established, and share¬
dealing over the Internet has become much more widespread.
As a result of rising real incomes, consumer
spending on financial, personal and leisure
services has increased considerably. Travel,
hotel and restaurant services in the UK are
among those to have benefited from the growth
in tourism, and the UK is one of the world’s
leading tourist destinations. Computer
activities and business services are among the
non-fmancial sectors which experienced strong
growth in turnover in 1999 (see Table 30.1).
Financial Services
The UK’s financial services sector accounts
for over 6 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP) and employs more than 1 million
people. Net overseas earnings have risen
substantially, reaching a record £31.2 billion
in 1999.
Historically, the heart of the industry has
been in the ‘Square Mile’ in the City of
London, and this remains broadly the case.
Among the major financial institutions and
markets in the City are the Bank of England,
the London Stock Exchange and Lloyd’s
insurance market. The City is one of the
world’s three leading financial centres, along
with Tokyo and New York. An important
feature is the size of its international activities.
It is noted for having:

BI (British Invisibles) promotes the
international activities of UK-based financial
institutions and related business services. It also
seeks to raise awareness of the UK’s leading
role in international financial markets and of
the major contribution of financial services to
the UK economy. In April 2000 a review of the
role of BI, including its relationship with other
City organisations, was launched.
REGULATION
In 1997 the Government announced major
reforms of the regulation of financial services,
London has a full range of ancillary and
support services, including legal,
accountancy and management services. A
report by BI in December 1999 confirmed
London’s position as a leading centre for
international legal services. Of the world’s
50 largest legal firms, ten were based in
London, more than in any other centre.
City firms have established themselves as
leading advisers in international financial
markets, taking advantage of the growth in
international bond and equity issues, and
in mergers and acquisitions. Overseas
earnings of UK legal firms were £791
million in 1998, over 50 per cent higher
than in 1995. Legal services account for
1 per cent of UK national output and grew
by 5 per cent a year in real terms between
1992 and 1998.'
including the creation of the Financial
Services Authority (FSA). In 1998
responsibility for banking supervision was
transferred to the FSA from the Bank of
England. The Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 provides for the formal
establishment of the FSA, bringing together
the regulation of investment business, banks,
building societies and insurance companies
previously handled by nine regulatory bodies.
New compensation arrangements and a single
Financial Ombudsman are being set up. The
new regulatory regime is expected to be fully
operational by summer 2001.

FSA Objectives and Functions
The FSxVs statutory objectives are
maintaining confidence in the UK financial
system and promoting public understanding
of it, protecting consumers and reducing
financial crime. In delivering these objectives,
the FSA has to be efficient and economic,
facilitate innovation in financial services, take
account of the international nature of financial
services business and minimise any adverse
effects of regulation on competition.
The FSA is currently supplying regulatory
and other services under contract to several of
the regulatory bodies which it will replace when
the Act is fully implemented, including the
Building Societies Commission, the Friendly
Societies Commission, the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation, the
Securities and Futures Authority, and the
Personal Investment Authority. It is also
supplying services to HM Treasury in its
regulation of insurance business, including
regulatory oversight of the Lloyd’s market (see
p. 518). In the light of the development of
electronic trading systems and greater
competition between exchanges, the FSA is
reviewing its regulatory approach to investment
exchanges and clearing houses—it supervises
the UK’s seven recognised investment
exchanges (including the London Stock
Exchange) and two recognised clearing
houses, and will be taking over responsibility
from HM Treasury for supervising the nine
overseas investment exchanges which wish to
be recognised in the UK. In May 2000 the FSA
acquired responsibility from the London Stock
Exchange for acting as the competent authority
for listing companies in the UK, determining
the rules for companies that wish to be listed.
The FSA will also become responsible for
statutory regulation of key aspects of mortgage
lending, which will take effect in 2001 as part
of the Government’s plans to reform the
selling of mortgages (see p. 346), and a new
statutory system for regulating credit unions
(see p. 517).
Banking Supervision
Banks are required to meet minimum
standards on the integrity and competence of
In January 2000 the FSA announced a new
risk-based strategy for the regulation of
financial services designed to help the
Authority achieve its statutory objectives.
This new framework, which will come
fully into operation in 2001—02, will aim to
identify and address the most important
risks to firms, markets and consumers,
with less routine monitoring for well-run
firms. Each year the FSA will identify key
regulatory themes for priority attention by
managers and regulators.
directors and management, the adequacy of
capital and cash flow, and the systems and
controls to deal with the risks they experience.
If a bank fails to meet the criteria, its activities
may be restricted, or it may be closed. These
arrangements are intended to strengthen, but
not guarantee, the protection of bank
depositors, thereby increasing confidence in
the banking system as a whole. The FSA is
consulting on proposed changes to the
international agreement governing the
adequacy of capital, which are designed to link
this more closely to the degree of risk taken.
Consumer Education
The FSA is to publish comparative information
on costs and charges in savings, insurance and
pensions products, so that consumers will be
better able to assess the products available. It is
working with the Department for Education
and Employment and the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority on preparing guidelines
for personal finance education, which are being
included in the National Curriculum in
England from September 2000.
Compensation
A single Financial Services Compensation
Scheme is being set up for the protection of
consumers in cases where authorised firms are
unable to meet their liabilities. It will replace a
number of schemes, including the Investors
Compensation Scheme, for private investors;
the Deposit Protection Scheme, for bank
510
30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
customers; and the Building Societies Investor
Protection Scheme.
Financial Ombudsman Service
A new Financial Ombudsman Service is being
set up as a one-stop service for dealing with
complaints about financial services, and will
have an annual budget of around £20 million.
It will replace eight schemes, including those
covering banks, building societies, insurers
and firms conducting investment business. All
firms authorised by the FSA will be subject to
the Ombudsman’s procedures, but will be
required to attempt to resolve complaints
themselves in the first instance. Firms not
authorised by the FSA will be able to join the
scheme on a voluntary basis.
International Agreements
The UK plays a major role in international
efforts to maintain global prosperity and
prevent financial crises. The Group of Seven
(G7) leading industrialised countries agreed in
1998 on measures to reform the international
financial architecture, including enhanced
global supervision and strengthened co¬
operation between regulatory authorities. A
new Financial Stability Forum (FSF) was set
up in early 1999, bringing together senior
representatives of G7 national governments,
central banks and statutory regulators,
together with international financial
institutions and the key global financial
regulatory standard-setting agencies.
In March 2000 the FSF produced papers
with significant regulatory and other
recommendations on hedge funds, capital
flows and offshore financial centres. These
were aimed at improving standards and
strengthening stability, particularly in
vulnerable areas. The FSF has also
contributed views on programmes for
assessing regulatory standards in offshore
centres. Several UK Overseas Territories have
important financial services sectors, and the
UK and relevant Overseas Territories
governments have commissioned a review by
independent regulatory experts, due to be
published later in 2000.
HM Treasury represents the UK in
negotiating EC Directives on the financial
services sector, co-ordinating as necessary
with the FSA and other bodies.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its capital stock was acquired
by the Government in 1946. Fundamental
changes to the Bank’s role took effect under
the Bank of England Act 1998, in particular
the acquisition of operational responsibility for
setting interest rates.
As the UK’s central bank, the Bank’s
overriding objective is to maintain a stable and
efficient monetary and financial framework for
the effective operation of the economy. In
pursuing this goal, it has three main purposes:
• maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
• maintaining the stability of the financial
system; and
• seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
Monetary Policy Framework
The Bank’s monetary policy objective is to
maintain price stability and to support the
Government’s economic policy, including
growth and employment objectives. Price
stability is defined in terms of the
Government’s inflation target (see p. 388). The
responsibility for meeting this target rests with
the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, which
comprises the Governor, the two Deputy
Governors and six other members. The
Committee meets every month and interest rate
decisions are announced as soon as is practicable
after the meeting. The Committee is
accountable to the Bank’s Court of Directors as
regards its procedures and to Parliament.
Financial Stability
Under the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Bank, HM Treasury and the
FSA, the Bank is responsible for the overall
511
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
stability of the financial system, and its
Financial Stability Committee oversees the
Bank’s work in this area. In exceptional
circumstances, it may provide financial
support as a last resort to prevent problems
affecting one financial institution from
spreading to other parts of the financial
system. The Bank also oversees the
effectiveness of the financial sector in meeting
the needs of customers and in maintaining the
sector’s international competitiveness.
Other Main Functions
The Bank’s money market operations are
designed to steer short-term market interest
rates to levels required to implement monetary
policy. Through its daily operations in the
money market, the Bank supplies the funds
which the banking system as a whole needs to
achieve balance by the end of each settlement
day. It also acts as the Treasury’s agent in
managing the Government’s reserves of gold
and foreign exchange and its foreign currency
borrowing.
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It
plays a key role in payment and settlement
systems, and has sole right in England and
Wales to issue banknotes, which are backed by
government and other securities. The profit
from the note issue is paid directly to the
Government. Three Scottish and four
Northern Ireland banks may also issue notes,
but these have to be fully backed by Bank of
England notes.
Court of Directors
The Court of Directors is responsible for
managing the affairs of the Bank other than
the formulation of monetary policy. It
comprises the Governor, the two Deputy
Governors and 16 Directors. The Directors
form a sub-committee; functions include
reviewing the Bank’s performance in relation
to its objectives and strategy, and the internal
procedures of the Monetary Policy
Committee. The Court is required to report
annually to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
BANKING SERVICES
At the end of March 2000, there were 315
banks authorised to accept deposits in the UK
under the Banking Act 1987. In addition, 103
branches of European-authorised institutions
were entitled to accept deposits in the UK.
With around 20 per cent of cross-border bank
lending, the UK is the world’s largest single
market for international banking. Banks from
around 80 countries have subsidiaries,
branches or representative offices in London.
‘Retail’ banking primarily caters for
personal customers and small businesses,
offering services including current accounts,
savings accounts, loan arrangements, credit
and debit cards, mortgages, insurance,
investment products and share-dealing
services. Nearly all banks engage in some
‘wholesale’ activities, which involve taking
larger deposits, deploying funds in money-
market instruments, and making corporate
loans and investments, while some concentrate
on wholesale business. Many dealings are
conducted on the inter-bank market, among
banks themselves.
Around 85 per cent of households have at
least one member with a bank or building
society current account (see Table 30.2).
Retail Banks and Banking Groups
The ‘big four’ banks are HSBC, Lloyds T SB,
Royal Bank of Scotland (following its
acquisition of National Westminster in
February 2000) and Barclays. They have a
significant share of current accounts, credit
cards and personal loans (see Table 30.3).
Other large-scale banks include Halifax,
Abbey National, Bank of Scotland, Woolwich
(which is being acquired by Barclays), Alliance
& Leicester and Northern Rock. Standard
Chartered, which mainly operates overseas,
has a network of around 740 offices in more
than 55 countries, notably in Asia, Africa and
the Middle East.
Several large building societies have joined
the banking sector, and Bradford & Bingley is
due to convert to a bank by the end of 2000.
Other businesses, notably insurance
companies and supermarkets (see p. 524), have
also entered the sector, although relatively few

offer current accounts, while several US banks
have entered the market for issuing credit
cards.
Traditionally, the major banks have
operated through their branches, but the
number of branches is falling, as banks have
taken steps to cut costs, such as through
centralising ‘back office’ processing operations,
to take account of fewer customers in some
instances and as more customers are using
telephone and Internet banking (see box).
Review of UK Banking Services
A major independent review of banking
services, Competition in UK Banking: A Report
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, published in
March 2000, found that, although the UK had
a stable financial system and one of the most
open regulatory regimes in the world, a more
competitive policy framework was needed.
The main recommendations included:
• a stronger policy framework for the
Government’s approach to banking
services, which would aim to increase
transparency in banking supervision,
deliver effective competition scrutiny,
eliminate regulatory distortions and
prevent anti-competitive mergers in the
banking industry;
• the establishment of a new payments
system commission (PayCom), which
would supervise a licensing regime for
banks’ payments systems, such as those
used for debit and credit cards;
• an investigation of the existence or
possible existence of a monopoly position
in the supply of banking services to small
businesses;
• better information to help customers
make the most from developing
competition in the banking sector;

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Technological developments, such as the
growing use of telephone banking and of
automated teller machines for dispensing
and depositing money, are having a major
impact on banking. Over 8 million people
used telephone and/or personal computer
(PC)/Internet banking services in 1999, of
whom around 2 million used PC/Internet
banking. Most customers use these
services to view balances and transactions
or to transfer funds between accounts,
with only a small proportion using them
for making payments. Banking services
using the Internet are becoming much
more widely available. Most major banks
are introducing Internet banking, either as
an additional option for customers or as a
separate stand-alone facility. Several are
planning to introduce Internet banking
with access through mobile telephones
and/or digital television.
• an opportunity for everyone, especially
those on low incomes, to have access to
affordable basic banking services; and
• better procedures for handling
complaints about banking services.
The report also recommended that the
Government should review the impact of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 on
competition in banking two years after its
implementation, with particular emphasis on
the governance of the FSA and the impact of
regulation on competition.
Government Response
On publication of the report, the Government
announced that it would implement two of the
key recommendations through:
• referring to the Competition Commission
the supply of banking services to small
businesses by clearing banks; and
• announcing that it would legislate to
open up access to payment systems and
to oversee access charges.
In its formal response to the report,
published in August 2000, the Government
announced a number of new measures
designed to improve competition in UK
banking markets and to deliver benefits to
consumers, including:
• reviewing self-regulatory redress
mechanisms, with the aim of ensuring
that they deliver sufficient consumer
benefits;
• encouraging the provision of comparative
information on banking products;
• agreeing to a review of the effect of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
on competition after two years; and
• reforming the Treasury’s objectives on
promoting competition in financial
services.
Investment Banks
Investment banks offer a range of professional
financial services, including corporate finance
and asset management. A major activity is the
provision of advice and financial services to
companies, especially in respect of mergers,
takeovers and other forms of corporate
reorganisation. Investment banks have
considerable expertise in advising governments
on privatisation. Many UK-owned investment
banks have been acquired by overseas concerns,
the most recent example being the acquisition
in 2000 of Robert Fleming by Chase
Manhattan of the United States.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. As well
as their retail deposit-taking services, they
specialise in housing finance, making long¬
term mortgage loans against the security of
property—usually private dwellings
purchased for owner-occupation. Some of the
larger societies provide a full range of personal
banking services. According to the Building
Societies Association, about 17 million adults
have building society savings accounts, and
some 3 million adults are buying their homes
through mortgage loans from a building
society. The chief requirements for societies
are that:
514
30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
• their principal purpose is making loans
which are secured on residential property
and are funded substantially by their
members;
• at least 75 per cent of lending has to be
on the security of housing; and
• a minimum of 50 per cent of funds must
be in the form of deposits made by
individual members.
There are 68 authorised building societies,
all of which are members of the Building
Societies Association, with total assets of
around ^160 billion. The largest is the
Nationwide, with assets of £64 billion.
The number of societies has fallen
substantially as a result of mergers and the
decision by several large societies to give up
their mutual status and become banks. In July
2000 members of the Bradford & Bingley (the
second biggest society) voted to convert the
society to a bank. Many of the remaining
societies have taken steps to defend their
mutual status, for example, by requiring new
members to assign to charity any ‘windfall’
payments arising from a conversion.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card arrangements,
the main payment systems are run by three
separate companies operating under an
umbrella organisation, the Association for
Payment Clearing Services (APACS). One
system covers bulk paper clearings—cheques
and credit transfers. A second, CHAPS
(Clearing House Automated Payment System),
is a nationwide electronic transfer service
dealing with high-value clearings for same-day
settlement. A third covers bulk electronic
clearing for direct credits, standing orders and
direct debits. A total of 29 banks and building
societies are members of one or more clearing
companies, while several hundred others obtain
access to APACS clearing through agency
arrangements with one of the members.
Trends in Financial Transactions
Major changes in the nature of financial
transactions have included the rapid growth in
the use of plastic cards (which first appeared
in 1966) and of automated teller machines
(ATMs). According to APACS, there were
around 3.5 billion plastic transactions in the
UK in 1999 when 118 million plastic cards
were in circulation, with 86 per cent of adults
holding one or more cards. Most non-regular
payments are still made by cash, but the trend
is away from cash and cheques towards greater
use of plastic cards (see Table 30.4).
Consumers now acquire more than half
their cash through withdrawals from ATMs.
The number of ATMs has risen by three-
quarters in the last ten years, to 28,300 at the
end of 1999. There were 1,968 million cash
withdrawals from ATMs in 1999. About
three-fifths of adults use ATMs regularly,
making on average 67 withdrawals a year.
Plastic Cards
The main types of plastic card are debit cards,
credit/charge cards, cash cards and cheque
guarantee cards, although individual cards
frequently cover more than one use. Charge
cards are similar to credit cards, but are
designed to be paid off in full each month and
are usually available only to those with
relatively high income or assets. Several major
retailers issue store cards for use within their
own outlets. Electronic purse cards are being
tested: cards are ‘charged’ with money from
the card holder’s bank account, and can be
used to purchase goods or services at retailers
through electronic tills.
There are nearly 45 million credit cards
(including charge cards) in use in the UK, and
52 per cent of adults have at least one credit
card. Most credit cards are affiliated to one of
the two major international organisations, Visa
and MasterCard. Competition has increased,
with new providers entering the market and
particularly rapid growth in the number of
‘affinity’ cards, where the card is linked to an
organisation such as a charity or trade union.
Debit cards, where payments are deducted
directly from the purchaser’s bank or building
society account, were first issued in 1987.
Purchases using debit cards are rising rapidly,
with the volume of debit card pay ments up by
nearly 19 per cent in 1999. Over 46 million
cards have been issued, and around four-fifths

Banks have been concerned at the rising
level of fraud on plastic cards, with losses of
£189 million in 1999 being 40 per cent higher
than in 1998. They are investing in the
replacement of cards with a magnetic strip by
‘smart’ cards, in which information is
contained on a microchip embedded in the
card. These are very difficult to counterfeit
and can also store securely much more
information than was previously possible.
National Savings
National Savings, an executive agency of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a source of
finance for government borrowing and offers
personal savers a range of investments. Its
operational services—including its three main
sites in Blackpool, Durham and Glasgow—are
now run under a 15-year partnership
agreement with Siemens Business Services,
with National Savings retaining responsibility
for policy and marketing. In March 2000,
£62.5 billion was invested in National
Savings. Sales of National Savings products
totalled £10.2 billion in 1999-2000.
Premium Bonds are held by 23 million people
and are entered in a monthly draw, with tax-free
prizes ranging from £50 to a single top prize of
£1 million. Other savings products include
Savings Certificates (both Fixed Interest and
Index-linked), Pensioners’ Bonds, Children’s
Bonus Bonds and Ordinary and Investment
Accounts (where deposits and withdrawals can
be made at post offices). New products were
launched during 1999-2000, including a cash
mini ISA (Individual Savings Account—see
p. 520) and a new Fixed Rate Savings Bond.
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial and insurance services, such as small-
scale savings products, life insurance and
provision against loss of income through
sickness or unemployment. The Friendly
Societies Act 1992 enabled societies to
516
30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
incorporate, take on new powers and provide a
wider range of financial services through
subsidiaries. Under the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, the Government has
removed the remaining restrictions on the
activities of friendly society subsidiaries.
There are around 250 friendly societies,
with total funds of £15 billion and an
estimated membership of over 5 million. The
largest society is the Liverpool Victoria, which
has over 1 million members and manages some
£5 billion of funds.
Credit Unions
Credit unions are mutually owned financial
co-operatives. They are less widespread in the
UK than in some other countries, but grew
rapidly during the 1990s. There were 666
credit unions registered in Great Britain in
September 1999. At the end of 1998 credit
union membership amounted to 256,000 and
assets totalled just under £148 million.
In November 1999 a report by a Treasury
taskforce found that credit unions could
provide safe, low-cost loans of particular help
to those in disadvantaged communities who
have difficulty in obtaining credit. Following
the report, as part of its measures to deal with
financial exclusion, the Government
announced a bigger role for credit unions,
including more flexibility in their operations,
an increase in the maximum repayment period
for loans and a proposed new central services
organisation to spread best practice. Under
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000,
the statutory basis for the regulation of credit
unions will be strengthened, including the
introduction of a protection scheme similar to
that for bank and building society customers.
The FSA will be responsible for regulation.
Venture Capital
Venture capital companies offer medium- and
long-term equity financing for new and
developing businesses, management buy-outs
and buy-ins, and company rescues. The UK
sector is the largest and most developed in
Europe. The British Venture Capital
Association has 131 full members, which
represent a large majority of private equity and
venture capital sources in the UK. During 1999
UK venture capital companies invested a
record £7.8 billion worldwide in 1,358
businesses, 60 per cent more than in 1998.
Investment in the UK was up by 63 per cent to
£6.2 billion. The Government is encouraging
the further development of venture capital,
particularly for smaller firms, and is working
with the Regional Development Agencies to
establish new regional venture capital funds.
Other Credit and Financial Services
Finance houses and leasing companies provide
consumer credit, business finance and leasing,
and motor finance. The 92 full members of the
Finance and Leasing Association undertook
new business worth £67 billion in 1999.
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services, including credit management and
finance in exchange for outstanding invoices.
The industry provides working capital to more
than 27,000 businesses a year. Member
companies of the Factors & Discounters
Association handled business worth £64 billion
in 1999, 13 per cent higher than in 1998.
INSURANCE
London is one of the biggest centres for
insurance business, handling 24 per cent of
world marine insurance and 37 per cent of
aviation insurance business in 1998. It is also
the largest global centre for reinsurance.
Main Types of Insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance:
long-term (such as life insurance), where
contracts may be for periods of many years;
and general, where contracts are for a year or
less. Most insurance companies reinsure their
risks; this performs an important function in
spreading losses and in helping insurance
companies to manage their businesses.
Long-term Insurance
Around 230 companies handle long-term
insurance. In addition to providing life cover,
517
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
life insurance is a vehicle for saving and
investment as premiums are invested in
securities and other assets. About 63 per cent
of households have life insurance cover. Total
long-term insurance assets under management
by companies in 1998 were £739 billion on
behalf of their worldwide operations. Total
long-term premium income by companies in
1998 was £87 billion.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, motor, marine, aviation and other
transport risks. Competition has intensified in
areas like motor and household insurance,
particularly with the growth of insurers
offering telephone-based services. Total
worldwide premium income of members of
the Association of British Insurers (ABI) in
1998 was £41 billion, of which £27 billion was
earned in the UK.
Structure of the Industry
At the end of 1999, around 800 companies
were authorised to carry on one or more
classes of insurance business in the UK. Over
420 companies belong to the ABI.
The industry, which includes both public
limited companies and mutual institutions
(companies owned by their policyholders), has
seen considerable restructuring in recent years.
In 2000 two of the biggest concerns, CGU and
Norwich Union, merged to form CGNU,
which is now the largest insurance group in the
UK; it controls over £200 billion in funds
under management and has more than 25
million customers worldwide. The mutually
owned sector is gradually contracting—
Scottish Widows has been acquired by the
banking group Lloyds TSB, Scottish Provident
is being acquired by Abbey National, and
Friends Provident and Equitable Life have
announced their intention to abandon their
mutual status. However, in June 2000 members
of Standard Life, the largest mutual insurer in
Europe, rejected resolutions put forward in a
campaign to convert the insurer to a public
limited company.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private
insurers in London. It is not a company but a
market for insurance administered by the
Council of Lloyd’s and Lloyd’s Regulatory
and Market Boards.
The net premium income of the market in
1997 was £4.7 billion. For 2000 the market
has a total projected allocated capacity of
£10.0 billion, of which some £8.0 billion will
be capacity provided by 853 limited liability
members, representing both companies and
individuals who have converted to limited
liability. The number of individual ‘Names’—
wealthy individuals who accept insurance risks
for their own profit or loss, with unlimited
liability—was 3,296 in 2000. Members
underwrite through 123 syndicates. Each
syndicate is managed by an underwriting
agent responsible for appointing a professional
underwriter to accept insurance risks and
manage claims on behalf of the members.
Insurance may currently only be placed
through 127 active Lloyd’s brokers and one
‘umbrella’ broker, which negotiate with Lloyd’s
syndicates on behalf of the insured. However, in
May 2000 Lloyd’s announced that it would
open up the market from January 2001 when
other UK and overseas brokers would be able to
have access, subject to meeting certain technical
and customer service standards. Reinsurance
constitutes a large part of Lloyd’s business—
around 3 per cent of the world’s reinsurance is
placed at Lloyd’s. Around one-sixth of Lloyd’s
current work is in its traditional marine market,
and it has a significant share of the UK motor
insurance market. Lloyd’s is a major insurer of
aviation and satellite risks, and underwrites in
other areas of insurance except long-term life
insurance.
Under the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000, the FSA will have regulatory
oversight of Lloyd’s. The FSA’s primary
concern will be protecting the interests of
Lloyd’s policyholders.
Insurance Brokers and Intermediaries
Medium to large insurance brokers almost
exclusively handle commercial matters, with
the biggest dealing in worldwide risks. Smaller
518
30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
brokers deal mainly with personal lines, such
as motor, household and holiday insurance, or
specialise in a particular type of commercial
insurance. Some brokers specialise in
reinsurance business. Under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, the statutory
regime of professional standards governing
insurance brokers will be abolished and
replaced by a new self-regulating regime for
intermediaries arranging general insurance
business, which will operate under the
General Insurance Standards Council. For
intermediaries arranging life insurance
constituting an investment (such as a personal
pension), regulation will be by the FSA.
INVESTMENT
The UK has considerable expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on behalf of investors, or advising them how
best to invest their funds. The main types of
investment fund include pension schemes, life
insurance, unit trusts, open-ended investment
companies and investment trusts. According
to BI, identified assets under management in
the UK totalled £2,500 billion at the end of
1998, one-third more than at the end of 1995,
and overseas service earnings of the fund
management industry were £540 million in
1999.
Pension funds are major investors in
securities markets, holding around 22 per cent
of securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Funds are managed mainly by the
investment management houses.
Unit Trusts
Over 1,800 authorised unit trusts and open-
ended investment companies (oeics) pool
investors’ money, and divide funds into units
or shares of equal size, enabling people w ith
relatively small amounts of money to benefit
from diversified and managed portfolios. In
April 2000 total funds under management
were £254 billion, 21 per cent higher than a
year earlier; £58 billion represented funds in
Personal Equity Plans and £12 billion in
Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), with over
4 million ISA accounts taken out in
1999-2000. Most unit trusts are general funds,
investing in a wide variety of UK or
international securities, but there are also
many specialist funds.
There are over 150 unit trust management
groups, of which 61 had total fund values
exceeding £1 billion in April 2000. Unit trust
management groups are represented by the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds (AUTIF). According to AUTIF, the
four largest groups are Fidelity, Schroders,
M & G and Threadneedle, all with fund
values exceeding £10 billion.
Oeics are similar to unit trusts, but
investors buy shares in the fund rather than
units. They were set up in 1997 to enable UK
companies to compete on an equal footing
with similar schemes operating elsewhere in
the EU. By April 2000, 381 oeics had been set
up by 43 management groups.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares can
be bought and sold in the same way as other
companies. Like unit trusts, they offer the
opportunity to diversify risk on a relatively
small lump-sum investment or through
regular savings; investments can be made
through private investor plans administered
by their managements. Investment trusts are
exempt from tax on gains realised within the
funds and invest principally in the shares and
securities of other companies. Assets are
purchased mainly out of shareholders’ funds,
although investment trusts are also allowed to
borrow money for investment.
There are about 350 investment trusts,
which form the largest listed sector of the
London Stock Exchange. Around 40 per cent
of their shares by value are held by private
investors. Over 300 listed trust companies are
members of the Association of Investment
Trust Companies. At the end of April 2000
the industry had £80 billion of assets under
management and a stock market capitalisation
of £65 billion. The three largest trusts by
market capitalisation are the venture capital
company 3i Group, Foreign & Colonial
Investment Trust and Witan Investment
Trust.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Share Ownership
Financial institutions hold the bulk of equities.
At the end of 1999 UK financial institutions
held ordinary shares valued at £917 billion (51
per cent of the total market value of £1,807
billion), with insurance companies holding £390
billion and pension funds £354 billion. Holders
from outside the UK had £530 billion. The
value of holdings of UK individual shareholders
was £276 billion (15 per cent). About 28 per
cent of households have at least one person
owning shares (see Table 30.2).
According to ProShare (an independent
organisation encouraging share ownership),
the number of investment clubs—groups of
individuals, usually about 15 to 20 people,
who regularly invest in shares—has risen to
around 8,000. The conversion of a number of
building societies to banks, privatisation,
employee share schemes and measures to
increase tax-free savings have led to increased
share ownership by individuals. The spread of
low-cost share dealing facilities has also
facilitated the growth in share ownership.
Initially these were available on an execution-
only basis primarily by post and telephone,
but recently there has been a rapid rise in
share-dealing and other personal finance
services available over the Internet.
Tax-free Savings
The main method of tax-free saving is now the
Individual Savings Account (ISA). The
Government introduced IS As in April 1999 to
help encourage savings, especially among
those on more modest incomes, and to
distribute the tax relief on savings more fairly.
They succeeded Personal Equity Plans
(PEPs), which allowed tax-free investment in
shares, unit trusts and certain corporate
bonds, and TESSAs (Tax Exempt Special
Savings Accounts, of which 5.7 million were
held in March 1999). Between 1987 and April
1999 some £70 billion were subscribed to 17
million PEPs.
ISAs allow tax-free saving of up to £5,000 a
year (£7,000 in 1999-2000 and 2000-01).
There are three main elements of an ISA:
• cash—up to an annual total of £1,000
(£3,000 in 1999-2000 and 2000-01)—
such as in a bank or building society ISA
account;
• stocks and shares—up to a maximum of
£5,000 a year (£7,000 in 1999-2000 and
2000-01); and
• life insurance—up to £1,000 a year.
There are two main types of ISA: a maxi
ISA, which can include all three elements in a
single ISA with one manager; and mini
ISAs—an individual can have three mini ISAs
each year, from different managers, for cash,
stocks and shares, and life insurance, but is
not allowed to take out both a mini ISA and a
maxi ISA in the same tax year.
In 1999-2000 over 9.3 million ISAs were
opened, attracting nearly £28.4 billion, about
a third more than the sum put into PEPs and
TESSAs combined in 1998-99.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange is one of the
world’s leading exchanges. In August 2000,
1,911 UK and 504 international companies were
listed on the main market, with a market
capitalisation of £1,968 billion and £3,831
billion respectively. A further 460 companies,
with a total capitalisation of £17.3 billion, were
listed on AIM, the Alternative Investment
Market, primarily for small, young and growing
companies. In November 1999 the London
Stock Exchange launched ‘techMARK’, a
market which brings together 190 of the listed
companies engaged in technology or related
sectors. CREST, a computerised settlement
system for shares and other company securities,
handles the settlement of all company securities
traded in the UK.
The value and volume of equity business
on the Exchange reached record levels in
1999. Turnover in international equities was
10 per cent higher than in 1998, at £2,403
billion, while turnover in UK equities was up
by 36 per cent, to £1,406 billion.
Several other products for raising capital
are handled, including Eurobonds (see below),
warrants, depositary receipts and gilt-edged
stock (see p. 405). The London Stock
520
30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Exchange provides a secondary or trading
market where investors can buy or sell gilts.
Other Equity Exchanges
Three other markets in the City of London for
trading equities are Tradepoint, OM London,
and Ofex (a lightly regulated exchange run by
market maker J. P. Jenkins). Tradepoint has
developed a pan-European electronic trading
facility with the backing of a group of
investment banks, and in July 2000 agreed a
merger of its facilities with those of the Swiss
stock exchange to form a new exchange, Virt-
X, which should be fully operational by early
2001.
Euromarket
The Euromarket began with Eurodollars—US
dollars lent outside the United States—and
has developed into a major market in a variety
of currencies lent outside their domestic
markets. London is at the centre of the
Euromarket and houses most of the leading
international banks and securities firms. Its
share of trading in the two main types of
international bonds—Eurobonds and foreign
bonds—is around 70 per cent. Coredeal, the
most recently recognised UK investment
exchange, started operations in May 2000 and
acts as an exchange for transactions involving
such bonds.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, accounting for about
30 per cent of global net daily turnover in
foreign exchange. A survey by the Bank of
England in 1998 found that daily turnover in
the UK was US$637 billion. Dealing is
conducted through telephone and electronic
links between the banks, other financial
institutions and a number of firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries.
The institutions keep close contact with
financial centres abroad and quote buying and
selling rates throughout the day for both
immediate (‘spot’) and forward transactions in
many currencies. Foreign exchange trading
has declined globally following the
introduction of the euro in 1999 (see p. 79),
but trading in London has declined less than
in financial centres in the euro area.
LIFFE
The London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange (LIFFE) handles
financial derivatives (including ‘futures’ and
‘options’), which offer a means of protection
against changes in prices, exchange rates and
interest rates. It also handles trade in
commodities, such as coffee, cocoa and sugar.
LIFFE has 214 members, including many of
the world’s leading financial institutions.
LIFFE handled 117 million futures and
options contracts in 1999, and currently is
handling an average of nearly 624,000
contracts a day, with a nominal average value
of over £300 billion.
All LIFFE’s financial futures and options
contracts are now trading on the LIFFE
Connect electronic trading system, and the
commodity contracts will move to this system
in November 2000. In June 2000 LIFFE
announced its intention to work with
technology and venture capital partners to
accelerate the development of its exchange
business using the Connect system and to
exploit the opportunities available in the
rapidly growing e-commerce business-to-
business markets.
Other Exchanges
Other important City exchanges include:
• the London bullion market—around 60
banks and other financial trading
companies participate in the London
gold and silver markets;
• the London Metal Exchange (LME)—the
primary base metals market in the world,
trading contracts in aluminium,
aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin
and zinc;
• the International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE); and
• the Baltic Exchange—the world’s leading
international shipping market.

Other Services
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale is a major
economic activity. The large wholesalers and
retailers of food and drink operate extensive
distribution networks, either directly or
through contractors.
WHOLESALING
In 2000 there were almost 113,000 enterprises
(see Table 30.5) engaged in wholesaling in the
UK; 26 per cent were sole proprietors and 15
per cent partnerships. There were 1,120,000
employee jobs in the UK in this sector in
December 1999 and turnover in 1999 amounted
to £328 billion, 0.4 per cent lower than in 1998.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small
wholesalers and independent grocery retailers
belong to voluntary ‘symbol’ groups, which
provide access to central purchasing facilities
and co-ordinated promotions. This has helped
smaller retailers to remain relatively
competitive; many local and convenience
stores and village shops would not otherwise
be able to stay in business. London’s wholesale
markets play a significant part in the
distribution of fresh foodstuffs. New Covent
Garden is the main market for fruit and
vegetables, London Central Markets for meat
and Billingsgate for fish.
In April 2000 Co-operative Wholesale
Society (CWS) and Co-operative Retail
Services (CRS) merged, integrating separate
food retailing, funerals and motor businesses.
The merger has created the UK’s largest
mutual retail group, with an annual turnover
of £4.7 billion, 1,135 stores and more than
50,000 employees.
CWS has been the principal supplier of
goods and services to the Co-operative
Movement and was a founder member of the
Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG).
The latter was formed in 1993 to act as a
central marketing, buying and distribution
partnership for retail co-operative societies.
522
30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
The CRTG now accounts for around 90 per
cent of Co-op food trade. CWS is also the
largest co-operative retailer in Europe, with
stores located in Scotland, Northern Ireland,
Wales, Cumbria, Nottingham, south Midlands
and the south-west, south-east and north-east
of England. Retail co-operative societies are
voluntary organisations controlled by their
members, membership being open to anyone
paying a small deposit on a minimum share.
The Co-operative Movement, which
comprises 44 independent societies, has
around 2,560 stores.
RETAILING
The retail sector accounts for 40 per cent of all
consumer expenditure and employs one in 11
of the workforce. In 2000 there were nearly
201,000 retail enterprises in the UK (see Table
30.5) ; 43 per cent were sole proprietors and 35
per cent partnerships. In December 1999 there
were 2,528,000 employee jobs in the UK in this
sector. Total turnover in the retail trade sector
(including repair of personal and household
goods) in 1998 amounted to £199 billion, over
6 per cent higher than in 1997. Businesses
range from national supermarket and other
retail chains to independent corner grocery
shops, hardware stores, chemists, newsagents
and a host of other types of retailer. The large
multiple retailers have grown considerably,
tending to increase outlet size until relatively
recently and to diversify product ranges. Some
also operate overseas, through either
subsidiaries or franchise agreements. Small
independent retail businesses and co-operative
societies have been in decline for some time.
Sunday trading laws have been relaxed to allow
retailers to open for specified periods on
Sundays. To help their competitive position,
smaller retailers can open for longer hours than
the larger supermarkets and department stores,
which are restricted to six hours, except in
Scotland. Some main supermarket chains are
experimenting with 24-hour opening on six
days a week.
The volume of retail sales rose by about 25
per cent between 1989 and 1999 (see Table
30.6) . Growth in non-food stores (28 per cent)
has been slightly higher than predominantly
food stores (26 per cent), with the most
significant increase in household goods stores,
48 per cent higher than in 1989.
The four biggest supermarket chains by
sales value are Tesco (with about 600 stores),
J. Sainsbury (400, excluding 12 Savacentre
stores), Asda (230, excluding Dales) and
Safeway (480, excluding Presto and
Wellworths). They accounted for 45 per cent
of total grocery sales, worth £96.6 billion in
1999. Asda was taken over by US discount
giant Wal-Mart in 1999. Other significant
food retailers are Somerfield, Marks &
Spencer, Waitrose, Iceland and Morrisons
which account for 16 per cent of grocery sales.
Alcoholic drinks are sold mainly in specialist
‘off licences’ and in supermarkets.
The leading mixed retail chains are found
in high streets nationwide. Competition with
lower-priced outlets and discount chains is
squeezing some of the more traditional
suppliers selling a range of items. Several
chains of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) stores and
superstores cater for people carrying out their
own repairs and improvements to their homes
and gardens; they stock tools, decorating and
building materials, kitchen and bathroom
As part of its inquiry into the supply of
groceries from multiple stores, the
Competition Commission (see p. 397)
considered a range of issues including
price competition, competition for services
and sites, relationships with suppliers and
whether local monopolies exist. The
results of the inquiry, announced in
October 2000, found that the big
supermarket chains were broadly
competitive and did not charge excessive
prices or earn excessive profits. The report
cited a number of concerns over a lack of
supermarket competition in local areas and
below-cost pricing, and highlighted
concerns over retailers’ relationships with
suppliers. It also recommended that those
with more than 8 per cent of the £90
billion a year food industry—the top five
retailers, Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Asda,
Safeway and Somerfield—should be
legally required to comply with an
industry code of practice.

Source: Office for National Statistics—annual data derived from short-term turnover inquiries
fittings, and garden products. Specialist shops
such as those selling mobile telephones have
shown substantial growth.
The large multiple groups have broadened
their range of goods and services. Large food
retailers are also placing greater emphasis on
selling own-label groceries (which now
account for over half of sales) and
environmentally friendly products (including
organic produce), together with household
wares and clothing. In-store pharmacies, post
offices, customer cafeterias and dry-cleaners
are now a feature of large supermarkets, which
also sell books, magazines, newspapers, pre¬
recorded videos, cassettes, compact discs and
electrical goods. ‘Stores within stores’ are
common; for example, sportswear and sports
goods retailers are found in several of the big
mixed department stores. The major
supermarket chains have their own petrol
stations at some of their bigger outlets (see
p. 525). Several large retailers offer personal
finance facilities in an attempt to encourage
sales, particularly of high-value goods, while
others have diversified into financial services.
Some supermarkets now offer banking
facilities (see also p. 512). ‘Loyalty’ cards were
introduced in the mid-1990s by supermarket
and other retail groups, giving regular
customers cash discounts related to the size of
their purchases and providing the stores with
detailed information on shoppers’ buying
habits.
A survey by NatWest and the British
Franchise Association (BFA) in March 2000
estimated that there were 642 fully-fledged
business-format franchises, with around
35,000 outlets, accounting for 316,000 direct
jobs in Britain and with annual turnover of
£8.9 billion. Franchising is a business in
which a company owning the rights to a
particular form of trading licenses them to
franchisees, usually by means of an initial
payment with continuing royalties. Franchised
activities operate in many areas, including
cleaning services, film processing, print shops,
fitness centres, courier delivery, car rental,
engine tuning and servicing, and fast food
retailing. About 300 franchisers are members
of the BFA.
Vehicle, Vehicle Parts and Petrol Retailing
In December 1999 there were 551,000
employee jobs in the UK in retailing motor
vehicles and parts, and in petrol stations.
Turnover in the motor trades industry in 1999
amounted to almost £123 billion, 1 per cent
higher than in 1998 (see Table 30.7).
Most businesses selling new vehicles are
franchised by the motor manufacturers.
Vehicle components are available for sale at
garages which undertake servicing and repair
work and also at retail chains and at
independent retailers. Drive-in fitting centres
sell tyres, exhaust systems, batteries, clutches
and other vehicle parts. According to the
Retail Motor Industry Federation, there were
12,850 retail outlets for petrol at the end of
1999, with the top three companies accounting
for about one-third of the total. The number
of petrol stations has declined by about 35 per
cent between 1989 and 1999, reflecting intense
competition in the sector, relatively low profit

margins and consolidation among operators.
This is particularly so in rural areas. Petrol
stations have increasingly offered other retail
services, such as shops, car washes and fast
food outlets, with the aim of attracting more
business. Over one-quarter of petrol sold in
the UK comes from the 1,050 supermarket
forecourts operated at the end of 1999.
Shopping Facilities
Government policy is to focus new retail
development in existing centres. This is to
ensure that everyone has easy access to a range
of shops and services, whether they have a car
or not; and to enable businesses of all sizes and
types to prosper. Many smaller and middle-
range retailers traditionally concentrated in
high streets have experienced high costs, with
a result that many have closed down. The
Government aims to revitalise town centres by
focusing new shopping, leisure and other
facilities in these centres. One of the most
significant trends in retailing has been the
spread of superstores, many of which were
built away from urban centres until recently.
Since 1996, social, economic and
environmental considerations have led the
Government and local planning authorities to
limit new retail developments outside town
centres, as these had undermined the vitality
and viability of existing town and district
centres, were not always readily accessible by
those without a car and encouraged greater car
use.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local planning
authority, which must consult central
government before granting permission for
most retail developments of 2,500 sq m
(27,000 sq ft) or more. Retailers’ attentions are
now being turned back to town centres,
redeveloping existing stores and building
smaller outlets. Almost 50 new small (1,000
sq m) stores have been opened by two of the
major supermarket chains so far and up to 50
smaller (300 sq m) stores are planned over the
next two years.
Regional out-of-town shopping centres, of
which there are eight, are located on sites
offering good road access and ample parking
facilities. The latest is the Bluewater shopping
centre near Dartford, Kent, which opened in
1999. It is the largest out-of-town retail
development in Europe, covering 160,000 sq
m (1.7 million sq ft), and has created some
7,000 jobs. It has 320 shops and parking for
13,000 cars, and attracted 28 million shoppers
in its first year of opening. It is likely to be the
last such out-of-town centre. The other out-
of-town regional shopping centres are: the
Metro Centre at Gateshead in Tyne and
Wear; Meadowhall near Sheffield; Trafford
Centre in Manchester; Merry Hill at Dudley
in the West Midlands; Cribbs Causeway at
Bristol; Lakeside at Thurrock in Essex, and
Braehead, near Glasgow. About half of total
food sales are accounted for by superstores
away from town centres, compared with a fifth
at the beginning of the 1980s.
Retailers of non-food goods, such as DIY
products, toys, furniture and electrical
appliances, sportswear, and office and
computer products, have also built outlets
away from urban centres. There was a trend in
the 1990s towards grouping retail warehouses

into retail parks, often with food and other
facilities, although planning controls now limit
approvals for new retail warehouse parks.
Computers monitor stock levels and record
sales figures through electronic point-of-sale
(EPOS) systems by means of product bar
codes. Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which products arrive at the store
at the last possible moment before sale, have
become widespread as a result. Electronic data
interchange (EDI) systems enable retailers’ and
suppliers’ computers to communicate and
transmit orders and invoices electronically, so
reducing errors and saving time. ‘Superscan’
technology—where customers use an electronic
scanning device to calculate their own bills—is
undergoing trials in a number of supermarkets.
Home Shopping
Traditionally, all kinds of goods and services
have been, and can still be, purchased through
mail order catalogues. In 1998 sales by direct
and agency mail order totalled £8.15 billion.
The largest-selling items are clothing,
footwear, furniture, household textiles and
domestic electrical appliances. More recently
introduced have been electronic home
shopping, using a television and telephone,
and ‘online’ shopping, where personal
computers are linked to databases—this
‘e-commerce’ is growing rapidly.
Supermarkets are looking closely at different
forms of home shopping (by telephone, fax
and Internet) and delivery.
CONSUMER PROTECTION
The Government aims to maintain and
develop a clear and fair regulatory framework
that gives confidence to consumers and
contributes to the competitiveness of business.
It works closely with outside bodies that have
expert knowledge of consumer issues to
develop policies and legislation. In July 1999,
the Government issued a White Paper,
Modern Markets: Confident Consumers, setting
out a range of initiatives to improve protection
for consumers. The main proposals include: a
hallmark for consumers identifying companies
signed up to a code of practice and a digital
hallmark for Internet traders abiding by codes
guaranteeing security of payment and privacy
of information; increased powers to deal with
dishonest traders; new advice networks,
including a consumer ‘gateway’ on the
Internet; new measures to ensure information
is accurate, comprehensive and easy to
understand; a review of consumer protection
legislation; and a review by the Director
General of Fair Trading of his consumer
protection functions.
Consumer Legislation
The Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended in
1994) ensures that consumers are entitled to
receive goods which fit their description and
are of satisfactory quality. The Trade
Descriptions Act 1968 prohibits
misdescriptions of goods and services, and
enables regulations to be made requiring
information or instructions relating to goods
to be marked on, or to accompany, the goods
or to be included in advertisements.
Misleading indications about prices of
goods are covered by the Consumer Protection
Act 1987. This Act also makes it a criminal
offence to supply unsafe products, and
provides product liability rights for
consumers. The regulatory framework to
control product safety is a mixture of
European and UK legislation, voluntary safety
standards and industry codes of practice. The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
runs a programme of safety awareness
initiatives. This aims to reduce accidents by
increasing consumer awareness of potential
hazards in the home and by encouraging
consumers to change their behaviour.1
The marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
Another law provides for the control of medical
products, and certain other substances and
articles, through a system of licences and
certificates. New regulations have been
introduced to strengthen the protection of
consumers from unscrupulous doorstep sellers.
1 DTI’s Home Accident Surveillance System shows that,
every year, there are just under 4,000 deaths and nearly 3
million medically treated injuries as a result of home
accidents.

30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractice. Under the Fair Trading
Act 1973, the Director General can
recommend legislative or other changes to
stop practices adversely affecting consumers’
economic interests; encourage trade
associations to develop codes of practice
promoting consumers’ interests; and
disseminate consumer information and
guidance. The Director General can also
demand assurances as to future conduct from
traders who persistently breach the law to the
detriment of consumers.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is intended
to protect consumers in their dealings with
credit businesses. Most businesses connected
with the consumer credit or hire industry or
which supply ancillary credit services—for
example, credit brokers, debt collectors, debt
counsellors and credit reference agencies—
require a consumer credit licence. The
Director General is responsible for
administering the licensing system, including
refusing or revoking licences of those unfit to
hold them. The Director General also has
powers to prohibit unfit people from carrying
out estate agency work; to take court action to
prevent the publication of misleading
advertisements; and to stop traders using
unfair terms in standard contracts with
consumers.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety, protection of
the consumer’s economic interests, promotion
of consumer education and strengthening the
representation of consumers. The views of
British consumer organisations on EU matters
are represented by a number of organisations
including the National Consumers Council and
the Consumers in Europe Group (UK).
Consumer Advice and Information
Citizens Advice Bureaux deal with over 60
million problems a year, providing advice on a
wide range of subjects at around 770 bureaux
in the UK. Their work is co-ordinated by a
national association linked to the bureaux by
local and regional committees (Scotland has its
own Association). Similar assistance is
provided by trading standards and consumer
protection departments of local authorities in
Great Britain and, in some areas, by specialist
consumer advice centres.
The National Consumer Council (and
associated councils for Scotland and Wales),
which receives government finance, gives its
view to government, industry and others on
consumer issues. The General Consumer
Council for Northern Ireland has wide-
ranging duties in consumer affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the
consumer. Some trade associations have set up
codes of practice. In addition, several
organisations work to further consumer
interests by representing the consumer’s view
to government, industry and other bodies.
The largest is the Consumers’ Association,
funded by the subscriptions of approximately
1 million members to its various Which?
magazines.
HOTELS, RESTAURANTS AND
CATERING
The hotel and restaurant trades, which
include public houses (pubs), wine bars and
other licensed bars in addition to all kinds of
businesses offering accommodation and
prepared food, had 1,371,000 employee jobs in
the UK in December 1999. Total turnover in
1999 amounted to £51 billion, 7 per cent
higher than in 1998. There are estimated to be
over 60,000 hotels and guest houses in the
UK, ranging from major hotel groups to small
guest houses, individually owned. Holiday
centres, including holiday camps with full
board, self-catering centres and caravan parks,
are run by several companies.
In 1999 there were around 44,420
restaurants, cafes and take-away food shops in
the UK, with a total turnover of £15 billion,
10 per cent higher than in 1998. An analysis of
the UK restaurant market—including fast
food outlets and takeaways as well as eat-in
restaurants and cafes—showed sales of £14.17
billion in 1999, 5.3 per cent higher than in
1998. Excluding sales not generated in sit-
down eating outlets, such as sandwich shops,
the total market was estimated at £10.15
billion in 1999. Burger restaurants accounted
for 16.1 per cent of the total, public house
527
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
restaurants 12.7 per cent, pizza and pasta
restaurants 7.4 per cent, roadside restaurants
5.6 per cent, and other restaurants—ranging
from small cafes and bars, and ethnic food
outlets, through to expensive restaurants, as
well as many chicken outlets and some fish
and chip outlets—58.2 per cent.
Restaurants offer cuisine from virtually
every country in the world, and several of the
highest-quality ones have international
reputations. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Italian,
French and Greek restaurants are very
popular. ‘Fast food’ restaurants are
widespread, many of which are franchised.
They specialise in selling hamburgers,
chicken, pizza and a variety of other foods, to
be eaten on the premises or taken away.
Traditional fish and chip shops are another
main provider of cooked take-away food.
Sandwich bars are common in towns and
cities, typically in areas with high
concentrations of office workers.
There were an estimated 50,500 pubs in the
UK in 2000, a decline of over 6 per cent since
1990. They account for 58 per cent of all fully-
licensed premises, compared with 65 per cent
in 1990. Estimated sales in 1999 were £13.75
billion, averaging £270,000 per pub. Pubs sell
alcoholic drinks (beer, wines and spirits) to
adults for consumption on the premises, with
non-alcoholic (soft) drinks and hot and cold
food a growing part of their trade. Many pubs
are owned by the large brewing companies
which either provide managers to run them or
offer tenancy agreements; these pubs tend to
sell just their own brands of beer, although
some also offer ‘guest’ beers. Others, called
‘free houses’, are independently owned and
managed, and frequently serve a variety of
different branded beers. Wine bars are
normally smaller than pubs and tend to
specialise in wine and food. ‘Themed’ pubs,
for example Irish bars, are becoming
increasingly popular.
TRAVEL AGENTS
Most British holidaymakers travelling
overseas buy ‘package holidays’ from travel
agencies, where the cost covers both transport
and accommodation. Popular package holiday
destinations include Spain and France. Long-
haul holidays to places like North America,
the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand
have gained in popularity as air fares have
come down. Some people prefer to travel
more independently, and there are travel firms
that will make just travel arrangements for
customers.
Around 85 per cent of high street travel
agencies are members of the Association of
British Travel Agents (ABTA). Although
most are small businesses, a few large firms
have hundreds of branches. Nearly 830 tour
operators are members of ABTA; about half
are both retail agents and tour operators. In
1999 turnover in the travel agency and tour
operator businesses amounted to £16 billion,
3 per cent higher than in 1998. ABTA
operates financial protection schemes to
safeguard its members’ customers and
maintains codes of conduct drawn up with the
Office of Fair Trading. It also offers a free
consumer affairs service to help resolve
complaints against members, and a low-cost
independent arbitration scheme for members’
customers. The British Incoming Tour
Operators’ Association is the leading body
representing tour operators engaged in
incoming tourism to the UK.
TOURISM AND LEISURE
Tourism is one of the UK’s key long-term
growth sectors, with total spending in 1999
estimated at £64 billion. In Great Britain
there were around 1.8 million jobs in tourism
and related activities in 1999; of these, around
155,000 are self-employed. About 126,000
businesses, mainly independent small ones—
hotels and guest houses, restaurants, holiday
homes, caravan and camping parks and so
on—are responsible for providing the bulk of
tourism services; about 8 per cent of small
businesses are engaged in tourism.
The number of overseas visitors to the UK
fell slightly by 1 per cent in 1999 to reach an
estimated 25.4 million, spending £12.5 billion.
The UK’s share of world tourism earnings
reached 4.5 per cent. The number of visitors
from Western Europe fell by 3 per cent to 16.1
million but there were increases of 1 per cent

in the number from North America, at 4.6
million, and 4 per cent in the number from
other areas, at 4.7 million. The highest
proportion from a single country was the
United States (15 per cent). Business travel
accounts for about £4.0 billion, 31 per cent of
all overseas tourism revenue. London’s
Heathrow and Gatwick airports, the seaport of
Dover and the Channel Tunnel are the main
points of entry.
Some 54 per cent of overseas tourists spend
all or most of their visit in London, while
others venture further afield to see the many
attractions in the English regions as well as to
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Domestic tourism generated approximately
£48.2 billion in 1999. Of British residents
opting to take their main holiday in the UK,
23 per cent choose a traditional seaside
destination, such as Blackpool (Lancashire),
Bournemouth (Dorset), Great Yarmouth
(Norfolk) and resorts in Devon and Cornwall.
Short holiday breaks (up to three nights),
valued at £3.5 billion in 1999, make up an
increasing part of the market.
The UK’s historic towns and cities and its
scenic rural and coastal areas continue to have
great appeal for British and overseas tourists
alike. There is a growing interest in heritage,
arts and culture; attractions include museums,
art galleries, historic buildings and monuments,
and theatres, as well as shopping, sports and
business facilities. Domestic and foreign
tourists play an increasingly important role in
supporting the UK’s national heritage and
creative arts, in addition to the large financial
contribution they make to hotels, restaurants,
cafes and bars, and public transport.
Business travel, which accounts for a
growing share of the tourism market, includes
attendance at conferences, exhibitions, trade
fairs and other business sites. Activity
holidays—based on walking, canoeing,
mountain climbing, or artistic activities, for
example-—are becoming more popular. The
Youth Hostel Association operates a
comprehensive network of hostels offering
young people and families a range of facilities,
including self-catering.
‘Leisure parks’ attract over 35 million
visitors a year. Alton Towers (Staffordshire)
was the biggest in terms of visitor numbers in
1999 (see Table 30.8). Attractions in these
parks include spectacular ‘white knuckle’ rides
and overhead cable cars and railways, while
some parks also feature domesticated and wild
animals. The Millennium Dome in
Greenwich, London, which opened in January
2000, attracted some 3.7 million visitors in its
first six months. The largest tourist attraction
with free admission is Blackpool Pleasure
Beach in Lancashire (see also Table 30.9).

responsibility for tourism in their respective
countries. The government-supported British
Tourist Authority (BTA)—which is receiving
an estimated £31 million in grant in
2000—01—boosts tourism spending in Britain
by focusing its marketing resources on 27 key
markets worldwide (which in total generate 89
per cent of all visitors to Britain) and
encourages the development of tourist
facilities in the UK to meet the needs of
overseas visitors. The tourist bodies for
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, which also receive government
finance, support domestic tourism and work
with the BTA to promote Britain overseas. In
1999 the English Tourism Council (ETC)
replaced the English Tourist Board. The ETC
is responsible for developing and promoting a
sustainable and competitive industry in
England, and in July 2000 additional funding
of £4.5 million over two years was announced.
The Government is working with the
tourism industry to raise standards of
accommodation and service, and to address
certain key issues facing the industry. These
include improving visitor attractions; boosting
business tourism; encouraging best practice
for the development of workforce skills; and
government-industry communication. The
Government is also considering how best to
support tourism growth which is
economically, socially and environmentally
sustainable. The BTA and the national tourist
boards inform and advise the Government on
issues of concern to the industry. They also
help businesses and other organisations to
plan by researching and publicising trends
affecting the industry. The national tourist
boards work closely with regional tourist
boards, on which local government and
business interests are represented. There are
about 560 local Tourist Information Centres
in England. The national tourist boards, in
conjunction with motoring organisations,
operate accommodation classification and
quality grading schemes.
EXHIBITION AND CONFERENCE
CENTRES
The UK is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences—along
with the United States and France. London
and Paris are the two most popular conference
cities. Other British towns and cities—
including several traditional seaside holiday
resorts diversifying to take advantage of the
growing business tourism market—have
conference and exhibition facilities.
Among the most modern purpose-built
centres are the National Exhibition and
International Conference Centres in
Birmingham; the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London; Cardiff International Arena; and the
Belfast Waterfront Hall. In Scotland,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen have
major exhibition and conference centres.
Brighton (East Sussex), Harrogate (North
Yorkshire), Bournemouth (Dorset),
Manchester, Nottingham and Torquay
(Devon) all have exhibition and conference
centres. Other important exhibition facilities
in London are at the Barbican, Earls Court,
Alexandra Palace and Wembley Arena. A new
exhibition and conference centre, Excel, will
open in London Docklands in autumn 2000.

30: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
RENTAL SERVICES
A varied range of rental services, many
franchised, are available throughout the UK.
These include hire of cars and other vehicles;
televisions, video recorders and camcorders;
household appliances such as washing
machines; tools and heavy decorating
equipment (such as ladders and floor Sanders);
and video films and computer games.
Retailing of many types of service is
dominated by chains, although independent
operators are still to be found in most fields.
In addition, there is a thriving sector renting
to businesses—all sorts of machinery and
other types of equipment, together with
computers and other office appliances. In
December 1999 there were 158,000 employee
jobs in the UK in the rental sector. Turnover
in 1999 amounted to j£16 billion, 12 per cent
higher than in 1998.
COMPUTING SERVICES
The computing services industry comprises
businesses engaged in software development;
systems integration; IT consultancy; IT
‘outsourcing’; processing services; and the
provision of complete computer systems. It also
includes companies that provide IT education
and training; independent maintenance;
support, contingency planning and
recruitment; and contract staff. In December
1999 there were 448,000 employee jobs in the
UK in computer and related activities.
Turnover of companies in this sector amounted
to £36 billion in 1999, 20 per cent higher than
in 1998. British firms and universities have
established strong reputations in software
R&D. A number of international IT
conglomerates have set up R&D operations in
the UK. US software company Computer
Associates is building a new £100 million
European headquarters at Datchet, near
Heathrow Airport, and Microsoft has made a
major R&D investment at Cambridge.
Academic expertise is especially evident in such
areas as artificial intelligence, neural networks,
formal programming for safety critical systems,
and parallel programming systems.
Software firms have developed strengths in
sector-specific applications, including systems
for retailing, banking, finance and accounting,
the medical and dental industries, and the
travel and entertainment industries. Specialist
‘niche’ markets in which UK software
producers are active include artificial
intelligence, scientific and engineering
software (especially computer-aided design),
mathematical software, geographical
information systems, and data visualisation
packages. Some firms specialise in devising
multimedia software. Distance learning,
‘virtual reality’ and computer animation all
benefit from a large pool of creative talent.
One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry. The provision
of almost all new telecommunications services,
including switching and transmission, is
dependent on software.
OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
In December 1999 a total of 188,000 employee
jobs in Great Britain were in market research,
business and management consultancy
activities.
Market Research
The UK’s market research profession has
grown strongly in the last five years and there
are now over 800 companies, with a total UK
revenue of over £1 billion a year. UK-owned
market research companies include the largest
international customised market research
specialists.
Management Consultancy
The UK’s 37,000 management consultants
supply techncal assistance and advice to
business and government clients. The 36
members of the Management Consultancies
Association account for more than half of
management consultancy work carried out in
the UK. In 1999 member firms earned £2.5
billion in the UK and £6 billion abroad.

often use advertising created in the UK for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
Advertising turnover in the UK increased by
14 per cent to £18 billion in 1999. The press
accounted for 52 per cent of the total,
television for 28 per cent, direct mail for 12
per cent, and posters, transport, commercial
radio and cinema for the rest. The largest
advertising expenditure is on food, household
durables, cosmetics, office equipment, motor
vehicles and financial services. The top ten
spenders in 1999 are shown in Table 30.10.
British television advertising receives many
international awards.
Campaigns are planned by around 1,100
advertising agencies. In addition to their
creative, production and media-buying roles,
some agencies offer integrated marketing
services, including consumer research and
public relations. Many agencies have
sponsorship departments, which arrange for
businesses to sponsor products and events,
including artistic, sporting and charitable
events. Government advertising campaigns—
on crime prevention, health promotion, armed
services recruitment and so on—are often
organised by the Central Office of
Information, an executive agency of the
Government.
The UK’s public relations industry has
developed rapidly, and there are now many
small specialist firms as well as some quite
large ones. About 11 per cent of the earnings
of UK public relations firms represents
overseas work.
Business Support Services
One of the major growth areas in the services
sector is in support services, reflecting the trend
among more and more firms to ‘outsource’ non¬
core operations. Initially, operating areas that
were outsourced or contracted out were in
cleaning, security and catering. However, firms
are now outsourcing other activities, such as IT
and personnel support services. A study for the
DTI in 1996 found that the annual turnover of
business support services in the UK was around
£10 billion, and the sector employed 675,000
people.

The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom
Britain 2001: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom
offers readers an authoritative and in-depth guide to all
aspects of Britain today. Written in a clear and
straightforward style, the Yearbook provides a description of
current policy in every area of the nation's life and gives the
latest available statistics wherever possible. Subjects range
from the economy, trade, industry, energy, science and public
finance to the media, culture, justice, health, and
environmental protection.
This new edition covers recent developments in science and
technology, including the rapid spread of the Internet and the
growth in mobile communications. Several key chapters also
describe the responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament, the
National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland
Assembly in the light of devolution.
Britain 2001 carries many tables, charts, maps and diagrams,
as well as over 1 SO colour photographs to help paint the most
complete picture of the shape of modern-day Britain. For
more than SO years this comprehensive Yearbook has been an
essential addition to bookshelves in schools and universities,
libraries and homes, and for businesses and researchers across
the world, keeping readers up to date with the ever-changing
structure and organisation of the United Kingdom.
