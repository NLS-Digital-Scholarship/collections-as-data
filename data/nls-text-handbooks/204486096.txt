INTRODUCTION
Britain: an official handbook, 1968, is the nineteenth in the series
prepared and extensively revised each year by the Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information with the co-operation of other government
departments and of many national organisations.
The handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided
by the British Information Services in many countries, was at first only
available overseas in a limited free edition. In 1954 it was placed on sale
throughout the world and it has since become widely known as an established
work of reference.
This 1968 edition, which covers events up to September 1967, gives, like
its predecessors, a factual account of the administration and the national
economy of the United Kingdom. It describes the activities of many of the
national institutions, both official and unofficial, and shows the part played
by the Government in the life of the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to the
United Kingdom as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and also other government publications and standard
works of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end
of the handbook. Readers are asked to note that the Central Office of
Information reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and
marked with an asterisk are available free of charge only at British Information
Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United Kingdom
from the Reference Division, Central Office of Information, on payment of
a small charge.

1 The Land and the
People
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with
a total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great
Britain proper (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are the important groups
of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative counties or parts
of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border) has a
total area (including inland water) of 50,332 square miles and is divided into
39 geographical or 46 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth¬
shire), with a total area of 8,016 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland,
including its 186 inhabited islands, has a total area of 30,412 square miles
and is divided into 33 counties; and Northern Ireland, consisting of six
counties, has a total area of 5,452 square miles. Together, these counties
constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with
a total area of 94,212 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom
(excluding inland water) is 93,025 square miles: England 50,056; Wales and
Monmouthshire, 7,967; Scotland, 29,796; and Northern Ireland, 5,206.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The position is further complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth
is sometimes included with England. United Kingdom statistics and other
data sometimes include the Isle of Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel
Islands, 75 square miles, which strictly are not part of the United Kingdom
but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern Ireland became indepen¬
dent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old Observatory of Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost
point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. It is just under 600 miles
in a straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and
rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays
and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
2
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Geology and
Topography
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less
than 50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf.
To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly
from 600 feet to 3,000 feet. These shallow waters are important because they
provide excellent fishing grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish.
The North Atlantic Current, the drift of warm water which reaches the
islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf and its ameliorating
effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal movement is also
increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, Lowland Britain and Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
above sea level. The boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth
of the Tyne in the north-east of England to the mouth of the Exe in the
south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This high ground, however,
is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains. Geologically
the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks (archaean
and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly more
recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal
measures which have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion.
The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted
were found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high
land. Most of the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice
Age, and at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north
of a line joining the river Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by
ice caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground
and swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern England and Wales
any loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that, when the
ice eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels—
lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous
drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up,
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon,
3,560 feet; and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland), 3,210 feet.
The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet.

leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland
are irregularly placed around central lowlands; in the higher parts the
moorland vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances,
particularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in
South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner
Hebrides. Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some
parts the soft, white limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white
cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the
south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern
coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the
most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments. These have occasionally been
breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was caused by the
abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries
of the short British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the
prevailing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is
controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which,
moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near
the British Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few
extremes of temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the
eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may
bring a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may
persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores
high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards
north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as
south-westerly ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent
in the spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction
may differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography.
Winds are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British
Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the
east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at
Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 22 m.p.h. in January to about
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only 210 and
200 miles long respectively.

14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about
7 m.p.h. in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the
north-west coast, with over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east
Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year
inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from 8°C. (47°F.) in the
Hebrides to ii°C. (52°F.) in the extreme south-west of England; it is
slightly lower in the eastern part of Britain in the same latitude. The mean
monthly temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges
from 4°C. (39°F.) during the winter (December, January and February) to
i2°C. (54°F.) during the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding
figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme south, are 6°C. (43°F.)
and I7°C. (63°F.). The average range of temperature between winter and
summer varies from 7°C. to i2°C. (i50-23°F.), being greatest inland in the
eastern part of the country. During a normal summer, the temperature
occasionally rises above 27°C. (8o°F.) in the south, but temperatures of
32°C. (90°F.) and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum temperatures
depend to a large extent on local conditions, but — 7°C. (20°F.) may
occur on a still, clear winter’s night, — i2°C. (io°F.) is rare, and — i8°C.
(o°F.) or below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe winter
periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches, while
England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual
rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the
mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain than the plains
of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits
of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the average year, whereas some places in
the south-east of England record less than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are the
driest months and October to January the wettest, the former period of four
months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of the latter. A period of as
long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to
limited areas. In successive years, however, remarkably contrasting weather
conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general decrease
from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the
mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five and a half hours in western
Scotland to seven and a half hours in the extreme south-east of England;
during the months of shortest daylight—November, December and January—
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a day in some parts
of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District (Derbyshire) and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter.1 Until about 1956 dense fogs containing smoke and other pollution
from the burning of coal used to occur from time to time in London and
other centres of population. Since then, as a result of changes in fuel usage
and the operation of clean air legislation, fogs have become less severe.
1 The number of mornings with less than i,ioo yards visibility ranges from less than 5
a year in areas of lowest incidence to about 55 in areas of the highest.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Soil and

Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils,
with the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands
of Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valley lands and the plains where soils are deeper and
richer; villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any
habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the
whole of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area
except where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under
cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and
similar areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open
moorland. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively
diminished and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry
Commission in the past 40 years, woodlands now occupy only about 7 per cent
of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the
north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in
Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be well
wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most
common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which about a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied
semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences
and, specially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents
a pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and
the even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely
dry up, grassland is green throughout the year and full of wild flowers from
spring to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some
flowers may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish High¬
lands and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are
found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow
deer (which are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks
and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen;
there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers
and streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of
the coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include
mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey
6

more numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits, coypu (fairly recently
imported), weasels and stoats.
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About
230 species are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The
chaffinch and the blackbird are probably the most numerous and are widely
and evenly distributed, but sparrows usually predominate near houses, and
huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain seasons, sometimes congregate
in London and other large towns. These and some other species of small
birds have been on the increase for several decades owing to their success in
adapting themselves to a man-made environment, while small birds in
general have benefited by more considerate treatment from the public. The
number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to decline, except for
game birds which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and partridges,
and the red grouse which is found in moorland areas.
Many species of gulls and other sea-birds nest round the coast and gulls
often fly far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage
and reclamation of marshlands have diminished the natural habitat of ducks,
geese and other aquatic birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs,
gravel pits and sewage farms in addition to the nature reserves and bird
sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only
one species of newt and the common viviparous lizard are indigenous; the
other species of reptiles and amphibians that are now firmly established came
to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace,
grayling and pike.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly
(3 to 4 inches) and the stag beetle (zi inches). The insect fauna in Britain is
less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a number of common
European species. With modern methods of pest control, extensive insect
damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases commonly spread
by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain but there is some anxiety among
naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing the
populations of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from
the people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long
succession of invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of
Europe were the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian
Vikings who, after settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French,
and assimilating the French language and customs, crossed to England and
conquered it in 1066.

Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the
present English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over
most of England and the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon
came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales,
Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of
population or of the extent or direction of population movement until the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end
of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about two million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary
estimate put the population of England and Wales at 5! million and that of
Scotland at about one million. The main factor in this gradual growth of
population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science,
by high death rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal
mortality. Immigration from the continent of Europe has been an influence
at certain times and immigration from other Commonwealth countries more
recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the
British people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births,
deaths, marriages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively
plentiful and reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular
flow of vital statistics (that is, statistical information based on statutory
registration of births, marriages and deaths) and the periodic census of
population which gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are about 500 super¬
intendent registrars in charge of registration districts and about 1,200 registrars
in charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars are
appointed by the county, county borough and London borough councils
but they act under the instruction of the Registrar General for England and
Wales, who is in charge of a central government department, the General
Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of births, deaths
and marriages, with planning and carrying out population censuses, and
with the compilation and analysis of population and vital statistics. There
are corresponding authorities1 and similar arrangements in Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every
ten years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
second world war. The latest full census covering the whole of the British
Isles was taken in 1961 by the appropriate authorities in England and Wales,
Scotland, Northern Ireland, the islands of the British seas and the Irish
Republic. As well as total population figures and local reports, tables have
been published on birthplace and nationality, age and marital condition,
fertility, household composition, housing tenure and household arrangements,
usual residence, migration, workplace, education, occupation and industry,
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London;
the General Register Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry
of Finance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of Jersey, of
Guernsey and its associated islands, and of the Isle of Man.

and also reports on the incidence of Welsh speaking in Wales and Monmouth¬
shire and on scientific and technological qualifications.
Because the traditional ten-year interval is now too long to wait for the
firm figures needed by Government and business for decision making, which
only a census can give, censuses were taken throughout Great Britain (on a
sample basis) and Northern Ireland in 1966. Data obtained from these
censuses are being prepared.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this
chapter is based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births,
marriages and deaths, though some use has been made of other special
investigations, including the Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.1
The enumerated population2 of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken on
23rd April 1961, was 52,708,934, excluding persons in the Isle of Man and
the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the United Kingdom.
The population had increased by nearly million since 1951, by about
6| million since 1931, by about 8| million since 1921 and by about 45^ million
—or about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates
into the beginning of the twentieth century. The estimated population of the
United Kingdom at 30th June 1966 was 54,744,100.
The population density of the United Kingdom as a whole is one of the
highest in the world: it was approximately 582 persons per square mile at
mid-1966; but in England and Wales there were approximately 824 persons
per square mile.
On the basis of present trends in birth and death rates and migration, the
population of the United Kingdom is expected to continue growing to the
end of the century, reaching 56,606,000 in 1970, 61,223,000 in 1980,
66,767,000 in 1990, and 74,574,000 in the year 2000.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was about 35 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century,
but natural population increase changed little. It rose from 12 per thousand
in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand in 1901.

EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH Years
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. At each successive census
the population of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the
preceding census, while the short expectation of life further reduced the ratio
of older to younger persons. When, therefore, death rates in all age groups
fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and 1910,
the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain the
population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual increase
in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth
century rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though
its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school children, school children, and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
48 years at birth for a boy born in 1900 to 1910 and 52 years for a girl, to
about 68 years at birth for a boy born in 1963 to 1965 and 74 for a girl. Since
1933 the steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the second
world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post-war peak
of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It then receded again to slightly
above the pre-war level in the early 1950s, rose (from 1955 onward) to 18-8
in 1964, but dropped back to 18-3 in 1965; it fell again to 17-9 per thousand
population in 1966. The proportion of illegitimate births, which reached a
peak of 9-1 per cent of all live births in 1945, the last year of the second world
war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached 4-5 per cent; since then it
has been rising again gradually and was about 7-6 per cent in 1966.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain
on mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and
mortality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. Infant mortality (that is, deaths of infants under one
10
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sex Ratio
Fertility Trends
Marriage
year old per thousand live births) has fallen by about 85 per cent since 1900.
Maternal mortality is now only about one-eighteenth of the 1934 rate. The
reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age,
such as cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen during the
twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in
diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive
health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women
preponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
Formerly, indeed, women outnumbered men in the United Kingdom in
every age group from adolescence onwards. Recently, however, the fall in
stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the influence of these factors on
sex ratio so that the age at which women begin to outnumber men has
advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand, the lengthening of the
expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for women than for
men, has increased the preponderance of women among the elderly—there
are now some nine women over 70 years old to every five men—and made it
a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population. This increase
in the number of elderly women, however, does not quite counterbalance
the increase in the number of boys and young men so that the ratio of females
to males has fallen from 108 : 100 in 1951 to 106 : 100 in 1966.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(that is, the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced
on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the 1860s, and continued until, for couples
married in the decade 1934-43, the average family size for Great Britain fell
to below 2-i. It rose again for those married in 1944 to 2-13. Later data
suggest some increase though the present position is not wholly clear, in view
of the latest trends in the birth rate.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women
getting married and of children surviving to adult life.
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the population of Great Britain who
are married has risen from 43 to 50 per cent, while the proportion of single
persons in the population over 15 years of age has fallen from 36 per cent
to 24 per cent. This change has been due mainly to an increase in marriage
rates among men and women in their late teens and early twenties; whereas
in 1931 only 25 per cent of the young women aged 20 to 24 were married,
in 1966 57 per cent of them were. Earlier marriage has led to a large increase in
the number of children born to women under 30 years of age and in recent

years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of the total flow of births
into the population.
There was approximately one decree of divorce made absolute in 1964 for
every nine marriages in England and Wales; a substantial proportion of
divorced people marry again. Divorce is highest for girls marrying in their
teens; the ratio being twice as high as for women aged 20 to 24 at marriage.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate beginning in the latter part of the
nineteenth century was to reduce the ratio of children and old people to
adults of working age. This ratio was at a minimum in 1930. After 1936 the
number of children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in
the birth rate after 1921, but the population aged over 64, born during an era
of high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising
numbers, increased very rapidly; the population aged over 40 was also
increasing relatively faster than that between 15 and 40. The higher birth
rates after 1942 arrested the compensating fall in the number of children and
further reduced the proportion of people of conventional working age.
This high proportion of the young and the old in the present population,
which is expected to increase still further (see diagram below), constitutes a
challenge to the nation to make the best use of its manpower resources, both
in the organisation of its economic structure and for the staffing and financing

of the social services most concerned with children and old people. In 1961
about 95 per cent of men and 42 per cent of women between 15 and 64 in
Great Britain were economically active in remunerative work (this includes
those temporarily out of work through illness or unemployment) the great
majority of them working for an employer. In addition some 25 per cent of
men and 6 per cent of women aged 65 or more were still economically active.
At the other end of the scale, some 23 per cent of boys between 15 and 19 and
23 per cent of girls were continuing their education. The scope for recruiting
more men and women into the paid working force is therefore limited, and
emphasis is likely to be placed increasingly on technological improvements
and wider training to raise the productivity of the working force.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance
of migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over
20 million people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the
Commonwealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and
large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians,
entered the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from the
present area of the United Kingdom amounted to some four million between
1871 and 1931. Since then the balance of migration for Britain as a whole
has been inward, though Scotland and Northern Ireland have throughout
continued to have a net outward movement of population to countries
overseas as well as to England and Wales. The main net inflow to Britain
since 1931 occurred in two periods. The first was in the years 1931 to 1940
when emigration was very low, many former emigrants returned, there was
considerable net immigration from the Irish Republic, and extensive
immigration from Europe, including about a quarter of a million refugees
seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, in the years from 1958 onwards,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth
countries, particularly West Indian countries, India and Pakistan. In the three
years 1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about
three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth (nearly half from the
West Indies). It was in these circumstances that the Government introduced
the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which gave it power to restrict
the number of people from the Commonwealth and, in principle, the Irish
Republic who may immigrate into the United Kingdom without assured
prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support, and to deport
unsuitable immigrants (that is, those convicted of offences and recommended
for deportation by a court of law). Net Commonwealth immigration under
the Act in 1966 was 51,300.
At the 1961 census some 2-1 million residents in England and Wales were
reported definitely to have been born outside the United Kingdom—rather
under one-third of them in other Commonwealth countries, about the same
number in the 26 counties now forming the Irish Republic, and the rest in
foreign countries, notably Germany, Poland, the United States and Russia.
The total number born outside the United Kingdom had increased by about
40 per cent since 1951, largely because of the inflow from Commonwealth
countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa. Residents in England or
Wales born in these countries had increased from over 170,000 to about
530,000. In Scotland, under 115,000 residents had been born outside the
United Kingdom (about a third of whom were born in the Irish Republic). In
Northern Ireland the number of residents born outside the United Kingdom
is relatively small.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Nationality
Distribution of
Population
It has been estimated that there are currently just over a million Common¬
wealth immigrants in Britain, many of them living in the congested parts of
industrial cities such as London, Birmingham and Bradford. They are making
an important contribution to the economy and public services by relieving
shortages of labour that would otherwise be critical; but the arrival of large
numbers during a relatively short period, and their concentration in certain
areas of full employment, has led to a suddenly increased demand for housing
where it is already scarce and caused additional pressure on the social services.
The central Government, local authorities and a variety of social agencies are
seeking in different ways to help immigrants and other citizens through this
period of adjustment and to deal with special social problems as they become
evident (see pp. 130 and 433).
British emigrants from Britain to Commonwealth countries in 1966 num¬
bered about 161,000; approximately 60,000 emigrated to foreign countries.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, with insignificant exceptions,
persons who are born, or whose fathers were born, in the United Kingdom
or in a territory which was a colony of the United Kingdom on 1st January
1949, or at the date of birth if later, or in a United Kingdom registered ship
or aircraft, are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent (subject to certain requirements) from a
paternal grandfather born in the United Kingdom or Colonies or from a
more remote paternal ancestor in the male line; by registration, for citizens
of Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor
children and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies; in consequence of an adoption order; and by naturalisation. The
requirements for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation include five years’
residence in the United Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service,
good character, a sufficient knowledge of English and the intention to reside
in the United Kingdom or a colony or to remain in Crown service; just over
23,000 such persons acquired citizenship in 1965.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country; nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and
Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien. Indeed, a citizen cannot
be deprived of his citizenship against his will except in very exceptional
circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation or registration
as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is, however, at
liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the nationality
or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens. Until the passing
of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, they were free to enter and
remain in the United Kingdom without restrictions of any kind. Similar
treatment has been extended to citizens of the Irish Republic who, in the
United Kingdom, are not aliens.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that
of all other parts of the United Kingdom combined. The distribution of the
population by country, as enumerated by population censuses back to 1901
(or, in some cases, nearest possible estimate), is shown in Table 1. The
populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were in every
case greater in 1961 than in 1951 and in 1951 than in 1931, but in the ten

years preceding 1931 the population of Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland had declined. The higher rate of increase in England is partly due to
migration from the other three countries. The estimated populations of
England, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to increase but that of Scotland
has fallen since 1964.
Geography, history and increasing urbanisation have given rise to the
differences between these countries and to an uneven distribution of the

of the eight standard administrative regions of England, as well as those of
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland with forecasts for 1981. Table 3 shows
the populations of the major conurbations and larger cities in Britain (the
majority of which are in England), and the map on p. 18 shows their location.
Approximately half the British population lives within the area of an ellipse
drawn across England enclosing south Lancashire and west Yorkshire at one
end, and the London area at the other, having the industrialised Midlands
at its heart. Other areas with large populations are the central lowlands of
Scotland; 1,000 square miles in the north-east of England from north of the
river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and
the English Channel coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely
populated areas are the eastern fringes of England south of the Wash, and the
far south-west. Most of the mountainous parts of Britain, including much of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the central Pennine Chain in
northern England, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
increasing. Though few places in the United Kingdom have had any
decrease of population in the past decade, there have been local differences
in the rate of increase. Many places in the Midlands and south-east England,
some south-coast areas and some of the most prosperous parts of northern
England, Wales and Scotland have had increases well above the average
national rate, while many of the older industrial towns and remote country
areas in northern England, Wales and Scotland and some coastal resorts have
had relatively small increases. The differences result from the combined
effect of natural increase in almost all areas and net migration towards the
expanding employment opportunities of the Midlands and south and towards
certain retirement areas, mainly on the south coast.

" The boundaries of some of the administrative areas have been altered from time to
time. The population figures given for cities relate in general to the areas as these were
defined in the year noted at the head of each column. The figures for conurbations,
however, relate in general to approximately the same areas throughout. See also c.
i Area at the date of the 1966 census of population.
'The Greater London population for 1951 relates to the former Greater London
conurbation; later figures relate to the area (616-4 square miles) of the Greater London
Council.
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses
of open country within the urban area. Table 4 shows the distribution of the
people of Britain between areas classified as urban for administrative purposes
and those classified as rural.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the
century three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the
large conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During
the twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres
have continued to spread and merge. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the
population has lived in the seven great conurbations whose centres are the
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
17
cities of London, Manchester (South-East Lancashire), Birmingham and
Wolverhampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and
Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon
Tyne (see Table 3, and map on p. 18).
A development which has been accelerating in recent years is the long-
established tendency for the number of people who actually have their homes
in the inner parts of an area (especially the town or city centre itself) to
decrease, and be balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes, where development commonly extends
without a break beyond the administrative boundaries and includes areas
which are administratively rural. For this reason the statistics of conurbations,
comprising continuously built-up, economically and socially interdependent
areas, are more illuminating than those for urban administrative areas.
In some cases even the conurbation, as defined for statistical purposes,
does not cover the whole of developments on the outskirts. This applies
most strikingly to London. A broad belt of almost continuous population
increase now completely encircles Greater London, includes and passes beyond
all existing London new towns and extends along every major rail and road
route from London. This belt contains both commuters, who have moved
their homes but continue to travel to work in inner London, and people who
have changed both home and workplace from inner London to new or
expanded towns. Other areas in which outward movement and fringe develop¬
ment have been noticeably large are the outer areas of the West Midlands and
Merseyside conurbations and areas on the edges of Bristol, Derby, Leicester,
Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield.
These two trends, the movement out of town centres and growth at the
periphery of built-up areas, help to explain why Table 3 shows decreases
in the population of the urban administrative areas of many cities and even
in the population of some of the officially defined conurbations.

Factors in the further dispersal of the last 15 years have been the spread of
car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work, private
property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers
of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the West Midlands
and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to the great cities.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 26 per cent of the population at the time of the
1961 census. In Scotland, in 1961, nearly 81,000 persons, mainly in Ross and
Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll, and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic,1
while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke the Irish form of Gaelic.
The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living
languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is used in addition to English
for certain official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now
used for almost all official proceedings.
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the
foregoing summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful,
however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British
households and social habits in Britain in order to provide a background to
the information given in later chapters on such matters as town and country
planning, housing, and transport.
The great majority of people enumerated in the 1961 census in Great Britain
(nearly 97 per cent) were living in private households2 3 (usually in families or
on their own). Less than one per cent of the population were in hotels or
boarding houses, about 1-5 per cent in hospitals or homes for the elderly or
disabled, and the remainder not in private households included people in the
Armed Services, in educational institutions and in various places of detention.
Of the 16J million private households in Great Britain in 1961, 13,475,000
were estimated on the basis of the 1961 census to be of the simplest type,
comprising married couples, single people or lone parents with their children,
if any (and resident domestic servants, if any). More specifically, the 13,475,000
households comprised 7,863,000 married couples or lone parents with
children, of whatever age, 3,655,000 married couples without children, and
1,957,ooo people living alone. Altogether some 9,362,000 households were
estimated in the 1961 census to be without children under 15 or in full-time
education and another 3,154,000 contained only one child.
The number of households (which has increased by 84 per cent since 1911)
and their small average size reflect a number of factors, including lower
birth rates, increased survival into old age, the higher proportion of married
people in the population and the general assumption that married couples
and old people in good health prefer and are entitled to have their own separate

homes. They are not to be taken as meaning there has been a general
weakening of family feeling, though family ties may link fewer people than
in former times. The volume of travel just before 25th December, the bulk of
which consists of people going to spend Christmas with their relatives, achieves
news value every year; only those involved know the hidden devotion in
thousands of homes where infirm old relatives or handicapped children are
cared for by their families. None the less, the small size of families, coupled
with a considerable dispersal about the country by movement for the sake of
study, work or housing, do make the role of neighbours and friends with
kindred interests of great importance.
The i6| million households enumerated in the 1961 census in Great Britain
were accommodated in 16 million dwellings, about million of which were
owner occupied, 4 million rented from a local authority or New Town
Corporation and 4 million privately rented. Less than 3 dwellings in 100 in
England and Wales were shared by more than one household in 1961. In
Scotland only 2-6 per cent of households shared a dwelling. Over 96 per cent
of all households in Great Britain had exclusive use of a piped supply of cold
water and 76-5 per cent one of hot water, 73-5 per cent in England and Wales a
fixed bath (about 71 per cent in Scotland) and about 87 per cent in England
and Wales a water-closet (over 82-5 per cent in Scotland). The proportions
were higher in urban areas. A survey made in 1964 found that about one
household in five then had a telephone.
Most women, and many men living alone, do their own catering and house¬
work. Probably less than five per cent of households employ any regular
paid help and almost certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant.
Relatively few households (estimated to be less than one in 600), and those
mainly ones with small children, have a foreign girl living with them au pair
to give some help in the home while improving her English. Approximately
one household in 40 gets help through the local authority home help service
at some time in the course of a year because of the presence of an invalid,
an old person or a maternity case. Nowadays wives can normally expect some
help with household tasks from their husbands.
Much of the drudgery has been reduced by changes in habits and equipment,
for example the relative popularity of easily cleaned plastic surfaces in place
of wood, tiles and metal in need of polishing; the availability of ‘convenience
foods’,1 non-iron fabrics and babies’ disposable napkins; and the spread of
labour-saving devices. More than three households in four now have a
vacuum cleaner, two in five a refrigerator, over half a washing machine,
nearly all an electric iron, one in four an electric hair drier, two in five an
electric blanket and one in six an electric toast-maker. About one in five
has completely eliminated the traditional coal fire in the principal living-
room. Women who go out to work (about half the women of working age are
in employment) benefit particularly from the flexible opening hours of many
launderettes and from the spread of automatic machines selling milk, groceries,
stockings and other supplies at any time of the day or night.
Compared with previous generations most people have considerably more
time at their own disposal, higher real incomes, and more chance of
developing their potentialities.

advanced stage by the manufacturer and which may be used as labour-saving alter¬

21
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 40 to 42 hours a week.
Actual hours worked by men average somewhat longer because of voluntary
overtime working; actual hours worked by women and girls average a little
less. Few employees are entitled to less than two weeks’ paid holiday a year
in addition to public holidays and most have more. Probably more than half
enjoy a five-day week, which is widespread in manufacturing industry.
A further extension of five-day week working in distributive trades offering
six days a week service is in progress. Housewives are probably, despite
current aids in the home, the section of the community with least leisure
and fewest extended periods of free time—even compared with those older
school-children entered for examinations who spend hours nightly on
homework.
At the other end of the scale, people who have ceased work or are
approaching retirement are showing considerable interest in courses offering
guidance on the constructive use of their increased leisure time.
Average earnings have risen more than prices in the last decade. Women’s
earnings have risen somewhat faster than men’s. The average earnings of
women in industry are approximately half the average earnings of men. In
many occupations the principle of equal pay for equal work is applied. The
real incomes of manual workers, especially unskilled workers and young
people under 18 years, have risen both in absolute terms and in relation to
the incomes of non-manual workers. The groups who are weakest economically
are retired people wholly or mainly dependent upon pensions, households in
which the father is absent or dead, and the families of low-wage earners with
a number of dependent children.
Opportunities for education and training have widened; these are
increasingly the keys to advancement. Of every 1,000 men in England and
Wales between the ages of 20 and 30 in 1961, 318 had continued at school
beyond 15 and 81 had continued their full-time education to the age of 20 or
beyond. By comparison, among those aged 65 or more, only 108 in 1,000 were
at school beyond 15 and only 28 continued their full-time education to the
age of 20 or beyond. Four-fifths of all university undergraduates in Great
Britain in 1961-62 were ‘first generation’ students, neither of whose parents
had had a university education (one-fifth of the total had fathers who were
manual workers). None the less, children from culturally articulate homes in
which they benefit from parental experience do have relatively more success
than others in achieving qualifications at every stage of the educational
system. However, distinctions based on occupation have become much less
clear-cut. Differences between the way of life of manual and other workers
are less pronounced, while many manual workers’ families have acquired
habits which were formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’. There is less disparity
than there used to be in the range of possessions to be found in the home.
Modern production and marketing methods, coupled with the declining
proportion of ‘dirty’ jobs, have contributed to far greater homogeneity of
dress and appearance; style in clothes, for example, being more divided by
age-group than by income-group or occupation.
The general level of nutrition is high, and still rising. In Great Britain in
1964 the average diet of households of all classes was nutritionally more than
adequate.1 Average weekly food consumption per head included over 5 pints
of milk and cream, over 3 ounces of cheese, over 36 ounces of meat, poultry

and bacon, over 20 ounces of sugar and preserves, over 138 ounces of fruit
and vegetables, 40 ounces of bread and 6 ounces of butter. Tea remained
the principal beverage but the consumption of coffee, one-sixth that of
tea, was nearly four times what it was 30 years ago. There are other pointers
to a modification in the traditional conservatism of British diet in the increased
consumption of wine, the spread of foreign restaurants in all parts of the
country, and successful sales of the more exotic fruits and vegetables outside
traditionally cosmopolitan areas.
There is quite a variation in diet between different parts of Britain.
Scotland maintains its traditional penchant for cakes, and the consumption
of materials for making pies and puddings is above the national average in
the Midlands and the north of England. More coffee is drunk in the south of
England, which also consumes proportionately more fresh fruit and vegetables.
The consumption of mutton and pork decreases proportionately from south
to north and the consumption of beef increases.
Food consumption accounts for about 26 per cent of all consumers’
expenditure on goods and services in Britain; tobacco1 and beer, wine and
other alcoholic beverages for about 6 per cent; and clothing and footwear for
about 9 per cent. Features of recent years have been the growing range of
‘leisure’ clothes and a greater adventurousness in men’s wear; fur hats for
men have become widely acceptable in the last few winters.
Something of a counterweight to the greatly increased strength of the
production and distribution sides of a modern economy is the growth of
activity to help the consumer; this has received government support.
Which?, the magazine of the Consumers’ Association, which publishes
appraisals of selected consumer goods, has nearly 440,000 subscribers and an
estimated readership of three million. Over three-quarters of a million people
a year make a personal visit to the Design Centre in London to see its display
of well-designed British consumer goods in current production. State services
do not escape the scrutiny of voluntary groups such as the Association for the
Improvement of Maternity Services and the Association for the Advancement
of State Education.
A considerable proportion of people’s free time and money is spent in and
on their own homes. On a weekday evening roughly seven in eight of the
adult population are at home. More demanding standards of home comfort
are evidenced by the sharp increase in the installation of central heating
apparatus and by the popularity of wall-to-wall carpeting. About four out of
five families do most of their own decorating, which may often constitute
the hardest physical effort undertaken by sedentary workers. The sales of
hand-tools and of small power-tools and powered garden implements testify
to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery and to the interest
and initiative that maintain Britain’s homes and gardens. In spite of the high
proportion of the population living in urban areas, at least half the families
in Britain have some garden, and the standard of both town and country
gardens is high. Over 3,000 local horticultural societies are affiliated to the
National Allotment and Gardens Society and there are a large number of
unaffiliated societies; altogether there are probably some 20 million spare¬
time gardeners. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held in town and
country are very popular and there is a large attendance at the most important
of them, including the annual Chelsea Flower Show.

Other home pursuits include reading, listening to the radio or record player
or tape recorder, watching television, entertaining friends,1 looking after
pets,2 and pursuing hobbies. Probably the most popular hobby in terms of
money spent is photography, which has shown a striking increase over recent
years. An estimated million people regularly express their competitive
instincts by entering promotional competitions of the type in which purchasers
of a particular product may attempt a puzzle and compose a slogan in the hope
of winning a car, a house, or a ‘dream holiday’.
Over 80 per cent of families (and a somewhat higher proportion of the large
families in Britain) have a television set. The growing impact of television was
probably most noticeable in the second half of the 1950s; the number of
viewing licences was doubled and by 1961 totalled over n£ million. Since
then the number has grown more slowly, and by July 1967 was 14^ million.
Although it is generally acknowledged that the popularity of television has
resulted in far-reaching social changes, clear-cut indications of the nature of
such changes are lacking. Mass entertainments have suffered, especially
where the quality and amenities provided are not considered adequate. The
lives of those housebound by disability or the care of small children have
been much enriched. Viewers in general have been stimulated to an awareness
of events and happenings which was once confined to fairly narrow groups.
Television has become an important influence in the way in which the various
political parties make their appeal to the electorate. There is no evidence
that television has brought any decline in those hobbies, recreations and
spare-time interests which people in Britain pursue so enthusiastically; in
fact for many of them it may well have provided a stimulus.
The enormous diversity of special interests, from angling to yachting, is
illustrated by the variety of magazines and periodicals, ranging from papers
dealing with sports to journals of opinion on social, political, scientific and
economic affairs (all of which command circulations in the tens of thousands),
and including ‘fan’ magazines about current ‘pop’ music favourites, do-it-
yourself and gardening weeklies (each commanding circulations of over a
hundred thousand), and illustrated instructional periodicals which build up
into encyclopaedias of art, science or general knowledge. The traditional
women’s weeklies, with their special blend of light fiction and meticulous
advice about family health and modern baby care as well as fashion and
beauty, still hold the loyalty of millions. Nearly one-third of the total popula¬
tion are registered members of public libraries; and an increasingly wide
range of titles, including works of scholarship, are bought in the comparatively
cheap paper-backed form which constitutes about a third of total book
production.
Increasing prosperity and leisure and the influence of television have affected
interest in playing or watching outdoor and indoor sports. The tendency is
for spectators to be attracted in large numbers only to the more important
events. This trend has been especially in evidence in association football,
which is by far the most popular spectator sport, and cricket. Higher standards
of comfort and amenity are being sought by the public and failure to provide
these may be reflected in falling attendances. But almost any sporting body
1 Indications of the rise in the scale and standard of home entertaining are provided by
the increasing sales of table wines (double those of the 1930s) and of expensive foods,
and by the standard of recipes in the numerous newspaper and periodical features
devoted to cookery.

riding, angling, bowling, rugby and association football are some examples—
and steadily rising sales of sports goods and membership of sports clubs
indicate the keenness with which open air leisure activities are pursued.
A feature is the enthusiasm with which new forms of sport and recreation,
some made more familiar through television or foreign travel, are adopted.
Ski-ing and sailing are examples of activities which, once confined to a small
number, now count their enthusiasts in hundreds of thousands. A surge of
interest in ten-pin bowling after i960 seems to have stabilised; the number
of rinks now stands at about 130. Ice-skating on indoor rinks is increasing in
popularity and attracts about a million skaters a year.
Much of the gambling with small stakes, which is practised at least occasionally
by three adults out of four, is on the results of sporting events. The total
money staked by the public on organised betting and gambling (private
wagers and games of chance cannot be counted) is unofficially estimated at
£915 million a year. About two-thirds of the money staked is on horse¬
racing. Betting on football matches, both at fixed odds and through the
football pools, is widespread, but usually for smaller stakes. Bingo is widely
played in converted cinemas and in club rooms and village halls, although
total expenditure is not large. There has in recent years been a considerable
growth in the establishment of commercial gaming clubs; the Government is
considering introducing regulatory legislation.
Cinema attendances (5-6 million a week in 1966) continue to decline, but
the cinema remains the most popular form of indoor entertainment outside
the home, particularly for young men and women and older children.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller. There are probably only some
200 theatres offering professional performances compared with rather less
than 2,000 cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiastic and growing
public not only for plays but for ballet, opera and concerts. Special art
exhibitions attract many people; the attendance at the Arts Council Picasso
Exhibition in i960 remains a record (close on half a million).
Dancing is popular, especially with those under 35 years of age; it is
thought that about six million people go dancing every week. There are
estimated to be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance halls, including public
dance halls and halls operated by the major dance schools, which are open
at least three times a week, and about 4,000 other schools of ballroom dancing.
Public dances are also often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and
societies which abound in Britain hold dances from time to time in their own
or hired premises. In addition, Scottish and English traditional dances have
their own following.
Nearly 52 million ‘singles’ and ‘extended play’ gramophone records were
pressed in Britain in 1966. It is on the weekly sales of these records (almost
entirely to young people) that the ‘pop music’ popularity placings, known as
the ‘Top Ten’ and ‘Top Twenty’, are calculated. Personal appearances by
leading ‘pop’ performers draw huge attendances both inside and outside the
theatre or studio.
A number of people from all age-groups and occupations find their main
free-time interest in some form of sustained group activity connected, for
example, with the churches, trade unions, politics, social welfare and reform,
with study or other self-improvement or with cultural pursuits.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some
particular purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and

international organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisa¬
tions of national importance in social life and in the promotion of social
gatherings include, in addition to those connected with religious denomina¬
tions, the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds
and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,780 clubs, with about 2^
million members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working Men’s
Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recreational,
though they also arrange lectures and classes. In recent years they have given
much attention to improving their premises and to arranging events of
sufficient attraction to compete with the comforts of members’ homes and
the standard of entertainment obtainable on television. Over 2,600 Towns¬
women’s Guilds, with a total membership of some quarter million, are
affiliated to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are
educational as well as social in purpose and they co-operate in many public
welfare activities. The declared objective of the National Federation of
Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; the institutes make
an important contribution to rural life by providing meeting places for
countrywomen and by organising social gatherings. In villages throughout
England and Wales there are over 8,900 institutes with nearly half a million
members; in Scotland and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural
Institutes with similar aims and interests.
About 31 million people in Britain take an annual holiday. Although the
seaside is still by far the most popular for holidays, the trend appears to be
towards visiting several resorts for short periods rather than staying in one.
Camping and caravanning have also increased greatly. Both tendencies are
closely allied to the growth of personal transport (see below). Many people
take more than one holiday during the year. The number going abroad has
risen sharply and in 1966 totalled about 5 million—more than half as many
again as a few years earlier. The popularity of holidays abroad may be
attributable to several factors besides rising incomes: the attraction of a
warmer climate, which makes Spain and Italy the most sought-after destina¬
tions for British tourists; the many charter and other airline services available;
and the readiness of the travel trade to provide relatively inexpensive inclusive
holidays. In this connection, the learning of foreign languages is popular
among adults, aided by radio and television programmes as well as by
attendance at adult classes. (Foreign languages are, of course, taught to
children in schools.) Wider experience of foreign travel probably contributes
to the increased adventurousness in diet and dress already noticed and to
international design in furnishings and decor now available in many British
shops.
Ownership of motor vehicles is now widespread. In the summer of 1966 there
were about 9-5 million cars licensed on the roads in Great Britain (compared
with 3-9 million ten years before). The number of motor cycles (including
motor scooters) was about 1-4 million (an increase of only about o-i million
over 1956).
The spread of car ownership, making many people more independent of
public transport, is not only affecting the whole pattern of leisure activities
but also leading to a new and more scattered distribution of houses, changing
the siting requirements of factories, shops and offices, and making large-scale
urban reconstruction and road development urgent. At the same time, by
reducing the economic returns on public transport, resulting in reduced
services, it is in danger of impoverishing the amenity of those who for reasons
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
'The Changing
iace of Britain
of age, health, income or personal preference do not possess their own
transport. A grim by-product of th$ increasing volume of road traffic is the
toll of road accidents which, though not increasing so rapidly, was just under
8,000 people killed and 384,000 injured in 1966.
Increasing population and social developments are affecting the physical
appearance of Britain. Towns and cities are being altered to accommodate
more traffic and house more people; experiments are being tried in remodelling
town centres with pedestrian precincts; new blocks of flats and office blocks
pierce familiar skylines. Town and country mingle as new estates for
migrating townsfolk encircle the little-changed hearts of old villages. New
roads and motorways to carry the traffic on leisure and business, reservoirs
to supply the growing demand for water, lines to carry electric power for
the growing volume of appliances, and sites for the disposal of unwanted
articles—from tin cans to old cars—all have to be accommodated.
In a modern industrial society in a densely populated country it is not
always possible to reconcile the conflict between the community’s needs and
existing natural beauty or historic interest. Nor can the planning machinery
which exists to contain disturbance and to preserve and foster the creation of
beauty, natural or man-made, achieve this unless enough people care. The
activities of amenity societies (such as the Civic Trust, the Council for the
Preservation of Rural England and its Scottish counterpart, and the Council
for Nature) and the wider public opinion which supports them suggest that
a growing volume of people in Britain do care.
2 Government
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions
are to be found in the history of each of its four component parts: England,
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon
king in the ninth century; Wales became part of that kingdom and Ireland
was joined with it under the same king before the end of the thirteenth
century; and the English and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in
the person of James I and VI in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for the Union of
England and Scotland provided that the two countries ‘should be forever
united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the Parliament of Great
Britain) became the supreme authority in both countries. In 1801 the Act
for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland 1800, which joined the Irish
Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain, established the United
Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland (now the Irish
Republic) became a completely independent country, outside the United
Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had enacted a
constitution for Northern Ireland which perpetuated Northern Ireland
representation in the United Kingdom Parliament as the supreme authority
and, at the same time, provided that country with its own legislature and
executive, to deal with domestic affairs.
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but methods of
government are flexible and, to some extent, adapted to the needs of the
constituent countries. England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland
on the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law,
a different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local
government, national churches on a different footing, and, for most domestic
matters, different government departments. In Scotland these departments
have headquarters in Edinburgh and are grouped under the Secretary of
State for Scotland, who is a member of the Cabinet.
There is also a measure of devolution in the administration of Welsh affairs
to the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State for Wales, who is a Cabinet
Minister, assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Under¬
secretary. In Northern Ireland the law is derived from and similar to the
law of England but the judiciary is separate; the Northern Ireland government
departments are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies, not part of the
United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and systems of local
administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same time, they have
a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of their proximity
to the mainland and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown. They
are treated as part of the mainland for certain purposes, such as wireless and
postal communication, and are ‘territories for whose international relations
Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’.
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the
good government of the British dependencies which are administered by
territorial governments and are at various stages of development towards full
self-government. The United Kingdom is also one of the independent member
28
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nations of the Commonwealth,1 which all acknowledge the Queen as the
symbol of their free association and, as such, the head of the Commonwealth;
most of these independent countries owe allegiance to the Crown.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which are not part of the law of the land since violation of them would not
lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable
to the machinery of government. The rules of the constitution have never
been codified; principles and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the
constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at any time by the passing
of an Act of Parliament, or by the general acceptance of a new convention,
without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the constitution are readily distinguishable
although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other ministers of
the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national
policy; (b) government departments, most of them under the control
of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for
administration at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer
and manage many services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards,
which are severally responsible for the operation of particular nation¬
alised industries or public services, and which are subject to ministerial
control in varying degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages describe these three organs of government in some
detail in order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II
is a descendant of the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the
year 829, and of Malcolm II, whose reign in Scotland (1005-34) was corre¬
spondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
1 The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon,
Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad and
Tobago, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia, The Gambia, Singapore, Guyana,
Botswana, Lesotho and Barbados.

Succession
Accession
Coronation
Acts of
Government
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom, the Queen being
represented by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of
royal functions in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is
represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown the Queen’s representative
is the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Crown on the advice of the
ministers of the country concerned and is wholly independent of the United
Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is
usually represented by Governors who are appointed by the Crown, have
varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible to the United
Kingdom Government for the good government of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement 1701, which
provided that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most
excellent Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’.
Subsequent Succession to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration;
and although succession is not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot
now be altered (under a provision of the Statute of Westminster, 1931)
except by common consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth
which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which
provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the
Throne according to their seniority or, if there are no sons, the daughters
in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-
Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and effectively
as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king takes the
rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not apply and the
constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the husband
of the Queen-Regnant.
I here is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London,
and the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the
Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval
which may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the
same in substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have
frequently been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of
the time. The service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was
derived from that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in
1 The Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England.
GOVERNMENT
31
England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief
of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established
Church of England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process
during which the absolute power of the monarchy has been progressively
reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United
Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the
Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts
of government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may
be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and
she must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in
both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the
fountain of justice’ and as such, can remit all or part of the penalties imposed
on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’, the Queen confers
peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes appoint¬
ment to all important State offices, including those of judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in the
established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the
realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the
State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory,
to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive2 which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise
of this authority is shown in three constitutional ways in which the royal
will can be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice
of the Privy Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally
by the Queen and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible
ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents
under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal
Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
smooth working of government; for although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and
other holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet
decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few (the Order of Merit, the Order of Companions of Honour, the Royal Victorian
Order, the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient
Order of the Thistle) are in the Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter;
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the admin¬
istration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, for example, markets, ferries and
fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and the right of printing or licensing others to
print the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
32
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of 18 years on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act 1953—
laid down that the first potential Regent should be The Prince Philip, Duke
of Edinburgh, and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age.
In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision
is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State (generally speaking, the
wife or husband of the Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent
certain royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance,
dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign),
nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the
Royal Visits British Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered
outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages
are the same today as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the
birth of royal children and royal funerals are marked by ancient ceremonial,
although to a lesser degree than in former days. The birthday of the Sovereign
is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse
Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State banquets
take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom;
investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal processions grace such
social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and add
significance to the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from
Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial,
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. They also pay State visits to foreign governments and undertake
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate: they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they do different work in different places and
they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
coronation, or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law¬
making organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot
legislate without the concurrence of all its parts (except in the case of Bills
passed under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949).
1 The Regency Act 1953 provided that Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.
GOVERNMENT
33
The Meeting of
Parliament
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the
United Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, or
any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of them.
It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these
islands and in Northern Ireland it is not the only legislature, for the Northern
Ireland Parliament has power to legislate for Northern Ireland on most
domestic subjects (see p. 43), and the ancient legislatures of the two Channel
Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and of the
Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless,
the Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical
limits there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act 19 n the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it is usually dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament
cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not
be sovereign or supreme), each assembly has a period of time of up to five
years during which it may legislate exactly as it chooses. During its life, it
can make or unmake any law; destroy by statute the most firmly established
convention or turn a convention into binding law; and legalise past illegalities
thus reversing the decisions of the courts. It even has power to prolong its
own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years without
consulting the electorate although such power is used only in circumstances
of national emergency, such as times of war.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice
Parliament does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Its members bear
in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain throughout the
centuries and they act as far as possible in accordance with precedent and
tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that has
been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper authority
cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely to pass an
Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of party
government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its responsibility
to the electorate in mind.
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for election and announces the date on
which the new Parliament is to meet. This cannot be less than 20 days after
the proclamation, but it may be more.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parlia¬
ment. Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, but since
1867 both Houses stand adjourned only until their members have taken the
oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign, which they do immediately after the
Accession Council has made the order for proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or
dissolution is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a com¬
mission under the Great Seal (see p. 31), which appoints the day and place
of its meeting in a new session. The date so appointed may be brought
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each
legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The effect of a prorogation
is at once to terminate all business (with certain minor exceptions) until
Parliament is summoned again. A Bill not completed in one session must
be reintroduced in the next, unless it is to be abandoned.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to
such date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business.
A reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by
virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about
160, divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting 30-40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of 40-50
sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one
from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40 sitting days. Nowadays,
the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of up to 10 sitting
days in October, after the long summer adjournment. The House of Lords
sits, on average, for about no days in each session.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life
peers and peeresses created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958,
and (3) Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to assist the House in the performance of its
judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement
from office. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the
Church of England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops.
Peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to
a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age or over,
but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession,
disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Those who disclaim their
peerages lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they are able to vote
at parliamentary elections and are eligible for election to the House of
Commons.
Not all holders of temporal peerages with a right to sit in the House of
Lords attend the sittings of that House. Those who do not wish to attend may
apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of a particular Parliament
or for a single session.
Members in constant attendance at the House of Lords include elder
statesmen and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive
no salary for their parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling
expenses from their homes to the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend
at least one-third of the number of sittings), and (with the exception of the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and any member in
receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment
for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for
judicial sittings) within a maximum of four and a half guineas (£4 14s. 6d.) a
day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits
on the woolsack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by
commission under the Great Seal, appoints several members of the House
GOVERNMENT

to act as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first
of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed
each session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the House other¬
wise directs. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments,
who is charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and
who pronounces the words of the Royal Assent to Bills; the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, who enforces the orders of the House; and the
Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections
of the community. There are at present 630 seats in the House of
Commons (511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern
Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons receive a salary (£3,250 a year) for
their parliamentary work and hold their seats during the life of a Parliament.
They are elected either at a general election, after a Parliament has been
dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election, held
when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death of a member, or
of his acceptance of office under the Crown,1 or as a result of his elevation to
the House of Lords.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the Deputy Chairman, both of whom may act as
Deputy Speaker; these officers are elected by the House on the nomination
of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other than
in their official capacity (see p. 38).
Permanent officers of the House, that is, those who are not members of
Parliament, include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is
charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing
orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker in the House.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
undertake general reviews of constituencies throughout that part of the
United Kingdom for which they are responsible at intervals of not less than
ten and not more than 15 years and report on the changes they recommend.
A Commission is also empowered to submit interim reports on particular
constituencies if, for instance, it is necesssary to bring constituency boundaries
into line with altered local government boundaries.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act 1949. Under the provisions of this Act,
election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in which
British subjects (except members of the House of Lords) and citizens of
the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (voting is not compulsory), provided
that they are 21 years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity
to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are recorded

of profit under the Crown.

on the register1 of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency
on a date fixed by statute. Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person
at a polling station, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of
the United Kingdom employed overseas, and wives of such persons, if resident
overseas with their husbands, may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain
cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for
such reasons as physical incapacity or the nature of his work.
Anyone, male or female, who is a British subject aged 21 or over, and is
not otherwise disqualified may stand as a candidate in any constituency at a
parliamentary election. Those who are disqualified include members of the
House of Lords, clergy of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged
bankrupts, and those expressly disqualified by the House of Commons
Disqualification Act 1957, for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil servants,
and members of the regular armed forces and the police forces.
The conduct of elections, including the manner in which candidates can
be nominated for election, is governed by the 1949 Act, which also prescribes
a maximum for the election expenses which candidates may incur. This is
^450, plus i |d for each elector in a borough constituency and 2d for each
elector in a county constituency. The prescribed scale is not required to cover
the candidate’s personal expenses, for instance, the cost of his living at an
hotel during the election campaign although any such expenses beyond £100
must be paid by his election agent.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties.
These privileges apply collectively to each House and individually to each
member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil
proceedings for a period from 40 days before to 40 days after a session of
Parliament; freedom of speech in debate; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges
include the right of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is
able, for example, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right to pronounce
upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of its
privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest;
freedom of speech in debate; freedom of access to the Sovereign for each
peer individually; and the right to commit for contempt. These privileges
are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House of Commons; they
exist independently without grant.
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the
constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a

published yearly by the registration officers, who in England and Wales are the clerks of
local councils and in Scotland are the land valuation assessors.

general election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for
election; any other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then
indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign,
usually on the advice of senior ministers; and its most outstanding members
in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial
appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority
party becomes the official Opposition with its own leader (who receives a
salary of £4,500 in addition to his parliamentary salary) and its own council
of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties
or any Independents who have been elected may support the Government
or the Opposition according to their party’s or their own view of the policy
being debated at any given time.
In the general election held in March 1966, 75-8 per cent of the electorate
voted, compared with 77 per cent in October 1964. The number and per¬
centage of votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 5.

The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the
general elections of 1964 and 1966 is shown in Table 6.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must
govern and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the
minority should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to
be heard. The detailed arrangements of government business are settled,
under the direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House (who
may be the Prime Minister or some other minister), by the Government
Chief Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief
Whips together organise the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of
Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for debating
some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of the House
is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is his duty
to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters about
which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips (the Chief

Whips and their assistants, chosen within the party or by the Prime Minister
for the Government party), whose duties include maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons is the
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government Whips,
five hold titular posts as Junior Lords of the Treasury, three are officers of the
Royal Household and five are paid Assistant Whips. The Chief Opposition
Whip also receives a salary. There are also Government and Opposition Whips
in the House of Lords. The former, who hold offices in the Royal Household,
sometimes act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.

“ When a candidate at the polls the Speaker remains aloof from party issues, standing
as ‘the Speaker seeking re-election’. In the past it was customary to allow the Speaker
an unopposed election in his constituency but this is by no means settled practice and
since the end of the second world war the Speaker has, almost always, been opposed.
The main functions of Parliament are (i) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the
funds necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts
and issues before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted
before the ratification of certain international treaties and agreements (in
spite of the fact that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised
on the advice of the Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary
approval).
Both Houses of Parliament have their own standing orders, but procedure
is based on custom and precedent (much of which dates back to the beginning
of the sixteenth century and even earlier) rather than on written orders,
which merely supplement the practice in each House. The system of debate
is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every matter is determined
upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and resolved in the affirmative
or negative, as the case may be; members speak from wherever they have been
sitting and not from a rostrum; and members do not read their speeches.
The main difference is that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
far greater measure of control.
In the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the
general sense of the House. In the Commons, on the contrary, the Speaker
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and
orders of the House. He must carefully guard against abuse of procedure
or any infringement of minority rights, and it is his duty to allow or disallow
any closure motion (that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may
GOVERNMENT
Legislation
39
be put to the vote). He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition
in debate, and to save the time of the House in various other respects. In
cases of grave disorder, he has power to adjourn the House or suspend the
sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast, the Speaker must give the casting vote; he does this (if
possible) in such a way as to avoid change and leave the question to be decided
on another occasion. The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is
similar to that in the House of Commons, but the Speaker or chairman has
no casting vote. With the exception of questions relating to Bills and delegated
legislation, the House of Lords is governed by the principle that unless there
is a majority in favour, the question is decided in the negative. When the
House is sitting judicially (see pp. 84 and 87) the question is put in such a
way that, if the votes were equal, there would be no interference with the
order under appeal.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare
occasions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Pro¬
ceedings) and the speeches (The Official Report of Parliamentary Debates,
Hansard) are published daily.
Legislation can be initiated from either side of either House; but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far
unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it.
This has the effect of giving the Government exclusive rights over a wide
field of legislation, and as a result most Public Bills are presented by the
Government. Certain days are, however, set aside for debating Private
Members’ Bills1; that is, Public Bills introduced by members of the House
not holding office in the Government, who have been successful in the ballot,
held early in each session, of members wishing to introduce Bills. Peers can
introduce Public Bills in the House of Lords at any time during a session
without notice. In addition, persons and bodies outside Parliament can promote
Private Bills relating solely to matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless they deal with finance or
representation when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule,
however, Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons
before the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are
frequently introduced and debated in the Lords before being sent to the
Commons.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
is given a Second Reading after the result of a debate on its general merits or
principles. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to the
Second Reading Committee to recommend whether or not it should be taken
as read a second time. After a Second Reading in the Commons a Bill is
referred for detailed examination either to a standing committee or, if the
House so decides, to the whole House sitting in committee; in the Lords it is
referred to a committee of the whole House. When the committee stage is
1 A private member may also present a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek
leave to introduce a Bill under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, that is, the Standing Order which
allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before
the House decides whether or not to grant leave.
4°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Committees
finished, the Bill is reported to the House, and a further stage takes place during
which the committee’s amendments may be altered and additional amend¬
ments may be suggested and incorporated. Finally, it is submitted for a
Third Reading and, if passed, is sent on from the Commons to the Lords or
from the Lords to the Commons (depending on its place of origin), where it
enters on the same course again. Any amendments which the second House
makes to the Bill must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise
reached, before the Bill becomes law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment all financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing
taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the
Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund.1 As a general rule, these Bills
are introduced upon resolutions in a committee of the whole House of
Commons and they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent for Royal Assent, which may be given by the Sovereign in person or,
periodically, by Royal Commission but is usually declared to both Houses
by their Speakers on receipt of a certificate that Letters Patent have been
issued to that effect. The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been
exercised since the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be
revived. The Lords, on the other hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a
Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal
course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it
unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for
the consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to
the amendments made. The Lords cannot require the Commons to agree to
amendments; nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in
respect of Money Bills; and, since the passing of the Parliament Act 1949,
any other Public Bill which has been passed by the House of Commons in
two successive sessions may be presented for Royal Assent without the consent
of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed between the date of the Second
Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on which it is finally passed
in that House. These limitations on the powers of the Lords are based on
the belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a non-elected
assembly, lies in bringing the wide experience of its members into the legis¬
lative process, not in thwarting the elected House. In other words, proceedings
in the House of Lords give time for further reflection, and often elicit new
points of view.
In substance, a Private Bill goes through the same procedure as a Public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where the promoters must
prove the need for the powers or privileges that they seek and where any
objections raised by opposing interests may be heard.
Either House can resolve itself into a committee, known as a Committee of
the Whole House. It does so to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause,
1 It is provided in the Parliament Act 1911 that all Money Bills sent to the House of
Lords one month before the end of the session shall receive the Royal Assent notwith¬
standing, if they are not passed by the Lords without amendment within the month.

after their second reading. A Committee of the Whole House is presided over
by a chairman instead of the Speaker.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of
which exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and
complex work. They are:
1. Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons
as necessary, for the consideration of the second readings and committee
stages of Public Bills and, in the case of the Scottish and Welsh Grand
Committees, other business referred to them. With the exception of the
Scottish Standing and Grand Committees1 (which consider Scottish
estimates and other matters relating exclusively to Scotland), and the
Welsh Grand Committee2 (for which parallel arrangements exist),
standing committees consist of from 20 to 50 members nominated for
each Bill by the Committee of Selection (a body normally consisting of
11 members drawn from the main parties in the House at the beginning
of each session)—the parties being represented in proportion to their
numbers in the House. The procedure of a standing committee is
generally similar to that of a committee of the whole House.
2. Select Committees, which are appointed to inquire into and report to
the House on special matters. Select Committees may be appointed
by either House when the occasion for such an appointment occurs,
or they may be appointed at the beginning of a session to consider all
aspects of a particular subject that may arise during the session. The
latter type of committee is known as a ‘sessional’ committee and includes
the Committee of Privileges, the Estimates and Public Accounts
Committees, the Committees on Nationalised Industries, Statutory
Instruments, Procedure, Public Petitions, the House of Commons
(Services) Committee and two ‘specialist’ committees: the Committee
on Agriculture and the Committee on Science and Technology. There
are also the Selection Committee (see above) and the Standing Orders
Committee, which have duties relating to Private Bills, and joint select
committees of both Houses of Parliament which may be appointed at
the instance of either House.
In addition there are the parliamentary party organisations: the Parliamen¬
tary Labour Party, which is a corporate body comprising all members of the
party in both Houses; and the Conservative and Unionist Members Com¬
mittee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, which consists of the back¬
bench membership of the party.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to ministers
of the Crown, to government departments for which ministers are responsible,
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of 30 members nominated from Scottish
constituencies with up to 20 other nominated members; in its plenary form, as the
Scottish Grand Committee, it comprises all the members for the Scottish constituencies
and not less than ten nor more than 15 others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to 25 other nominated members selected in order to make the
balance of parties in the committee approximate to that in the whole House.
42

or to organisations whose legislation is subject to confirmation or approval by
ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for it. Moreover the
Act which delegates legislative power generally defines its precise limits and,
in the more important cases, gives Parliament the right to confirm or annul the
statutory instruments1 (rules and orders) by which delegated legislation is
enacted. Certain Acts also require direct consultation, before such legislation
is made, with organisations which will be affected by delegated legislation.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation
by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments (see p. 41). The Special
Orders Committee of the House of Lords examines and reports on all
Statutory Instruments requiring affirmative resolution.
Parliamentary Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
Control ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’; but Parliament has not used this power in this way for many
years. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of government
policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back-benchers
are, however, provided in parliamentary procedure. Such opportunities
include:
1. Question Time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in
rotation, answer questions put to them on matters for which they are
responsible. So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public
business that questions are regarded as the best means of eliciting
hitherto unpublished information about the Government’s intentions,
as well as an effective way of airing, and possibly securing some redress
of, grievances brought to the notice of members by their constituents.
(The other means available to members is by way of Parliamentary
Commissioner—see p. 43.)
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the
House to initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public
business; on a day when public business ends before the scheduled
time the time saved may be used for adjournment debates; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
Whitsun and the Summer) there is a whole day spent discussing topics
raised by private members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a
definite matter of ‘urgent public importance’ he may, at the end of
Question Time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House; if the
Speaker accepts the motion as being within the terms of the Standing
Order and if, the matter being referred to the House, 40 or more members
rise to support the motion, the matter is debated later the same day.
3. The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee
of Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements
of the Government and has become an occasion for the examination,
initiated by the Opposition, of some aspect of the Government’s
administrative policy, the cost of which has been included in the
Estimates.

The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of
Commons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments
for the public service are described in Chapter 14, Finance.
The Parliamentary Commissioner is an officer of the House of Commons,
independent of the Executive. His function is to investigate complaints of
maladministration brought to his notice by members of Parliament on behalf
of their constituents. His powers of investigation extend to any action by a
Government department in the exercise of its administrative function, but not
to policy decisions (which are the concern of the Government), nor to matters
affecting relations with other countries or the activities of British officials
outside the United Kingdom.
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and, generally speaking, reports his findings
to the member of Parliament who presented the case. A Select Committee has
been appointed to which the Commissioner submits his annual report and
any other report raising important general principles.
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and
a House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by
a Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her
Majesty’s name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord
Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry) and 24 senators who hold
office for an eight-year term, 12 being elected by the House of Commons
every four years under a system of proportional representation; while the
House of Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of parlia¬
mentary franchise similar to that which operates in Great Britain. The House
continues in existence for a period of five years unless it is dissolved earlier.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters
except those especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom,
which include the Crown or succession to the Crown; foreign relations;
defence; the postal services; the Supreme Court; customs and excise; income
and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights and measures; trade marks;
submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and lighthouses,
buoys and beacons. Under the constitutional practices which have developed
since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 the United Kingdom
Parliament does not legislate on matters within the powers of the Northern
Ireland Parliament unless the Government of Northern Ireland requests that
this should be done. But, because certain matters have been reserved to the
United Kingdom Parliament, provision was made in the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland
constituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; in
accordance with this provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
44
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Procedure and
Functions
Committees of
the Privy
Council

Committee
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. The present-day Privy Council is the body on whose advice
and through which the Sovereign exercises his or her statutory and a number
of prerogative powers. It also has its own statutory duties, independent of the
power of the Sovereign in Council.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy
Council (which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have
reached eminence in some branch of public affairs in any country of the
Commonwealth. There are usually about 300 Privy Counsellors.
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is presided
over by the Sovereign or, when the Sovereign is abroad or ill, by Counsellors
of State. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but, as a rule, not fewer
than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called together
only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or
her intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for advising the Sovereign to approve
Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing fundamentally in
constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal prerogative, for
example, Orders approving the grant of Royal Charters of Incorporation; and
those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of delegated
legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy Council
attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby
become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based;
this rests with the minister whose department is responsible for the subject
matter of the Order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
Notice of certain Orders in Council must be published in the London Gazette,
an official periodical published by the authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of
Parliament.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be
prerogative, such as the committee which deals with legislative matters
submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; or
they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with
applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the
Council (see p. 46).
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of certain independent members of the Commonwealth and of the
British dependencies. Its jurisdiction derives from the right of the subjects of
the Crown in overseas territories to appeal for redress to the Sovereign in
Council if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
Some of these independent members of the Commonwealth who have con¬
tinued the appeal after achieving independence have retained it in its original

form; others have retained it in the form of an appeal to their own head of
State, acting on the advice of the Judicial Committee; and others again have
provided that the appeal should be to the Judicial Committee itself. Appeals
from the dependent territories remain as appeals to the Sovereign in Council.
The Committee sits in public and appeals are argued before it as before
any other court of law. A considered judgment is always delivered. Where
the appeal is to the Sovereign in Council, the final order disposing of it is an
Order in Council of Her Majesty made on a Report from the Committee.
Members of the Judicial Committee hold or have held certain high judicial
offices in the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth, and are Privy Counsel¬
lors. Appeals are admitted only by leave given by the court overseas according
to local law, or failing that, by the Judicial Committee itself.
The Judicial Committee also has a limited jurisdiction in certain matters
arising in the United Kingdom. It hears appeals by members of the medical,
dental and certain kindred professions against decisions of their respective
disciplinary bodies. Appeals from the courts of the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man also come to the Committee, as do appeals from prize courts,1 and
a few ecclesiastical appeals. In addition, the Sovereign may refer to the
Committee for hearing or consideration any other matter which he or she may
think fit.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time
being with the administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers
are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. There
are, however, always some ministers in the House of Lords, partly because
there is a statutory limit to the number of ministers who may sit and vote in
the Commons while receiving salaries from the Crown, and also because
every Government must be assured of spokesmen to expound and justify its
intentions and its actions to the House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor is
always a member of the House of Lords.
Ministerial salaries range from £14,000 for the Prime Minister and £8,500
for senior ministers to £3,750 for junior ministers. The Prime Minister and
ministers in the House of Commons also have a parliamentary salary of £1,250.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to
time, both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The
usual ministerial offices may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who has no department, but is technically First Lord
of the Treasury.
Departmental Ministers, whose responsibilities cover the full range of
Governmental concern. Holders of most of the more recently created posts
have the formal title ‘Minister’, but those who hold older posts have special
titles, for instance, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for
the Treasury and a number of sub-departments) and the President of the
Board of Trade. The holders of eight offices (some ancient and others of
recent creation) are known as ‘Secretaries of State’.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and Ministers
without Portfolio. Usually these ministers have few or no departmental duties
and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor has departmental functions; he is also in a special
position as a Minister of the Crown who is also head of the judiciary in
England and Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England
and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland,
the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State, who are additional ministers in government departments
where the work is particularly heavy and complex, or where it involves
frequent travelling abroad. There are now: four Ministers of State in the
Foreign Office; three at the Board of Trade and in the Department of Educa¬
tion and Science; two in the Commonwealth Office; and one each in the Home
Office, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Ministry of
Technology, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office. The Chief Secretary,
Treasury, and the two Ministers of Defence under the Secretary of State for
Defence (one for Administration and one for Equipment) also rank as Ministers
of State.
Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by assisting in their
departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the
Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips.
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the
holder of this office derives from his ability to command a majority in
Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the
Sovereign and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. Nowadays,
by convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise
a general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences
and approving important departmental decisions where reference to the
Cabinet is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in
the House of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions
on its general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown

on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord Lieutenants of counties1 and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower,
and some university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The
Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various
public boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. In addition, he makes
recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions. He selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers (usually about 20) who
are selected by the Prime Minister personally. Its origins can be traced back
to the informal conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers,
independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After
the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the eighteenth
century, and the development of organised political parties stimulated by
successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form (see p. 43).
The functions of the Cabinet are2: the final determination of the policy
to be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous
co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments.
The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet
is a group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the
support of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the
publication of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they
have been in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection
in the Public Record Office) and a resigning minister desiring to make a
statement involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the
permission of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister. From a practical
point of view, this secrecy is essential in the interests of unprejudiced discus¬
sion, which can only be maintained if there is no risk of publicity for every
statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time, if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet
meetings decisions are reached on major issues of government policy, and
on other issues which cannot be settled elsewhere. A great deal of the work
of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system, which ensures that
the amount of business coming before the full Cabinet is kept at manageable
proportions. The system involves the reference of any issue either to a
standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the
ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail and

Responsibility
either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations
for action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when
matters affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be
members of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance
of documents submitted, with a summary of arguments and conclusions, are
recorded; even these records have a strictly limited circulation. The Secretary
of the Cabinet is responsible for keeping the records.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the
individual responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their
departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to
act not as individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a
united group. It does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at
every Cabinet meeting; and the obligations of individual ministers may be
passive rather than active when the decision to be taken does not relate to
their spheres of administrative responsibility. At the same time, every
minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion beforehand, so
that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He may not
repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have
received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies that have not been
agreed with the other departments concerned (including the Treasury). A
minister must also be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues,
and where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy; if he feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of
his colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere he must resign unless the Cabinet
has agreed otherwise. A minister who does not resign in these circumstances
cannot later reject criticism on the ground that he did not personally agree
with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is
bound to offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members
do not hold identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admin¬
istration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually their Parliamentary Secretaries.
Departmental ministers are expected to take the final decision on all
matters relating to their spheres of administration, unless these are of such
political importance that Cabinet sanction is required. If any departmental
decision brings a minister under criticism in Parliament he may be upheld
by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of confidence in itself;
or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose office.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
GOVERNMENT
49
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation.
They may, and frequently do, work with and through local authorities,
statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations operating under
varying degrees of government control.
A change of Government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy
may be accompanied by organisational change. The widening scope of
government activity in the past half-century, however, has led to the formation
of many new departments. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, for instance, the Board of Customs and
Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments, for
instance the Ministry of Labour, cover Great Britain (England and Wales,
and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others, such as the Ministry of
Health, cover England and Wales only, and there are similar but separate
departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is also a separate
department with certain responsibilities for affairs in Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, Treasury ministers are responsible for a number of departments,
including Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information,
the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Department of the Government
Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works Loan
Board, and the National Savings Committee. The staff of departments are
all members of the Civil Service, a body of Crown servants recruited into the
service as a career.
Internal
Organisation
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
its duties there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments,
however, have certain features in common: for example, the minister of a
major department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent
secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those depart¬
ments where the minister is a Secretary of State), one or more deputy secre¬
taries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries.
Usually major departments also have a principal finance officer and a
principal establishments and organisation officer. A number of establishment
divisions have their own organisation and methods (‘O and M’) branch, the
members of which act in an advisory capacity. Many departments also have
their own legal advisers or solicitors, and their own information division.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Advisory Bodies Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect
information, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before

coming to a decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases
there is a statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee,
but usually advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister
concerned because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved. Some are expert committees; others
include civil servants and representatives of varying interests and professions,
for instance, industrialists, trade unionists, university and industrial scientists,
educationists, lawyers and local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recom¬
mendations on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal
Commissions, whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide
experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by Royal Warrant).
Royal Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government
departments and other interested organisations and individuals, and on this
evidence submit recommendations. The Government may accept the
recommendations in whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further
action or to delay action. Inquiries may also be undertaken by departmental
committees, appointed by the head of the appropriate department.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the
main government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order,
except for the Cabinet Office, the Department of Economic Affairs and the
Treasury (which, in view of their central position, are placed first) and the
Scottish and Northern Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end
of the section). Further information on their work is given in later sections
under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, a Secretariat of permanent officials, and an instrument of
great importance in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level, operates
under the direction of the Prime Minister. Its functions include circulating
the memoranda and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet com¬
mittee business, preparing the agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its
committees, recording their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping
in touch with the progress of action on decisions and safeguarding the security
of documents. The Cabinet Office also includes an historical section, which is
responsible for the preparation of Official Histories of the War.
Attached to the Cabinet Office, and an integral part of it, is the Central
Statistical Office, which is charged with the collection from departments of
statistics relating to the national economy, their analysis, and their prepara¬
tion as an agreed body of statistics to assist the Government in formulating
its economic and financial policy.
The Prime Minister directs the work of the Department of Economic
Affairs, which is headed by the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs,
assisted by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and two Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries. It works in close co-operation with the Treasury and
other departments.
The Department works mainly through the three inter-related groups
described below, but has certain additional functions. One group deals with
such domestic issues as prices and incomes, industrial policies, and the
promotion of industrial efficiency; it works closely with the Economic Develop-

ment Committees on industrial matters. The general planning group works
on growth policies, public expenditure, and the preparation of medium-term
assessments of the development of the economy, and of long-term and very
long-range forecasts. The regional planning group is responsible for regional
economic planning, including the regional aspects of industry, employment,
land use, and transport. It has staff in each of the English regions and a Central
Planning Unit to study projects for large-scale development. (See also
p. 248.)
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and by
the Financial Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
Functionally, the Treasury is divided into four groups: the pay group,
which deals with the pay and working conditions of the various classes of civil
servants and handles questions about the pay of staffs in other parts of the
public service; the management group, responsible for developing manage¬
ment services, whose activities include organisation and methods work,
inquiries into and comparisons of management practices over a wide field,
and work on recruitment, training, manning and grading in the Civil Service;
the finance group, which brings together all questions affecting home and
overseas finance; and a fourth group, concerned with balancing public
expenditure against national resources and organising the control of this
expenditure under such headings as defence, social services, and transport.
The Treasury has prime responsibility for short-term economic assessments
and works in close co-operation with the Department of Economic Affairs on
economic analysis and forecasting, and many other questions.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of
all Government Bills, except those Bills or provisions of Bills extending
exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Depart¬
ment. The Office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills; it advises
departments on questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings
(and committees) in both Houses. The Parliamentary Counsel also draft
subordinate legislation when specially instructed, and advise the Government
on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within their
special experience.
of The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering government policy for agriculture, horticulture
and fishing. The Ministry administers deficiency payments schemes and
various grants and subsidies designed to improve the efficiency of the
industries, and also gives free technical advice.
Schemes for the control and eradication of animal and plant diseases are
also administered by the Ministry, whose responsibilities extend to Scotland
in the operational control of certain diseases of animals.
In England and Wales the Ministry also deals with certain questions relating
to legislation about food, including labelling and advertising, slaughter¬
houses, and the quality and cleanliness of milk. Questions relating to the
supply and manufacture of food, its consumption, composition, preservation

and nutritional qualities, are dealt with by the Ministry for Great Britain
or the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in the agricultural and fishing activities of a number
of international organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food,
such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Commonwealth Office advises the Secretary of State for Commonwealth
Affairs on all aspects of Commonwealth relations. It communicates on his
behalf with other Commonwealth Governments and with the Commonwealth
Secretariat,1 keeps in touch with and advises other United Kingdom govern¬
ment departments on Commonwealth policy, provides information to the
British press and public about Commonwealth activities, and deals generally
with matters affecting members of the Commonwealth both as a group and
as individuals.
The Commonwealth Office co-operates closely with other departments,
particularly the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Overseas Development, in
discharging its responsibilities in those associated states and dependent
territories in the Commonwealth for which the United Kingdom still has
responsibilities. In the case of associated states, these responsibilities relate
mainly to defence and external affairs. Each of the dependent territories also
has its own administration, but the British Government is finally responsible
for their good government and for their relations with other countries.
Relations with Rhodesia and the Maidive Islands are also the responsibility
of the Commonwealth Secretary, as are relations with the Republic of Ireland
which, although not a Commonwealth country, is for most purposes not
treated as a foreign country.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties imposed from time to time in the
annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor
of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. The Board is also
responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of the revenue laws, including
smuggling and illicit distillation.
The Board undertakes a wide range of non-revenue agency work for other
departments, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions
on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods, exchange
currency control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade
statistics from customs import and export documents.
The government department responsible for the formulation of defence
policy and for the control and administration of the three fighting Services
is the Ministry of Defence. The Secretary of State for Defence is in charge
of the department and there are two Ministers of Defence—^Administration
and Equipment—who each have functional responsibilities for the whole of
the defence policy. The first is responsible for personnel and logistics, and the

wealth and financed from their contributions, was formed in July 1965. Its functions
include the dissemination of factual information, the promotion of Commonwealth links
by the assistance of official and unofficial agencies, and the co-ordination of preparation
for meetings of Commonwealth heads of Government and other ministers.

second for research, development and production and for procurement and
sales. There are also three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries with responsi¬
bilities for the respective Services.
The Meteorological Office provides the national weather service and
meteorological library. It is responsible for: forecasts required for aviation
and for sound and television forecasts; much of the weather information
published by the press; and forecasts provided on the Automatic Telephone
Weather Service. Weather centres have been opened in London, Glasgow,
Manchester and Southampton to deal with industrial, commercial and
popular demands.
The Meteorological Office is also responsible for seismological observations
and terrestrial magnetism. Research branches in the Office conduct their own,
and collaborate with other bodies in, research in these fields.
The Department of Education and Science is organised in branches concerned
with schools, further education (including vocational, recreational and adult
education and the youth service), teachers and kindred subjects in England
and Wales; and with the universities, civil science and support for the arts and
sport throughout Great Britain. There are also specialist branches, which
provide professional advice on health, building, planning (including educa¬
tional research and statistics), law, and information. The Secretary of State
for Education and Science is responsible for the whole work of the Department
and is assisted by three Ministers of State and one Parliamentary Under¬
secretary.
The Department’s responsibilities for the development of primary,
secondary and other education include dealing with the supply, training and
superannuation of teachers, the building of new schools and other institutions,
the school health service, the special educational treatment of handicapped
children, and the provision of school meals and milk. In these matters the
Department works in co-operation with local education authorities—the
Inner London Education Authority and the councils of counties, county
boroughs, and the outer London boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
adequate facilities for all forms of education in their areas. Its relations with
the universities are conducted through the University Grants Committee
(appointed by the Secretary of State to advise on State aid to universities).
Its activities in the field of civil science are discharged through five research
councils: the Medical and the Agricultural Research Councils, the Natural
Environment Research Council (which carries out and supports research in
earth sciences and ecology), the Social Science Research Council, and the
Science Research Council (which carries out scientific research and is
responsible for research grants and postgraduate training awards in those
fields which are not specifically the responsibility of the other councils, and
also supports research in engineering and technology in the universities).
The Secretary of State is advised by the Council for Scientific Policy, and
jointly by the Minister of Technology and the Committee on Manpower
Reserves for Science and Technology.
The Foreign Office, under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, acts
as a channel of communication between the British Government and the
Governments of foreign States for the discussion and negotiation of all matters
falling within the field of international relations, including the drawing up
of international treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by
which the British Government is represented in the United Nations and on

housing, the administration of the planning Acts concerning the use and
development of land, sewerage, and other services administered by local
authorities. It is responsible for sanctioning loans for most purposes for which
local authorities require to borrow money and for acting as the main link
between local authorities and the central Government.
As the central housing authority, the Minister supervises the administration
of the housing statutes and the national housing programme; and his officers
keep in close touch with the local housing authorities. Local authority
proposals for dealing with slum clearance are also submitted to him.
The planning work of the Ministry includes confirmation of the acquisition
and disposal of land by local authorities and the payment of grants in certain
cases of acquisition, clearing and compensation. The Minister also has
responsibility for the Land Commission, the National Parks Commission,
the Water Resources Board, and is concerned with historic buildings, the
designation of new towns and their development corporations, and with the
Commission for New Towns.
The Ordnance Survey is administered by the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government, although it is itself responsible for its day-to-day affairs. It is
in charge of the survey and mapping of Great Britain—the maps and plans
resulting from the survey ranging in scale from 1/1,250 to 1/1,250,000. The
survey also undertakes a considerable amount of agency work in compilation,
drawing and printing for other departments, particularly the Ministry of
Defence and the Land Registry.
The Central Office of Information is a common service department which
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by all other government departments. In the United Kingdom it
conducts government press, television and poster advertising, produces
booklets, leaflets, films, television material, exhibitions, photographs and other
visual material, and distributes departmental press notices. For the overseas
departments it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio
and television material, booklets, magazines, reference services, films,
exhibitions, photographs, display and reading-room material; and manages
schemes for promoting the overseas sale of British books, periodicals and
newspapers. It also organises tours for visitors officially invited to Britain
(other than those sponsored by the British Council, see p. 217), and is

responsible for exhibition stands on behalf of the Board of Trade at overseas
Trade Fairs and British Weeks. There are nine regional infornaation offices in
England, which provide services for the home departments and assist the
overseas services by the provision of material and in arranging tours for overseas
visitors. As a non-ministerial department, the Central Office of Information
is administratively responsible to Treasury ministers, but the ministers whose
departments it serves are responsible for the policy expressed in its work.
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax
and surtax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, estate duty and
certain other direct taxes, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any
matters connected with them. It is also responsible for the valuation of real
property for such purposes as compensation for compulsory purchase, local
rates in England and Wales, and estate duty; it collects tithe redemption
annuities; and it makes payments, under compensation schemes, for war
damage to land, buildings and chattels.
The Ministry of Labour co-operates with other government departments on
matters of general employment policy, including the distribution of industry,
the maintenance of a high and steady level of employment, and research into
medium- and long-term trends in the distribution of manpower between
industries and occupations.
One of the Ministry’s principal functions is to help employees to find the
work best suited to them and employers to obtain suitable employees; to this
end, it operates a national system of employment exchanges, which includes
a Professional and Executive Register at 39 of the larger exchanges and a
limited number of Occupational Guidance Centres for adults. It also
administers the Industrial Training Act; operates government schemes for
vocational training and industrial rehabilitation; is concerned with the central
administration of the Youth Employment Service, which is provided locally by
the Ministry of Labour or the local authority; and provides the Disablement
Resettlement Service which helps disabled persons to secure employment.
Other functions of the department include: the resettlement in civilian
employment of men released from the armed forces; the supervision, through
the Factory Inspectorate, of safety, health and welfare measures for workers
in industry and commerce; the collection and publication of labour statistics
of all kinds; the promotion of good industrial relations; the provision of
services for conciliation, arbitration and investigation in industrial disputes;
the administration of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965; and dealing with
questions arising from the administration of the Wages Councils Act 1959.
The Ministry is also the department mainly responsible for the administration
of the Selective Employment Repayments Act 1966.
Responsibility for the relations of the United Kingdom Government with
the International Labour Organisation rests with the Ministry, which also
deals with overseas questions about labour and employment and with the
employment of foreign workers in Great Britain.
Besides these principal functions, the Ministry undertakes agency work for
other government departments in connection with social security benefits,
repayment of income tax to unemployed persons, and the issue of passports.
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General) are responsible for the legal advice given to the
Government; in addition, they have a wide range of duties in relation to the
GOVERNMENT
57
courts. The Attorney General, who is the senior Law Officer, is the Crown’s
representative in the courts, and legal proceedings for the enforcement of
public rights and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted in his
name; he is assisted by the Solicitor General, who is the junior law officer.
The Attorney General’s consent is required to the institution of criminal
proceedings for certain offences, and the Director of Public Prosecutions is
subject to his superintendence. The Procurator General (Queen’s Proctor),
who has certain duties connected with the operation of the divorce laws, also
exercises his functions under the direction of the Attorney General. The
Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney General, with the
same rights and duties. The Law Officers, who are appointed from among the
leading members of the English Bar and are always members of the House of
Commons, are assisted by a small professional staff.
The Lord
Chancellor’s
Departments
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the Bench or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet rank.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian
of the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor is in charge of more than 20 different
offices and branches which are mainly concerned with legal practice and
procedure. He controls the personnel and machinery of the courts of law
through his patronage, through administrative powers conferred by the
Judicature Act 1925 and other Acts, and through his membership of the Rules
Committee of the Supreme Court and his responsibility for that of the county
courts; he appoints the justices of the peace and recommends to the Crown
other appointments to the judiciary in England and Wales; and he is the
minister responsible for the Judge Advocate General’s Department, which
advises the Secretary of State for Defence and the Defence Council on legal
matters arising out of the administration of military law, and which reviews
the proceedings of army and air force courts martial (see p. 93).
In addition, the Lord Chancellor is a leading member of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council; he appoints the members of the Law
Commission for England and Wales, the chairmen of certain administrative
tribunals in England and Wales, and (with the Secretary of State for
Scotland) the members of the Council on Tribunals; and he is responsible
for the administration of the Land Registry (which maintains a State register
of title to land), the Public Trustee Office (which may act as the executor
or administrator of the estate of a deceased person or as a trustee under a
will or settlement) and the Public Record Office (which preserves, and
provides access to, the national archives).
The Ministry of The Ministry of Overseas Development is responsible for carrying out the
Overseas Government’s policy for development overseas. It is responsible for the
Development development aid programme as a whole and its make-up between bilateral and
multilateral aid and between capital aid and technical assistance; the terms and
conditions of capital aid and the principles on which technical assistance is
granted; the size and nature of the aid programme for each country; the
management of capital aid and technical assistance; relations with international
aid organisations; the United Kingdom interest in United Nations programmes
of technical assistance; and liaison with voluntary bodies operating in the same
field. The Ministry also has direct responsibility for a number of research
and other organisations, the resources of which are available to the Ministry
in an advisory capacity and in connection with the provision of technical
assistance.
58
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In carrying out these duties the Ministry works in close co-operation with
the overseas departments (the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Office)
and other departments concerned. It is also responsible for the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, which provides capital for certain development
projects in Commonwealth countries. The aid aspects of the United Nations
Trade and Development Conference are the concern of the Ministry, as is
United Kingdom participation in UNESCO and FAO.
The Paymaster The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
General’s Office departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, and the Post Office, for all of which separate arrangements exist.
Money granted by Parliament is transferred (in such sums as may be required
from day to day) from the Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster
General at the Bank of England. Most departmental payments are made by
means of payable orders drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; these are
similar to cheques, and their recipients obtain payments through the com¬
mercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in turn reimbursed
by the Paymaster General’s Office.
The department is also responsible for the regular payment of many public
service pensions, including those of civil servants, teachers, and members of
the National Health Service, as well as the retired pay and pensions of officers
of the armed forces, their widows and dependants.
The Post Office The Post Office, which is controlled by the Postmaster General, operates
the inland postal, telegraph, telephone and remittance services and, in
co-operation with other countries and interests, the corresponding overseas
services.
Through its 25,000 post offices it also undertakes numerous agency
functions, including the operation of the Post Office Savings Bank, the issue
of savings certificates and bonds, the sale of broadcast receiving and other
licences, the sale of stamps for National Insurance contributions, and the
payment of grants and allowances, such as National Insurance payments,
retirement pensions and family allowances. A considerable volume of scientific
research and technical development relating to telephone, telegraph and radio
systems and the mechanisation of the postal services is carried out by the
engineering staff of the Post Office.
All Post Office income is paid into, and all its outgoings are met from, a
self-contained fund under the control of the Postmaster General.
The Postmaster General is also responsible to Parliament for broad questions
of national policy concerning the sound and television broadcasting services.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Power has the general duty of ensuring the effective and
Power co-ordinated development of fuel and power supplies in Great Britain, and
of promoting economy and efficiency in their distribution and consumption.
The business of producing and distributing gas and electricity and of pro¬
ducing coal is operated by the boards of the three nationalised industries
which are responsible to the Minister on policy issues. The Ministry is
responsible for government relations with the petroleum industry; it regulates
the construction and operation of privately owned industrial pipelines, and
the exploration for, and production of, oil and natural gas in Great Britain
and on the United Kingdom part of the Continental Shelf; it is also responsible
for the safety of nuclear installations other than those operated by the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and, as a result of recent legislation,
The Department

has assumed responsibilities in regard to the steel industry, broadly similar
to those which it has for the gas, electricity and coal industries.
The Ministry is concerned with the general co-ordination of fuel research
and research in the iron and steel industry; it administers the legislation
governing the safety and health of workers in or about coal mines, metalliferous
mines and quarries, and it conducts or arranges for research on these matters
and on other specific projects.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number
of government departments in England and Wales; the duties of his Depart¬
ment include drafting and preparing litigation, representing other departments
in court, and giving general advice on the interpretation and application of the
law. The Department undertakes a considerable amount of conveyancing
connected with the transfer of real property and with the administration of
the residuary estates (undisposed of by will) of certain deceased persons, and
it deals with the outstanding property and rights of dissolved companies. The
Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled by the Treasury
Solicitor, who reports annually to the Statute Law Committee (a body
appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the judiciary and legal
profession in England and Scotland) on its work.
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; others have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for conveyancing; and others, whose administrative work is based on or deals
with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work, have
their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also Procurator General (Queen’s Proctor).
The Ministry of Public Building and Works is responsible for the execution
of works services for the Ministry of Defence; the provision of office
accommodation for government departments at home and overseas, buildings
for British embassies and legations, research establishments and many other
types of accommodation required by civil and Service departments; the
design, purchase, supply and maintenance of furniture and equipment for, and
supply of fuel, household articles and stores to, diplomatic and consular
buildings, civil and Service departments and certain other bodies; the admin¬
istration of the Ancient Monuments Acts and the maintenance of those
monuments and historic buildings in the department’s charge; the
maintenance of royal palaces and certain official residences; the provision of
services for certain State ceremonial occasions; and the management and
maintenance of the royal parks and certain other open spaces.
The Ministry is the point of contact within the Government for the
construction industries and the building materials industries; it has general
responsibility for co-ordinating information about current and future building
programmes and for advising on the level of building activity. Regular
consultation with the industries at national and regional levels and a com¬
prehensive statistical service are maintained.
The Ministry is also responsible for the Building Research Station, for the
general co-ordination of research and development work carried out in
connection with building, for developing and fostering good management
practice at all stages of the building process, for disseminating the results
of such work and for encouraging the construction industries to make full
use of them.

pensioners in the United Kingdom and in the Irish Republic, the Ministry is
responsible for the administration of war pensions and for the medical treat¬
ment of war disablement of United Kingdom pensioners living in Northern
Ireland and, through its various agencies, in other countries overseas. The
Ministry maintains an office in Ottawa to serve pensioners in North America.
The Government Social Survey is a research body dealing with social and
economic problems. In essence it is concerned with survey research about
the circumstances, behaviour and attitudes of individuals, and its function is
to provide other government departments with facts and statistics which
their own organisations cannot produce, and which can best be obtained by
direct contact with, or observation of, samples of the general population or
particular groups. The Government Social Survey operates under the
direction of a Controller and is administratively responsible to Treasury
ministers.
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, responsible to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, is the central agency for government printing, binding and
publishing, and for providing government departments with duplicating,
addressing and distributing services, office machinery, equipment and
supplies, commercially published books and periodicals, and desk stationery.
It also provides certain of these services for the armed forces of the Crown.
The Controller is Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament and the copyright
of all British government documents is vested in him. About a third of all
official printing, including parliamentary needs, is done in the Stationery
Office’s 13 printing and binding works, the remainder being carried out by
private printers under contract. As government publisher, the Stationery
Office is responsible, through its nine government bookshops as well as the

The Board of Trade, under the President of the Board of Trade, has a general
responsibility in respect of the United Kingdom’s commerce, industry and
overseas trade. It is concerned with the formulation and administration of
policy on such subjects as commercial relations with other countries, import
and export trade, the protective tariff, industrial development and general
economic matters, consumer protection, shipping and civil aviation.
The Board’s other responsibilities are: the promotion of exports; statistics
of trade and industry (both at home and abroad), including the censuses of
production and distribution; the administration of certain regulative
legislation, for example in relation to patents, registered designs, copyright,
trade marks, weights and measures, merchandise marks, companies, bank¬
ruptcy, insurance, hire purchase, shipping, civil aviation, distribution of
industry, films, and enemy property; the payment to industry of investment
grants; and the management and development of the United Kingdom air
traffic control organisations.
In addition, the Board of Trade has a particular responsibility for govern¬
ment relations with all industries which are not specifically the concern of
other departments. The main industries which fall outside the scope of the
Board of Trade’s specific concern are food, agriculture and fisheries, building
and quarrying, iron and steel, fuel and power, engineering, and transport
(except shipping and civil aviation).
The Ministry of Transport has powers and duties relating to inland transport,
in Britain, including certain statutory duties concerning railways, roads, road
transport and inland waterways. The Minister appoints the members of the
nationalised transport boards (British Railways Board, London Transport
Board, British Transport Docks Board, British Waterways Board and
Transport Holding Company) and agrees the general lines on which their
development programmes are drawn up. He is the highway authority for
trunk roads and motorways in England, allocates the funds provided by Parlia¬
ment for road expenditure (including grants for classified roads vested in local
authorities) and has many powers and duties relating to road traffic and safety.
The Minister is also responsible for general policy in connection with the
development of United Kingdom ports and for the operation of ports in the
event of war.
The Secretary of State for Wales, who is assisted by a Minister of State and
a Parliamentary Under-Secretary, has responsibility in Wales for almost all
ministerial functions relating to housing, local government, water and sewerage,
historic buildings, town and country planning, new towns, forestry, roads,
and information. He has, in addition, a general oversight of government
policy in Wales, and certain responsibilities relating to national parks, the

The Welsh Office is centred in Cardiff; there is also a small ministerial
office in London.
The Secretary of State is responsible in Scotland for a wide range of functions
which in England and Wales are divided among a number of departmental
ministers. He is assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State and three
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. There are also two Scottish Law

departments of equal status (the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland, the Scottish Development Department, the Scottish Education
Department, and the Scottish Home and Health Department), each under
a Secretary responsible to the Secretary of State.
The responsibilities of the Secretary of State for the preparation and
implementation of the economic plans for Scotland (which form part of, or

through the Permanent Under-Secretary of State and other Scottish Office
staff with the advice of the Scottish Economic Planning Council and the
assistance of the Scottish Economic Planning Board and the officials of the
departments principally concerned.
The day-to-day administration of the departments is conducted in
Edinburgh, but each department has representatives in London for liaison and
parliamentary duties. The London office is generally known as the Scottish
Office, the term also used to describe all Scottish administration for which
the Secretary of State is responsible.
The Scottish Ministers are advised and assisted (particularly on questions
with which more than one of the departments are concerned or which fall
outside the province of any of them) by the Permanent Under-Secretary of
State, Scottish Office.
The Department has a general responsibility for, and in most cases admin¬
isters, government measures for the promotion and development of farming
in Scotland. In certain of these functions the Department is assisted by eleven
agricultural executive committees, consisting of members of the agricultural
industry and organised on an area basis.
The Department has responsibilities for the oversight and protection of
the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh-water fisheries. It also has functions
relating to harbours, to steamer services in the Highlands and Islands and to
general questions concerning Highland development.
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of the
services affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and
country planning, new towns, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage,
coast protection, flood prevention, building standards and the prevention of
river and air pollution (most of which are administered locally by town and
county councils) and with the policy of the Electricity Boards in Scotland.
The Department is responsible for general policy in regard to local govern¬
ment organisations and finance, and for the allocation of the major Exchequer
general and equalisation grants.

The Scottish Education Department is responsible for supervising the
administration of the Education (Scotland) Acts and for guiding the develop¬
ment of public education in Scotland in all its forms. The Department’s
functions include: the supervision of the training of teachers and the issue
of teachers’ certificates; the regulation of teachers’ salaries and the
administration of the Teachers (Superannuation) (Scotland) Regulations;
the control and distribution of specific Exchequer grants in aid of educational
expenditure; and the award of students’ allowances to those taking full-time
courses at universities and colleges of education. The Department also
exercises general supervision over the child care and adoption services,
remand homes, and approved schools; and is concerned with the development
of the arts in Scotland, having responsibility in this connection for the
administration of the Scottish national institutions—the National Galleries
of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum, the National Museum of Antiquities
of Scotland, and the National Library of Scotland.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for: (a) the
central administration of functions relating to law and order; and (b) the
health and welfare services in Scotland. Under (a) the Department is con¬
cerned with the police and probation services, criminal justice, legal aid and
the services needed by the courts, and is directly responsible for the adminis¬
tration of prisons and borstal institutions. It is also the central authority in
Scotland for the fire service, for civil defence, and for legislation concerning
shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed premises (which are directly maintained
by the Department in districts in which State management is in operation).
Under (b) the Department is responsible for the administration of the National
Health Service. Its work in connection with the associated welfare services
includes the supervision of local arrangements for the aged and handicapped,
and medical and surgical treatment for war pensioners.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Scottish Information
Office, which undertakes information services on behalf of the Scottish
departments and, to some extent, for Great Britain departments in Scotland,
and acts as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of Information; the
Department of the Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Register
Office); the Scottish Record Office; and the Department of the Registers
of Scotland. There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and
United Kingdom departments under the direction of controllers, who are
responsible for ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and
procedure of their departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and
needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court.
In some of this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate s
Department, the members of which also act as legal advisers on Scottish

questions to certain government departments who have no Scottish legal
adviser of their own. The work relevant to prosecutions is centred in the
Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland are incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department and are responsible to the minister concerned and
to the Law Officers for the drafting of all government Bills in so far as they
affect the law of Scotland. Their responsibilities in this connection are
similar to those of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.
Executive and administrative powers on matters under the jurisdiction of
the Northern Ireland Parliament are vested in the Crown, and exercised
by the Governor, acting on the advice of the Northern Ireland Cabinet,
through a number of departments. Each of the seven ministries (Agriculture ’
Commerce, Development, Education, Finance, Health and Social Services’
and Home Affairs) is under the control of a minister responsible to the
Northern Ireland Parliament. In addition, there are a Supplementary
Benefits Commission, and an Exchequer and Audit Department which,
together with the Ministries of Home Affairs, Education, and Agriculture,’
have functions indicated by their titles. The other departments have duties of
a varied nature, which are summarised below.
The Prime Minister s Department includes the Cabinet Secretariat, the
Information Service and the Economic Section. It corresponds with the
Government of the United Kingdom on major matters of policy and acts as
a channel of communication between the Governor and the Cabinet and
between the Cabinet and departments.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Commerce is concerned with industrial information and
Commerce statistical services; the progress of industrial production and trade in
Northern Ireland; the development of existing enterprises and the attraction
of new ones; and the administration of schemes of financial assistance to
industry. The department also has responsibilities in relation to electricity
and gas undertakings; harbours; the tourist trade; the regulation and
inspection of mines and quarries; mineral development; scientific develop¬
ment; weights and measures; the registration of companies and friendly
societies; and the administration of the Assurance Companies Acts and the
Industrial Assurance Acts.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Development is responsible for housing, planning, water
Development supplies, sewerage, local government matters, the planning of new towns,
roads, railways and public transport.
The Ministry of The basic functions of the Ministry of Finance are the settlement of financial
Finance questions with the United Kingdom Treasury, the financial control of
Northern Ireland departments, and the management of the Civil Service.
In connection with these functions the Ministry is responsible for the control
of borrowing, the issue of Ulster Savings securities, government loans to
local or public authorities, the collection of stamp duties, death duties and
certain excise duties, the collection of land purchase annuities and the staffing,
recruitment and training of the Civil Service and the regulation of its
conditions.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of
a political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose
remuneration is found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament.
The number of civil servants under this definition is about a million, for it
includes several hundred thousand government industrial employees in such
establishments as Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Navy dockyards. The
term ‘Civil Service’ is, however, generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’
members of the staffs of the various government departments in the United
Kingdom or working overseas. The total number of non-industrial civil
servants employed in all departments, at home and overseas, is approximately
855,ooo1; nearly one-third are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he
serves the minister in charge of the department in which he works by advising
on the formulation of policy, by carrying out policy decisions and by under¬
taking the many government activities which affect the life of the citizen.
From time to time the minister changes but the civil servant remains to serve
his successor. In Britain changes of Government do not involve changes in
departmental personnel, since it is considered that continuity makes for
administrative stability.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth
century included the substitution of open competition for the practice of
obtaining Civil Service appointments by favour or purchase, and the establish¬
ment of an independent body, the Civil Service Commission, to organise
recruitment to the service. The great expansion in State activity in the last
50 years, and the consequent increase in the numbers of civil servants and
the scope of their duties, have led to further reorganisation, including the
creation of service-wide scientific and professional classes; recruitment
competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system; and
co-ordination between the various departments has been improved. Civil
servants, though they remain employees of their departments, have become
members of an integrated service with common conditions of employment
1 Including part-time staffs—two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent to
one whole-time officer.

and their traditions and standards of conduct belong, not to individual
departments, but to the Civil Service as a whole.
The structure, recruitment, management and training of the Civil Service
are at present being reviewed by a committee which is expected to report in
1968.
Uniformity in the Civil Service derives mainly from the fact that the Treasury
exercises general control. One of the two Joint Permanent Secretaries to the
Treasury is the official head of the Home Civil Service and the principal
adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service as a
whole, and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the service. The
Treasury is responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment of all
civil servants; it controls the total number of staff and the creation of higher
posts, maintains a central organisation and methods division which serves
all departments which do not maintain an organisation and methods branch
of their own, and deals with general questions relating to training after
entry into the Civil Service. It is also concerned with the number of
departments and the distribution of functions between them.
Because modern government touches almost every aspect of life, the Civil
Service comprises officers with a wide variety of professional and technical
qualifications. Where officers of a particular type are required in more than
one department they are organised in general service or linked departmental
classes. This ensures similar grading and salary structures for the same type
of officer in each department. The main classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which numbers about 3,500. This class is
responsible for advising ministers on policy, for dealing with any
difficulties which may arise in carrying out existing policy and for
forecasting the probable effects of new measures and regulations. It is also
responsible for the broad problems which arise in the running of the
Government machine. Most new entrants are appointed soon after leaving
university, but there is some recruitment of more mature people
and civil servants from other classes may be promoted. Members of the
administrative class work in close conjunction with the executive class.
2. The Executive Classes (General and Departmental) which number some
81,000. These classes are responsible for the day-to-day conduct of
government business, including, for instance, the higher work of accounts
and revenue collection, within the framework of established policy.
3. The Specialist Classes (General and Departmental), which number about
127,000 in a variety of different categories, carry out the wide range of
specialised activities which are now undertaken by the Government. The
categories include accountants, architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers,
surveyors and scientists in all branches of science. The professionally
qualified staff are assisted by a large number of technical and drawing
office staffs.
4. The Clerical Classes (General and Departmental) comprise about 136,000
officers who undertake all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business: for instance, the preparation of accounts and the
keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in accordance writh
known rules, and the summarising and annotation of documents for the
assistance of senior officers. The personal secretaries of senior officers are

included in this group, together with officers directly responsible for the
supervision of clerical work.
5. The Ancillary Clerical Classes (with about 112,000 members), which
include clerical assistants, shorthand typists and typists, duplicator
operators and machine-operating grades.
6. Messengerial Classes (with some 35,000 members) which, in addition to
messengers, include paper keepers, office cleaners and similar workers.
In addition there are other departmental classes where employment is
peculiar to one department: for instance, the Post Office, with its postmen
(120,000), telephone operators (52,000), postal and telegraph officers (22,000)
and over 100,000 staff for the installation, maintenance and development of the
telephone, telegraph and wireless systems. Other examples are the Factory
Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and the Schools Inspectorate of the
Department of Education and Science.
The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides the staff (comprising some 6,200 civil servants) for service in
the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent
Commonwealth countries.
The Service has its own grade structure, corresponding by salary with the
grades of the Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes1 of the Home
Civil Service; it also has Secretarial, Communications and Security Guard
branches. Various specialists and advisers from home departments or the
armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or attachment to the
Diplomatic Service.
The Government of Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals
with matters transferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland
Act 1920. Subject to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service
is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, but recruitment to permanent
and pensionable posts is effected through the medium of a separate Civil
Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the two Civil Services
occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for departmental agreement
in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
when vacancies cannot be filled by this means, the Ministry for Overseas
Development and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and
Administrations are asked to recruit other candidates, principally from the
United Kingdom.
The recruitment of permanent civil servants in the Home Civil Service of
Great Britain and the Diplomatic Service is in the hands of the Civil Service
Commission which, in the selection of entrants, is independent of both
ministerial and parliamentary control; its members are appointed by the
Crown on the advice of the Government. The normal method of entry is by
open competition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by
the Treasury and consisting of written examination or interviews, or both.
1 The numbers in these separate classes are included in the equivalent Home Civil
Service Grades.
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Training after
Entry
Promotion
The main points of entry into the main classes of the Home Civil Service
are planned to correspond to definite levels in the British educational
system, and it is the Commission’s duty to study the requirements of the
Civil Service in the light of the education provided by the schools and
universities.
In a number of junior grades, departments recruit their own staff and the
Civil Service Commission will consider granting those recruited permanent
status, if they possess the prescribed qualifications. Temporary civil servants
are also normally recruited by the department concerned; no special qualifying
examinations are required.
In all except the smaller government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors who organise both general and technical courses,
ranging from courses of systematic instruction for recruits in all classes to
‘refresher’ courses covering technical subjects or broader subjects, such as
management, organisation and communications, for more experienced staff.
Young people are given opportunities to continue their studies under schemes
by which young employees and apprentices are released for study, usually
on one day a week (‘day-release’ schemes). In some departments similar
arrangements are available for selected older staff.
Methods of training include lectures, discussion groups, case studies,
instructional films, desk training and the preparation of self-instruction
programmes (‘programmed learning’). There are also exchanges to enable
civil servants to study the working of appropriate outside bodies. Officers in
the early years of their service may be transferred from branch to branch and,
more rarely, from department to department, in order that they may gain as
wide an experience as possible of Civil Service activities, and there are
openings for selected officers to travel abroad or to study at universities,
technical colleges and other educational establishments. Facilities are provided
for officers who take up private studies to have the fees met in whole or in part,
depending upon the subject being studied.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division of the
Treasury, which is also responsible, with the National Whitley Council,1 for
guidance and some aid to departments in the organisation and performance
of their training through a team of Training Liaison Officers. The Division
also runs central courses and residential seminars for members of the
administrative, professional and scientific classes at different stages of their
careers and trains departmental instructors and other special groups, for
instance, superintendents of typists, secretaries and staff in establishment
divisions.
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service.
Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments; those from
class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions and partly
by departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to most of the
highest positions in the Civil Service, for instance, permanent secretaries,
deputy secretaries, principal establishments officers and principal finance

between managements and staffs; the councils are named after Mr. J. H. Whitley,
former Speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of a committee which investi¬
gated industrial unrest from 1916 to 1919.
GOVERNMENT 6g
officers, must be approved by the Prime Minister; he is advised in these matters
by the head of the Home Civil Service.
Conditions of Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
Service as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil Service Clerical
Association, the Union of Post Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants,
the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, and the Association of First
Division Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent
civil servant, who is capable and efficient, may reasonably expect a full career
in the public service and a pension on retirement—though this, again, is not
a legal right.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work such long hours as may
be necessary without additional pay. The standard working week for office
staffs is 41 hours in London and 42 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies
according to grade and length of service up to a maximum of six weeks, that
is, 30 working days, a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance
benefit received, may be granted to permanent civil servants for up to six
months in any twelve months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum of one
year’s sick leave in any four years; any officer whose health is permanently
impaired may be retired on medical grounds.
Political and
Private
Activities
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the
day irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free,
as a private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to
grade. For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who
are completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political
activities (although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign
their appointment before nomination day on the understanding that if not
elected they will be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the
declaration of the election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance
of the need for discretion and with the permission of the department, to take
part in most activities except parliamentary candidature; and those who are
debarred from national political activities though they may seek permission
to take part in local government and political activities. In the non-industrial
Civil Service, the completely free groups are the manipulative grades of the
Post Office, and the minor grades such as cleaners and messengers. The
intermediate group includes mainly clerical and typing grades, and the
granting of permission by the department depends, broadly, on the nature of
the work done. The group which is not allowed to take part in national
political activities includes the executive, the professional, the scientific and
70
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Security
technical, and the administrative grades. In general, because the reputation
of the service must be closely guarded, permission to take part in local
political activities will also be refused to members of this group if the local
activities are conducted on the same party lines and through the same party
organisations as national political activities. Where permission is granted, it
is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the department
of election or co-option to a local council.
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all
citizens to register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions,
for instance, at general or local authority elections. They may also engage
in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do not in any way
conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920, and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.
However, since a civil servant must not use his official position to further his
private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in commerce and business:
for instance, he may not hold private interests in public contracts and he may
not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the
approval of his department.
The political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of
official concern, but there are some Civil Service duties in which secrecy is
so vitally important to State security that the Government does not feel
itself justified in employing anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in
doubt. For this reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively
associated or in sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist
organisations is employed in connection with secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals
with national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of
the United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape much of it dates
back to the late nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive
system of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the
benefit of the community was first incorporated in statute law. Since that time
there has been a large increase in the population, and a massive transformation
in the range, complexity and scale of local authority functions. Because of
this, local government in Greater London has already been reorganised and
Royal Commissions are now carrying out a comprehensive review of the
structure and functions of local government in England and Scotland
respectively. Proposals for the reorganisation of local government in Wales
have already been published.
In Northern Ireland the Minister of Development is engaged upon a
fundamental examination of the structure of local government.

The powers and duties of local authorities are defined by Acts of Parliament.
Basically councils are responsible to the law and to the local electors and not to
the central Government. They determine their own budgets, and no minister
of the Crown has power to suspend or dismiss them, nor to inquire into the
way in which they organise their business. However, in respect of certain
services, Acts of Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of
the Crown defined powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure
of national uniformity in the standard of service provided, or to safeguard public
health, while others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens.
For some services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for
some there are strictly limited powers; for others no provision at all is made
for ministerial supervision.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England; in Scotland the
Scottish Development Department is responsible for general policy in regard
to local government; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Development.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside the Greater London area) and Northern Ireland is a division of the
country into county boroughs and administrative counties. The county
boroughs (mostly with populations of over 75,000) are separate from the
counties and independent of them. The administrative counties are sub¬
divided into county districts—non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural
districts, the last-named being further divided into parishes1 (except in
Northern Ireland). Scotland is divided into counties (including 4 counties
of cities) which are independently administered, large and small burghs, and
districts. Each local authority division is administered by its own elected
council. In England and Wales (outside the Greater London area) there are
58 county councils, 82 county borough councils, 270 non-county borough
councils, 535 urban district councils, 473 rural district councils,2 about
7,500 parish councils and some 3,300 parish meetings (in parishes not large
enough to have a parish council); in Scotland, 33 county councils (two pairs
being combined for certain purposes), 200 town councils (including 4 for
counties of cities) and 198 district councils (2 counties not being divided
into districts); and in Northern Ireland, 2 county borough councils, 6 county
councils, 10 non-county borough councils, 25 urban district councils and
27 rural district councils.
The Greater London area is administered by the councils of 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, and by the Greater London Council
(GLC).
Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some
cases, aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who
has varied ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work on
the council. In most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern
Ireland the chairman is the Mayor; in the City of London and certain

important boroughs, the Lord Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the Convener;
and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local
government is three years; aldermen normally hold office for six years. In
some local authority areas the whole council retires every third year and
another is elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually,
when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government
elections in Great Britain is governed by rules laid down by the Representation
of the People Act 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to
vote at a local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age
or over on the qualifying date, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish
Republic, is not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local
government elector for the area for which the election is held. In Great
Britain a person qualifies for registration as a local government elector if,
on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annually), he or she is resident
in the council area or occupies therein, as owner or tenant, any rateable land
or premises of a yearly value of not less than £10. In Northern Ireland, in
order to qualify for registration as a local government elector, a person must
have been born in Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have resided con¬
tinuously in the United Kingdom for seven years immediately prior to the
qualifying date and must have either a resident occupier’s or a general
occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more
restricted. Each elector has one vote for each seat contested in his electoral
area; he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than one vote
for each candidate.
Most candidates for election as councillor stand as representatives of one
of the national political parties, as members of an association representing
some local interest, or as independents. All must be of British nationalitv,
over 21 years of age, and must (1) be registered as local government electors
in the register of electors for the area of the local authority to which they seek
election, or (2) have resided within that area during the whole of the 12
months preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils),
or (3) in England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the area.
Candidates are also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed
to ensure that unsuitable persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by
the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962 and regulations made there¬
under by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland. These regula¬
tions are, in general, similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though
differing in certain particulars; for instance, there is no postal voting and the
only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
Most local authority areas are divided into electoral districts for local
council elections. Administrative counties are split up, in accordance with
orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Minister
of Housing and Local Government, or the Secretary of State for Scotland, into
‘electoral divisions’. Boroughs, urban and rural districts in England and
Wales, and burghs in Scotland, are either divided into ‘wards’, or, if they are
small, left as single units. In rural districts the wards are based on parishes

which, if large enough, may be split into parish wards. In these types of local
authority area each ward returns one or more members.
County divisions each return one member to the council. The London
boroughs are divided into electoral areas (covering in most cases the same
areas as parliamentary constituencies), each of which returns one councillor.
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer
such environmental and social services as Acts of Parliament require it to
provide and administer. It may provide additional services under the
permissive powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by local or
Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows:
in England (outside the Greater London area) and Wales county borough
councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them,1 which they
exercise independently to a considerable extent, although there is a certain
degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils,
especially of duties connected with town and country planning and the
education, health and welfare services. Parish councils or parish meetings
have a few functions of local interest which they may exercise of right. In
Scotland the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities;
elsewhere, the county councils, the town councils and the district councils
all share in local government work. In Northern Ireland the position is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales, except that local authorities
are not called upon to provide or administer police, civil defence or (except in
Belfast) fire services; moreover county councils do not in general delegate any
of their functions to county district councils.
In Greater London the basic units of local government are the London
boroughs; the GLC is responsible only for those services which, by their
nature, require unified administration and control over the whole area. In
the City of London (an area of approximately one square mile in the centre
of the metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general powers admin¬
istered and duties performed by the London borough councils.
Local authority services may be classified under three heads: environ¬
mental, protective and personal. The environmental services are designed
to secure local good order, amenity and public health. They include the
inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, litter prevention, rodent control, the super¬
vision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for preventing
air pollution, and the provision of baths and washhouses. They also include
the services for bridge and highway construction and maintenance, for street
lighting, public safety on the roads, and the provision of recreation grounds,
parks and similar amenities. Town and country planning is the major
environmental service. The protective services are the fire service, the civil
defence service and the police service, while the personal services range from
health services, education and housing to the provision of public entertainment.
Services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the provision
of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some residential and
day nurseries; the provision and supervision of midwifery services, health
visitors and home nursing facilities; measures for the prevention of illness and
1 For instance, county councils are generally responsible for the police, fire and civil
defence services, while the district councils administer most of the environmental and
sanitary services.

the aftercare of physically or mentally sick persons; the provision of domestic
help where necessary; the ambulance service; the provision of facilities for
vaccination and immunisation against certain infectious diseases; and the
services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged and infirm
and for children deprived of a normal home life. Education and culture are
promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types of schools;
by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical colleges; by
the award of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds; and by the
provision of libraries, art galleries and museums. Housing needs are met, as
far as possible, by building new houses (mainly to let), acquiring old houses
and converting them to provide additional accommodation, planning for slum
clearance, seeing that adequate standards are maintained in both newly built and
older houses, and generally ensuring that housing conditions are satisfactory.
Some local authorities also engage in trading services, such as passenger
transport, water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services; they also have
power to initiate schemes to attract industrial development.
The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller
information is given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters of
this book.
Internal
Organisation
of Local
Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
will discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
committees are appointed to carry out the detailed administration of the
various services. Parish councils and the smaller district councils are often
able to do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint
committees from time to time, when any special study or experience is
required. The more important of the committees of the larger authorities
may divide their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent com¬
mittee in a relation similar to that of the main committees to the whole
council. The execution of the policy decided upon by the council and the
committees rests with salaried officers and employees, whose number may
vary from about half a dozen in a small rural district to several thousands
in the large counties and in the larger county boroughs and burghs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of
specialists on committees and the length of time certain members may hold
office, committees of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those
which are mandatory committees are constituted according to individual
requirements and not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes
of classification, however, they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary
committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be further
divided into mandatory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; other standing committees, which are appointed
in accordance with the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis
according to the extent of the council’s business; and special committees,
which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than
one authority. They may be established, outside the Greater London area,
for services that can be more effectively administered over a wider area than
that controlled by a single council, for instance, town and country planning,
water supplies and the police service.
GOVERNMENT
75
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s
standing orders. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees,
except its powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates, or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute (raising precepts
in England and Wales and levying requisitions in Scotland) which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. County and county borough councils exercise
their powers of delegation to a considerable extent, but in most districts
and parishes councils use their committees only in an advisory capacity.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and
of some committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered
if the council resolve that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to
the public interest.
Officers and
Employees
Local
Government
Finance
Generally speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as they
deem necessary for carrying out their work, although certain posts (for
instance, the clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health) are
compulsory in almost all councils. Choice of personnel is left to a great extent
to the individual council: in theory, the appointment of certain chief officers
is subject to some central control but, in practice, the nominee of the council
is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for
which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned;
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements are
always made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and committees
are informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council (except for the rare case where the
proposed salary of an officer requires the approval of a government depart¬
ment, as in the case of the clerk of a county council in England and Wales).
They are based on recommendations made by the Whitley Councils (see
note on p. 68), of which the largest, in England and Wales, are the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical
and Clerical Services and the National Joint Industrial Council for Local
Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) and, in Scotland, the
Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities
(Scotland) and the Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In
England and Wales conditions of service and salary scales for senior local
government officers are determined by separate joint committees. The local
government service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating
machinery at various levels.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of
conduct; as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must
be beyond the reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
There are three sources of local authority income: government grants (about
two-fifths); local rates, paid by occupiers of land and buildings (about two-
fifths); and rents from municipal houses, dividends and interest (about
?6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Rates
one-fifth). Capital investment is, for the greater part, financed by borrowing.
Government grants occasionally take the form of capital grants, paid on
approval of claims made by local authorities for specific services, principally
roads and public lighting; annual subsidies are also payable for local
authority housing. Revenue grants—payable both in aid of revenues
generally (known as rate support grants) and for specific services—
amount to about £1,250 million and £127 million respectively for 1967-68;
they are related to estimates of local authority revenue expenditure other than
on contributions to deficits on housing and trading accounts. Services
attracting specific grants include police, civil defence, and comprehensive
development. Grants are also made towards the cost of rate rebate for people
with low incomes.
The rate support grant is distributed among the major authorities (in England
and Wales, the county, county borough and London borough councils; in
Scotland, the county and town councils) in three parts: the ‘needs’ element
composed of a basic payment which takes into account total heads of popula¬
tion and, in particular, the number of children of school age, together with
supplementary payments which may take into account the numbers of
children under five years old and of people over 65, the cost of various stages
of education, density of population and road mileage; the ‘resources’ element
which is paid to authorities whose rateable resources are below the average
for all authorities in relation to population; and the ‘domestic’ element which
compensates rating authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in
rate poundage which they are required to give to householders—5d. in
1967-68 and tod. in 1968-69. Rate support grants are estimated to shift the
balance from rates to taxes on revenue account by about one per cent
annually.
In Northern Ireland there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific
services (for example, education, roads, housing, health and welfare, water
supplies and sewerage), supplemented by a General Exchequer Contribution
which compensates for derating and takes account of the needs and resources
of individual authorities. A grant is also paid to rating authorities to compensate
them for prescribed reductions in rate poundages, which they are required
to give to householders.
Rates are a form of local tax paid by the occupiers of land and buildings
(except agricultural land and buildings) as contributions to the cost of local
services. They are levied by a poundage on the rateable value of property;
in England and Wales this is equivalent to its net annual value which, in
turn, is based on the rent which it might reasonably be expected to command
if let from year to year with the tenant bearing the rates and the cost of
insurance and repairs. Valuation for rating in England and Wales is under¬
taken by valuation officers of the Board of Inland Revenue, who are
independent of the local authorities. In the latest valuation lists (1963)
rateable values for all classes of property are based on current rental values.
Transitional assistance is being given for eight years, from 1st April 1965, by
the Greater London Council to the councils of the home counties (Essex,
Surrey and Kent) of which parts have been absorbed into the Greater London
area to offset extra rate burdens caused by the reorganisation of London
government; and there is a scheme for reducing disparities in the rates levied
in Inner London. In addition, rate rebates are available to people with small
incomes. Charities pay half the full rate on property they occupy for charitable
purposes but may be given further reliefs by the rating authorities, who are

empowered to reduce or remit the rates for a wide range of non-profit-making
bodies.
Appeals from valuations may be made to local valuation courts, each
consisting of three members of an independent local valuation panel, and
thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of each
valuation area and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation Advisory Council has been established
by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the valuation
authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose department is part of the
Ministry of Finance. Industry and freight transport in Scotland are rated at
half and in Northern Ireland at a quarter of their net annual value.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the councils of county boroughs and county districts, with the
London borough councils and with the City Corporation. The rate poundage
for each county district consists mainly of a district rate and a county rate,
calculated in accordance with the respective requirements of the two
authorities, and the proceeds of the latter are passed on to the county council.
In rural districts the rate levied in each parish takes into account precepts
issued by the parish council or parish meeting. In Greater London the GLC
raises revenue by precepting on the London boroughs and the City. Rates
in Scotland are levied by the town councils in burghs and by county councils
elsewhere; to cover their expenditure, district councils levy a requisition
each year to the county council; a town council has to meet an annual requisi¬
tion from the county council in respect of the burgh’s share of the expenditure
on functions exercised by the county council throughout the county, including
the burgh. In Northern Ireland county councils are responsible for making,
levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts of the county as fall within
the jurisdiction of the county borough, borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by local authorities for financing such items of capital
expenditure as are sanctioned by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment, the Secretary of State for Wales, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
or, occasionally, the government department responsible for the service for
which the capital is required. The Greater London Council applies annually
for parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure.
In Northern Ireland the government department responsible for the service
also issues the appropriate loan approvals. Borrowing powers for specific
purposes may also be taken under Acts of Parliament of local application.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by issuing mortgages, by issuing
stock upon the Stock Exchange and by bonds which may or may not be quoted
on the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any period, local
authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also have
right of access to the Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer,
or, in Northern Ireland, to the Government Loans Fund for a proportion of
their long-term borrowing and may borrow temporarily for a limited propor¬
tion of their outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned
by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of
the council under constant review. In England and Wales an external audit
is carried out (except for certain general accounts in most of the county

borough and about two-thirds of the borough councils) by district auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. County
borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts
which relate to police, children and education, and local health and welfare
services. In both county and non-county boroughs rating and coast protection
are also subject to district audit. For their other accounts borough councils use
mainly professional auditors; a few use ‘elective audit’, which provides for the
appointment of three auditors: two elected by the local government electors
and one appointed by the mayor. In Scotland the accounts of each authority
are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary of State for
Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern Ireland by
special local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of Development.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England
and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services^ in
Northern Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation
and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the
Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United Kingdom is covered
by a public fire brigade.
There are 132 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and 11 in
Scotland. In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act 1947, separate
fire brigades are administered by the county and county brough councils,
which are the fire authorities for their areas and have powers and duties which
they exercise either separately or as combined authorities where neighbouring
councils care to make such arrangements in the interests of the efficiency of
the service. The Greater London Council is the fire authority for the Greater
London Fire Brigade. In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in 11
areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the
town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered
by a joint committee representative of the councils of the counties and large
burghs in the area.
There are also fire-fighting organisations outside the local authority service;
for instance, those maintained by the Service departments of the Ministry of
Defence and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland may make
regulations regarding the maintenance of discipline, training, appointments
and promotions, pensions, the design and performance of equipment, and the
uniformity of fire hydrants in local fire brigades, and their approval is necessary
for certain reductions in establishment schemes. In matters affecting the fire
brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and conditions of service), each
minister is advised by the appropriate Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council,
consisting of officers of the respective home departments, representatives of
the local authority associations, representatives of the chief officers (firemasters
in Scotland) and other members of the brigades, and other persons having
special qualifications. The National Joint Council for Local Authorities Fire
Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint Council for Chief Officers
of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain are the negotiating

bodies on ranks, pay and conditions of service of members of the brigades.
Inspectorates of fire services advise the Secretaries of State on operational
and technical matters.
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Establishment
schemes differ according to the fire risks in the area concerned; in the whole
of England and Wales there are about 24,300 whole-time and 17,100 part-time
firemen, operating more than 3,000 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps,
turntable ladders, water tenders, and emergency and salvage tenders) housed
in some 1,600 fire stations. In Scotland there are approximately 2,800 whole¬
time and 2,700 part-time firemen, 574 fire-fighting appliances, and 216 fire
stations (61 whole-time, 173 retained and 82 volunteer).
It is the duty of each fire authority to buy such vehicles and equipment as
are required. Equipment is standardised, and appliances are bought by fire
authorities to specifications which ensure that essential standards are main¬
tained and yet allow sufficient freedom of design to meet local requirements.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the head administrative and executive officer for its fire services. The
appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary or by the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The chief fire officer or firemaster is responsible to the
fire authority for seeing that the fire brigade is organised and managed in
accordance with policy.
All brigades have a central headquarters for operational control. Control
is, however, usually exercised on a local basis by divisional officers in charge of
the geographical divisions into which most areas are divided. Each divisional
officer has at his disposal a staff of whole-time officers and men, often
supplemented—particularly in country areas—by part-time officers and men;
and he is responsible for mobilising this force in the strength necessary for
dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters and if at any time
an outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is
sent from one or more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of
another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire
authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless
of area boundaries.
In England and Wales the approximate number of fire calls (in 1966) including
false alarms and special service calls for such purposes as rescuing persons and
animals trapped in dangerous situations, dealing with crashed aircraft, and
pumping and salvage operations was 310,000. In Scotland the number of fire
calls was approximately 36,000.
Estimated fire losses in the United Kingdom in 1966 amounted to about
£82 million, some £7 million more than the corresponding figure for 1965.
About three-fifths of the total number of firemen in local authority fire
brigades work on a whole-time basis. The part-time firemen include retained
firemen who, in return for a retaining fee, undertake to attend fires if called
upon, and volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration. Many fire

authorities employ women on communications and mobilising duties; some
have also introduced schemes for the employment of junior firemen between
the ages of 16 and 18 years, with a view to their being enrolled as regular
firemen at the age of 18.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at training schools run by fire authorities.
In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central training school which
is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health Department. Advanced
and specialised training courses, including fire prevention courses, are provided
for the higher ranks at the Fire Service College, Wotton House, near Dorking,
Surrey; training for lower and middle ranks is provided at the Fire Service
Technical College, Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Both these establish¬
ments are maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health
Department. Facilities for properly accredited officers from overseas fire
services to study the organisation, current training methods, appliances and
equipment of the British fire brigades are arranged by the Home Office Fire
Department.
A report of a joint committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory
Councils has given guidance on the broad lines on which local training schemes
should be based, leaving discretion on certain matters to local authorities.
The report suggests the adoption of syllabuses of practical fire service
training, physical, general and technical education.
The fire authorities bear the cost of maintaining the fire service, but they receive
an Exchequer contribution which is included in the aggregate amount of the
local authority rate support grant (see p. 76). For the purpose of arriving at the
amount of this contribution, the Government receives from fire authorities
(at the time when the grant is to be considered) details of the last known
actual expenditure for a year, together with estimates for the impending
grant period.
Side by side with fire-fighting operations, fire authorities have important
responsibilities in respect of fire prevention. They have a statutory obligation
to maintain adequate arrangements for giving advice about fire prevention to
anyone who requires it, and have been made the enforcing authority for fire
precautions under a steadily growing number of Acts of Parliament, of which
the most notable are the Factories Act 1961, and the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act 1963. There are provisions relating to fire and fire
prevention in a large number of other Acts with which fire authorities are
concerned, either in their own right as fire authorities or by virtue of the
advisory functions of their fire brigade.
Within brigades, the work of fire prevention is entrusted to a staff of fire
prevention officers. Other sources of advice on fire prevention include the
various insurance companies who advise their policy holders, and the Fire
Protection Association, a non-profit-making body established by the Fire
Offices’ Committee1 as an advisory centre on a nation-wide basis for industry
and the general public on protection of life and property against fire.
Research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire fighting, and in particular
into the relationship between the frequency and severity of outbreaks of fire,
the effects of fire fighting and the provision of protective equipment within

buildings, is undertaken by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under the
general direction of the Fire Research Board. The cost of the Organisation
is shared equally between the Ministry of Technology and the Fire Offices’
Committee who, jointly, nominate the members of the Fire Research Board.
The Organisation operates from a fire research station at which tests are
carried out.
In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade
and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern
Ireland Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an
establishment of 280 officers and men manning 14 appliances, while the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry
and 44 other stations throughout the remainder of the area, and an establish¬
ment of 103 whole-time officers and men and 662 part-time firemen, manning
71 appliances.
The amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority is 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure
which do not exceed £90,000 and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which
the loan charges exceed £90,000, together with 50 per cent of the first £240,000
of other net expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that amount.
Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is apportioned among the local
authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the Authority. Under the Fire
Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for the payment of fire
service grant.
3 Law and Order
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single
body of law applicable universally within its limits; and in England and
Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, separate systems are in
force (see p. 27). There are, however, similarities between the systems. As
between England and Wales on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the
other the similarity is general, due to the closeness of the association between
these countries since the twelfth century. As between Scotland and the rest
of the United Kingdom the differences are more extensive, although the
existence, during the past 250 years, of a common Parliament, a common
public opinion on broader issues, and a common court of appeal for civil
cases has resulted in substantial identity at many points. A large volume of
modern legislation, particularly in the social field, applies throughout the
United Kingdom.
A feature which is common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom
(and differentiates them from some continental systems) is that there is no
complete code. The sources of law in all the systems include statutes dealing
with particular subjects, and a large amount of unwritten or ‘common’ law,
which can be gathered from decisions of the courts and from other sources.
English law today is contained in about 3,000 Acts of Parliament, several
thousand Statutory Instruments and over 300,000 reported cases.
Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate
legislation made under powers conferred by Parliament. It is absolutely
binding on all courts of the United Kingdom, taking precedence over any
other source of law. The common law of England originated in the customs
of the realm and was built up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary
system of law, known as ‘equity’, came into being during the Middle Ages
to provide and enforce more effective protection for existing legal rights.
It was administered by a separate court and later became a separate body of
legal rules. In 1873 the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common
law, so that all courts now apply both systems but, where they conflict,
equity prevails.
In Scotland the basis of common law, which largely depends on the canon
law of Rome, helped by continental commentators, is embodied in the
writings of certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century
lawyers of great repute who, between them, described systematically almost
the whole field of private and criminal law as existing in their times. Broadly
speaking, the principles enunciated by these lawyers, together with the many
judicial decisions which have followed and developed from those principles,
form the body of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has never had a separate
system of equity—equitable principles having always permeated the ordinary
rules of law.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
the community between themselves.

The courts of ordinary criminal jurisdiction in England and Wales include:
magistrates courts, which try the less serious offences and conduct preliminary
inquiries into the more serious offences; courts of quarter sessions, which try
most of the more serious offences; and courts of assize, including the Central
Criminal Court (for Greater London) and the Crown Courts in Liverpool
and Manchester, which try the gravest offences and cases of special difficulty.
All trials at quarter sessions and assizes are conducted with a jury (see p. 95).
Most magistrates’ courts consist of two to seven lay magistrates known as
justices of the peace. The justices are unpaid; are not required to possess any
legal qualifications although they must undergo a period of training; and may
obtain advice on points of law, when required, from the clerk to the justices. In
some of the large cities there are also paid, or ‘stipendiary’, magistrates who
are professional lawyers and usually sit alone. In inner London there is a
unified system of magistrates’ courts, in which either a metropolitan stipendiary
magistrate or justices may sit. The great majority of offences (over 97 per cent)
committed are disposed of in magistrates’ courts.
Specially qualified magistrates sit in juvenile courts to hear cases involving
young offenders (see p. 102) or children brought before the court as being in
need of care or protection, as beyond control, or as persistent truants. These
courts, which sit either in a different room or building from other courts, or
at a different time, and at which only limited publicity is allowed, also deal
with many applications for the adoption of children.
Courts of quarter sessions sit at least four times a year; in the busier places,
they meet much more frequently than this.
All counties have courts of quarter sessions and 94 cities and boroughs
also have separate courts which exercise jurisdiction within their own boun¬
daries. In counties the courts are generally presided over by a bench of lay
magistrates under a legally qualified chairman. In boroughs the courts are
presided over by a single judicial officer, the Recorder, who is a barrister
specially appointed to act part-time in this capacity. In Greater London there
are five areas, each with its own quarter sessions, presided over by a full-time
paid chairman or deputy chairman.
Courts of assize1 are branches of the High Court presided over by High Court
judges and held at assize towns—generally in the county town of each county
and in certain of the other larger towns and cities. The judges go round
‘on circuit’ three times a year—on the autumn, winter and summer assizes.
Each town is visited once on each circuit; the larger towns are visited twice.
After the trial of criminal cases in each town, the judges deal with civil
cases.
In Liverpool and Manchester, Crown Courts act both as quarter sessions for
the two cities and as assize courts for South Lancashire. The courts are
presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and Manchester, who are
whole-time judicial officers. Where the work requires additional courts, the
Recorders may be assisted by Commissioners, who may be county court
judges.
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey in the City of London acts as
the court of assize for the criminal business of Greater London. The court
sits in virtually continuous session; more than one court sits at one time and
each is presided over by a salaried judicial officer.

Appeals

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Appeals may be brought on a point of law, by either the prosecutor or the
defendant, direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more
usual appeal is that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence,
which is heard by quarter sessions.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or
Crown Courts go to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. Appeals
on questions of law may be brought as of right, but on other grounds only by
leave of the court. The Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal presides
in the Criminal Division and Queen’s Bench judges sit with Judges of Appeal
(see p. 87). On appeal against conviction the court has power to quash the
conviction and direct the appellant’s acquittal or, if the appeal is allowed on
grounds of fresh evidence only, to order a retrial. A further appeal from the
Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords can be
brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public importance
is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point
is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no restriction on the right of a private citizen to institute criminal
proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales are, in fact,
initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent of the
Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less frequently,
a government department is required. The Director of Public Prosecutions
is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious classes of indictable
offences (that is, offences involving formal written accusation); in courts where
a substantial number of cases with which he is concerned are tried, standing
counsel are appointed by the Attorney General to appear on his behalf.
At the Central Criminal Court in London, for instance, there is a panel of
counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are retained to prosecute in the
Director’s cases.
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a
judicial authority on information laid before it or, in certain cases, without
a warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defen¬
dant on bail, that is to say he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his
entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable sum
of money, to appear in court at the time appointed for the trial. Magistrates
may also grant bail in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Justice
Act 19671. An arrested person must be charged at once with the offence of
which he is suspected; under the Judges Rules2, once a person has been
charged with or informed that he may be prosecuted for an offence, no further
questions relating to that offence may be put by the police, save in exceptional
circumstances for the purpose of preventing or minimising harm or loss to
any person or to the public, or for clearing up an ambiguity in a previous
answer or statement. Unless the offence of which an arrested person is
suspected is serious, he must be granted bail if he cannot be brought before
the court within a day.
If anyone is detained in custody and thinks that the grounds3 for his
detention are not lawful, he (or, if he is unable, someone acting on his behalf)
1 These and a number of other provisions of the Act, come into operation during 1968.
2 These Rules do not have the force of law but carry very great weight.
3 Lawful grounds include: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; for disobeying a court order to pay a civil debt when able
to do so; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered; detention of children
by their parents or guardians. The writ of habeas corpus runs in both criminal and civil
cases.

may sue out a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained him, this
person then being required to appear before the court on the day named to
show cause for detention. An application for a writ of habeas corpus is normally
made to a divisional court. If no such court is sitting it may be made to a
single judge (where possible to one sitting in court) who may, and in some
cases must, direct that it should come before a divisional court. An application
on behalf of anyone under 21 is always first made to a judge sitting in chambers
or in private. A writ may be refused only by a divisional court.
Nearly all criminal cases are tried first in magistrates’ courts. Most involve
either summary offences which may be disposed of by the justices sitting
together without a jury, or the less serious indictable offences which may be
dealt with in the same way, if the defendant consents. For the more serious
offences the magistrates sit as ‘examining justices’ to determine if there is
sufficient evidence (which may be in the form of written statements only) to
justify committal of the defendant for trial in a higher court before a jury.
Since criminal law presumes the innocence of the accused until his guilt
has been conclusively proved, the prosecution has no advantage, apparent
or real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal adviser
for his defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal aid at
the public expense; if remanded in custody he may be visited in prison by
his legal adviser. During the preparation of the case, it is customary for the
prosecution to inform the defence of any relevant documents which it is not
proposed to put in evidence and to disclose them if asked to do so.
All criminal trials are held in open court and the rules of evidence (which
are concerned with the proof of facts and much the same in civil and criminal
trials) are rigorously applied.1 For instance, although the uncorroborated
evidence of one witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, conviction
in criminal cases solely on the evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is,
in practice, never allowed unless the judge has warned the jury of the danger
of convicting without corroboration.
During the trial the accused has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the
prosecution; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial
of their own free will, may be ‘subpoenaed’, or legally compelled, to attend;
and to address the court either in person or through his counsel. But he
cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be sworn as a witness
in his own defence. The right to cross-examine the accused, even when he
is so sworn, is limited by law, with the object of excluding inquiry into his
character or into past offences not relevant to the particular charge on which
he is being tried. Furthermore, although confessions made in the course of
previous judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been
made upon oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances should be
admissible unless it can be proved that they were made voluntarily, that is,
without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up
the evidence for the benefit of the jury (see p. 95), and acquits the accused or
passes sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides
the issue of guilt or innocence. Verdicts need not necessarily be unanimous;
in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, majority verdicts
of ten to two may be accepted by the court.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a
86
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
defence of insanity is accepted by the jury the verdict is ‘not guilty by reason
of insanity’ and the accused will be detained in a suitable hospital. From a
verdict of guilty or of not guilty by reason of insanity there is a right of appeal
on the part of the defendant to the appropriate court.
CIVIL LAW IN
ENGLAND AND
WALES
Civil Courts
County Courts
The High Court
of Justice
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in England and Wales are the county
courts, which are the courts for the lesser cases, and the High Court, where
the more important cases are tried. Most appeals go to the Court of Appeal
and from there may go to the House of Lords. Magistrates’ courts have
limited civil jurisdiction, mainly relating to domestic proceedings, such as
maintenance applications, the custody of infants, and questions concerning
marriage of young people under the age of 21. They also have power to settle
minor civil disputes, where small sums are at stake, and administrative
functions in relation to such matters as licensing.
County Courts (of which there are nearly 400) are so located that no part of
a county is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. They are
presided over by a paid judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may
sit with a jury consisting of eight persons if either party wishes it and the court
makes an order to that effect. There are 88 county court judges now in office,
each having a circuit, which is either one court, or a group of courts, depending
on the amount of work to be done.
Generally speaking the jurisdiction of the county courts includes all civil
actions where the amount claimed is not more than £500 or where, in actions
for the recovery of land, the rateable value of the land is not more than
a year. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent
of the parties, or may be transferred to the High Court. In addition, recent
legislation provides that divorce proceedings may be started in county courts
designated as ‘divorce’ county courts. These courts are to have jurisdiction
to hear and determine undefended cases; defended cases are to be transferred
to the High Court. Some actions, in particular actions for libel and slander,
cannot be brought in the county court.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts
with somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the
medieval borough courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time,
but the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the
Mayor’s and City of London Court are still well used.
The High Court of Justice, which is divided into the Chancery Division, the
Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and the Queen’s Bench Division,
forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. Its jurisdiction is both original
and appellate, and covers virtually all civil causes and some criminal causes.
The Rules of Court (see p. 93) and the practice of the courts govern the distribu¬
tion of work among the Divisions. Although the rules do not give exclusive
jurisdiction in any matter to any one Division, in practice each Division has a
separate field of jurisdiction and the judges are attached to a particular Division.
The High Court is staffed by 62 puisne1 judges. The Lord Chancellor is,
in strict law, the president of the whole High Court (although, in practice,
he does not sit in any Division); he is also nominally head of the Chancery
Division, of which the Master of the Rolls2 is another nominal member; there

is a President for the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division; and the Lord
Chief Justice of England presides over the Queen’s Bench Division. For the
hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly. Appellate
jurisdiction is exercised either by divisional courts consisting of three (or
sometimes two) judges, sitting in one of the three Divisions of the High Court
or, in some cases, by a single judge.
Nearly all appeals from magistrates’ courts, ministerial decisions and the
decisions of judges sitting in Chambers1 are heard in the first instance in the
appropriate divisional court of the High Court,2 but all the more important
appeals in civil actions come before the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal,
which is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, and some (with leave of the
Court of Appeal or of the House of Lords) before the House of Lords, which
is the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases in the whole United Kingdom.
The Civil Division hears appeals from the High Court, the county courts
and assizes in civil cases. The Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and most of the
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are members of the court, but its effective head
is the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eleven Lords Justices of Appeal;
the Court sits in divisions, each with three judges.
The judges in the House of Lords are the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but often sit as a group of five, and some¬
times of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may sit. The president
is the Lord Chancellor.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved
person; no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is
required. The most common form of proceedings is an action commenced
by a writ served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant
that the plaintiff has a claim on him and states the nature of the claim. If the
defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance’ by informing
the court to this effect and documents setting out the precise question in
dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
Because civil proceedings are a private matter, they can at any time be
abandoned or compromised without leave of the court3 and, in fact, in the
great majority of cases, the parties to a dispute are able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that
are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, seduction,
or breach of promise to marry, when either party may insist on trial by jury,
or in a case of fraud, when the person charged may claim this right. In trials
where a jury is present, it is responsible for deciding questions of fact (as in
criminal trials) and also the amount of damages to be awarded to the injured party.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant to do something or to
abstain from doing something may result in imprisonment for contempt of

court. Arrest under an order of committal may be effected only on a warrant
of the court.
As a rule, the court awards the costs of an action (the barrister’s fees,
solicitor’s charges and essential disbursements) to the winning party, although
in practice he always pays part of them. In certain circumstances (for instance,
extravagance or negligence in the conduct of the case), the court may, in its
discretion, refuse to order that one party’s costs should be borne by the other.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, that is,
where proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury,
or under summary procedure, where the judge sits without a jury. All cases
in the High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court
are tried under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary
procedure in the more minor cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of
the peace and burgh (or police) courts.
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who
are serving (or have served) in the office of magistrate of the burgh. In
Glasgow stipendiary magistrates act as judges of two of the courts.
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges
being the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Any court of summary jurisdiction may sit as a juvenile court (see p. 102).
Special justice of the peace juvenile courts have been established in three
counties and in the city of Aberdeen.
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combina¬
tion of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff and a number of sheriffs-substitute who
act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts1 exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court:
the Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of
Session), the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 14 Lords Commissioner
of Justiciary who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the
court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in
other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment
may appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on an^
ground which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High
Court or upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a
fit case for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave
of the High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard
by three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
1 A comprehensive review of the sheriff courts including both their civil and criminal!
jurisdiction has been carried out by a departmental committee.

LAW AND ORDER
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petition with a view to
proceedings on indictment.
The police in Scotland have very broadly the same powers of arrest as have
the police in England and Wales. The Judges Rules do not apply in Scotland,
but when an accused person is arrested, he should be cautioned and have the
charge read over to him. Thereafter, only the accused’s voluntary statements
should be used in evidence at his trial, and the court will reject any statements
made by him unless it is satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, a person apprehended in Scotland must be
brought before the court competent to deal with his case with the least possible
delay. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated, the accused is
brought before a magistrate for judicial examination. The magistrate may
then commit the accused for trial or for further examination. Eight days may
elapse between commitment for further examination and commitment for
trial.
Persons in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may
be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction
of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or the police.
Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be accepted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail,
by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the
amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High
Court of Justiciary has power to release persons unlawfully detained and
accused persons must, in any event, be brought to trial within no days of
committal.
In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff
court, when the accused is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he
pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the
appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which is to be
dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a
High Court case it is continued to the second diet in the High Court for
disposal.
The second diet is held at least nine days after the pleading diet, either
before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without
opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for
the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return
a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in acquittal, or
they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds to deliver
sentence. The verdict may be by a majority of 8-7. Fairness to the accused
is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor exceptions, no person may be
convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses, or corroboration of
one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly implicate the accused
person in the crime.
At summary trials the accused is asked to plead to the charge at the first
calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the case.
Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a trial diet for a later date.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England
and Wales, and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court in
Scotland.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff-
substitute, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-
principal or directly to the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions
not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices of the peace.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being
presided over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord
Justice Clerk. From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
Civil
Proceedings
COURTS IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains he is
entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it.
In ordinary sheriff court actions ‘entering appearance’ is followed by the
‘tabling’ of the case, which involves a formal appearance in court. In summary
and small debt actions the defender is simply given notice of the date on
which the action will be heard. It is much more common in Scotland than in
England and Wales to have legal debates in court as to the competency or
relevancy of the written pleadings prior to the proof.
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial
case, at any time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement
of the proof or trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action
in Scotland is more common than in England and Wales, being the usual
form of procedure in actions for damages for personal injuries.
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller
community. The superior courts comprise the Supreme Court of Judicature
(consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal) and the
Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court is the superior court of first
instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench Division
(including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and the circuit
courts (assizes) and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as president,
and two judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, is
constituted of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). Courts of quarter sessions have been amalgamated with the
LAW AND ORDER

county courts, which now exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction and
are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are five (two of
them having the title of Recorder—of Belfast and of Londonderry). At least
four sittings of the court are held annually in each division. Petty sessions
courts are composed of one resident magistrate (who corresponds to a
stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except in some
specific cases, for instance in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate.
Juvenile courts are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members,
one of whom must be a woman.
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears
to have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the
cause is unknown, and in certain other circumstances.1 In such cases, it is
the duty of the local coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by county,
county borough, or certain borough councils) to hold an inquiry into how,
when, and where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this
purpose, and he must do so if he has reasonable cause to believe that the
deceased has died a violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in
circumstances for which an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must
be held. A jury must be summoned in certain cases, including those in which
there is reason to suspect that the death was due to murder, manslaughter,
or infanticide, or was caused by an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle
on the public highway. If the jury returns a verdict of murder, manslaughter
or infanticide by a particular person, the coroner must commit that person
for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest, but may order a post¬
mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and
may report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that
Crown Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
In Northern Ireland coroners are appointed by the Minister of Home
Affairs and must, on appointment, be either barristers-at-law of not less than
five years’ standing practising in Northern Ireland or practising solicitors of
the Supreme Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland of not less than five
years’ standing.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in
the social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
or with another body of persons or individual; consequently there has
been a substantial growth in the number of tribunals (there are over 2,000
in existence) and in the range of their activities during the past twenty years.
Their constitution follows a fairly general pattern: all, for instance, consist
of an uneven number of persons so that a majority decision can be reached;

members are usually appointed by the minister concerned with the subject
but other authorities (for instance, the Crown, the Lord Chancellor and the
Master of the Rolls) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases and
the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court of Session in
Scotland, makes appointments in all cases where a lawyer chairman or member
is required; and, with some exceptions, members of tribunals hold office for
a period specified in the warrant or instrument by which they are appointed.
Administrative tribunals may be broadly classified as follows:
1. those which have permanent members appointed for their special
knowledge, and a chairman who must be a lawyer of experience: for
instance, the Transport Tribunal, which has jurisdiction over British
Rail passengers’ fares within the London area and London Transport
road and rail fares and also hears appeals relating to road carriers’ licences
throughout Great Britain, and the Lands Tribunal, which has jurisdiction
in a variety of matters relating to the value of property;
2. those which are purely administrative: for instance, the Special Commis¬
sioners of Income Tax, who hear appeals on income tax matters from
the rulings of the Inland Revenue officials;
3. those which deal exclusively with matters of interest to one government
department or public authority: for instance, the Pensions Appeal
Tribunals, which hear appeals against the rejection by the Minister of
Social Security of war service pension claims; and
4. those which consist of ordinary people appointed by a minister to arbitrate
between individuals: for instance, the Rent Tribunals, which have
jurisdiction in the determination of rents of certain properties.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the
General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of The Law
Society, but these are entirely different in constitution from the statutory
tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Although there is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory
tribunals, the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958 and other Acts provide
for an appeal, at least on a point of law, from all the more important tribunals
to the High Court or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An appeal may
also lie to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown
or to an independent referee. An advisory body known as the Council on
Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of
State for Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over the tribunals and
reports on particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by
the Scottish committee of the Council.
Criminal The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board consists of a chairman of wide
Injuries legal experience and seven other legally qualified members appointed by the
Compensation Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
Board ^ Lord Chancellor. Its function is to entertain applications for ex gratia
payments of compensation, in certain circumstances, to victims of crimes of
violence in Great Britain or on a British vessel or aircraft. Compensation,
which is assessed on the basis of common law damages and, usually, takes the
form of a lump sum payment, amounts to approximately £900,000 a year.
Some 3,000 applications are received.

Courts Martial
ADMINISTRATION
OF JUSTICE
93
Courts martial have jurisdiction, under the Army Act and the Air Force Act
°f 1955 (as amended) and the Naval Discipline Act of 1957 (also as amended),
over serving members of the armed forces and, in certain circumstances, their
dependants and other civilians who accompany them outside the United
Kingdom. Courts martial may not deal with charges involving treason, murder,
manslaughter or rape, if the offence is committed in the United Kingdom.
Civil offences committed in the United Kingdom by members of the armed
forces are normally also dealt with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and members, all of whom
are serving officers) may be convened by any authorised officer. A judge
advocate is appointed to sit with the court in more serious cases brought under
the Army and Air Force Act (and at every trial brought under the Naval
Discipline Act) to advise upon law and procedure and, in the former case,
to sum up the evidence. The judge advocate is a civilian and a barrister
appointed by the Office of the Judge Advocate General in the case of the Army
and the Air Force or by the Judge Advocate of the Fleet in the case of the Navy.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. In England and
Wales, responsibility for the administration of the judicial system when it
does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with the Lord Chancellor
and partly with the Home Secretary; in Scotland it lies with the Secretary
of State. In England the Lord Chancellor is concerned with the composition
of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal procedure and
with everything relating to civil law, and the Home Secretary with criminal
law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the process of
trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown
the highest judicial appointments.
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the
appointment of the officers of the court (for instance, the masters, registrars
and clerks) is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the
hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is concerned with
legal procedure in that he is a member of the Rule Committee which makes
the rules of the Supreme Court, appoints the County Court Rule Committee
and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by it. He is concerned with
law reform in that he appoints the members of the Law Commission for
England and Wales, which is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of
high standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,
the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enact¬
ments, and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. The Com¬
mission submits to the Lord Chancellor programmes of reform which may
recommend their further examination by itself or by some other body,
such as a Royal Commission or the existing Law Reform Committee or
Criminal Law Revision Committee.1 The Lord Chancellor may also ask the

Commission to prepare draft Bills or to advise government departments. In
the course of its work the Commission has power to consider the legal systems
of other countries.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees (com¬
mittee of magistrates in inner London); but the local authorities, with
financial assistance from the Government, are responsible for meeting their
costs, and the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has
certain specific responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes,
approval of the appointment of justices’ clerks, and deciding disputes on
financial matters.
In Scotland the Secretary of State appoints the staff of the High Court
of Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the staffing and
general organisation of the sheriff courts. He is also responsible, jointly with the
Lord Advocate, for appointing the members of the Law Commission for
Scotland (which has functions similar to those of the English Law
Commission).
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts has been
reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by
the Crown and are removable only on an address of both Houses of that
Parliament. The Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts; the judges of the county court and resident magistrates of the
magistrates’ courts are appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests; of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached; and of the barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are
entrusted with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute.1
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and the Lords
Justices who are the judges of the Court of Appeal—are made on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister, while the Lord Chancellor recom¬
mends the appointment of the puisne judges, the county court judges
(except in Lancashire where they are recommended by the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster), the chairmen of quarter sessions, the recorders of
boroughs, and the metropolitan and other stipendiary magistrates. Justices
of the peace are appointed on behalf of the Crown by the Lord Chancellor,2
who is advised, as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant3 with the assistance

of a local advisory committee, and as to the boroughs by separate advisory
committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord
Justice Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies
with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible
for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
Judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor who, as
well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the Government
in power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges are normally
appointed from practising barristers, advocates or solicitors and neither their
training nor their career is in any way dictated by the State.
Once appointed, judges normally hold office for life or until statutory
retiring age. However, in certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of mis¬
conduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales may be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor. In
Scotland the Secretary of State may issue an order for the removal from
office of a sheriff-principal on a report prepared at his instance by the Lord
President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk, on the grounds
of inability, neglect of duty or misbehaviour, but this order is required to lie
before both Houses of Parliament for a period of four weeks and is subject to
annulment by a resolution of either House. A sheriff-substitute may similarly
be removed from office, but in his case no parliamentary procedure is
necessary.
In England and Wales all superior judges (other than the Lord Chancellor
wTho, as a Cabinet Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a
power of removal only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both
Houses of Parliament.1 Since 1701 only one such address has been moved
(against a judge convicted of misappropriation of funds, in 1830); and it can
be stated with confidence that Parliament would never use this means to
attempt to interfere with judicial independence. Similarly, although no court
in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act of
Parliament which had been legally promulgated and published it might,
through its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the
policy of the Government which introduced the Act. In such a case the
Government could try to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute
by new legislation. It would not be open to it to penalise the judge or to
try to influence the court in any other way.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to assizes or county quarter sessions,
or in a civil action, consists of 12 persons (except in county courts, where
juries consist of eight persons). In Scotland the jury consists of 15 persons
in criminal cases and 12 in civil cases and in Northern Ireland of 12 in criminal
and seven in civil cases. Most householders in Britain (men and women
alike) are liable for jury service if they are British subjects between the ages
of 21 and 60, but persons following certain occupations can claim exemption
and those convicted of certain serious offences are disqualified.
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
1 There is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High
Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.

for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the
jury have been sworn, they may not be subjected to interference of any kind.
It is an offence to threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman either before or
during a trial.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at fatal accident inquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors. A jury is also
required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether objects of gold
or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake
legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems sub¬
mitted through solicitors and conduct proceedings in the higher courts—
though certain functions are common to both.
A barrister in England is required to have reached an accepted educational
standard, to have passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of
Legal Education and to have become a member of one of the four Inns of
Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple.
A barrister with a substantial junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor
for a patent appointing him Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding known as ‘taking
silk’. Most higher judicial appointments are made from among barristers who
have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a barrister is
subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar; but disciplinary
powers are vested exclusively in the Senate of the Inns of Court.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organi¬
sation of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a
practising solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin
his professional career. The term of articles lasts for three or five years,
depending upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled
clerk must pass the necessary examinations held by The Law Society and,
unless he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is
generally required to attend a course of studies at a recognised law school.
Once a solicitor is qualified, he may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland a prospective advocate must show evidence of his general
scholarship (normally by holding an arts degree) and his knowledge of law
(normally by holding a law degree of a Scottish University). The conditions
applying for the admission of solicitors are broadly similar to those applying
in England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations are the
Faculty of Advocates and The Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources
have existed for centuries in some courts—to a limited extent in England and
Wales, and to a somewhat greater extent in Scotland.
Since 1949 in Great Britain and 1965 in Northern Ireland statutory schemes
for providing legal aid in civil matters have come into operation, until today
legal aid is available for nearly all types of civil proceedings in nearly all
LAW AND ORDER

Civil Cases

Criminal
Courts

courts of law. It is also available for oral legal advice and in certain circum¬
stances where the assistance of a lawyer is needed but which do not (or do not
yet) involve litigation.
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those in higher income and capital
groups. The majority of people are financially eligible for legal aid.
The legal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by The Law Society
under the general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. It is operated by 12 area
committees and a network of local committees composed of barristers and
solicitors (who may be paid a fee), with a salaried staff. The cost is met from
the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three sources: contributions from assisted
persons; costs recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from
the Exchequer.
Applicants for free legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds
for asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case
is then conducted in the ordinary way. Certain types of action, including
libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by The Law Society of
Scotland through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court
committee and 16 local committees. To obtain legal aid for litigation an
applicant is required to show ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of
Scottish law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House
of Lords from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court
of Session, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court and the sheriff courts and
in matters not involving litigation. Where litigation is not involved, the
applicant must show he has reasonable grounds for taking the proposed legal
action.
In Northern Ireland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Incorporated
Law Society of Northern Ireland under the general guidance of the Ministry
of Home Affairs. The scheme provides for legal aid in proceedings in the
Supreme Court, the county courts and in certain civil proceedings in
magistrates’ courts.
In the criminal courts in England and Wales free legal aid is, at present,1
provided by the granting of either a legal aid certificate which entitles the
recipient to the services of a solicitor (or, in the case of a preliminary inquiry
into a charge of murder, of a solicitor and counsel) in defending a charge
heard summarily or at committal proceedings in indictable cases, or a defence
certificate which provides both solicitor and counsel in a trial on indictment.
The granting of these certificates is in the discretion of the justices or judge
before whom the applicant is to be tried, except in the case of a person
committed for trial on a charge of murder, when a defence certificate must be
granted if the defendant has insufficient means.
In appeal cases at quarter sessions an appeal aid certificate may be granted
by a magistrates’ court or quarter sessions. The granting of legal aid for
appeals to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal rests with that
court which may also grant legal aid for the purposes of a further appeal to
the House of Lords.
1 Certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 designed to improve the effective¬
ness of legal aid take effect from 1st October 1968.
98
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Legal Advice
Penalties
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid
Fund. In the higher courts payments are made in the first instance out of
local authority funds and the cost is reimbursed by the central Government.
Legal aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland is available to all persons in
custody on their first appearance in the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff
courts and the special juvenile courts (see p. 88). Otherwise, it is granted for
proceedings in these courts at the discretion of the courts themselves except
in appeals, when the final decision whether or not it should be granted is in
the hands of the Supreme Court Committee of The Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland free legal aid is available in trials or indictments before
courts of assize and in county courts and in criminal proceedings before
magistrates’ courts. It is also available for appeals from magistrates’ courts to
the county court and in appeals from county courts and courts of assize to
the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal.
Oral advice on legal matters is available, both in England and Wales and in
Scotland, free of charge to persons in receipt of national assistance and at a
very reasonable cost, that is, at 2s. 6d. for an interview of up to 30 minutes,
to those of limited means. Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out
of the legal aid funds of the two countries. The scheme is administered by the
two Law Societies, which also run voluntary schemes (for a fee of £1) for
those who do not qualify for statutory assistance.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. In England
and Wales a Standing Advisory Council, appointed by the Home Secretary, is
responsible for exercising a continuous review of developments in the penal
system.
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a
fixed penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty (within maxima
prescribed by law) that it considers most suitable in the light of the circum¬
stances of the offence and the offender. In general, the courts have power to
impose either imprisonment or a fine for serious offences (both in certain
cases); while most minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the
alternative of imprisonment if the fine is not paid. Moreover, the court has
discretion to discharge an offender absolutely, to place him on probation;
to discharge him conditionally (that is, subject to the condition that he
commits no offence during a specified period not exceeding 12 months) in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland only; or to impose a ‘suspended’
sentence (that is, when passing a sentence of imprisonment of two years or
less, to have power to suspend its operation, subject to the good behaviour of
the offender, for a period of between one and three years). Summary courts,
when they consider sentencing a first offender to imprisonment, must be
satisfied that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate.
Special sentences of somewhat longer duration may be imposed on
persistent offenders.
In England and Wales no offender under the age of 17 years may be
sentenced to imprisonment. Offenders aged 17 and under 21 are not sentenced
LAW AND ORDER
Administrative
Authorities
99
to imprisonment for any period between six months1 and three years (unless they
are persistent offenders, in which case a sentence of imprisonment of 18 months
or more may be passed). In Scotland, no offender under 21 may be detained in
a prison. Methods of dealing with young offenders are described on pp. 102-5.
The automatic penalty for murder in Great Britain2 is imprisonment for
life—this sentence being also the maximum sentence that may be imposed
for a number of other serious offences. Anyone subject to such a sentence is
liable to be detained for the rest of his or her life but the Home Secretary (or
the Secretary of State for Scotland) may, if he thinks fit,3 release such a
prisoner on licence at any time subject to the proviso that, in murder cases,
the sentencing court may recommend a minimum period of detention, and
that the ministers should, before granting a licence, consult the Lord Chief
Justice in England and the Lord Justice General in Scotland (as the case may be)
and, if possible, the judge who presided at the trial. The period of detention
varies according to the circumstances of the particular case and the question of
whether the prisoner’s release would be likely to involve risk to the public.
In Northern Ireland the death penalty has been abolished except for two
categories of capital murder: murder of a constable or other person in the
service of the Crown in the course of duty involving enforcement of the
law, maintenance of law and order or the administration or advancement
of justice and murder done in the course of furtherance of any seditious
conspiracy or of the activities of an unlawful organisation.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is theminister generally responsible
for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical
and other information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing
the advantages and defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and
for bringing information about these methods to the attention of the courts.
He is specifically responsible for supervising the approved schools, for pro¬
moting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, maintaining
and managing prisons, borstal institutions, detention centres, remand centres
and attendance centres. Prison policy is carried out by the prison department
of the Home Office through the agency of the prison service which operates
under the direction of an inspector-general and includes all prison officers
up through the grade of governor to the senior officers at headquarters, and
members of particular professions, such as medical officers, chaplains and
social workers, with their own professional status.
The general supervision of penal institutions is the responsibility of visiting
committees or boards of visitors who must be appointed at every prison,
borstal institution, detention centre or remand centre, partly to ensure that
local interest in the administration of these establishments is preserved and
partly to provide some independent and unofficial check on the administration,
and particularly on the punishment, of inmates. For each prison to which
offenders may be committed directly by a court, a visiting committee of
justices of the peace is appointed by the various courts of quarter sessions in
1 Short-term sentences (less than six months) for young offenders will be replaced when
sufficient accommodation is available, by detention in a detention centre for between
three and six months.
2 The Act embodying this provision expires on 31st July 1970, unless both Houses of
Parliament pass resolutions extending it.
3 From 1st April 1968 on the recommendation of the Parole Board or the Parole Board
for Scotland. These boards, to be set up from 1st October 1967, will each consist of a
chairman and not less than four other members appointed by the appropriate Secretary
of State.

the area, in numbers fixed by the Home Secretary. For all other prisons and
for borstals, detention centres and remand centres a board of visitors is
appointed by the Home Secretary; not less than two members must be justices
of the peace.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. In Scotland the system is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland
of the Ministry for Home Affairs.
The Prison Rules state that ‘the purpose of the training and treatment of
convicted prisoners shall be to encourage and assist them to lead a good and
useful life’. To this end prisoners in England and Wales are classified into
groups, according to their record, character, potentialities and the risk they
present to security, and assigned, so far as circumstances permit, to the
establishment best suited to their needs. Untried prisoners are separated
from convicted prisoners and, as far as practicable, those under 21 are
separated from adults.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are
known as ‘local’ prisons; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which
may be open or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons.
To meet the need for additional accommodation caused by the rise in the
prison population and to facilitate the application of modern methods of
treatment and training an extensive programme for the construction of new
prisons and the modernisation of existing establishments has been embarked
upon. Since i960 the number of men’s prisons in England and Wales has
increased from 46 to 57 and a further 14, of which two are in the course of
building, are planned. To improve security, electronic and other devices are
being used at selected prisons, and a maximum security prison is to be built
in the Isle of Wight.
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to
imprisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their
sentence (one-fourth in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than
two years), provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days
(in Scotland, 30 days). From 1st April 1968, on the recommendation of the
Parole Board, long-term prisoners may be released on licence by the Home
Secretary after serving one-third of their sentence, subject to a minimum
period of 12 months. The Home Secretary or, in Scotland, the Secretary of
State for Scotland may also release a life prisoner on licence (see p. 99). All
prisoners become entitled to certain personal privileges at successive stages
in their sentence.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the prison governor, the visiting
committee or the board of visitors have power to order, among other penalties,
forfeiture of remission (postponement of eligibility for release) and forfeiture
of privileges.
In prison training, efforts are being made to provide (1) work of a type likely
to help fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training
in skilled trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities, and
(3) opportunities for the development of a sense of personal responsibility,
including (for suitable prisoners) training in open conditions.
The policy on employment in prisons is based on the principle laid down by
the Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners (appointed by the
Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Scotland) that prisoners should

Welfare and
After-Care
be employed for a full working week in productive work similar to that found
in modern industry and organised on an up-to-date basis. Except in general
local prisons in England and Wales, where the hours are shorter, most
prisoners spend about 40 hours a week in the prison workshops or in other
employment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening in the
prison precincts. A number of prisoners are employed outside the prisons on
various types of (mainly agricultural) work.
In England, Wales, and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do, and good work is rewarded by payments above the minimum;
in Northern Ireland there is a progressive system of earnings, which is not
related to output nor to wrork done.
Specially selected prisoners, amongst those sentenced to long-term imprison¬
ment, are allowed to work in ordinary civilian jobs outside prison during the
months immediately preceding their discharge. These prisoners, some of
whom live in prison hostels, are paid normal wages from which they support
their families and meet their own expenses.
Educational arrangements are made in prisons in England, Wales and Scotland
by local education authorities, advice being given by the government depart¬
ments responsible for education in their respective countries. The local
educational authorities are fully reimbursed for their services v/hich, in England
and Wales, consist of supplying a tutor organiser and most of the teachers. A
wide choice of evening classes and correspondence courses is available, and
prisoners are encouraged, if they show ability, to acquire recognised qualifica¬
tions. Vocational training courses and other educational facilities, such as
physical training, concerts, plays, films, lectures and group discussions, are
arranged separately. Prisoners also use the prison libraries which depend largely
upon the local public libraries for their stocks. Education in prisons in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers whose
duties include not only the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, but also the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
A few prisons and borstals have their own psychiatric clinics (with qualified
medical staff, visiting psychotherapists and psychiatric social workers) to
which inmates may be transferred where necessary. In England and Wales
there is one psychiatric prison, with accommodation for some 350 people,
and a prison psychological service, whose officers are employed to assist
governors and medical officers in their work of examining and classifying
prisoners, and to advise on methods of training. The hospital facilities of
the National Health Service (see Chapter 5) are also available for the treatment
of prisoners in appropriate cases. Arrangements may be made, where
necessary, for prisoners to receive treatment after release.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole, and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to the resident welfare officers, who are probation officers seconded by
the probation and after-care service. The function of these officers is to
help the prisoner in his relationships with individuals and organisations outside
the prison, and to concern themselves with making plans for the prisoner’s
after-care, working closely in this connection with colleagues in the probation
and after-care service and with other agencies in the community whose help
the prisoner or his family may need either during sentence or after release.

a Roman Catholic priest and a minister of the Methodist Church are appointed
to every prison. Ministers of other denominations are either appointed or
specially called in as required. Regular services are held and religious instruc¬
tion given. Chaplains not only visit every prisoner soon after reception,
shortly before release and regularly during the sentence, but they also pay
daily visits to all prisoners who are sick or undergoing cellular confinement
and any others who apply to see them.
While in custody prisoners may write and receive letters regularly and may
be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals. They may also
receive visits from prison visitors specially appointed for the purpose. The
voluntary work of prison visitors in England and Wales is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
In England and Wales pre-release courses, at which experts hold open
forum with prisoners nearing their release on the domestic, social and
industrial problems with which they are likely to be faced, are conducted
at all prisons. Home leave, allowing five clear days at home, is extensively
granted to many categories of prisoners with sentences of two years or over
towards the end of their sentences to enable them to make family adjustments
and contacts with potential employers.
In England and Wales statutory supervision applies to certain prisoners
released from long-term imprisonment, to young prisoners and to young
persons discharged from borstals and detention centres. The sanctions for
failure to observe the conditions of supervision are recall to prison, borstal or
detention centre. Statutory supervision is carried out by probation officers
of the probation and after-care service, to which prisoners, not subject to
compulsory supervision, may also apply for help.
In Scotland after-care duties are likewise carried out by probation and
after-care officers.
In Northern Ireland the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the
discharged prisoners’ aid societies and probation officers.
In England and Wales the Government has presented provisional proposals
for taking children under 16 out of the ambit of the criminal courts and for
separating the arrangements for the trial and treatment of young people in
the 16 to 2i age group from the adult criminal courts and the adult penal
system. At present, a child under the age of ten cannot be charged with an
offence; between ten and 16 years old, a child charged with an offence other
than homicide, must be dealt with in a juvenile court unless charged jointly
with an adult; while a young person (that is, one between 14 and 17 years of
age) charged with an indictable offence may be dealt with summarily (as is
usually the case) or committed for trial by jury.
In Scotland, a recommendation that young offenders under 16 should be
dealt with outside the criminal courts by specially constituted juvenile panels
has been accepted by the Government and suggestions have been put forward
in a White Paper, Social Work and the Community (see Bibliography p. 495),
for the creation of these panels and of a new professional social work service
to support them. At present, all children and young persons between eight
and 17 years of age who are charged with offences must be dealt with in
juvenile courts, unless they have been charged in conjunction with adult
offenders or are proceeded against on indictment.
In Northern Ireland, likewise, a child or young person between the ages
of eight and 17 is normally dealt with by a juvenile court unless charged
jointly with an adult or committed for trial by jury in the case of an indictable

offence. Such committal may take place at the request of the accused’s parents
or at the discretion of the juvenile court.
Methods of treatment available in law for dealing with children and young
persons found guilty of committing an offence include: absolute discharge;
conditional discharge (in England and Wales and Northern Ireland); fines
imposed upon the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents;
probation; committal to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate
local authority) until the age of 18; or committal to an approved school.
Offenders aged not less than 10 and under 21 years may be ordered to attend
an attendance centre; aged not less than 14 and under 21, they may be detained
in a detention centre; aged not less than 15 and under 21 (not less than 16 and
under 21 in Northern Ireland), they may be sent for a period of borstal
training, and aged not less than 17 and under 21 they may be given a prison
sentence ranging from up to six months to three years or more. In Scotland
offenders of 17 and under 21 found unsuitable for detention centre or borstal
training may be detained in a young offenders’ institution.
In England, Wales and Scotland remand homes are provided by local
authorities for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their
appearance in court, or between court appearances (while inquiries are
made as to the best method of treatment for them), while they are awaiting
vacancies in approved schools, or for a short period (up to a month) of punitive
detention. In Northern Ireland the responsibility for providing or arranging
for the provision of remand homes rests with the Ministry of Home Affairs.
In addition to remand homes, remand centres are being established in
England and Wales (and are planned for Scotland), to which a court may send
young persons aged 17 and under 21 who would otherwise be remanded to
prison, and those under 17 who are unsuitable for remand homes.
1 he system of remand offers valuable opportunities for the observation
of any young offender on whose physical or mental condition a medical
report may be desirable to help the court in deciding the most suitable method
of dealing with the case.
Approved schools are boarding schools for boys and girls under the age of
17 who, the courts consider, need not only removal from home but also a
fairly long period of residential training. Boys and girls may be sent to
approved schools because they have committed an offence or are in need of
care or protection or on certain other grounds not involving the commission
of an offence. The schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organisations concerned with the welfare of children and young people on a
national scale, or by local committees formed by people interested in such
work. In England and Wales the schools must be approved by the Home
Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in
Northern Ireland, where they are known as training schools, by the Ministry
of Home Affairs.
The schools, which are for boys only or for girls only, are classified according
to age on admission, and within each age group there are separate schools for
Roman Catholic children. Assignment to a school in the appropriate age group
is determined by such considerations as the location of the school in relation
to the home, the type of training provided, and the probable reaction of a child
or young person to the individual personalities of the staff.
A child under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal
may be kept in an approved school until the age of 15 years and 4 months;
if he is more than 12 years and 4 months he may be kept in the school for

three years from the date of committal or until he reaches the age of 19, which¬
ever is the shorter period. The upper age limit may be extended to 19! in
certain circumstances, and the period of detention of an absconder is length¬
ened by any period spent unlawfully absent from the school.
The primary object of approved school training is the readjustment of boys
and girls for their return to the community, and contact with their homes is
maintained while they are in the schools. Managers of approved schools are
under an obligation to review the individual progress of the children in their
care with a view to releasing them as soon as they have made sufficient progress
in their training. After release children remain under the care and supervision
of the managers for two years or until they reach the age of 21, whichever is
the earlier.
Over 50 attendance centres have been established in England and Wales
to deal with boys between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for
which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment is
designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them
some instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must
do so during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may
be required to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for a
total of not less than 12 hours (with certain exceptions) and not more than
24. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts, or a lecture
(for example, on first aid) and a period of physical training or disciplinary
tasks under supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys
to join a youth club or other suitable organisation.
There are also two centres for youths aged 17 and under 21, which operate
on lines similar to those adopted at the juvenile centres, but the activities are
adapted to meet the needs of the older age group.
Detention centres provide a means of treating young offenders for whom a
long period of residential training in an approved school or borstal does not
seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such measures
as fines or probation. In England and Wales junior centres are available for
boys of not less than 14 and under 17, and senior centres for boys aged
17 and under 21. One centre is also available for girls of 16 and under 21.
In Scotland there are two senior centres. Detention in England and Wales
may be for not less than three and not more than six months; if consecutive
sentences are passed, the total term may not exceed nine months at any
one time. Remission of up to one-sixth of the sentence may be earned for good
conduct. In Scotland the fixed period for all detention centre sentences is three
months.
As the intention is primarily deterrent, the life of a centre is strict and
vigorous, demanding a brisk tempo and the highest possible standard of
discipline and behaviour in every aspect of training. The keynote is positive
training in a routine which provides a normal working week of 44 hours,
including one hour daily devoted to physical training. Boys of compulsory
school age have day-time and evening classes, and further education is
provided for others in the evenings. Statutory supervision for up to 12 months
of young persons discharged from detention centres is undertaken by probation
officers.
The borstal training system consists of different borstals specialising in
different types of young offender, classified according to such criteria as age,
intelligence and criminal sophistication. There are also a few borstals for
special purposes, such as allocation or recall. In England and Wales the

period of detention ranges from six months to two years and is followed
by supervision for two years from the date of release. In Scotland, where
there is no minimum period of detention, the maximum is two years and the
supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution.
Sentences in Northern Ireland are for periods not exceeding three years
including the period under supervision; normally release does not take place
until at least nine months of the sentence has expired. The system is essentially
remedial and educational, based on personal training by a carefully selected
staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is
much freedom of movement and many borstals are open establishments.
An initial period of classification ensures that each young offender is sent to
the institution best suited to his or her requirements.
\ oung prisoners’ centres, which provide special training suited to the age and
character of the offenders, are provided for those under 21, who are sentenced
to imprisonment. On release, the offenders who have served sentences of
three months or more are subject to supervision under licence for a period
equal to the amount of remission earned on the full sentence, subject to a
minimum of six months. Remission is granted at the normal rate of one-third.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation officer,
whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature of the
service is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before making a
probation order, the court must explain its effects and make sure that the
probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the requirements of
the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the original offence. A probation
order cannot be made without the consent of the person concerned unless
(in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only) he is under 14 years of age.
The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the
probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It
may also require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to treatment for
his mental condition. A probation order is made for not less than one year and
not more than three years.
The services of probation officers are available to every criminal court. In
England and Wales the appointment of probation officers is the responsibility
of probation committees composed of justices and in Scotland of probation
committees composed of ex officio members and members appointed by the
local authorities, but first appointments are subject to confirmation by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively. In
Northern Ireland the Ministry of Home Affairs appoints probation officers.
Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on
the advice of the Advisory Council for Probation and After-Care and are made
available by arrangement to Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland training is
mainly provided during the first year of appointment and before the officer
enters on the duties of the service.
Criminological research, particularly research directed to the question of the
treatment of offenders, continues to expand. Most of it is financed by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department by means of
grants amounting to about £100,000 a year, although a certain number of
research grants are also made by charitable foundations. Much of the work is
undertaken by the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge University, which
also provides a postgraduate course in criminology, and courses in criminology

for people engaged in work relating to the treatment of offenders or the
administration of criminal law. Other academic bodies now providing courses
in criminology for students and carrying out research in this field include the
universities of Durham, Reading, Oxford, Manchester and Southampton;
the London School of Economics, and University College in the University
of London; and the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Strathclyde in
Scotland.
The Home Office Research Unit, which also serves the Scottish Home and
Health Department, carries out a large programme of research of its own,
concentrating mainly on projects of direct interest to the home departments,
the results of which are given practical effect in administrative policy and
legislation. The unit also plays a central part in the allocation of Home Office
grants for research, and in the provision of technical advice, information and
facilities for other research workers in this field.
In addition to research, special inquiries into particular questions are con¬
ducted, as necessary, by advisory bodies or specially appointed committees.
Reports have been issued on such matters as corporal punishment, the non-
residential treatment of offenders under 21 years, and the organisation of
after-care for discharged prisoners.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a number of large forces
linked with local government and subject to the influence and eventual control
of the Home Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for
Scotland in Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force is controlled by an
Inspector General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
During the past year, a number of police forces in Great Britain have
amalgamated as part of a nation-wide reorganisation of the police service,
which is not yet complete. At present, there are 91 regular police forces in
England and Wales and 20 in Scotland. Each police force is responsible for
a separate police area, but there is constant co-operation between them.
In England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of responsi¬
bility as: county forces (22); county borough forces (45); combined forces (22),
which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over two or more counties
or county boroughs; the Metropolitan Police Force, which is responsible for
an area of approximately 15 miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding
the City of London; and the City of London force. In Scotland there are
county forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales the size of police forces depends on the area and
population which they serve. Outside Greater London, present forces range
in strength from about 4,000 to 120; when the amalgamation programme is
complete the majority will be in the range of 1,000 to 1,200. The Metropolitan
Police Force numbers some 25,000. In Scotland forces range in strength from
about 100 to 3,000.
The actual strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approxi¬
mately 90,000, including women. This is below the desirable figure, but the
improvement in recruitment shown in recent years has been maintained.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are the police forces
maintained by certain public services, such as the statutory transport

Police
Authorities
and Chief
Constables

Authority

authorities, the Service and departmental constabularies, and the special
constabularies attached to each regular police force.
For each of the regular police forces there is a police authority with the duty
of securing the maintenance of an adequate and efficient force. In the counties
of England and Wales the authority is a police committee and in the county
boroughs a watch committee. Both are committees of the local council and
consist of councillors and justices in a proportion of two to one. Combined
police authorities, which also consist of councillors and justices, contain
representatives from each constituent area covered by an amalgamation
scheme.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the police
authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all
police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county council; in
the large burghs it is the town council; and where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
Police authorities are required to secure the maintenance of an adequate
and efficient police force for the area. Subject to the approval of the Home
Secretary or Secretary of State for Scotland they appoint the chief constable
and the deputy and assistant chief constables in their area, and fix the
authorised establishment. They may also retire the chief constable in the
interests of efficiency, if the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for
Scotland agrees, and must keep themselves informed of the way in which
chief constables deal with complaints from the public against police officers.
In addition, police authorities, with the consent of the Secretary of State,
provide the buildings and equipment needed for their forces. In the Metro¬
politan Police District the chief officer of police and his immediate subordinates
are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police
forces, but are answerable to the police authorities for the efficiency with
which they are used.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have a general
duty to exercise their powers to promote the efficiency of the police. They
are empowered to require a police authority to retire a chief constable in the
interests of efficiency, to call for a report from a chief constable on any matters
relating to the policing of his area, and to cause a local inquiry to be held
into any police matter.
Uniformity in the conditions of service and in the administration of the
police is achieved through detailed police regulations which are made by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland under statutory
powers. The police regulations cover such matters as ranks; the qualifications
for appointment and promotion; probationary service; retirement; discipline;
hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and the issue and use of clothing
and personal equipment. Some of these are first negotiable on the Police
Council for Great Britain; the others are discussed on representative advisory
bodies along with any general questions affecting the police service.
The Home Secretary is advised on all matters concerning police efficiency
by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and a number of
inspectors, of whom one acts as the Commandant of the Police College and
one is in charge of the Police Research and Planning Branch at the Home

Police Cadets
Civilian Staff
Office. Other inspectors are responsible for a certain number of forces, and
must be satisfied of their continuing efficiency through annual inspection,
ad hoc visits and consultations when particular problems arise. The inspectors
report to the Home Secretary on the condition of all the forces, with the
exception of the Metropolitan Police Force. The Secretary of State for
Scotland is similarly assisted by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary
in Scotland and one other inspector.
All police authorities receive a government grant equal to half their net
expenditure except the Common Council of the City of London, which
receives one-third. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scot¬
land are empowered to withhold the grant, in whole or in part, permanently
or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police
area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
There are in Great Britain regular police officers, who usually serve for
25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension, and special constables, who
are volunteers performing short periods of duty without pay in their spare
time from their normal occupations. In Scotland the employment of special
constables, other than in emergencies, is subject to strict limitations.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the
ages of 19 and 30. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between
the ages of 19 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and 30 years old. Men
over 30 years old, and women over 35, may, however, be appointed on the
recommendation of the appointing authority in special circumstances approved
by the Home Secretary in England and Wales. In Scotland the Secretary of
State may approve appointments of both men and women over 30 years old.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and
constable. Intermediate ranks may also be adopted in areas where varying
degrees of responsibility make them necessary. In the Metropolitan Police
District the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners.
Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders; the other ranks
are the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are
the same as in the provinces, except that the chief officer is the Commissioner
of Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own representative associations which can make representations to
ministers or to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their
members.
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among boys between 16 and
18 years of age. They have no police powers but are given some training in
police work, partly as useful preparation for subsequent appointment as
constables and partly to give them sufficient insight into police duties to
enable them to decide whether or not they wish to make a career in the police
service. Some forces also recruit girl cadets.
A number of police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switch¬
board operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release
uniformed personnel for police duties.

Traffic wardens are employed in a growing number of areas to help the
police in dealing with the problems created by parked vehicles and in the
control and regulation of traffic. In specially designated areas traffic wardens
issue fixed penalty tickets which give motorists who have committed certain
parking offences an option to pay their fine to the clerk of the appropriate
court instead of having their cases tried. A county or county borough council
(or by agreement a police authority) may also employ school-crossing patrols.
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public
office. His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common
law, are exercised by virtue of his office; he is not a servant of the police
authority. Chief officers of police in England and Wales have a vicarious
liability for any wrongful act committed by their subordinates in the
performance of their functions as constables.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from
the protection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic
control to criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.
All police forces have their own criminal investigation departments, and
many have other specialised departments, including motor patrols, river police
(in districts which include long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted
branch (for maintaining order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
During recent years a number of common services have been provided by
the central government departments for the benefit of all forces; they
supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use and
by communal arrangements made between the forces themselves. The most
important of these services are: training services, which in England and Wales
provide ten residential training centres and a central police college and in
Scotland a central police college with courses of recruit training and higher
training; a forensic science service in England and Wales which provides
nine laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory) for the
use of regional groups of forces; regional wireless services and wireless depots,
which in England and Wales supply and maintain wireless equipment for the
police; and central and provincial criminal records which are available to all
forces. Regional crime squads, consisting of teams of experienced detectives
from several forces, are employed to investigate major crimes involving
inquiries in more than one police area. Arrangements are also made for
everyday assistance by one force to another.
The Home Office Police Research and Planning Branch, headed by one of
Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary and staffed by senior police officers
and scientists, is charged with the planning of police methods, the develop¬
ment of new equipment and the study of new techniques throughout Great
Britain. Its current programme covers various aspects of criminal investigation,
traffic policing, establishments (force strengths), recruitment and wastage in
the Service, vehicle replacement, the evaluation of equipment requirements,
and the application of computers to police work. A considerable amount of
the work in which the Branch is engaged involves the use of operational
research techniques.
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(1) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people

wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without
charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Com¬
monwealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the special
branch of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard,
whose duties include the physical protection of royalty, some ministers, and
distinguished foreign visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders
made by the courts. The Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on
request, to assist any other police force in England and Wales in criminal
investigations. Similarly, the services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by
the Metropolitan Police Force and the City of London Police, are available
throughout Great Britain for the investigation of serious company frauds.
The National Central Bureau, which handles the business of the International
Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) on behalf of Great Britain and the
British dependencies, is part of the Metropolitan Police Force. For certain
of these services, the Metropolitan Police Force receives an additional
Exchequer grant.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. It undertakes
the policing of the whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the
Northern Ireland Exchequer.
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 3,000. The
Inspector General has, under his immediate command, a deputy inspector
general, a commissioner for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector for
each of the six counties. The area is further sub-divided into districts, each
district coming under a district inspector and each sub-district under a head
constable or a sergeant. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the
lines of the police service in Great Britain, and the general duties pertaining
to the various ranks are much the same. Although the more senior ranks bear
different titles, the ranks of head constable, sergeant and constable are broadly
equivalent to the three junior ranks in the police service of Great Britain.
The Ulster Special Constabulary, which may assist the Royal Ulster
Constabulary on special occasions, also comes under the direction of the
Inspector General. In the main, this force is a part-time body of some 10,500
part-time members with a small nucleus (no) of full-time personnel for
organisation and training purposes.

Peace-keeping
and
Disarmament
Britain’s security depends above all on the prevention of war in Europe, and
for this reason Britain makes a substantial contribution to the forces of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In addition, Britain has a
political and economic interest in the stability of the world outside Europe,
and accordingly retains a capacity to contribute to the maintenance of peace
where this can usefully be done by British forces. Britain belongs to the
Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the South East Asia Treaty
Organisation (SEATO), which involves certain defence responsibilities in the
Middle and Far East; has defence obligations under various bilateral and
multilateral agreements; and is ultimately responsible for the defence and
internal security of British dependencies overseas.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided by the
Government in an annual Statement on the Defence Estimates. In 1967, the
usual statement (Cmnd. 3203) issued in February was followed in July by a
Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy (Cmnd. 3357) marking the end of a
three-year major policy review. Defence policy can never be static; this chapter
describes the position in July 1967.
It is Britain’s policy not to undertake major operations of war except in
co-operation with allies; not to attempt to maintain defence facilities in an
independent country against its wishes; and to make military commitments to
other countries dependent on receiving in time the facilities necessary to
ensure that such military support is effective. Outside Europe Britain aims to
foster developments which will enable the local peoples to live at peace without
the presence of external forces. Defence policy provides for closely integrated,
well-equipped and trained, highly-mobile regular forces, including a strategic
reserve maintained in Britain and able to move rapidly by air to any part of
the world.
In order to keep defence costs within the country’s resources, the British
Government has carried out a major review of defence policy resulting in
decisions which are expected to keep the future annual cost of defence below
£2,000 million at 1964 prices. The defence estimates for 1967-68 of £2,205
million were equivalent, at 1964 prices, to £1,927 million.
Foreign exchange costs arising from the stationing of British troops abroad,
including those in Germany, were estimated at £293 million in 1966-67, thus
constituting, as in previous years, a heavy burden upon Britain’s balance of
payments. It is aimed to achieve, by the end of 1967-68, an annual rate of net
overseas expenditure about £75 million below that estimated for 1966-67,
without allowing for any further reductions in expenditure on British forces
in Germany that may be arranged. Foreign exchange costs in Germany for
1967-68 will be covered by offset arrangements to the extent of some 90 per
cent.
The British Government believes that, in the long term, the security of all
countries would be best assured by developing systems of arms control and
disarmament and by strengthening the peace-keeping capacities of the
United Nations, and is working to achieve these ends. Britain has signed,

and strongly supports, the 1963 ban on nuclear tests in the atmosphere,
under water and in outer space, and the treaty agreed in 1967 excluding
weapons of mass destruction from outer space and reserving celestial bodies
for peaceful uses.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister
and the Cabinet, under the ultimate control of Parliament. Defence problems
and their implications for foreign and economic policy are dealt with on
the Cabinet’s behalf by the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy,
under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The formulation of defence
policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence (see
P- 52).
Command and administration of the armed forces is vested in the Defence
Council, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The members of
the Defence Council are the two Ministers of Defence, the three Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State, the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chiefs of
Staff, the Chief Adviser (Projects), who is professional head of the Ministry
of Defence scientific staff, and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.
The Defence Council deals mainly with major defence policy. The
principal military advisers to the Government are the members of the
Chiefs of Staff Committee, which comprises the Chief of the Defence Staff
as chairman and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services. The Com¬
mittee is responsible to the Government for professional advice on
strategy and military operations and on the military implications of defence
policy.
The management of the three Services is delegated to Admiralty, Army and
Air Force Boards of the Defence Council, of each of which the Secretary of
State is chairman, although the appropriate Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State normally acts for him. Unified control of policy and management has
made possible further rationalisation of Service administration and operation
and improving the work of the whole structure of defence organisation is
continuing.
The Royal Navy has nine specialist branches: Seaman, Communications,
Engineering, Fleet Air Arm, Electrical, Supply and Secretariat, Medical,
Shipwrights and the Regulating Branch.
The Corps of the Royal Marines, which is part of the Royal Navy, is a body
of men trained for service on sea or land. Its official existence dates from
1664. The present-day functions of the corps are: to provide personnel for
Commandos; to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other
parties required for amphibious assault; and to supply for Her Majesty’s ships
detachments which take part in the routine duties, including guard duty, and
provide emergency landing parties.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry Regi¬
ments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the
Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides land

and wireless communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Brigade
of Guards), the Infantry of the Line (to be regrouped into divisions), the Army
Air Corps (which operates light aircraft on reconnaissance and undertakes
aerial observations and liaison work), the Royal Corps of Transport (which
operates all types of logistic vehicles from locomotives to aircraft), the Royal
Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (responsible for most
equipment and stores), and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers
(responsible for most repairs).
The specialist branches of the Royal Air Force are the eight Home
Commands (see below).
The three women’s services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(WRAF), are integral parts of the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively.
Servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing
services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service,
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal
Air Force Nursing Service.
Operational control of the Forces in the Persian Gulf and Far East is exercised
through Unified Command Headquarters in Bahrain (seep. 116) and Singapore
respectively by a single commander, who may belong to any one of the three
Services; he is supported by an inter-Service staff co-ordinated by a Chief
of Staff. These arrangements are one of the most important features of the
increasing unity of the Services.
The structure of the home commands is being radically altered in order
to bring the bulk of combat forces in Britain under a single major front-line
command in each Service. Meanwhile the home and overseas commands of
the Services are:
Portsmouth, Plymouth, Scotland (Rosyth) and Northern Ireland, and the
Commander-in-Chief, Western Fleet. British naval forces in the North
Atlantic and Mediterranean area are assigned to NATO. Naval command in
the Middle East rests with the Flag Officer, Middle East, and in the Far East
with the Commander, Far East Fleet. Smaller naval forces operate under the
Senior Naval Officer, West Indies Station.
Eastern, Northern, Northern Ireland, Scottish, Southern and Western
Commands. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR, assigned to NATO);
Gibraltar; Malta; Near East Land Forces; Land Forces Gulf; and Far East
Land Forces. In April 1968 all field force formations and units in Britain,
apart from those earmarked for assignment to NATO or employed on
public duties and training, are to be brought under a new Army Strategic
Command.
Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport (from August 1967, Air Support
Command), Flying Training, Technical Training, Maintenance and Signals
Commands; Royal Air Force, Germany (Second Tactical Air Force, assigned
to NATO); Near East Air Force; Air Forces, Middle East; Far East Air
Force. From April 1968, Bomber and Fighter Commands will be merged
into a new Strike Command. Flying Training and Technical Training
Commands are to be amalgamated into a single Training Command from
1st June 1968.

Entrants to the non-commissioned ranks of the three Services are given
basic training, and further training is given during the course of their careers.
Young servicemen have the opportunity to read for the General Certificate of
Education ‘O’ level (see pp. 158-9). Trade and technical training, though
primarily designed for Service purposes, leads in many cases to nationally
recognised qualifications; completion of many Service trade or technical
courses followed by experience is recognised by trade unions as a qualification
for membership by men who have left the Services.
Commissions may be granted for short, medium or long terms. Promotion
from the non-commissioned ranks is possible in all three Services. In the
Royal Navy and the Army the normal method of entry is through cadetship
in the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, or the Royal Military
Academy, Sandhurst. This is followed by specialist training which may include
degree courses. The RAF trains cadets for long-term commissions at the
RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire, but the majority of entrants to the
flying and executive branches take Direct Entry Commissions (of medium
length). There is special provision in all three Services for the entry of men
with appropriate qualifications including doctors, dentists and other
graduates. A Royal Defence Academy is being set up to provide higher educa¬
tion for men from all three Services. It will comprise a Royal Defence College
together with the three existing Service technical colleges.
Selected officers of all three Services who have had previous staff training or
have been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army
Staff College at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff Colleges at
Bracknell (Berkshire) or Andover (Hampshire) go to the Joint Services Staff
College at Chesham (Buckinghamshire), where particular attention is paid to
the inter-Service aspects of staff work. A few specially selected and more
senior officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and from other Common¬
wealth countries are sent to the Imperial Defence College in London.
Considerable training is done through joint-Service and inter-allied exercises,
on which increasing emphasis is being placed. Inter-allied exercises take
place under the auspices of the three regional alliances.

The Regular Reserve consists of various categories of former full-time officers
and ratings liable to recall in emergency. The Voluntary Reserves comprise
the Royal Marine Reserve (with its associated women’s reserve) and the
Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve, and carry out part-time training.
The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, a civilian organisation composed of
men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for minewatching
duties around the coast and the waterways, and other duties.
Men who have completed the Colour portion of their service with the Regular
Army are retained on the Regular Reserve to complete a total engagement of
12 years; as such they are liable to recall to the Colours. Thereafter they are
transferred to the Long Term Reserve (LTR) where they remain until the age
of 45 and are liable to recall in an emergency.
The Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (T & AVR) comprises
categories I and II (the ‘Volunteers’), category III (the ‘Territorials’) and
section IV. Category I, together with individual volunteers from the Regular
Reserve and T & AVR II, is known as the Special Army Volunteer Reserve
(‘Ever Readies’), liable to be called out at any time at the discretion of the
Secretary of State for Defence. T & AVR I and II are liable for service with
the Regular Army when warlike operations are in preparation or progress.
T & AVR III is liable for recall for home defence only. T & AVR IV consists
of miscellaneous reservists not included in the other categories.
The Regular Reserve consists of former full-time officers and airmen, of whom
a few are detailed for specific tasks in emergency and the remainder have a
statutory liability for recall. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force, consisting of
three maritime headquarter units controlled by Coastal Command, and the
Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve are liable for part-time training and for
recall in an emergency. Auxiliary formations include the mainly civilian
Royal Observer Corps and the 18 University Air Squadrons (for information
about the Combined Cadet Force, see p. 174). The present strength of the
Royal Observer Corps is some 18,000 men and women whose principal task
would be the measuring and reporting of radioactivity in the event of nuclear
attack.
DEPLOYMENT
In January 1967 British and locally enlisted troops were deployed roughly as
follows:
Britain, 243,300; European continent, 63,460 (nearly all in Germany);
Mediterranean and Near East, 20,300; Middle and Far East, 72,650
(including Gurkhas); and elsewhere, 43,290 (mostly Royal Navy at sea).
Britain’s deployment of forces is summarised below:
Frigates, submarines and coastal minesweepers carry out training, trials and
fishery protection, and ships of all classes spend periods at home for refitting. All
ships at home have NATO commitments in the Channel or Eastern Atlantic.
The Army Strategic Reserve and certain other front line units and skeleton
headquarters are kept in readiness. There are also training and logistic units.
Air Force units are V-bomber, reconnaissance and tanker forces of Bomber
Command; air-defence forces of Fighter Command; strategic and tactical
transport and ground-attack squadrons of Transport Command; maritime

reconnaissance squadrons of Coastal Command and squadrons of the Royal
Air Force Regiment.
Britain has stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany an army corps of
three divisions—the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR)—with associated
troops and a tactical air force including light bomber, reconnaissance and
air-defence squadrons; also fighter reconnaissance aircraft and support
helicopters and a brigade in Berlin (which the NATO powers have agreed to
treat as part of the Atlantic Treaty area): giving a total force of some 63,000.
BAOR equipment includes, as tactical nuclear weapons, the Honest John
free-flight missile and the 8-inch howitzer.
Britain’s contribution to NATO includes the strategic nuclear V-bomber
force, all Fighter Command and nearly all Coastal Command, over three-
quarters of the Royal Navy’s operational and reserve fleets and all British
forces in Germany. The V-bomber force, in its strategic role, will be replaced
by the Polaris force (see pp. 117-8) as it becomes operational.
Facilities for a depot ship for United States Polaris submarines are provided
by Britain at Holy Loch on the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, while the Ballistic
Missile Early Warning Station built at Fylingdales Moor, Yorkshire, under
an Anglo-American agreement of i960 completes a chain of such stations
formed with Thule (Greenland) and Clear (Alaska).
Britain contributes toward the defence infra-structure of the CENTO area,
provides various military training facilities and keeps an RAF bomber force
in Cyprus for the defence of the region. Britain also supplies at its own expense
about 1,000 men for the United Nations Force in Cyprus (more than one-fifth
of the total) and provides logistic support for the force. Certain forces are
stationed in Malta under bilateral arrangements and there is a small garrison
in Gibraltar.
Destroyers, frigates and minesweepers are deployed in the Mediterranean
and are supplemented from time to time by other major naval units.
Middle East land forces numbered about 11,500 at the beginning of 1967,
mostly stationed in Aden and Bahrain. The Aden garrison is being run down
and is to be withdrawn as South Arabia becomes independent in 1968.
Forces in the Persian Gulf will be slightly increased.
Royal Navy frigates and coastal minesweepers have been operating in the
Persian Gulf and Aden area. A Royal Marine Commando was based in Aden
during 1967. East of Suez one aircraft carrier, one commando ship and one
assault ship have been operating as needed between the Far and Middle East
theatres.
Royal Air Force units stationed in Aden during 1967 included ground-
attack, fighter reconnaissance, tactical transport and maritime reconnaissance
aircraft, helicopters and a field squadron of the RAF Regiment. Units in
Bahrain and Sharjah comprised ground-attack aircraft, tactical transport and
communications aircraft.
In the SEATO area, Britain provides training facilities and, in particular, has
built an airfield in Thailand with the help of Australia and New Zealand.
In addition to ships mentioned in Middle East section above, there are many
destroyers (some with guided missiles), frigates, submarines, coastal mine¬
sweepers and support ships; two Royal Marine Commandos and two Royal
Marine special boat sections; and ships of the Royal Australian and Royal
New Zealand Navies, attached to the Fleet.

New Zealand Air Force.
Singapore provides bases for all three Services.
With the end of Indonesia’s campaign of ‘confrontation’ all British troops
were withdrawn from Eastern Malaysia and by the end of April 1967 troops
in Far East Command had been reduced to about 30,000. In October 1967
there is to begin a two-year run down of the Brigade of Gurkhas from 14,000 to
10,000 men.-A small garrison of Gurkhas is stationed in Brunei. A substantial
garrison, including a Gurkha brigade, remains in Hong Kong.
A small naval force, normally of frigates and sometimes carrying a Royal
Marine detachment, is stationed in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. There
is a small garrison in British Honduras. HMS Protector operates in the Falkland
Islands and Dependencies and the Antarctic during the period of the southern
summer.
Royal Navy submarines are based in Canada and Australia to assist in
anti-submarine training for the Royal Canadian and Royal Australian Navies.
COMBAT FORCES
Combat forces can be divided into six major groups, according to their functions
and corresponding equipment, as described below.
The nuclear strategic forces are the medium bomber force (V-bombers) of
Royal Air Force Bomber Command (together with their headquarters, bases
and control and support facilities), which are being progressively replaced by
the Polaris Fleet of the Royal Navy as it becomes operational. Their cost in
1967-68 is estimated at £104 million. Their role is to contribute to the
strategic nuclear deterrent forces of the West. To achieve this, the nuclear
forces must be seen to be able to inflict an unacceptable degree of damage upon
an aggressor.
Britain has assigned its strategic nuclear force to NATO, and has played a
leading role in discussions intended to devise means of ensuring that decisions
concerning the use of nuclear weapons by the Alliance be taken in accordance
with the wishes and interests of the Alliance as a whole.
The V-bomber force comprises Victor Bz squadrons and Vulcan Bz squadrons,
equipped with either Blue Steel stand-off bombs or free-fall weapons.
The effectiveness of the force has been increased by progressive improvements
to electronic equipment and nuclear weapons, and greater fuel capacity. A pro¬
portion of the force is always kept at readiness. In addition to their nuclear
strike role, V-bombers can carry conventional weapons and, in an emergency,
can be deployed rapidly for operations in other theatres.
The first Polaris submarines, Resolution and Renown, have been launched,
and Resolution will become operational during 1968. The force will ultimately
consist of four submarines, two of which will always be on patrol at a time.
Each submarine will carry 16 long-range missiles. Construction of the
submarine base on the Gareloch (north of the Clyde estuary) should be
completed in 1968. When the Polaris submarines come into service they will

take over the strategic role of the V-bombers, which will then be used to
supplement the FmK aircraft (see p. 121) in the strike role.
The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR and an independent
brigade in Berlin. Their role is to deter aggression in all its forms and to
fight if deterrence fails, in co-operation with NATO allies. Their cost in
1967-68 is estimated at £184 million.
The Chieftain main battle tank is succeeding the Centurion, and Conqueror has
been withdrawn from service. It incorporates many new features in protection
and mobility. Two armoured car regiments are equipped with the Vigilant
anti-tank guided weapon mounted on the Ferret scout car. Swing fire, a long-
range, guided, anti-tank weapon, will be introduced into certain units during
1968. The field artillery supporting the general war ground forces have received
several new weapons, including the British Abbot self-propelled 105 mm. gun
(which has good cross-country mobility, range, fire power and protection for
its crew) and the American self-propelled 155 mm. Mi09 and 175 mm. Mi07
guns. Missile regiments equipped with the Honest John free-flight rocket and
the 8-inch howitzer provide surface-to-surface tactical nuclear support for the
ground forces. The new tracked armoured personnel carrier is increasing the
mobility and protection of the infantry, who are also being provided with
improved chemical and nuclear defensive equipment. Carl Gustav anti-tank
weapons have been made available to infantry sections. A semi-automatic
multi-channel trunk system for communications in the combat area is being
introduced in BAOR.
The naval general purpose combat forces are the ships of the Fleet1 II other than
the Polaris submarines; the Fleet Air Arm (aircraft carriers, naval aircraft,
air personnel and shore naval air establishments); the Royal Marine Com¬
mandos ; and support ships and overseas bases, dockyards and supply depots.
Their role is to help to keep the peace and to protect and further trade and
other British interests; in an emergency to be ready to safeguard the use of
the sea and to support the Army; and to make an effective contribution to
the forces of NATO, CENTO and SEATO. Their cost in 1967-68 is estimated
at ^291 million.
The two commando ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, the two assault
ships HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid, and the Royal Marine Commandos
are the amphibious forces. Commando ships are equipped with Wessex Mark 5
helicopters and landing craft. In the commando troop-carrying role, the
Wessex is armed with the SS 11, a French anti-tank guided missile. The
United States Sioux helicopters are coming into service.
Assault ships are also equipped to operate helicopters. A Landing Force
Headquarters can exercise command control from the ship until it takes up
position ashore. The ships can land troops with supporting arms and transport
and the landing craft, operating from a dock space at the stern of the ship, can
unload tanks, vehicles, equipment and stores across open beaches.
The aircraft carriers HMS Ark Royal and HMS Eagle are to continue in
service until the middle 1970s, while it is planned to phase out HMS Victorious
I In 1967 the following ships of the Fleet were operational, preparing for service, or
engaged on trials and training: 3 aircraft carriers, 2 commando ships, 2 assault ships,
6 guided-missile destroyers, 14 other destroyers, 51 frigates, 37 submarines, 56 mine¬
sweepers, and an ice patrol ship. In addition the following were in reserve or undergoing
long refit, conversion, etc.: 2 aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers, 2 destroyers, 20 frigates,
II submarines and 31 minesweepers.

in 1969 and HMS Hermes in 1971. The carriers are equipped with the angled
tiight deck, the steam catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device for the
catapult and the projector sight (all British inventions), and the ‘Audio’ landing
aid. HMS Eagle also has Action Data Automation (ADA) giving command
and control facilities in advance of any system at present known. The main
strike and fighter strength is provided by the Buccaneer and Sea Vixen aircraft
both fitted with the United States Bullpup air-to-surface guided missile. The
Buccaneer Mark 2 is a long-range low-level strike aircraft with an advanced
weapon system. The Sea Vixen Mark 2 carries air-to-air missiles Firestreak
f°r use against high-flying and supersonic targets. Eventually
the United States Phantom, powered by Rolls-Royce Spey engines, will
replace the Sea Vixen, and the first unit of Phantoms will be formed during
1968. The Whirlwind Mark 9 helicopter is in service for search and rescue
duties and the Wessex Mark 1 and the Wasp for anti-submarine work.
The still more advanced Wessex Mark 3 helicopter, with radar equipment,
is being introduced and in the slightly longer term is to be replaced by an
anti-submarine helicopter of yet greater capacity, a British-built and British-
engined version of the Sikorsky SH-3D (Sea King).
Eventually the Royal Navy, and the Army, will rely on Royal Air Force
land-based aircraft for support. Ships from frigate upwards will be
equipped with helicopters capable of reconnaissance and attack on ships and
submarines.
Nuclear power propulsion has revolutionised the submarine, enabling it
to operate submerged for prolonged periods at sustained high speed. Apart
from the Polaris submarines three other nuclear-powered submarines are now
in service (Dreadnought, Valiant and Warspite) and wih eventually be joined
by three more. Thirteen Oberon class submarines, the most advanced con¬
ventional-powered submarines in the world, are now in service. They are
armed with a new type of homing torpedo, backed by a complex fire system.
Other operational submarines include eight of the Porpoise class.
The Tiger class cruisers have fully automatic armament and the latest
control equipment. 1 hey are being converted to carry anti-submarine
helicopters. Destroyers and frigates, which constitute the largest part of the
Fleet, are the main surface protection against submarines and against enemy
surface and air forces. Of eight County class guided-missile destroyers planned
for the Navy, six are in commission, two of them are already equipped with the
Seaslug Mark 2 surface-to-air missile and ADA. All the ships carry a Wessex
helicopter. A new, more powerful guided-missile ship is on order—the Type 82
destroyer—to be equipped with the surface-to-air guided weapon Seadart,
the Ikara anti-submarine weapon and new Anglo-Netherlands radar. Leander
class frigates have advanced anti-submarine equipment including variable-
depth and medium-range sonar and mortars; both they and the Tribal class
frigates can carry Wasp anti-submarine helicopters.
Support-ships replenish the Fleet and offer it maintenance and repair
facilities. They include submarine depot ships (equipped with workshops
and plant to support a squadron or more of submarines), a heavy repair and
maintenance ship and mine counter-measures support ships, all manned by
naval personnel. Ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service provide afloat
logistic support such as fuel, food, ammunition, stores and spare gear. These
ships fly the Blue Ensign and are manned by Merchant Navy officers and
seamen. The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth
provide the Navy with major supplies and repair facilities in Britain. Singapore
and Gibraltar are the main dockyards overseas.

Army general purpose combat forces consist mainly of the ground forces
deployed outside Europe; the Strategic Reserve; and other front line units
in Britain. Their cost in 1967-68 is estimated at £185 million.
The Strategic Reserve consists of two infantry brigades and one parachute
brigade with armoured car, artillery and engineer support. It is capable of
undertaking operations ranging from internal security and counter-insurgency
to limited war and is available to support BAOR in the event of general war.
It is completely air-portable. In addition special Air Service troops are highly
specialised forces which can act independently and react quickly to unforeseen
contingencies.
The introduction of the light-weight rifle and light-weight sleeping equipment
and rations in the Far East has helped to lessen the infantryman’s load; a new
manpack radio has been issued. Other equipment includes the remotely
controlled anti-personnel mine, the radio homing beacon and the Green Archer
mortar locator. The General Purpose Machine Gun is replacing the Vickers
and the Bren in infantry battalions. Equipment to improve the Army’s ability
to fight by night is being issued. Mobility is being increased by improved
engineer equipment that enhance the Army’s power to cross natural and
artificial barriers and by deployment of the Stalwart high-mobility load-
carrier. Following trials of hovercraft by the Joint Service Hovercraft Unit
in the Far East, the Army has formed a Hovercraft Unit, equipped with four
Westland hovercraft modified for military use. The introduction of the Sioux
helicopter has greatly increased the Army’s power of reconnaissance. Scout
helicopters are used to carry patrols, casualties and urgently needed stores,
and as airborne command posts. The Canadian fixed-wing light aircraft
Beaver is used for liaison purposes. The faster and more advanced Landing
Ship Logistic (LSL) is superseding the Landing Ship Tank (LST) for support
operations.
The Royal Air Force combat forces comprise all the front-line formations
and units except the V-bomber, transport and tanker forces. They fall into
five main categories: air defence, ground attack and fighter reconnaissance;
light bomber and tactical reconnaissance; maritime reconnaissance; head¬
quarters; and general support, including the Royal Air Force Regiment,
which is responsible for protecting bases. Their cost in 1967-68 is estimated
at ^237 million.
Fighter squadrons are equipped with Lightning Mark 3 and Mark 6 supersonic
aircraft, which carry Firestreak or Red Top air-to-air missiles and can be
refuelled in flight. The Lightning is fitted with a computer to aid bomber
interception. In the long term, the Lightning’s successor will be the Phantom.
Air defence is also the function of the Bloodhound Mark 2 surface-to-air missile.
Air defence squadrons are controlled by ground radars. New military radars
and centralised data-handling equipment are being installed in Britain as part
of the integrated plans for air defence and national air traffic control. Overseas,
new transportable radars are supplementing static radar. The ballistic missile
early warning station at Fylingdales (see p. 116) would provide warning of a
missile attack on Britain and so enable V-bombers to be alerted and despatched.
It also detects, tracks and identifies objects in orbit.
The Hunter EGA 9 ground attack and short-range Army support aircraft
is being replaced by the Phantom in 1968 and the British-PII2J vertical take-oft
and landing aircraft (the Harrier), the first such aircraft in the world to enter
squadron service, during 1970-71. Later, a strike version of the Anglo-French

Jaguar light-strike and trainer aircraft will release Phantoms to replace the
Lightnings. Overseas fighter-reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with
Hunter FRio aircraft.
Light bomber forces are assigned to NATO in a primary role of nuclear
strike, but they can also use conventional weapons to meet Britain’s require¬
ments outside the NATO area. Squadrons are also declared to CENTO and
SEATO. 1 hey are equipped with Canberra aircraft, some of which are armed
with AS1130 missiles. These forces will be replaced partly by the F111K and
partly by medium bombers transferred from the nuclear strategic role.
Reconnaissance forces comprise the Canberra PRy and Victor Mark 2
aircraft. Maritime-reconnaissance squadrons in Britain are equipped with
Shackleton Mark 2 and Mark 3 aircraft and squadrons overseas with the
Shackleton Mark 2. In addition to their reconnaissance functions they can also
be used for attacking surface ships and submarines, and as transport aircraft to
supplement Transport Command. The Shackleton Mark 3 is being modernised
and the Mark 2 replaced by the HS801 (the first all-turbo-jet maritime
reconnaissance aircraft) from 1969-70.
Air mobility forces are made up of the strategic and tactical transport forces,
tanker aircraft to refuel combat aircraft in flight, and communications aircraft.
Their cost in 1967-68 is estimated at £140 million.
The strategic transport force at present consists of Britannia and Comet
Mark 4 aircraft, while the Comet Mark 2 has been withdrawn. The Belfast and
VC 10 are being introduced. Tactical transports are the United States
Hercules (which is replacing the Hastings and Beverley aircraft) and the
Argosy. The short-range tactical transports are the Pioneer and Twin Pioneer
aircraft and the Belvedere, Whirlwind and Wessex helicopters. The Andover
Mark 1 short-range military freighter is now in service. The Victor tanker
aircraft can refuel two or three aircraft at the same time. The Basset (Beagle
B 206) and Andover C Mark 2 aircraft are used for communications.
WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
Responsibility for the supply of aircraft, guided weapons, nuclear weapons
and certain radar and other electronic equipment has been taken over by the
Ministry of Technology from the former Ministry of Aviation. The Ministry
of Defence is responsible for the procurement of other weapons, stores and
equipment. Total expenditure on research and development for 1967-68 was
estimated at £260 million.
A substantial part of the equipment used by the Services is developed and
produced in Britain, some by private industry on a contract basis and some
by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards and other establish¬
ments operated by the Ministry of Technology and the Ministry of Defence.
Production of nuclear warheads is undertaken by the Atomic Energy
Authority (see p. 210) under contract with the Ministry of Technology. In
some cases—particularly where development costs would be dispropor¬
tionately high—aircraft, weapons and other equipment are bought from
overseas. Conversely, British defence equipment has been adopted by allied
and friendly nations: for example, the United States, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Denmark and Sweden are using the British 105 mm. tank gun, and

British early warning radar equipment has been adopted by several countries
and by NATO.
Britain also undertakes manufacture in collaboration with other countries.
The United States Bullpup short-range air-to-surface guided weapon is in
service with the Royal Navy and is being manufactured in Europe under a
NATO international agency.
Other collaborative projects in progress are: with France, the Jaguar light
strike and trainer aircraft, the Martel stand-off air-to-surface guided missile
and an air-portable helicopter (SA 330) for the RAF, a light helicopter (SA 340)
for the Army, and a utility helicopter (WG 13) for the Royal Navy; with
Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany, a reconnaissance drone; with
the Netherlands, a surveillance radar; and with Australia, the long-range
anti-submarine Ikara system.
Britain is participating in the United States Interim Defence Communica¬
tions Satellite Project (IDCSP) and a memorandum of understanding has been
signed under which Britain is acquiring an operational satellite communica¬
tions system, functioning initially through two satellites providing communi¬
cations for the area between Britain and Australia.
Research and development are undertaken at a number of specialised
establishments. Among the most important are: the Royal Aircraft Estab¬
lishments, Farnborough and Bedford; the Royal Radar Establishment,
Malvern; and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment,
Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. The Navy Department’s two research
establishments carry out research on ships, maritime equipment and weapons
and also on certain kinds of electronic equipment on behalf of all three
Services. They are at Portsdown (near Portsmouth), where the design and
development of ship-borne gunnery and guided-missile systems are carried
out, and at Portland (Dorset), where all aspects of work on underwater
detection are co-ordinated with work on underwater weapons. Research
establishments controlled by the Army Department include the Royal
Armament Research and Development Establishment, Sevenoaks, Kent; and
the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment, Chobham,
Surrey.
Much experimental work has been carried out by the Navy and the Atomic
Energy Authority on nuclear-propelled submarines (see p. 119), and a nuclear
submarine power unit prototype is in operation at Dounreay (see p. 211). The
Royal Naval College, Greenwich, has a low-power training reactor which
provides facilities for basic education in nuclear engineering and research.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Technology’s research establish¬
ments, and guided and ballistic missiles at the Woomera range set up in
Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project.
Service firing trials of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles are carried out at
Aberporth and at the Army gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing
surface-to-surface missiles has been set up on South Uist in the Hebrides.
Research into nuclear weapons began in Britain during the second world
war. It was continued, as an allied project, in the United States where the
first atomic bomb was produced. After a subsequent period of independent
development in both countries, collaboration was resumed in 1958, when an
agreement was concluded which made possible the exchange of information
on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. This was supplemented
by a further agreement in May 1959, which contained provisions to enable
DEFENCE
123
Britain to buy from the United States component parts of atomic weapons
and weapons systems other than actual warheads, and to make possible the
exchange of nuclear materials between the two countries.
Britain s present nuclear programme is based on an agreement of 1963
under which Britain buys from the United States a number of Polaris missiles,
to be fitted with British nuclear warheads, for submarines to be built largely
by Britain.
USE OF MANPOWER AND RESOURCES
Defence policy provides for a force of about 400,000 professional servicemen
consisting entirely of regular volunteers with the highest possible proportion
in effective combat units, backed by an approximately equal number of
civilians. Tables 7 and 8 and diagrams on p. 124 show the active strengths of
the three Services at 1st April 1967 and estimated for 1st April 1968, the
allocation of expenditure allowed for in the Defence Estimates for 1967—68
between government departments, and the estimated use of this expenditure
and of both military and civilian personnel according to defence functions
irrespective of departmental and Service divisions.

HOME DEFENCE
Expenditure and other information on home defence is given in the annual
Statement on the Defence Estimates. In 1967-68 home defence expenditure
by civil departments (including part of the cost of the Territorials, see p. 115)
was estimated at £20 million.
Civil defence forms an integral part of the country’s defence plan. Following
a nuclear attack there would be enormous and immediate devastation: there
would nevertheless be millions of survivors in need of help. The civil defence
programme is designed to ensure as many survivors as possible and to safe¬
guard their well-being by making the best use of essential supplies and services
after an attack.
The United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation exists to warn
the public of the threat of air attack and fall-out. Warning would be given by
sirens and other devices from 18,000 points throughout the United Kingdom
and by BBC broadcasts. Information about nuclear bursts and radioactive
fall-out would be collected by the Royal Observer Corps. The Organisation
would also provide civil and military authorities in the United Kingdom (and
neighbouring NATO countries) with a scientific appreciation of the predicted
path and probable intensity of fall-out.
A scheme has been drawn up for the voluntary dispersal from the larger towns
of up to about 45 per cent of the population, mainly mothers and children,
disabled, aged and infirm people.
It would be impossible to provide protection by shelter within any area of
complete devastation caused by nuclear explosion, and beyond the country’s
resources to provide specially constructed underground shelters all over the
country as a protection against blast, heat and fall-out. Nevertheless, protective
shelter against some of the effects of nuclear explosions could be provided
relatively simply for most households and advice on this is given in civil
defence publications.
Plans have been made for safeguarding essential supplies of food, electricity,
gas and water and for maintaining the functioning of ports, shipping and rail¬
ways. Provision is also being made for stockpiling, storing and distributing
oil and emergency medical supplies. Special attention is being given to
safeguarding telephone communications and broadcasting.
Civil defence planning in Britain is the responsibility of a number of ministers
each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a
natural extension of his peace-time functions. The central Government has
enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of industry and
commerce and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organisa¬
tions such as the Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service, for the local execution of the plans.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary co-ordinates the work of
government departments in home defence planning and supervises the civil
defence activities of the police and fire services, the Civil Defence Corps
and the Industrial Civil Defence Service. Other government departments have
direct responsibility for the civil defence applications of the services which
they control; for example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital
and first-aid services (including the National Hospital Service Reserve) and
the Post Office for telecommunications.

In Scotland the Scottish Home and Health Department deals with questions
corresponding to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and
Wales, and is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid
services.
In Northern Ireland responsibility for civil defence matters lies with the
Ministry of Home Affairs, which may arrange for other departments to
undertake some functions on its behalf.
Co-ordination of government activity in war time would be undertaken in
the nine civil defence regions in England by Regional Commissioners, who
would assume full responsibility if control by the central Government were
disrupted. Similar arrangements would apply in Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland would be under one central control.
In England and Wales the regions are divided into two or more sub-regions
in each of which the main government departments, the police, fire service
and public utilities would be represented, so that effective government
would continue if communications with the regional headquarters were cut
off. Below sub-regional level, control is based on administrative counties and
county boroughs and, within counties, on county districts. The purpose of
this system of control is to direct life-saving operations after attack and to
provide a framework of civil administration to marshal and co-ordinate the
use of available resources to the best advantage for the continued survival of
the community.
Civilian volunteers in Great Britain undertake regular training in peace time
in the following services.
The Civil Defence Corps, following reorganisation, is expected to have an
active strength of about 75,000-80,000 members, who must undertake one
year’s part-time training. The Corps is recruited and organised by local
authorities. Its role is to help the local authorities to man the ‘control system’
(the system of government in emergency) and to provide limited numbers of
specialists to assist in organising first aid and welfare operations. On comple¬
tion of active service members pass to a reserve.
The Industrial Civil Defence Service (106,230 members in October 1967)
has been formed in the larger industrial and commercial establishments and
is trained in the same way as the Civil Defence Corps.
The Auxiliary Fire Service (13,932 members in March 1967) would reinforce
the regular Fire Service in war time (see below). Auxiliary firemen are trained
by officers and men of the regular brigades. In addition, both regular and
auxiliary firemen receive special training in emergency fire-fighting.
The National Hospital Service Reserve (69,335 members in March 1967),
limited at present to trained nurses and people willing to be trained as nursing
auxiliaries, reinforces the National Hospital Service in England and Wales.
In Scotland there is also an ambulance section of the reserve.
In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence
Corps; the Auxiliary Fire and Reserve Services; and the Hospital Service
Reserve.
In time of war the fire brigades maintained by local authorities would be
brought under central control and formed into a National Fire Service, which
would be expanded by the mobilisation of such members of the Auxiliary
Fire Service as were available for whole-time service.

the maintenance of law and order and for the control of essential service routes.
They are also likely to have duties in connection with dispersal, care of the
homeless and other specialised civil defence tasks. In all these duties they
would have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
The Secretary of State for Defence plans the part to be played by the armed
forces in home defence. In addition the military home defence force of
between 20,000 and 30,000 men (T & AYR III, the Territorials, see p. 115)
will supplement military units in the United Kingdom, assist the police in
the maintenance of law and order, and act in support of the civil authorities
in the event of a general war.
5 Social Welfare
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local govern¬
ment, for a range of services covering family allowances, social insurance,
help for war victims, financial assistance when required, health and welfare
services for mothers and young children, the sick, mentally disordered,
elderly and handicapped and for families in difficulties of various kinds, and
the care of children lacking a normal home life (all described in this chapter);
and for education (see Chapter 6) and housing (see Chapter 7). Public
authorities in the United Kingdom are spending over £7,000 million a year
on this range of services; that is, over £130 a year per head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of
nearly all the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics,
dispensaries, and social and recreational clubs before these were provided by
the State. They made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very
young and the very old, the homeless and the handicapped. Gradually the
State accepted the primary responsibility for the major services, supplementing
the voluntary services and developing a comprehensive structure that ensured
a minimum standard of living and well-being for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
The State may work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
particular needs and ensures that necessary standards are maintained. The
officers of central and local government, in carrying out their duties, co-operate
with the workers of many voluntary social service societies, while the resi¬
dential provision made by the State and by local authorities for the care of
the chronic sick and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various
types. Most of the sick and elderly receive State pensions or benefits.
The Charity Commission, a government department, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate
their administration when necessary; it maintains central and local registers
of charities which are open to public inspection; and it works to promote
co-operation between charities and State services.
Voluntary
Organisations
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain
runs into thousands; they range from national organisations to small individual
local groups. Most organisations, however,- are members of larger associations
or are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the
formation of public opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and mis¬
fortunes include the voluntary family casework agencies, of which the Family
Welfare Association, working mainly in London, is the best known; marriage
guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage Guidance Council; and
the Family Service Units.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British
Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the St. Andrew’s Ambulance
Association, but a number of societies exist to help sufferers from particular
disabilities, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal
SOCIAL WELFARE
129
Social Workers
Immigration
and Welfare
National Institute for the Deaf, the National Association for Mental Health,
the constituent members of the Central Council for the Disabled and their
Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the
Committee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
England Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work,
the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian
Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which gives help in every kind of practical difficulty,
brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, provides
flatlets and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family problems and
assists in hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
A central link between voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned
with social welfare is provided in England and Wales by the National Council
of Social Service, which brings together most of the principal voluntary
agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in groups of
those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth work or old people’s
welfare. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service and the Northern
Ireland Council of Social Service, which perform similar functions. It was the
National Council of Social Service which set up the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux,
of which there are now over 450 in Great Britain. The primary role of the
bureaux is to give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt about
his rights or who does not know about the State or voluntary services which
could help him.
While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done
pioneer work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an
essential part, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their operation
chiefly on the professional social worker, that is, the full-time salaried worker
trained in the principles and technique of social work. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate
course in social science followed by a university course in applied social
studies or specialised training for a particular service. The latter is sometimes
organised by the profession concerned. The Council for Training in Social
Work also promotes the training, in the first instance, of workers in the local
authority health and welfare services and similar services run by voluntary
bodies. Full-time courses lasting two years, now being provided by 21
colleges of further education, lead to the Council’s Certificate in Social Work.
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training
of social workers, but local authorities now employ increasing numbers of
trained social workers, for example, in child care, youth work, medical social
work, psychiatric social work, and the probation service.
Since the 1950s many people have entered Britain from Commonwealth
countries in Asia, Africa and the West Indies to take up employment, some
with the intention of returning home when they have acquired savings or
additional skills but many coming to settle permanently with their families;
others bring their families over later. Immigrants from the Commonwealth
and their families now comprise about two per cent of the total population.
130
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Home Office is responsible for co-ordinating Government action
designed to help Commonwealth immigrants to settle in Britain and to deal
with a number of social problems which have arisen.
In 1965 the Prime Minister appointed the National Committee for
Commonwealth Immigrants under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of
Canterbury with the aims of promoting and co-ordinating on a national basis
voluntary efforts directed towards the integration of Commonwealth immi¬
grants into the community.
The Race Relations Act 1965 introduced legal sanctions against certain
discriminatory behaviour. It provides for local conciliation committees to
enquire into complaints of racial discrimination in places of public resort1 and
to try to settle differences. The Race Relations Board, established under the
Act, examines cases where conciliation is not achieved and, if necessary, reports
to the Law Officers who may then take proceedings in the civil courts.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, family allowances and
supplementary benefits together with (in a special category) war pensions
constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Social Security administers these services in Great Britain
and within the Ministry the Supplementary Benefits Commission is responsible
for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern Ireland the first four of
these schemes are administered by the Ministry of Health and Social Services
which contains the Supplementary Benefits Commission for Northern Ireland.
Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are
the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Security throughout the United
Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits, family allowances
or war pensions, or to applications for supplementary benefit, are decided not
by the Ministries but by independent authorities.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may be
regarded as specially important in England and Wales), the modern system
of comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non¬
contributory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first con¬
tributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory
National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year
a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was
extended to cover the great majority of employees. By the beginning of
the second world war social security provision in Britain was among the
best in the world, but lacked co-ordination because of its piece-meal develop¬
ment, and not everyone came within its scope. In the immediate post-war
years a series of Acts introduced the present comprehensive system, which
became fully operative on 5th July 1948. Adjustments have been made by a
number of subsequent Acts. Statutory provision for the war disabled goes
back to the end of the sixteenth century, but the main lines of the present
war pension provisions were laid down during the first world war.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable
income on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income

the scope of the Act to include discrimination in employment, housing, credit facilities
and insurance.

tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the
support of dependants. War disablement pensions are not taxable.
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate
as a single system. Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family
allowances and most national insurance benefits are in operation with Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Guernsey, Jersey,
Norway, Sweden and Yugoslavia. Agreements with France, Israel, Italy,
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey cover industrial
injuries and most national insurance benefits. With Australia and New Zealand
there are agreements on family allowances and most national insurance
benefits. An agreement with Cyprus covers all national insurance benefits
and one with the Irish Republic covers most national insurance benefits
and certain provisions on industrial injuries relating to seafarers. There is
a limited agreement with Canada. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man are
also party to most of these agreements with other countries.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1965 (which consolidated the Acts of 1945-64), and in Northern Ireland
under its own legislation. About 6| million allowances are being paid in Great
Britain to nearly 4 million families with two or more children, and in Northern
Ireland to 124,000 families. An allowance is paid for each child other than the
first child below the age limits. The age limits are 15 years for children who
leave school at that age, 16 years for certain incapacitated children, and 19
for children who remain at school or are apprentices. The rate of the allowance
is 8s. a week for the second child below the age limits and 10s. a week for the
third and each subsequent child. These rates are to be increased by 7s. in
April 1968 (5s. of which will be paid for the fourth and subsequent children
in October 1967).
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to
benefit the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid
either to the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for
title to the allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
The National Insurance Acts apply, in general, to everyone over minimum
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. (The National Insurance Act 1965
consolidated the provisions of the National Insurance Acts 1946-64.)
The national insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by contributions of employers
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by the
Exchequer out of general taxation.
The original system was based on flat-rate contributions and benefits.
Contributions varied only with the sex and insurance class of the insured
person and benefits were at standard rates. (In both cases lower rates apply to
those under 18.) Two modifications were subsequently introduced to provide
additional earnings-related contributions and benefits. For retirement,
graduated contributions and pensions were introduced in 1961. For the first
six months of sickness, unemployment or widowhood the National Insurance
Act 1966 introduced a scheme for earnings-related supplements to the flat-rate
benefit and contributions.

Contributions
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Contributors under the national insurance scheme are divided into three
classes:
Class i. Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a
contract of service or are paid apprentices—over 23 million.
Class 2. Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account
and others who are working for gain but do not work under the control
of an employer—nearly million.
Class 3. Non-employed persons. All those insured who are not in class 1
or class 2—nearly a quarter of a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by
regulations, to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in
their own household duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’
insurance and need not pay contributions. They can choose to pay contri¬
butions provided they were insured when they married. (Those who were
already married when the scheme began to operate on 5th July 1948 cannot
be insured in their own right unless they were then insured under the old
scheme and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons or
unless they have since taken up paid work.) Employed married women may
choose whether to pay separate flat-rate contributions themselves (they must
pay graduated contributions) or to rely on the cover provided by their
husbands’ contributions, which make them eligible for maternity grant,
retirement pension at lower rate, widow’s benefit and death grant. Students
receiving full-time education and unpaid apprentices need not pay contribu¬
tions. Up to the age of 18, flat-rate contributions are credited to them. Over
that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed persons (class 3) and
thus safeguard entitlement to widow’s benefit and to retirement pension at
full rate. Self-employed and non-employed people whose income is not more
than ^312 (£260 until October 1967) a year can apply to be exempted from
liability to pay contributions. They too may pay as non-employed persons to
safeguard entitlement to pension.
An employed person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 for men, 65 for women, or when he retires, or is deemed to
have retired, from regular employment after reaching minimum pension
age (65 for men, 60 for women), whichever is the earlier. If such a person
does any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an industrial
injuries contribution; the employer still has to pay his full share of the flat-rate
contribution.
Flat-rate contributions1 are paid by means of national insurance stamps bought
from a post office and fixed, for each contributor, to a single contribution card.
All three classes pay flat-rate contributions (see Table 9). The stamps for
class 1 contributors also include the employer’s redundancy contribution (to
help to provide for payments in certain circumstances to employees whose
work is terminated, see p. 436) and the selective employment tax paid by
employers (see p. 380); and for all contributors the National Health Service
contribution (which for convenience is pad with the national insurance
contribution although the two services are separately administered). It is the
employer’s responsibility in the first place to see that the class 1 contributions
are paid, but he can deduct the employees’ share from their wages. The

October 1967. The new rates are given in the following paragraphs.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Benefits
Amounts
self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards. Flat-rate
contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or
injury, or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
Graduated contributions are payable by employed people (including
married women but not retirement pensioners) aged between 18 and 70
(65 for women) who earn more than £9 a week. The range of graduated
contributions is given in Table 9. Employees whose job provides them with
an occupational pension of at least ^3 9s. yd. a year for each year of service
(£2 18s. for women) may be ‘contracted out’ of the graduated pension part
of the scheme. Contracted out employees pay graduated contributions at the
rate of half per cent of that part of their weekly pay lying between £9 and £30;
their employers pay the same amount. Employees who are not contracted out
pay graduated contributions at the rate of 4! per cent of the part of their
weekly earnings between £9 and £18 and \ per cent of the part between £18
and £30. Their employers pay the same amount.
Graduated contributions provide a graduated addition to retirement pension
and meet the cost of earnings-related supplements to sickness and unemploy¬
ment benefit and widow’s supplementary allowance. The contributions are
collected through the same machinery as is used to collect Pay As You Earn
(deduction at source) income tax.
The scheme provides payments1 to contributors in case of unemployment (if
normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an
employer or self-employed), and confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-
employed and paying national insurance contributions at the full rate).
Retirement pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for women)
if they have retired from regular work and from the age of 70 (65 for women)
even if they continue to work; widows receive benefit in the first 26 weeks
after bereavement and subsequently while they have young children or if
they have reached the age of 50 when widowed or when their children have
grown up; and there are two kinds of allowance in respect of orphan children
where a widow’s pension is not payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum
cash grants for two expensive contingencies—the birth of a child and a death.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First,
before benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must
actually have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate
of benefit cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have
been paid or credited over a specified period. There are special rules to help
a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood
or when her children have growm up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment
benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established herself
in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to
help a divorced woman who was not paying contributions during her
marriage.
The basic amount of the majority of flat-rate benefits is £4 10s. a week which
may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been paid, but is not
affected by other unearned income or the previous level of earnings. Earnings
received while the benefit is in payment, however, may cause its reduction or
withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a person earning more
1 Increases in certain contributions and benefits are to be introduced at the end of
October 1967. The new rates are given in the following paragraphs.

Duration
than a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation; retirement pensioners
under the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions reduced in step with
earnings over certain specified amounts; sickness benefit, though not affected
by continued payment of wages during illness, is not normally payable to a
person doing any actual work. Exceptions to the basic flate rate are the higher
rate of ^6 7s. a week payable to widows during the first 26 weeks after
bereavement, the increased retirement pension earned by someone who has
continued at work and paid contributions beyond minimum pension age,
and the lower rate of ^3 2s. a week unemployment or sickness benefit payable
to married women who pay contributions. The standard rate of retirement
pension for a woman on her husband’s insurance is £2 16s. a week.
Standard increases of flat-rate benefit are payable for dependants at the
rate of ^2 16s. for an adult (generally a wife), £1 5s. for the first or only child
under the family allowances age limits; 17s. for the second and third child and
12s. for other children over and above any family allowances payable. The
amounts payable to widows for their children are appreciably larger.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of
whom was insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a guardian’s
allowance of £2 2s. 6d. a week. It is paid to the person in whose family the
child is, for the time being included. For certain fatherless children there
is a child’s special allowance also of ^2 2s. 6d. a week inclusive of family
allowances (to be increased in April 1968, see p. 131); this is payable to a
woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who has not
remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child to whose support
he was contributing before he died.
The graduated addition to retirement pension is at the rate of 6d. a week
for each ^7 10s. of all graduated contributions paid by a man and for each £9
of such graduated contribution paid by a woman (with, in each case, the
matching amount of graduated contribution coming from the employer).
The earnings-related supplements to flat-rate unemployment and sickness
benefit are one-third of a person’s average weekly earnings between £9 and
£30, but the supplements cannot raise the total benefit, including increases
for dependants, beyond 85 per cent of earnings. The supplement is also paid
to widow beneficiaries who have the appropriate record of earnings, if they
become upemployed or sick.
An earnings-related supplement is paid on top of the widow’s allowance to
widows whose husbands were under 70 and had not retired from regular
employment; this supplement is one-third of the husband’s average weekly
earnings between £9 and £30.
The rates of grants are varied: £22 maternity grant is payable for a con¬
finement and a further £22 grant for each additional child born at the same
confinement living 12 hours after birth; and £30 death grant on the death
of an adult (less for a child, or for an adult who was within 10 years of
minimum pension age when the scheme started).
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than
a year if less than 156 contributions have been paid (possible in three years
for a contributor continuously at work) and unemployment benefit is payable
for a maximum of one year. The supplement to unemployment and sickness
benefit is paid for a maximum of six months starting from the thirteenth day
of unemployment or incapacity for work. Maternity allowance begins 11 weeks
before the expected week of confinement and ends after the sixth week
following the expected week or the actual confinement if this is later.
136 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Similarly, widowed mothers’ allowances at the full rate cease when the
children reach family allowance age limits, though a mother can continue to
receive ^4 10s. a week for herself while she has living with her a son or
daughter above the age limits but under 19. The widow’s pension payable to
the childless widow, provided she is over 50 (and had been married at least
three years when her husband died), or the similar pension normally paid
to the widowed mother who has reached 50 when her widowed mother’s
allowance ends, continues until she has reached minimum pension age and
retired, or at most till age 65. If she has satisfied the conditions she then
becomes entitled to a retirement pension.
NATIONAL
INSURANCE
(INDUSTRIAL
INJURIES)
The industrial injuries insurance scheme, which, in July 1948, replaced the
workmen’s compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused
by accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for
prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically
everyone in class 1 of the national insurance scheme and certain others.
Like the national insurance scheme, the industrial injuries scheme is financed
partly from contributions (see Table 9) and partly from taxation. The legal
basis of the scheme is the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965
which consolidated the 1946 Act and subsequent legislation. Similar cover
against industrial injuries and diseases in Northern Ireland is provided by
Northern Ireland’s legislation.
Benefits
Injury Benefit
Disableme?it
Benefit
Injury benefit for an adult is ^7 5s. a week plus £2 16s. for an adult dependant
£i 5s. for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits,
17s. for the second and third eligible child and 12s. for each other child in
addition to any family allowance payable. It is paid when the insured person
is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or prescribed disease,
and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date
of the accident or development of the disease. A person entitled to sickness
benefit who draws injury benefit instead, also receives any earnings-related
supplement (see p. 135) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a
loss of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £7 12s. for 100 per
cent disablement to £1 10s. 6d. a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for
disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid, ranging up
to £500.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £4 10s.; constant
attendance allowance of up to £3 weekly normally, or at an intermediate
rate of £4 10s. or a special rate of fib a week in exceptionally severe cases; an
allowance of £2 a week for a person entitled to constant attendance allowance
at more than the normal maximum rate whose need for an allowance at such
a rate is likely to be permanent; a special hardship allowance of up to £2 is.
for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or work of an equivalent
standard; and hospital treatment allowances which raise the benefit to that
for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for the industrial
disability. Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with unemploy¬
ability supplement and hospital treatment allowance.
SOCIAL WELFARE
Death Benefit
SUPPLEMENTARY
BENEFITS
I37
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £6 7s. a week is payable for the first 26 weeks
of widowhood. In addition she receives any earnings-related supplement
(see p. 135) that would have been paid had she claimed widow’s allowance
under the main national insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow can receive
a pension of ^5 is. a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband’s
death, or has dependent children or other special needs; otherwise she receives
£\ 1 os. a week. If she had been living apart from her husband, the pension is
limited to the weekly rate of maintenance he was paying, if less than the rate
otherwise appropriate.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For widows, these allowances together with any family allowance
payable amount to £2 2s. 6d. a week for each child (until April 1968, see p. 131).
For other beneficiaries, the rate is £1 5s. for the first child, 17s. a week for the
second or third child and 12s. for each later child.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions (of up to ^ 1 a week), allowances or gratuities.
The Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 provided for a scheme of supple¬
mentary benefits to replace the system which had been administered by the
former National Assistance Board since 1948. The Act established within
the Ministry of Social Security a Supplementary Benefits Commission
responsible for guiding the scheme and for determining awards of benefit.
The parallel legislation in Northern Ireland made similar provision.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work,
attending school or involved in a trade dispute and whose resources are
insufficient to meet his requirements is entitled to a supplementary benefit.
The benefit takes the form of a supplementary pension for those over the
statutory retirement age, and of a supplementary allowance for others. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his available
resources, both being defined by rules laid down by the Act. The calculation
of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and family
groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case,
an addition for rent. For the old and most other long-term cases a special
addition is made. Available resources include certain income and capital; the
main national insurance and industrial injury benefits, family allowances and
maintenance payments from a husband or the father of the claimant’s children
are taken into account in full but some part of all other resources is
disregarded. There is a right of appeal if the claimant is dissatisfied with the
decision of the Commission.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
man of working age may be subject to the condition that he registers for
employment at an employment exchange of the Ministry of Labour; the
allowance is then paid at the exchange. Otherwise the supplementary benefit
is paid weekly through a post office.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence
‘persons without a settled way of living’ to lead a more normal life. The
Commission provides temporary accommodation for them in reception centres,
sometimes through the agency of local authorities. For men who have been
unemployed for long periods and who are in receipt of supplementary
allowances or are using reception centres, it runs eight non-residential and two

residential re-establishment centres where they are given help to fit them
again for work.
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through the wars or
service in the Forces since the second world war are paid under Royal Warrants
and other instruments administered by the Ministry of Social Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private
soldier is 12s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the
degree of disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the condition of
the person disabled by service with that of a normal healthy person of the
same age and sex. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to
the basic pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the
main ones being for unemployability (.£4 ys. 6d. a week), constant attendance
(up to £3 and, exceptionally, £6 a week), comforts (12s. 6d. or £1 5s. a
week), and lowered standard of occupation (up to £3 is. a week). An addi¬
tional allowance of £3 a week is payable to war pensioners who are receiving
constant attendance allowance at a rate above the normal maximum. An age
allowance (at rates varying between ys. 6d. and a week) is payable to
disablement pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is
40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any
allowances payable under the Family Allowances Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is ^5 lys. a week, with additional
allowances for their children (a maximum of £2 6s. 6d.), and, in certain cases,
an allowance for rent (up to .£2 5s. a week). There is an additional allowance
of 15s. a week for widows aged yo or over. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Ministry of Social Security maintains a welfare service for war
pensioners and war orphans which is available to help any who require
advice and assistance. War pensioners have priority for treatment of their war
disablements in National Health Service hospitals subject only to needs of
emergency and other urgent cases.
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The Ministry’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these voluntary
bodies and with the specialist government welfare agencies.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second
half of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 1948 of a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every resident. Scientific
discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the development
of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 50 years, particularly
in maternity and child welfare, school health services and school meals, are

reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 9) and improved physique.
The infant mortality rate has more than halved since the National Health
Service was inaugurated; this and the maternal death rate are among the lowest
in the world. The health of children has steadily improved and the proportion
of school children considered to be in an ‘unsatisfactory’ condition of health
is now the lowest recorded. Deaths from such diseases as tuberculosis,
poliomyelitis and diphtheria have fallen so markedly that they are no longer
major health problems. Diseases now in the forefront of research programmes
include cancer and diseases of the central nervous system, such as muscular
dystrophy. Efforts are also being made to combat some of the most prevalent
diseases, which include, besides the common cold and influenza, bronchitis,
rheumatism and heart diseases.
The Public Health Act of 1936 constitutes the present basic public health
code in England and Wales. Local authorities (under the general direction
of the Ministry of Health or the Welsh Board of Health and the Ministry of
Housing and Local Government) have extensive powers for making and
administering by-laws on matters of public health. The local authorities
chiefly concerned are the councils of county and non-county boroughs,
London boroughs and the City of London, urban and rural district councils
and, to a limited extent, parish councils.
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed
on much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on
separate Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various
types of local authority (working under the direction of the Scottish Home
and Health Department and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and
Social Services). The Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 and the Burgh
Police (Scotland) Act 1892 as amended by later Statutes constitute the basic
legislation for Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the councils of
counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and non¬
county boroughs and urban and rural districts are mainly responsible for
administering the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland) 1878-1966.
The Medical Officers of Health of local authorities are responsible for
investigating outbreaks of infectious diseases and for disinfection and other
preventive measures. They must also keep records of the incidence of
‘notifiable’—the more dangerous—infectious diseases.
Port health authorities supervise health control at seaports and airports,
the primary object of which is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease
into the country. This health control is undertaken by health authorities
using the services of medical officers, public health inspectors, rodent
inspectors and others.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and
Drugs Act 1955 in England and Wales, by the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act
1956 in Scotland, and by the Food and Drugs (Northern Ireland) Act 1958
in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales the question of the composition, adulteration and
description of food are the concern of food and drugs authorities (county,
county borough, London borough and City of London councils and, generally,
the larger borough and urban district councils) and questions of soundness,
purity and hygiene are the concern of all local authorities, except parish
councils. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
140

and Food are the central departments responsible for giving advice and making
regulations. Places where food for sale for human consumption is prepared,
sold or stored must conform to certain hygienic standards. Authorised officers
of the councils may take for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination
samples of any food for sale for human consumption. Special regulations are
in force for certain foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of
counties and large burghs.
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and
county borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry
of Health and Social Services.
Local authorities are also responsible for the public health aspects of water
supply, sewerage and drainage; street paving and housing; and the abatement
of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke-controlled areas, to
secure cleaner air and to arrange with statutory water undertakings for the
addition of fluoride to water supplies to reduce dental decay.
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health
Service Act 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947, and the
Health Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1948—came into force simultaneously
on 5th July 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act 1946 is ‘to promote the
establishment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service
designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the
people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of illness, and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision
ORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH
SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES*

of services’. The service was originally free to users but certain small charges
were introduced under subsequent legislation. The removal of anxiety about
the cost has encouraged people in need of treatment to seek it where previously
they might not have done so. The Government has announced its intention
of abolishing all charges. The service is available to all according to medical
need without regard to any insurance qualification. National insurance
contributors are required to pay a separate weekly national health contribution
under the National Health Service Contribution Acts 1957 to 1961 (see
I able 9) but contributors and non-contributors are entitled to the same full
range of services. Visitors from other countries who come to Britain for treat¬
ment are expected to pay for it, but treatment can be given under the
emergency provisions of the National Health Service to any who fall ill
during a visit to Britain.
The services provided by the National Health Service fall into three main
groups:
1. The hospital and specialist services for which the Minister of Health or
Secretary of State for Scotland is directly responsible. These are
administered through 20 regional hospital boards and over 460 hospital
management committees, or, in the case of teaching hospitals in England
and Wales, boards of governors. The three special psychiatric hospitals in
England for people with criminal propensities are directly administered
by the Minister of Health, and the similar hospitals in Scotland by the
Secretary of State.
2. The general practitioner services consist of the family doctor service,
the dental service, the eye service and the pharmaceutical service, for
which the Health Ministers are indirectly responsible. They are adminis¬
tered by some 160 local executive councils on which doctors, dentists
and pharmacists are represented. Each council in England and Wales
has an ophthalmic services committee; in Scotland there are five joint
ophthalmic services committees.
3. The local authority health and welfare services.
In addition, the Minister of Health in England and Wales has power to
conduct, or assist others to conduct, research work and he provides a public
health laboratory service and a blood transfusion service. He is advised by
the Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory committees
on various aspects of the service.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister; but
it is his responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The Secretary of State has similar duties for Scotland. The teaching
hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the regional hospital boards,
but special medical education committees consider matters relating to medical
teaching. The Scottish Health Services Council and the standing advisory
committees advise the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the
Central Health Services Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 148.
Estimated expenditure on the National Health and Welfare Services in Great
Britain was £1,532 million (gross) in 1966-67 and amounts to over 4 per cent
of the total national income. The greater part of the cost falls on the Exchequer,
and is met from general taxation, and a small part is met from local rates.
142
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Practitioner
Services
Other income is derived from the national health service contribution paid
with the national insurance contribution.
There are charges for treatment in the dental service (but not for examina¬
tion only or for treatment given to people under 21 years or to nursing or
expectant mothers), for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at
school, and expectant and nursing mothers) and spectacles (except children’s
spectacles in standard frames), and for some local health authority services.
Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the
Supplementary Benefits Commission for help in meeting any of these charges.
Under the 1946 Act, a limited number of beds may be made available for
hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided that this accommodation is not
needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients. Charges for these
‘amenity’ beds are fixed by statutory regulations. Provision is also made at
certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private patients’ accom¬
modation on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation and treatment.
Such patients may make private arrangements for treatment by doctors of
their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in public service are paid
according to the nature and extent of the services they provide.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions
they dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the supple¬
mentary ophthalmic service are paid prescribed fees for each sight test made;
opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and type
of pairs supplied.
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to
individuals by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those
enrolled in the service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own
surgeries; practice in health centres established under the National Health
Service Acts is, however, being encouraged by the Government. About
24,000, or almost all, general medical practitioners (principals and assistants)
in Great Britain take some part in the service, three-quarters of them in
partnership. The method of remunerating doctors has been under review
and a new system of payments is being introduced which is more directly
related to the amount of work and responsibility undertaken by the individual
doctor.
Doctors wishing to enter practice have to apply through their executive
councils to the central Medical Practices Committee, so that a balanced
distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated. The maxi¬
mum number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is
normally 3,500; the average number in England and Wales is about 2,450.
It is normally through the patient’s own doctor that access to most other
parts of the health service is obtained.
There are about 10,400 dentists in England and Wales and over 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Over 880 ophthalmic medical practitioners and nearly 7,200 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and 68 ophthalmic medical
practitioners and about 700 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland
are engaged in the supplementary ophthalmic service. These services provide
SOCIAL WELFARE
I43
for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Cases requiring treatment
are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
Nearly 14,000 retail pharmacists take part in the National Health Service.
They are responsible for the dispensing of all prescriptions except for the
small number dispensed by certain general practitioners.
Hospital and
Specialist
Services
Hospitals
Rehabilitation
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities both for in-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity departments,
infectious disease units, psychiatric hospitals and units, convalescent homes
and rehabilitation centres, and all forms of specialised treatment.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service in Great
Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much
earlier charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s and St.
Bartholomew s Hospitals in London. Much has been done in the last ten years
to improve and extend existing hospitals, some of which are housed in
inconvenient buildings, and a number of new hospitals have been built.
In 1962 long-term plans for hospital building were published by the Govern¬
ment and revisions were made in 1963, 1964 and 1966. The plans set out
the probable future pattern of the hospital service and contain assessments of
the work to be undertaken in the ten years ahead; it is expected that roughlv
^1,000 million will be spent in England and Wales on hospital building
during the ten-year period beginning 1966-67 and over ^60 million in
Scotland for the first five years.
Over 2,500 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are
in England and Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals comprising about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes,
branches, annexes, or treatment centres) and the 10 teaching hospitals
elsewhere in England and Wales (comprising some 70 hospitals and other
establishments). They have nearly 460,000 beds available for use and a nursing
and midwifery staff of some 184,000 full-time and about 74,000 part-time
nurses and midwives. The 372 hospitals in Scotland have over 62,000 beds
and more than 26,000 full-time and 9,000 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and
Jewish Hospitals, serve a special group of patients; others are maintained
for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations. There
are also private nursing homes, which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today hospital
treatment is not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions
but aims at helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible.
Experience has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in
hospital, the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity
for full work. It has been applied with advantage in the care of the chronic
sick, the mentally disabled, the aged and the handicapped and has enabled
many patients to become self-sufficient and to resume an independent life
in their own homes. Specialised rehabilitation facilities are provided at the
main hospitals and in a few other centres. The work is carried out under the
guidance of the appropriate medical specialist by physiotherapists, remedial
gymnasts, occupational therapists and social workers acting as a team. The
hospital departments work closely with the Disablement Resettlement Service
of the Ministry of Labour.

Medical rehabilitation includes the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Nursing aids for the handicapped at
home, ranging from special carriages to feeding cups, can be borrowed through
the service.
Most hospitals have social work departments staffed by workers trained to
apply the principles of social casework to the problems of the hospital patient.
Medical and psychiatric social workers co-operate with clinical and other
staff in the patient’s treatment by making social investigations as an aid to
diagnosis, taking action to alleviate problems and anxieties surrounding
admission to hospital, and arranging after-care which will ensure that the
patient is helped to readjust to life, whatever his continuing disability.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered
by the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service. Donors
give their blood voluntarily without payment. There are two central
laboratories administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf of the
Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which prepares
grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it, and
the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma
fractions. In Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is under the direction of
the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association, which is an independent
voluntary body but is supported in the main by a grant from the Scottish
Home and Health Department. In Northern Ireland the Blood Transfusion
Service is operated by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
A Chest Radiological Service, which is freely available, is provided by mass
radiography units, chest clinics and the radiological departments of general
hospitals. The mass radiography units alone X-ray about 3 J million people
each year, concentrating increasingly on specially susceptible groups in the
population.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no separate public health
laboratory service, bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories.
The Committee on Safety of Drugs, set up by the Health Ministers, is
responsible for considering reports of toxicity testing and clinical trials of
new drugs and for studying reports of adverse reactions to drugs in use.
Members of the manufacturers’ organisations have undertaken not to start
clinical trials or to market a new drug without or against the advice of the
Committee.
Local authorities play a major part in promoting the health and welfare of
people in the community often in co-operation with voluntary organisations,
to which they may make grants, lend premises or give help in other ways.
Most of the needs for which the services are designed arise among four
broad groups of people: mothers and young children; the elderly; the mentally
disordered; and the physically handicapped. Other smaller groups include the

ill and convalescent at home, and the temporarily homeless. To ensure that
the services bring the maximum benefit to those who use them, local authori¬
ties work in close co-operation with the general practitioner and hospital and
specialist branches of the National Health Service.
The authorities responsible for health and welfare services are the councils
of counties, county boroughs, London boroughs and the City of London and,
in Scotland, counties and large burghs. Plans for the development of health
and welfare services in England and Wales over the ten years ending 1975-76
were published in 1966 and the authorities keep the plans constantly under
review. In 1966 a committee was appointed to review the organisation and
responsibilities of the local authority personal social services. In Scotland
fundamental studies of services are being carried out as a guide to authorities
in their plans for the future.
Charges may be made for some local authority health and welfare services
(for example, domestic help, welfare foods for young or handicapped children
and nursing or expectant mothers, day nurseries, the loan of equipment and
laundering of bed linen for people being nursed at home, and chiropody
services) but arrangements are made for free provision to people with very
low incomes.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis by local health authorities is normally
restricted to people under 40 years of age (apart from people liable to special
risk who may be vaccinated at any age); those over 40 may be vaccinated, free
of charge under the National Health Service, by their general practitioner.
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis by local health authorities is available
to children of ten years and over and to others exposed to particular risk of
infection. Vaccination is also available against diphtheria, smallpox, tetanus
and whooping cough.
Maternity and child welfare centres offer regular supervision by doctors,
midwives and health visitors to expectant and nursing mothers and young
children. Special sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for
early testing of babies for deafness and other defects. A feature of the service
is the education of mothers before and after the birth by means of talks,
discussion groups, demonstrations and classes. More than 77 per cent of
babies born in England and Wales and some 60 per cent of those born in
Scotland in 1966 were taken to the centres. Health visitors also visit the homes
of babies and young children to give advice on their care and health, and under¬
take school nursing and tuberculosis visiting (for all age groups) as part of
their duties.
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital
according to the advice given by the doctor or midwife. Those for whom
domiciliary confinement is inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or
because of unsuitable home conditions have their babies in hospital. For a
home confinement the services of either a general practitioner obstetrician
or her own family doctor, if he is willing to undertake her maternity care,
besides those of a trained midwife and, if necessary, a consultant obstetrician,
are now available to every mother.
The majority of premature babies are cared for in hospital but special
arrangements for premature babies who are fit to remain in their own homes
are made by many local health authorities who lend equipment and appoint
experienced nursing staff to supervise their care.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is made available by local
authorities during periods of special need, for example, confinement or
146
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Elderly
The Mentally
Disordered
during the absence of the mother when children might otherwise have to be
cared for away from home.
Some local authorities make direct provision for the special needs of
unmarried mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work
done by voluntary organisations and other bodies (see p. 149).
Under the welfare foods service expectant and nursing mothers, children
up to five years and one month and certain handicapped children can obtain
a pint of milk a day at a reduced price. Other welfare foods distributed by local
health authorities to the same group of people are dried milk, as an alternative
to liquid milk and at the same price per pint equivalent, orange juice, cod liver
oil and, for expectant and nursing mothers only, vitamins A and D tablets at
cost price. Some authorities also provide other proprietary foods at special
clinic prices.
There are about 515 day nurseries (apart from nursery schools and play
groups) for children under five in Great Britain provided by local health
authorities or voluntary associations working with them. Private or factory
nurseries must be registered with the local health authority to ensure that
their premises and management are satisfactory. People who mind more
than two children under five years of age in their homes for payment must
also be registered if the children are not relatives and come from different
households.
A number of services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by
statutory and voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible.
Local authorities supply, under the National Health Service Acts, home nursing
and domestic help and many arrange a chiropody service, sitters-in, night
attendants and special laundry services. Under the National Assistance
Amendment Act 1962 the authorities may provide day centres, clubs,
recreational workshops and meals for old people. Health visitors and social
workers employed by local authorities are spending an increasing proportion
of their time helping old people with their problems and in most areas ‘good
neighbour’ and friendly visiting services have also been arranged by the local
authority or a voluntary organisation.
Local authorities provide residential accommodation, under the National
Assistance Act, for the elderly and infirm and have powers to register homes
run by voluntary organisations or privately (see p. 149). The newer homes
provided by local authorities for elderly and other infirm people usually have
accommodation for 30 to 50 residents; for the elderly mentally infirm the
present development is towards homes of not more than 35 places. Nearly
1,750 new homes have been opened in Great Britain since 1945.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided
an increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for
frail or infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help.
County councils may make grants to county district councils towards the cost
of providing a resident warden and other welfare services for elderly people
occupying these special groups of dwellings.
Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health
Service. Patients can consult the family doctor, and receive specialist advice
at hospital out-patient clinics as they would for any other kind of illness, and
can enter hospital for in-patient treatment without formalities.
In England and Wales under the Mental Health Act 1959, and in Scotland
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act i960, mentally disordered patients can,
where necessary in the interests of their health or safety or for the protection
SOCIAL WELFARE
I47
of other people, be compelled to enter hospital for treatment. There are
procedural safeguards to protect patients from unnecessary detention in
hospital; in England and Wales patients may apply to a Mental Health Review
Tribunal for discharge and in Scotland to the sheriff.
Local health authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally disordered in the community, and before or after hospital treatment.
Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness, which enable patients
to be discharged from hospital more quickly provided support is available in
the community, are adding to the demands for these services. Arrangements
include training centres for mentally subnormal children and adults,
occupational centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and residential
accommodation for the mentally disordered of all ages. If necessary, the local
health authority can place a mentally disordered person under guardianship
within the community. In Scotland education authorities share the respon¬
sibility for providing training or occupation.
Local authorities have a duty to provide welfare services for people who are
blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard of hearing, or otherwise substantially and
permanently handicapped. Voluntary organisations give important help in
providing these services. To become eligible for the services a person must
apply to the welfare department of the local authority for registration as a
handicapped person.
A wide range of facilities is available under authorities’ welfare schemes,
including advice on occupational, social and personal problems arising from
disability; assistance in overcoming the effects of disability; help in carrying
out adaptations in the home—for example, by fitting ramps, wide doorways,
ground floor toilets, guide rails, and the provision of various aids to living to
meet individual needs; social and occupational centres and clubs; teaching of
handicrafts and other occupations either at home or in centres; and the pro¬
vision of recreational facilities, outings and holidays. The blind welfare services
are staffed by social workers, known as Home Teachers of the Blind, who are
specially qualified to assist the blind in all matters including teaching them
craftwork and the use of embossed symbols for reading and writing. Services
for the deaf are also staffed by specialist welfare officers qualified to com¬
municate with the deaf.
Benefits available from other sources include financial aid, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped
children see p. 157, and the school health services and welfare clinics, which
keep a watch for abnormalities, p. 156.)
Thirty-one health centres which provide primarily for the association of
general medical practice with local health services and the school health service
have been set up by local health authorities in England and Wales. Interest
in the provision of health centres is growing rapidly. In April 1967 a further
30 centres were under construction and many more were planned. The
provision of health centres in Scotland is the responsibility of the Secretary
of State for Scotland. Four centres are in operation and two are under
construction.
Health education is primarily the responsibility of local authorities and they
are increasingly employing specified officers to organise and promote health
education, much of which is carried out in child welfare clinics and by health
visitors.

A central advisory service is provided by the Central Council for Health
Education which is supported by local authorities in England and Wales and
Northern Ireland. The council holds staff-training schemes and conferences
and distributes material such as posters and films for teaching and publicity.
The existing council is to be replaced by an entirely new Health Education
Council.
In Scotland central services are provided by the Scottish Council for Health
Education and the Scottish Home and Health Department. A new health
education unit, which will work in close association with the Council, is to be
established within the Scottish Office.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital is provided, where needed, by local authorities either directly or by
arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service
(organised by the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross
Society, and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the ambulance
service in many areas for the conveyance of sitting patients. In Scotland
ambulances are run by the St. Andrew’s Ambulance Service on behalf of the
Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland they are run by the Northern Ireland
Hospitals Authority.
The health services established under the Health Services Acts (Northern
Ireland) 1948-67 correspond fairly closely to the medical care system
established under the National Health Service in Great Britain and they are
financed in the same way as in the rest of the United Kingdom. Welfare
services are provided under the Welfare Services Acts (Northern Ireland)
1949-61 by separate statutory welfare authorities.
The hospital and specialist services, which include mental health services,
are administered on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Social Services by
the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority (which corresponds approximately
to a regional hospital board in Great Britain) through hospital management
committees. The Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority has under its control
83 hospitals containing in all about 17,000 beds. The administration of the
general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary eye services is
in the hands of the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board, which
takes the place of the executive councils in Great Britain. There are some
750 general practitioners (with an average of 2,020 patients each), 316 dentists,
13 ophthalmic medical practitioners and 141 ophthalmic and 15 dispensing
opticians. The provision of health centres is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Health and Social Services. Local health and welfare services are admin¬
istered by the six county councils and the two county borough councils in
Northern Ireland. The range of local authority services and the arrangements
made by the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board for the provi¬
sion of services, and for the remuneration of the people providing them, are
similar to those already described for the rest of the United Kingdom.
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive health and welfare
services in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision made by
central and local authorities.
In many areas invalid children, old people and others needing care in their
own homes are visited and helped by voluntary organisations. The National
Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, for example, gives help through
advice and services. The voluntary societies concerned with mental health
have formed the National Association for Mental Health which does advisory,

educational and therapeutic work. There are specialist and general societies
concerned with the blind, the deaf and people with other handicaps. The
extensive work done for elderly people is co-ordinated by Old People’s Welfare
Committees which have been established in 1,600 areas. They are affiliated
to the National Old People’s Welfare Council, to which there are correspond¬
ing bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A National Corporation for the
Welfare of Old People, established by the Nuffield Foundation, is now con¬
centrating on services in the home. At the present time some 2,430 homes
for old and disabled people, run by voluntary bodies or privately, are registered
with local authorities under the National Assistance Act. In Northern Ireland
voluntary homes are registered with the Ministry of Health and Social Services
and private homes with the welfare authorities.
Most of the homes and hostels for unmarried mothers and their children
are provided by voluntary organisations, who employ specially trained workers
to help the mothers to plan their future.
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers. Many hospitals have their own Leagues of Friends or
similar bodies of voluntary workers who organise and undertake a variety of
services. Many hospitals also have help from the British Red Cross Society,
the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service, and
other organisations. The operation of canteens for out-patients, and trolley-
shops and book and picture library services for in-patients, visiting in the
wards, escort services in out-patient departments, and mending linen are
among the tasks commonly undertaken. The majority of convalescent homes
are, or were, originally provided by voluntary effort.
There are a number of private health insurance schemes, membership of
which has grown considerably in recent years. It is estimated that some
2 million people are now covered by these schemes. Subscribers who wish for
private medical treatment outside the National Health Service can insure
against all or nearly all the cost of hospital treatment and certain medical
treatment outside hospital.
THE MEDICAL,
DENTAL AND
ALLIED
PROFESSIONS
Only people whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors,
under the National Health Service. Apart from registered medical practi¬
tioners, only people whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise
the full range of dentistry in Britain; dental auxiliaries who have undergone
a two-year training course may do some simple work under supervision. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s experience
as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years,
at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession
is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is.
the General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956.
The British Medical Association is the main doctors’ professional association;,
that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children’s, mental, and mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes,
a two-year course. The examining body of the nursing profession in Great
Britain is the General Nursing Council, and in Northern Ireland the Joint
Nursing and Midwives Council. Midwives in Great Britain must have the
certificate of the Central Midwives Board, and in Northern Ireland of the-

Joint Nursing and Midwives Council. Most pupil midwives are already state
registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year
midwifery training period is reduced to one year and, for state enrolled nurses,
to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of
Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors
are state registered general nurses who have undergone at least the first part
of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s course in
health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Training of Health Visitors.
To practise as a pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist must have his or her
name entered in the register maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or by the Pharmaceutical
Society of Northern Ireland. Qualifications requiring four or five years’
academic study and practical training are necessary for registration. The sale

prescriptions can be carried out only by, or under the supervision of, a
registered pharmaceutical chemist. Under the Opticians Act 1958 a General
Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician and dispensing
optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practi¬
tioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes three years
followed by a year under supervision.
State registration is provided for chiropodists, dietitians, medical laboratory
technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, radio¬
graphers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards
(called, for example, the Chiropodists Board or the Dietitians Board) under
the general supervision of the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. A professional training lasting two or three years or more is needed
to qualify for registration. Only state registered members of these professions
may be employed in the National Health Service and some other public
services.
Medical social workers must obtain the certificate of the Institute of
Medical Social Workers, or have taken a recognised university course to
qualify them for membership of the Institute. Psychiatric social workers are
required to have a certificate showing they have attended the mental health
course provided at certain universities. Speech therapists need a good general
education and three years’ professional training.
Medical research in Britain receiving support from government funds is
carried out by the Medical Research Council, the universities and their
associated medical schools, and in hospitals in the National Health Service.
Further support for medical research is provided by private organisations, of
which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the Nuffield Foundation are
among the largest. There is close co-operation between the Medical Research
Council and these organisations to ensure the best allocation of their respective
resources. A considerable amount of medical research is undertaken by the
pharmaceutical industry (see also p. 207).
Local authorities in Great Britain have a duty under the Children and
Young Persons Act 1963 to make available such advice, guidance and
assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need
to receive or keep them in the authority’s care or to bring them before a
juvenile court. This help may include assistance in kind or, exceptionally,
financial help, and may be given through a voluntary organisation or directly.
However, if a child seems to be in need of care, protection or control because
SOCIAL WELFARE
I5I
of adverse circumstances in which he is not receiving the standard of care to
be expected from a good parent or because he is beyond the control of parent
or guardian, the local authority may initiate court proceedings and the child
may be committed by the juvenile court to the care of a ‘fit person’, usually
the local authority, till he or she reaches the age of 18. Local authorities have
a further duty, under the Children Act 1948, to receive into their care any
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been
abandoned or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or
permanently. A child so received remains in the care of the local authority
until he is 18 years old unless the authority finds it to his advantage to return
him sooner to his parents or guardian or to entrust him to friends. Both
categories of children are to be treated so as to further their best interests and
afford them opportunity for their proper development.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents,
who receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may
be placed in a children’s home provided by a local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses, on
housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of 12 or fewer children
live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband following
his normal employment. Other children may be placed in hostels or lodgings
or in other accommodation specially suited to their needs. The desirability
of returning a child to his family circle as soon as possible is fully appreciated,
and work is carried out to rehabilitate the family where this is necessary.
To carry out its functions under the Children Act 1948 each local authority
(county, county borough and London borough council or, in Scotland, council
of a large burgh) is required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s
officer to be responsible for the care and upbringing of children in the
authority’s care. Children’s officers are assisted by a staff of child-care officers
who undertake enquiries and who supervise children placed in foster homes.
Regulations for England and Wales safeguarding the boarding out of children
by local authorities and voluntary organisations and the conduct of children’s
homes have been made by the Home Secretary, and, for Scotland, by the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The cost of the local authorities’ child-care
service, including the provision of training for houseparents and child-care
officers, is shared between the local authorities and the Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern
Ireland) 1950 gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county
borough (under the general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) the
duty of caring for homeless and neglected children. Legislation relating to
children and arrangements for their care follow the same general principles
as in Great Britain.
War orphans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Security
(see p. 138).
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as Dr.
Barnardo’s, the Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic
Child Welfare Council, are constituent societies of the National Council of
Voluntary Child Care Organisations, to which a large number of smaller
voluntary homes are also affiliated. In Scotland a valuable contribution is also
made by the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other
voluntary organisations. Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations
152
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Adoption
(of which there are nearly 630 in Britain) are required to be registered under
the Children Act (in Northern Ireland under the Children and Young Persons
Act). The boarding out of children and all children’s homes, whether local
authority or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by the Child Care
Inspectorate of the Home Office, of the Scottish Office or of the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own homes
include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units, which
undertake prolonged and intensive casework with families. The old-established
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
counterpart between them maintain inspectors and visitors throughout the
United Kingdom for the investigation of cases of reported cruelty to, or neglect
of, children in their own homes; when necessary, they resort to law after
consultation with the local authority, but they prefer to achieve their purpose
by warning and advice.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,
in Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. Over 20,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 400 in
Northern Ireland. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in
Great Britain and by the Adoption of Children Act (Northern Ireland) 1950 m
Northern Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted children;
adoption societies (over 80 societies arrange adoptions) must be registered with
the local authority (in Northern Ireland with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
Local authorities, through their children’s committees, have had the power
since 1959 to act as adoption agencies and increasingly do so.
6 Education
Educational
Administration
Ihere are over 91 million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, colleges of education and technical colleges in Britain.
T he great majority of schools, attended by over 90 per cent of school children,
are publicly provided or assisted. Most technical colleges and other centres
of further education are also publicly maintained. Universities are autonomous
self-governing institutions but are aided from public funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although many of the older-established schools and colleges continue to
benefit from private endowments. In 1966-67 estimated total public
expenditure on education, including university education and school meals
and milk, was ^1,867 million, which was 13 per cent of all public expenditure.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning
of the present century. In 1833 the Government began to make annual
grants to the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the
Elementary Education Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory
education. By the end of the nineteenth century elementary education had
become virtually both compulsory and free of charge. Public provision of
secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England under the
Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 n°w governs public education in
England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems
both have long histories independent of that of education in England, but
the same general policy is now being implemented throughout the United
Kingdom, with some national variations. The governing acts are the Education
(Scotland) Act 1962 (a consolidating measure) and the Education Act
(Northern Ireland) 1947.
All aspects of education in England and Wales, and of universities, civil
science, sport and the arts (see p. 53) throughout Great Britain are the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science. (The
Secretary of State for Wales is concerned with the general oversight of the
national educational policy in Wales.) The Secretary of State for Scotland and
the Minister of Education for Northern Ireland have corresponding educa¬
tional responsibilities, except that the Secretary of State for Scotland is
consulted about Scottish universities but is not responsible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is
divided between the central government departments, local education
authorities, and various voluntary organisations. The relation between these
three groups is based on consultation and co-operation, both by direct contact
between the parties and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools who
act as liaison officers, particularly between local education authorities and the
departments.
The local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate
provision is made in their areas for the two stages of school education
(primary and secondary), and that those pupils who would profit by proceeding
to higher education are not deterred by lack of financial means. They are also
responsible for the provision of further education (see p. 160).
154
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SCHOOLS
Management
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher
of each school and the individual teachers (see pp. 155 and 156).
The Schools Council for the Curriculum and Examinations, representative
of all educational interests in England and Wales, acts as an advisory body
and carries out research and development work on curricula, teaching
methods and examinations in primary and secondary schools. In Scotland
a similarly representative Consultative Committee on the Curriculum
advises the Secretary of State for Scotland on the development of the
curriculum.
In England and Wales colleges of education (for teacher training) are under
the financial and administrative control of local education authorities or
voluntary organisations, but the organisation of courses is based on university
institutes of education.1 The Scottish colleges of education are under the control
of specially appointed governing bodies; in Northern Ireland they are under
the control of the Government or voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent of the Department of
Education and Science (and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Education);
the Government exercises its responsibilities in relation to the universities
through the University Grants Committee (see p. 164). Their governing
bodies are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters.
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive
efficient full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of
5 and 15. (The school-leaving age is to be raised to 16 in 1970-71.)
At present there are about 9 million school children at about 40,000 schools.
In England and Wales there were 7,274,500 children in publicly maintained
schools in 1966, besides some 125,970 others at schools receiving direct
grants from the Department of Education and Science; there were also about
449,780 children of all ages at about 3,340 independent schools. In Scotland
903,000 children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools and
over 18,400 were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland nearly 306,000
children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools; there were
few at independent schools.
The number of school children in Britain is increasing mainly because the
birth rate rose steadily between 1955 and 1964 so that primary school numbers
are very high. Each year, too, more children stay on at school beyond the
minimum leaving age and raising the school-leaving age will probably increase
the school population by 425,000. The school population is expected to rise,
altogether, by 2 million by 1975. There is, therefore, a continuing need for
more teachers and more school buildings.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to
be taught together in primary schools but about half the secondary schools
are for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales and in
Scotland, where most city schools take both boys and girls. In the independent
sector more than half the schools are co-educational; but of those providing
secondary education the majority are either for boys or for girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained
by local education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools
(mostly ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a

over their own affairs.

voluntary body, usually of a religious denomination,1 and direct-grant schools
w ich are completely independent of local education authorities but receive
a grant-in-aid from the Department of Education and Science. These last
(the smallest group) mostly provide education of the grammar school type-
they include some schools of ancient foundation. In Scotland most of the*
schools supported from public funds are provided by education authorities
and are known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of
independent school, see p. 158). There are also a few grant-aided secondary
schools comparable to the English direct-grant schools. In Northern Ireland
county schools, managed by local education authorities, and voluntary schools
under voluntary management, are both grant-aided by the Government.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
schools maintained by local education authorities (that is over 90 per cent
of the school population) and books and equipment are supplied free
The direct-grant grammar schools take pupils paid for by local education
authorities as well as those whose fees are paid wholly or partly by parents.
(For independent schools, see p. 158.) In Scotland education authorities may
charge fees in a limited number of schools provided that this does not
prejudice the provision of free education for all who are entitled to it. In
Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-
aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where qualified pupils
receive from the local education authorities scholarships which cover the
whole or most of the fees charged by the school.
In England and Wales there is no organisation of curricula or direction of
teaching methods by either the Department of Education and Science or the
local education authorities who are responsible for ensuring that there are
sufficient schools available for their area. However, teachers are advised by
Her Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools
including independent schools; they review and report on the content and
value of the education provided and are available as advisers. Local education
authorities also employ inspectors to advise on the schools which they main¬
tain. Further advice and encouragement for school-based research and
development is becoming available to teachers through the Schools Council.
In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same
as that of the Inspectorate in England and Wales. The extent and balance of
the curriculum is kept under continuous review by the Consultative Com¬
mittee on the Curriculum. In Northern Ireland the curriculum of each
grant-aided school is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Education.
In both countries considerable latitude is afforded in the scope both of the
curriculum and the teaching methods employed.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents wish them to be withdrawn. In county schools, and in
certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an
1 The local education authority is responsible for the running costs of all voluntary
schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools. Aided schools have
more independence than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost of
external repairs and any building work (see p. 159). Over a third of the 28,620 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools
^d the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are some 2,300 Roman
Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.

undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to
safeguards for the individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruc¬
tion are in the hands of the education authorities; in the more populated areas
there are separate schools for Roman Catholics. In county schools in Northern
Ireland clergy have a right of access to give religious instruction to children
of their denomination for a limited period each week.
At many of the independent schools services in the school chapel and
religious teaching, mainly Anglican, are an important part of school life.
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must
have the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service provides periodic medical inspection and
arranges, in co-operation with the National Health Service, for free medical
and dental treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local
education authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child
guidance centres.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all school children
who wish to have it, and the Schools Meals Service provides a midday dinner
at a subsidised price (remitted where there is need) to 68 per cent of the
pupils in county and voluntary schools. Education authorities have power to
provide free transport for children who live more than a certain distance from
the schools they attend.
Nursery schools provide informal educational and play facilities for a small
proportion of children between two and five years old but many more are
needed to meet the demand. Compulsory education begins at five when
children in England and Wales go to infant schools or departments; at seven
they go on to junior schools or departments. At present the age of transfer
from primary to secondary schools is n in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland (although a few local authorities have other arrangements); in
Scotland, where there is no division of primary schools into infant and junior
schools, it is generally 12.
The age of transfer was one of the subjects covered in the report of the
Central Advisory Council for Education (England) (see Bibliography, p. 500)
under the chairmanship of Lady Plowden, which considered primary
education in all its aspects. It recommended eight as the age of transfer from
junior (or ‘middle’) schools and 12 as the age when secondary schooling
should begin. Among the many other recommendations of the report were the
establishment of educational priority areas in the poorer neighbourhoods to
which more teachers and finance could be channelled; the recruitment of
teachers’ aides; and a large expansion of nursery education.
The content of curricula is very largely a matter for the schools themselves
and many interesting developments are taking place in the teaching of
mathematics, science and foreign languages as well as in physical education,
drama and art. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are no compul¬
sory secular subjects but generally a curriculum includes the teaching of
reading, writing, arithmetic, English, music, art and handwork, nature study,
history and geography. Additionally, in Wales, the Welsh language is taught.
(Children who speak Welsh at home normally receive the early stages of their
primary education in Welsh and are taught English as a second language.)
EDUCATION
J57
In Scotland the scope of the curriculum is outlined in the Schools (Scotland)
Code but it is for each head teacher and his staff to determine precisely what
is to be included and what part it is to play in their pupils’ educational
development.
Secondary
Schools
England and Wales
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. In 1964 the Government announced that
as a matter of national policy, all secondary education in England and Wales
should be reorganised on a comprehensive basis.
Comprehensive schools are not selective and provide a wide range of
secondary education for all or most of the children of a district. They can be
organised in a number of ways and the Government gave guidance on
acceptable forms in a circular issued in 1965. They include the comprehensive
school that takes the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; the
‘two-tier’ system in which all pupils transfer at 11 to junior comprehensive
schools and at 13 or 14 to senior comprehensive schools; and the compre¬
hensive school with an age-range of 11 to 16 combined with a sixth-form
college for pupils over 16. By 1967 there were 408,000 comprehensive school
pupils, or 14*4 Per cent of all pupils in maintained secondary schools.
The comprehensive system is replacing the ‘separatist’ system, which
consists of the following types of secondary school to wdiich children are
allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11 (hence the term ‘eleven-
Plus ) • grammar schools which provide an academic education orientated
towards university entrance (these include a small number of direct-grant
grammar schools); secondary modern schools which were originally designed
to give a general education with a practical bias; a few secondary technical
schools offering a general education related to industry, commerce and
agriculture; and schools providing all three, or any two types of education,
in separately organised streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
Scotland Secondary education in Scotland is also being reorganised on comprehensive
lines and by the middle of 1967, 30 out of the 35 education authorities already
had schemes of reorganisation approved. Where the ‘separatist’ system still
prevails Scottish secondary schools fall mainly into one of three categories
or are a combination of all three: (1) junior secondary schools providing
courses, normally lasting three years, for pupils likely to leave school at the
statutory leaving age (15, rising to 16 in 1970-71); (2) schools which, in
addition to junior secondary courses, provide courses leading to the Ordinary
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education; and (3) senior secondary
schools which provide Certificate courses of four, five or six years. The
responsibility for allocating pupils to secondary courses best suited to them
rests with a Transfer Board consisting of representatives of the education
authority and of teachers, and working in accordance with a scheme approved
by the Secretary of State for Scotland. A parent who is dissatisfied with the
Ttansfer Board’s decision may appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools, secondary (intermediate)
schools, which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England
and Wales, and technical (intermediate) schools, which offer the same
facilities as secondary technical schools in England and Wales.
Special
Educational
Treatment
Special educational treatment is provided for children who require it because
of any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment, either in
ordinary schools or special schools (including hospital schools). For children
i58

Schools

School
Examinations
at special schools attendance is compulsory up to the age of 16, and a number
of schools retain children beyond this age. There are about 1,000 special
schools in Britain, including hospital schools, day and boarding schools.
There are also boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary
schools.
There are ten categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted,
physically handicapped and children suffering from speech defects. There is
no separate category for the delicate in Scotland.
Independent schools receive no grants directly from public funds but all are
open to inspection and must register with the Department of Education and
Science (or the Scottish Education Department) which has power to require
then to remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation
or instruction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or
to be the proprietor of a school. In default, the Department can, in effect,
close a school but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent Schools
Tribunal against any of the Department’s requirements. The schools in
England and Wales whose standards are regarded by the Department as
broadly comparable with those required of the grant-aided schools are, on
application, granted the status of ‘recognised as efficient’. Such schools (some
i, 540 of 3,400 registered) contain about two-thirds of the pupils in independent
schools. There is no ‘recognised as efficient’ status in Scotland.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages and abilities; a high propor¬
tion, particularly among the recognised efficient schools, provide a boarding
education. These include the preparatory schools and the public schools.1
The preparatory schools cater mainly for boys from about 8 to 13 years of
age who are intending to enter public schools. The largest and most important
of the independent schools are the public schools, although the term includes
some, mostly direct-grant schools, which are not independent schools. There
are just under 300 public schools about half of which are for girls. The boys
schools in particular include a high proportion of boarding schools and it
is among these that some of the most famous schools are numbered. Fees
generally range between ^300 and j£6oo a year. In 1965 the Government set up
a Public Schools Commission to advise on the best way of integrating public
schools with the state system of education.
The minimum school-leaving age for all but children at special schools
(see above) is, at present, 15; it will be raised to 16 in 1970-71. Most grammar
school pupils remain at school until they are 16 and the rest leave between the
ages of 17 and 19. The number of pupils in all schools staying on beyond the
minimum leaving age has been steadily increasing, as has the number of
pupils who stay until the end of the secondary school courses and go on for
further education.
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils (and candidates not attending school) may take the General
Certificate of Education (GCE) or the Certificate of Secondary Education
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. They should not be confused with the state-supported
public schools in Scotland.

(CbE). The GCE, which is on a single subject and not a grouped subject
basis (that is, no subject is obligatory and individual subjects may be taken at
different times), is conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels.
Most candidates for the O-level are about 16 years of age, although many
take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most grammar, direct-
grant and independent school pupils and an increasing number from other
secondary schools take the ordinary examination, and passes in various
subjects are widely accepted for entry to courses of vocational training. The
advanced examination is at university entrance level (supplemented by special
papers to help university authorities in selecting students) and is accepted
also for purposes of entry to many forms of professional training. The CSE,
instituted in 1965* is designed for pupils who have completed five years’
secondary education but who are not taking GCE j it is also on a single subject
basis and is controlled by teachers serving in the schools providing candidates.
The highest grade of pass in the CSE is widely accepted as being of the same
standard as a pass in the GCE O-level. Control over the definition of scope
and standards of examinations is exercised by the Schools Council for the
Curriculum and Examinations (see p. 154) to ensure national comparability.
It does not lay down model syllabuses or examination papers but it puts
forward ideas and promotes research and development.
In Scotland courses in senior secondary schools lead to examinations
conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board.
School pupils in the fourth year of secondary courses sit an examination at
16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary grade of the Scottish
Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth year can obtain passes on the
Higher grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education. Examinations at both
grades are open to candidates who have left school.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Junior Certificate Examination
at about the age of 15, and the Northern Ireland General Certificate of
Education at about the age of 17.
School Building Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments announce the levels of annual building programmes, frame
regulations, fix cost limits and decide on the size and nature of the
authorities’ individual programmes in the light of national priorities; they also
offer guidance to authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
An extensive school building programme has been carried out in recent
years. This has resulted in the completion of over 9,600 new schools in
Britain since 1945 > together with extensions, alterations and remodelling of
existing State schools, about 5 million new places have been provided, at a cost
of about £1,200 million. In England and Wales new work to the value of
£131 million has been authorised for the year 1967-68, and £150 million for
each of the years 1968-69 and 1969-70. In Scotland the comparable authorisa¬
tions are £24 million in each of the three years and in Northern Ireland over
£6 million.
Grants of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost are normally available
from the Department of Education and Science for the building of new
voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to existing
aided schools. The Northern Ireland grants amount to 65 per cent of the
total cost of the expenditure by voluntary bodies on both new schools and
improvements.

The extensive school building programme has been accompanied by new
ideas and methods in design and construction. Industrialised building
techniques have been widely adopted. The new schools are light, airy and
colourful, with a high standard of finish and generous provision of teaching
area and outdoor games space.
Further education is a broad term which covers all education beyond the
secondary stage; it may be full-time or part-time, vocational or non-vocational.
It includes adult education (see p. 161) and higher education (defined on
p. 164). For convenience, advanced work at the level of higher education, but
carried out at institutions regarded as within the further education system,
is included below.
In England and Wales local education authorities maintain about 500 colleges,
including colleges of further education and technical and commercial colleges,
which provide courses at every level up to that of a degree. In 1966 the
Government announced plans to concentrate advanced work in a limited
number of institutions to be called ‘Polytechnics’ (see p. 167).
Four national colleges which provide specialised education appropriate to a
particular technology are administered by independent governing bodies and
financed by the industry and the Department of Education and Science.
They are the colleges for rubber technology; heating, ventilating, refrigeration
and fan engineering; agricultural engineering; and the National Leathersellers
College.
In Scotland there are about 100 local further education colleges offering
full- and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 13 central
institutions for further education doing advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 32 institutions of further education, of
which seven conduct advanced level courses.
Since most of the technical colleges and other further education establish¬
ments in Britain are either maintained or aided from public funds, tuition
fees are moderate, and often remitted for young people under 18 years of age.
Many full-time students are helped by awards from local education authorities.
The awards are generally based on the results of the General Certificate of
Education or a corresponding examination; they are assessed to cover tuition
fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who can afford to contribute
towards the cost are required to do so. There are also some scholarships
available from endowments, and others are awarded under schemes organised
by particular industries or companies for the most promising of their young
workers.
Capital expenditure on further education institutions in England and Wales
totalled j£i75 million in the ten years to 1966-67. In Scotland the total for
these ten years was ^24 million and in Northern Ireland over £4 million.
In 1966 there were 231,370 full-time and sandwich course (see below) students
and 1-85 million (including evening) part-time students in technological,
technical, art and commercial colleges in Britain (1-5 million in England and
Wales, 305,000 in Scotland and 56,760 in Northern Ireland). In 1965 the
total number of students on advanced courses in England and Wales was
149,700, in Scotland 14,000, and in Northern Ireland 2,460.
The courses provided are full-time, sandwich (up to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study

in a technical college and supervised experience in industry), block release (on
similar principles, but for shorter periods), day release (generally attendance at a
technical college for one day a week during working hours), and evening classes.
bandwich courses are popular at advanced levels. For lower level courses
day release and block release courses are replacing evening courses to a large
extent and are becoming more widespread as a result of the operations of the
Industrial Training Boards established under the Industrial Training Act
1964 to promote and supervise standards of training (see p. 433).
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and
occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of up
to five years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates
and Diplomas approved by joint committees consisting of representatives of
t e education departments and the appropriate professional bodies. These
courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary
National Certificate courses last two years part-time and students usuallv
follow them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level of the certificate is
generally considered to approach that of GCE A-level. The Higher National
Diploma, which requires a further three years’ full-time or sandwich study,
is recognised as being near degree level; the Higher National Certificate
(after two further years’ part-time study) is somewhat lower in standard and
more narrowly based. (For degree courses, see p. 165.)
Many technical colleges, evening institutes and independent colleges offer
courses in shorthand, typing and book-keeping. Most local technical colleges
offer some lower-level work in business and commerce; higher-level work is
generally concentrated in colleges with a department of business studies or
in specialised colleges of commerce. There are a number of courses for young
entrants to clerical and other non-technical posts including a two-year part-
time course leading to the Certificate of Office Studies.
Some business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; large numbers of the candidates taking
such courses do so through correspondence courses. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland there are part-time courses leading to the Ordinary National
Certificate and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies. There are
also full-time and sandwich courses leading to the Ordinary National Diploma
and Higher National Diploma in Business Studies. In Scotland, broadly
similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish Advanced
National Certificate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business Studies
awarded by the Scottish Council for Commercial, Administrative and
Professional Education.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of non-vocational education
for people over 18. In 1966 an estimated 1-3 million people registered for
these courses which were provided by local education authorities, various
voluntary bodies of which the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) is
the most notable, certain residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra
mural’) departments of universities.
The residential colleges, the university departments and the voluntary
bodies, such as the WEA, recognised as competent to provide adult education,
receive government grants. So too do various national bodies which promote
educational activities of a non-political kind, such as the National Federation
of Women’s Institutes. Many of these bodies also receive grants from local
education authorities for services rendered locally.
162 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A major share in the provision of adult education is increasingly being
assumed by local education authorities. Most of it is on a part-time basis,
mainly in the 7,500 evening institutes, which have a total of over a million
students, and also in schools of art, adult education centres, community
centres, literary institutes and youth clubs. There are 30 short-term residential
colleges in Great Britain, mostly maintained or aided by local education
authorities, providing courses varying in length between a weekend and a
fortnight. Many of the courses are practical, but there are widespread
opportunities for academic study.
The Village Colleges pioneered in Cambridgeshire and variously adapted
in Cumberland, Monmouthshire, Leicestershire, Peterborough and
Somerset are a local education authority development in rural areas. The
colleges are secondary schools planned also as community centres, providing
educational, social and cultural centres for adults in the areas served. Commu¬
nity centres, though aided by the local education authorities, are usually
managed by community associations many of which are affiliated to the
National Federation of Community Associations.
Six residential colleges (five in England and Wales, one in Scotland) provide
courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges
vary in character, although they all aim at providing a liberal education.
A number of voluntary bodies provide adult education as part of their
services. The Women’s Institutes and Townswomen’s Guilds, for example,
generally offer courses in social studies, arts, drama and handicrafts. These
too are aided by local education authorities.
In general, courses at the highest levels in liberal studies are provided by
the extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time
staff appointed for this purpose and can call on the services of other members
of the university staff; and by the Workers’ Educational Association, which
also employs organising tutors and works closely with the university extra¬
mural departments. In 1966 223,000 students in Britain attended such courses.
Similar work is also promoted in some of the centres maintained by local
education authorities.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in this subject. It is largely financed by contri¬
butions from local education authorities and assisted by a grant from the
Department of Education and Science. The Scottish Institute of Adult
Education is the corresponding body in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the extra-mural department of the Queen’s University
of Belfast organises and staffs adult education classes which are supple¬
mented by classes organised by various non-official bodies. The Workers
Educational Association is responsible for classes at other than university
level and receives grants from the Ministry of Education.
TEACHERS AND Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
TEACHING bodies or managers. In 1966 there were about 345,000 full-time and 36,190
part-time (equivalent to 16,000 full-time) teachers in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in Britain, an average of one teacher to 24
pupils; but because of the shortage of teachers, particularly those for younger
children, and their uneven distribution throughout the country, many classes
have more than the statutory maxima of pupils (40 pupils for primary and
30 for secondary school classes in England and Wales; in Scotland 45 for
EDUCATION
163
primary, 40 for classes in the first three years and 30 for classes in subsequent
years of secondary departments). The rise in school population has created
a need tor more and more teachers; although greater numbers are entering the
colleges of education (see p. 166), more university graduates are turning to
teaching, and many married women, formerly teachers, are returning to the
pro ession, yet more are needed if the Government’s aim of eliminating
oversize classes is to be achieved. In 1966 there were over 41,000 full-time
teachers in grant-aided establishments of further education in Britain, and,
because of the special conditions, many more part-time teachers. Most
teachers in technical colleges have had some industrial and professional
experience.
. There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland.
Teaching Aids
and Educational
Techniques
Radio broadcasts to schools and colleges of further education are well
established. In 1966-67 the School Broadcasting Department of the BBC sent
out 65 different radio series, some of which were repeated within each week
to make it easier for the schools to arrange their listening times. These
programmes were used by about 32,000 schools in Britain. Television reached
some 16,000 schools and the British Broadcasting Corporation and the
Independent Television Authority between them broadcast about 40 weekly
television series in a year, most of which were repeated.
Radio provides a great variety of educational programmes for adults, both
vocational and non-vocational; most of them are grouped in the ‘Study
Session’ hourly programmes on five nights a week. Television programmes
for similar audiences have grown fast; they are mostly shown on Saturday
and Sunday mornings and in the evening during the week. There have also
been a number of experimental projects sponsored between the BBC, some of
the independent television companies, universities, local education authorities
and a voluntary body, the National Extension College. (For the proposed
‘open university’ see p. 167.)
Both the BBC and ITA have educational advisory bodies and there is
consultation between the two broadcasting services to prevent duplication of
education programmes.
More recent developments include the use of aids which take over part of
the repetitive teaching functions, allowing more of the teacher’s time to be
devoted to individual pupils. There has been a rapid development in the use
of programmed learning and a National Centre for Programmed Learning
has been established in the Department of Education at the University of
Birmingham. Language laboratories (using tape recorders in individual
booths) are being used at all levels of the educational system. Most universities
in Britain use closed circuit television in one or more of their departments;
it is also used increasingly in medical schools, colleges of education, technical
colleges and schools.
Schools and colleges co-ordinate different methods of audio-visual
presentation, including radio, television, films, colour slides, wall charts,
maps, models and tape recordings. For example, the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’
programmes for schools use coloured film strips synchronised with sound
programmes. In 1967 the Government announced that a National Council
for Educational Technology would be set up to advise all bodies connected
with education and with training in industry and the Services on the use of
audio-visual aids and other media. The new Council will co-operate with the

and University
Colleges
existing National Foundation for Visual Aids, and will serve Scotland as well
as England and Wales.
The system of higher education includes universities, colleges of education
and advanced courses at various colleges in the further education system.
(Advanced courses are dealt with on p. 167 and higher education in
Northern Ireland on p. 168.) The expansion of higher education has been
accelerated by the Government’s acceptance of the target figures up to 1973-74
and the substance of certain other important recommendations of the
Committee on Higher Education under Lord Robbins’ chairmanship. The
Committee’s report, published in 1963 (see Bibliography, p. 500), suggested
that by 1973-74 there should be 390,000 places in higher education, of which
218,000 should be in university institutions. The Government has decided
that 122,000 of the remaining places should be for training teachers (see
pp. 166-67).
Further expansion of technological education and the selective development
of certain institutions is being encouraged. These include the Imperial College
of Science and Technology (University of London), University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology and Strathclyde University.
Colleges of education are undergoing the most rapid expansion of all the
institutions of higher education. It is now possible for some of their students
to take degrees by means of a four-year course.
There are 43 universities in Britain. Although the Government is responsible
for providing nearly three-quarters of universities’ income it does not control
their work or teaching nor does it have direct dealings with the universities.
The grants are distributed, and the Secretary of State is advised on university
matters, by the University Grants Committee, Avhose members are drawn
from the academic and business worlds. Universities as such are not repre¬
sented on it.
The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath, Birmingham,
Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London), Durham,
East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster, Leeds,
Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, Newcastle upon
Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, Southampton,
Surrey, Sussex, Warwick and York. Since 1967 the federated University of
Wales has included the University of Wales Institute of Science and Tech¬
nology and St. David’s College, Lampeter. The Scottish universities are:
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St.
Andrews, Stirling, and Strathclyde (Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there is
Queen’s University, Belfast (see p. 168).
There are three other institutions where the work is predominantly of
university standard: University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, whose students read for degrees of the University of Manchester,
and the two postgraduate business schools which are supported jointly by
industry and the Government. These are the Manchester Business School
and the London Graduate School of Business Studies, associated with the
London School of Economics and the Imperial College of Science and
Technology.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
EDUCATION

in^vTu'1168 administer themselves according to the terms of their
cha«ers or Acts their forms of government vary. Oxford and
Cambridge are each composed of a number of residential colleges which are
corporate bodies governed by their own fellows and distinct from the
“eTJhem or ^ *he, of the colIeges. however, are university
teachers or officers and the majority of university teachers are also fellows of
colleges. Only the universities have the right to confer degrees, and they
provide central libraries and laboratories as well as much formal instruction,
overnment of these universities is entirely in their own hands. The Univer-
wIlL°f fa11 (,WIth T* ?9l50° student, by far the largest in Britain) and
Wales are federal; academic and financial matters concerning the whole
university are controlled by the central authorities, which include lay
representatives; the constituent colleges and institutions manage all other
Tr for themselves. At most of the other universities, especially those
V 1Ck owe their foundation to local initiative, the lay element has an important
role m university administration. Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Keele
lave high porportions of students in residence. At most other universities the
proportion is less than half. Just over a third of all full-time students in Great
Britain are in colleges or halls of residence, slightly under half are in lodgings
and the remainder live at home.
University Finance
1 he Government contributes over 70 per cent towards the current income
o universities and about 90 per cent towards their capital programmes
Money for current purposes is given in the form of a block grant which is
allocated between the universities by the University Grants Committee. In
addition to those for building work, grants are also made for purchasing sites
and properties, for professional fees and for furniture and equipment. Further
sums are raised by the universities themselves.
Recurrent grants for the academic year 1967-68 are provisionally estimated
at some £147-5 million, over four times the amount for 1957-58 Capital
grants paid out during 1967-68 are expected to be about £75 million, or seven
times the 1957-58 figure. In recent years about 70 per cent of each year’s
capital programme has been for buildings to accommodate teaching and
research in the various faculties; over half for science subjects and technology.
The remaining 30 per cent has been for general service buildings, such as halls
01 residence, student unions, refectories, and libraries.
Studies and
Degrees
Courses in arts and science are offered by most universities. At nearly all
universities courses are available in one or more applied sciences: Imperial
College, London, University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, the University of Strathclyde and the former colleges of
advanced technology concentrate on technology although some of them are
now offering a number of courses in social studies, modern languages and
other non-technological subjects. About 43 per cent of full-time university
students in Great Britain are taking arts or social studies courses and 44 per
cent.science and technology; more than 10 per cent are studying medicine
dentistry and veterinary science, and the remainder agriculture, forestry’
architecture and town planning. J ’
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science five or six years are required.
The first degree of Bachelor (Master for Arts, in the older Scottish univer¬
sities) is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on satisfactory
examination results. Further study or research is required at the modern
J66 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
universities for the degree of Master and by all universities for that of Doctor.
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university. Diplomas
and certificates are awarded after shorter courses in some subjects.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific
subjects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials, the last
being a traditional feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research.
Students Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men, but at Cambridge their numbers are limited by statute. The general
proportion of men to women students is nearly three to one; at Oxford it is
six to one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
Despite recent expansion programmes, applications for places at universities
for arts studies still exceed the number available. Prospective candidates for
nearly all the universities apply for places through the Universities Central
Council on Admissions instead of to individual universities; this organisation
passes copies of each application to all the universities (maximum six) named
in it, sends the universities’ decisions back to candidates and then forwards
applications from candidates who have failed to secure a place to universities
known still to have suitable vacancies. The only students to apply directly
are Scottish candidates for the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.
At the beginning of the academic year 1966-67 there were about 184,000
full-time university students in Great Britain. Over 31,000 were postgraduate.
There were also in 1966-67 about 18,550 part-time students, nearly 90 per
cent of whom were working for university-level qualifications.
Staff In 1966-67 there were about 27,400 full-time university teachers in Great
Britain; about 10 per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to
students was about one to nine, one of the most favourable in the world.
Colleges of Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
Education education departments. In England and Wales the majority qualify y
undertaking a three-year course of studies at a college of education. 1 here
are also opportunities for college students to obtain a degree (Bachelor o
Education (BEd)) as well as a professional qualification by means of a four-year
course. University graduates and certain specialist teachers are qualified by
their degree or specialist qualification although many do an additional one-year
course at a university or college of education. There are special shortened
courses for well-qualified older students. In Scotland all teachers in secondary
schools must be graduates (or have equivalent qualifications) and must have
taken a course of teacher training but primary school teachers may qualify
by taking a three-year course at a college of education. Under the Teaching
Council (Scotland) Act 1965, a General Teaching Council has been set up to
take over almost complete powers over the profession excluding salary
matters but including the function of compiling a register of teachers,
admission to which will replace the former system of qualification by
ccrtifiCcitc
In England and Wales there are 168 colleges of education 16 of which are
for day students only; 28 university departments of education, 4 colleges
for training teachers for technical institutions and 16 art teacher training
centres. In 1966-67 there were over 83,340 students in colleges of education

in England and Wales (including 5,380 in day colleges), 3,910 in university
departments of education, and i,57° in technical and art training establish¬
ments. The total of 88,820 students is three times that for 1956-57. In
Scotland there are ten colleges of education; the number of students in
training in 1966 was 9,500 with a proposed increase to over 14,000 in 1970-71.
There is a target of 122,000 teacher training places in Great Britain in
I973-74- Measures to help provide enough teachers for the rising school
population are mainly aimed at attracting back into teaching former teachers,
now married, and increasing the numbers of part-time teachers. More day
colleges are being opened, some training is to be organised on a part-time
basis and there are more refresher courses, and more nursery classes for
children of potential teachers.
The education departments, universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short in-service training courses for
practising teachers.
Many students in Great Britain (over 163,000 in 1965-66) take advanced
courses outside universities in a wide variety of subjects including architecture,
art and design (see p. 222), catering, engineering, natural sciences and business
studies. The Council for National Academic Awards has powers to award
degrees and other academic distinctions to students who successfully
complete approved courses at educational establishments other than
universities. In 1967 there were 160 courses, most of them in science and
technology, but also in subjects such as arts, social studies, business studies,
law and librarianship. The Council must ensure that its degrees are comparable
with those of universities. The Council’s powers extend to the whole of
Great Britain.
In 1966 the Government announced plans for the establishment of
‘Polytechnics’. Each will be expected to provide eventually for at least 2,000
full-time students and will be developed as large and comprehensive
institutions offering full-time, sandwich and part-time courses of higher
education. In April 1967 the Secretary of State for Education and Science
announced plans for 30 polytechnics and invited the local education
authorities concerned to submit schemes for their establishment. It is hoped
to increase the number of full-time and sandwich course higher education
students in the further education system in England and Wales from about
40,000 in 1964-65 to over 60,000 in 1969-70.
Management studies are provided by universities and technical colleges,
by individual companies and by trade and industrial federations. (For the two
postgraduate business schools, see p. 164.) Certain independent colleges
specialise in management training. Several universities have introduced
management studies into the curriculum and courses for the postgraduate
Diploma in Management Studies are run by certain technical colleges. In
Scotland courses leading to the Certificate of Business Administration are
provided for students in junior supervisory positions.
In 1966 the Government published its scheme for the establishment of
an ‘open university’, A University of the Air (see Bibliography, p. 516),
offering degree, refresher and similar courses in which series of radio and
television programmes would be combined with other adult educational
provision. A planning committee has been appointed.
Awards
University and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the
national educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by

lack of means from taking an advanced course at a university or elsewhere.
About 90 per cent of university students in Great Britain are aided from
public or private funds.
In England, Wales and Scotland all British students with certain qualifica¬
tions are eligible for awards from public funds in order to attend full-time
at a university, college of education or major further education establishment.
In England and Wales local education authorities provide awards. In Scotland
students’ allowances for advanced courses are awarded by the Scottish
Education Department. The amount of award depends upon the income of
the student and his parents. Studentships for advanced postgraduate study
are offered annually by the Department of Education and Science, the
Science Research Council, the Social Science Research Council and by the
Scottish Education Department.
Northern Higher education in Northern Ireland is also expanding. The Government
Ireland accepted most of the recommendations put forward in 1965 by the committee,
under Sir John Lockwood’s chairmanship, on higher education in Northern
Ireland (see Bibliography, p. 500). The Government agreed that there should
be between 8,000 and 9,000 full-time university places by 1973-74 and is
establishing a second university, at Coleraine; it will be named the New
University of Ulster and the first students will be admitted in October 1968.
Technological studies are to be concentrated at the existing university,
Queen’s, Belfast, and the Lockwood Committee recommended that the new
university should concentrate on the biological sciences. The Government
also accepted in principle the committee’s proposals for teacher training. An
education centre for non-graduate teachers is to be established within the
new university and the general teacher training colleges are to be renamed
colleges of education and brought into closer association with Queen’s
University. Higher education outside the universities is to be centred on a
new Ulster College, ultimately envisaged as an association of the colleges of
technology, art and domestic science and other colleges providing a Northern
Ireland service.
Queen’s University, Belfast, and a recognised college, Magee University
College, Londonderry (which is to be integrated into the New University of
Ulster) had a total of 5,500 students in 1966-67. Between 1957 and 1966
nearly £10% million was spent on university building projects and further
expansion over the next 10 years is planned. Recurrent expenditure in 1966-67
was estimated at £2-3 million. Government grants are made by the Ministry
of Education which usually first seeks the advice of the University Grants
Committee. Teacher training takes place in one university department of
education and six training colleges, with 125 and 2,160 full-time students
respectively in 1966-67. Technological education outside the university
sphere is given under the sponsorship of the Joint Authority for Higher
Technological Studies. Under the proposed reorganisation this work will be
transferred to the Regional College of Technology and the Joint Authority
will be wound up. University and further education scholarships are awarded
by local authorities and postgraduate awards and teacher training scholarships
by the Ministry of Education, the conditions of award being identical with
those for Great Britain.
EDUCATIONAL Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
RESEARCH educational services is supported financially by the educational departments,
local education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and
EDUCATION 169
teachers’ associations. The Social Science Research Council is an additional
channel for government support.
The greater proportion of educational research is done in the universities,
particularly within departments or institutes of education and departments
concerned with sociology, psychology, statistics and problems of physical and
mental handicap. Outside universities, the major research institute is the
National Foundation for Educational Research, an autonomous body which
derives its income mainly from corporate members, including local education
authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities and from an annual grant
from the Department of Education and Science. There are also the Scottish
Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council for
Educational Research. The Schools Council sponsors a number of projects
in England and Wales.
There is no single central organisation for the co-ordination of educational
research, but the central departments, by their allocation of funds for projects,
exercise some influence on the direction of research effort. In 1966-67 the
Department of Education and Science had a total commitment of about ,£1 -6
million spread over 134 projects, and current expenditure exceeded ,£330,000;
the Scottish Education Department’s grant to the Scottish Council and other
research bodies totalled about £50,000.
Among philanthropic organisations that provide generously for research
are the Nuffield Foundation and Ford Foundation, the Gulbenkian Trust,
the Leverhulme Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust.
INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad and British teachers are encouraged to
serve overseas for a period.
Overseas
Students
in Britain
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1965-66 there were over 71,000 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about 16,000 were at universities, another 16,000 at technical
colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, doctors
and nurses, for the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About two-
thirds of all overseas students were from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers
from other Commonwealth countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan, the Governments of certain Commonwealth countries
have made awards available at their own institutions of higher education to
men and women from other Commonwealth countries. In 1966-67, 570
scholarships and fellowships were held in Britain, the highest annual total
since the scheme began in 1959; the Commonwealth Bursary Scheme also
achieved its highest total (544) of teachers and others training in Britain.
Examples of smaller government schemes are the Athlone Fellowship Scheme,
under which about 40 fellowships a year are awarded to Canadian engineering
graduates for up to two years’ further study, training and research in
institutions or industries in Britain, and the Indian Centres of Advance
Study Scheme in which, as part of a plan for establishing links between British
and Indian universities, academic staff from 12 Indian universities spend
a period with British universities.

Arrangements
for Overseas
Students
About 500 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one year in
Britain, are offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Twenty-four
Marshall Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are
offered annually by the British Government to graduates from the United
States of America and over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to
Commonwealth and United States graduates for two years of study at the
University of Oxford. Other universities and colleges themselves offer many
scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible.2
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are
available under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the
Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical
assistance programmes for many other countries. Large numbers of awards
for study or training in Britain are also made under the United Nations
Programmes of Technical Assistance and by the United Nations specialised
agencies such as UNESCO, FAO and WHO.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee, set up after the
Commonwealth Education Conference of 1959, supplements normal direct
dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. The last
Commonwealth Education Conference was held in Lagos in 1967.
The national representatives in London (Office of the High Commissioner or
Embassy) of a number of countries accept certain special responsibilities for
their students in Britain. The British Council acts as an agent for the overseas
departments of State in matters affecting the welfare of overseas students,
and provides certain services such as, meeting on arrival, introduction
courses, an accommodation bureau and student centres in London and other
university cities. The Council also organises a varied programme of lectures,
discussions and social and other activities. Many British people like to invite
students to their homes and the British Council arranges introductions. In
the vacations there are courses in many parts of the country which offer
opportunities for getting to know more about British life in town and country.
In term time there are visits to various places of interest, and theatre and
concert parties are arranged.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table,
the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the National Union of Students, the English-Speaking Union and
Churches of all denominations. The London Conference on Overseas
Students, for which the British Council provides the secretariat, co-ordinates
1 The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and other
countries. The Council is governed by an executive committee of 30 members,
broadly representative of many elements of the life of Britain and including nine
members nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds.
The activities of the Council, which has staff in 70 overseas countries, are concerned
with: English language teaching and other educational work including science;
fostering personal contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the
educational, professional and scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, libraries
of British books and periodicals overseas; and presenting overseas the best in the arts
in Britain. Its work in Britain is concerned mainly with professional visitors and with
the welfare of overseas students.
2 The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes every two years a handbook,
United Bingdom Postgraduate Awards (see Bibliography, p. 499), listing postgraduate
awards tenable at universities in Britain and awards at overseas universities for which
British students are eligible.

their work in the metropolis. In some London boroughs and in other large
cities there are committees which help students to make contact with local
residents and organisations. Similar conferences have come into being in other
large cities in Britain. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas
students and many of them have established hostels with the financial help
of the Overseas Students Welfare Expansion Programme which is admin¬
istered by the British Council. By the beginning of 1967 grants had been
approved for 95 projects, providing places for 4,200 students.
Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a number of
scholarships are made available annually to United Kingdom students by the
Governments of other Commonwealth countries for study in their universities,
colleges and other institutions of higher learning. In 1966-67, 61 scholarships
were held by United Kingdom students in 10 Commonwealth countries. In
addition the Study and Serve Scheme enables British students to undertake
a year’s postgraduate study at universities in the developing countries on
condition that they also work for a period in appropriate employment in the
country concerned.
For many years the United States has offered awards for British students,
the best known being the Fulbright travel grants for postgraduate study at
American universities. Notable among recently established scholarships are
the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study at three
American universities, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and
women in all walks of life. Thirteen Commonwealth countries offer awards to
British students under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan.
British students are also offered scholarships at institutions of higher education
in 22 European and seven non-European countries (see footnote, p. 170).
Over 1,150 teachers left Britain during 1966 for posts in schools, colleges of
education, technical colleges and universities in developing countries,
including 1,050 who left to serve in the developing countries of the Common¬
wealth. The number of British teachers recruited to serve in these countries
have nearly doubled in three years. Steps taken by the Government to
encourage school teachers to serve for a period overseas have included the
establishment of a National Council for the Supply of Teachers Overseas and
the introduction of special measures to safeguard their interests both while
abroad and on their return home. Recruitment is carried out by the Ministry
of Overseas Development, the British Council and the voluntary teacher
recruiting agencies, such as the Catholic Overseas Appointments and the
Overseas Appointments Bureaux.
There are about 1,000 British university teachers serving overseas, most of
them recruited through the Inter-University Council on Higher Education,
the Association of Commonwealth Universities or the British Council.
Government encouragement also includes support for the work of the
Committee on University Secondment and the Special Commonwealth
Awards, which are made to leading scholars from British universities who are
willing to work for a minimum of two years in important posts in the
universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside the schemes, an increasing number of graduate and qualified
volunteers, also cadet volunteers (school leavers), 1,722 in 1966-67, are going
overseas for one or two years, a large number to teach. Many of them go with
the support of voluntary bodies (co-ordinated under the British Volunteer
Programme) which receive financial assistance from the Government.

Interchange schemes, under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for
a year with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another
with Commonwealth countries, whereby each year over 100 British teachers
exchange posts with teachers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language
specialists.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for technical and
consultant services and specialist missions, through various educational
organisations and the Ministry of Overseas Development. For example, the
Centre for Educational Television Overseas (see p. 458) helps to advance the
education of adults and children in developing countries by means of
television, and the Oversea Visual Aids Centre in London gives advice to
teachers and others from overseas countries on all aspects of audio-visual aids.
Financial assistance is also given for building and equipping educational
institutions; recent examples include the £5 million grant for educational
development in Nigeria and the £1 million grant for the University of
Zambia.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people in the 14 to 20 age group, and to offer them
opportunities—complementary to those of home, formal education and work
—for discovering and developing their personal resources, so that they may
be better equipped to be responsible members of the community. Membership
of youth organisations is voluntary and the facilities they offer are sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
Responsibility for youth services in Britain is shared by the education
departments, local education authorities, voluntary organisations and the
Churches. There is no attempt to impose uniformity or to create any national
youth organisation. A number of youth organisations have spontaneously
developed over the last century, mainly by voluntary effort. Government
encouragement in England and Wales dates from the 1930s. In 1939 the Youth
Service (as it is known in England and Wales) was created as a partnership
of voluntary organisations, local education authorities and central government.
The status of Youth Service as an essential part of the educational system of
Great Britain was confirmed by the Education Act 1944 and the Education
(Scotland) Act 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth welfare work is promoted
under the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947, and the Youth Welfare,
Physical Training and Recreation Act (Northern Ireland) 1962.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative
and training work of some national voluntary youth organisations, towards the
expense of training full-time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises
and equipment of youth clubs provided by voluntary bodies.
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in
their areas: most give some financial help and lend premises and equipment;
most also employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and encourage¬
ment of youth work. Where voluntary services are considered inadequate,
EDUCATION
173
local authorities themselves organise youth centres and clubs. Most local
authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented.
In addition to grants received from the State and local authorities, voluntary
organisations may receive help for special projects from charitable trusts.
Most of the funds of the voluntary organisations are raised by their own
efforts.
Since i960 developments in the Youth Service have been greatly influenced
by the recommendations of a committee set up to examine the service, under
the chairmanship of the Countess of Albemarle (see Bibliography, p. 500).
On the advice of the Youth Service Development Council, formed as a result
of one of the committee’s recommendations, the Department of Education
and Science is making larger grants towards the headquarters expenses of
national voluntary youth organisations and special grants for voluntary
projects; it authorised a building programme for the period 1960-68 at an
estimated cost of ^27-5 million and co-operated with a local education
authority in designing an experimental club; and, to supplement existing
facilities, established a national training college at Leicester for youth leaders.
Local authorities’ contributions to the Youth Service have also increased;
their expenditure for 1966-67 was estimated at £6-8 million.
The Albemarle Committee’s inquiry extended only to England and Wales,
youth provision in Scotland having already been the subject of reports by
advisory bodies; but some of its main recommendations applied to Scotland,
while others reflected the existing Scottish position. The Standing Consultative
Council on Youth and Community Service has functions similar to those of
the Youth Service Development Council for England and Wales. Training in
youth leadership is available for full-time youth leaders and organisers. More
money is being made available from central funds to national voluntary
organisations in Scotland and, as in England and Wales, increased expenditure
on youth services by Scottish education authorities (estimated at £1 million
in 1966-67) is taken into account in calculating the Exchequer general grant.
The Youth and Sports Council for Northern Ireland encourages the
provision of facilities by voluntary and statutory bodies and advises the
Northern Ireland Ministry of Education. Grants are available for indoor and
outdoor amenities, for the training and salaries of youth leaders, and for
maintenance costs. Local education authorities also take an increasingly
active part in the youth service, both in running their own youth centres
and in co-operation with voluntary organisations.
The Voluntary The voluntary organisations vary greatly in character since nearly all of them
Organisations were formed to serve specific groups of young people; some of them provide
educational and religious activities as well as social and recreational pursuits
for their members, and all of them seek to inculcate high ideals of personal
conduct and service to the community.
Twenty-six national voluntary youth organisations with memberships
of at least 10,000 are constituent members of the Standing Conference of
National Voluntary Youth Organisations, a consultative body which takes
action only in the name of its member bodies and with their consent. A further
27 bodies are associate or observer members, for example, the Church of
England Youth Council, which represents about 273,000 young people who
are members of clubs sponsored by the Church of England. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary Youth
Organisations, in Northern Ireland the Standing Conference of Youth
174
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Organisations, and in Wales the Standing Conference for Wales of Voluntary
Youth Organisations. These major organisations have a total United Kingdom
membership of about 3 million young people under 21.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose
are the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s
Christian Association (YWCA), with about 52,000 and 18,000 members under
21 respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (150,000), the Church Lads’ Brigade
(12,000), the Girls’ Brigade (91,000), the Girls’ Friendly Society (19,000),
the Methodist Association of Youth Clubs (157,000), the Salvation Army
Youth Organisations (109,000), the Catholic Young Men’s Society of Great
Britain (15,000), the National Council for Catholic Youth Clubs (39,000),
the Young Christian Workers (18,000), the Grail (12,500), and the Association
for Jewish Youth (18,000).
The Scouts Association and Girl Guides Association have world-wide
affiliations; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good
citizenship in boys and girls. Their total United Kingdom membership under
21 is about 489,000 scouts and 574,000 guides.
The National Association of Boy’ Clubs, with about 2,000 affiliated clubs
and 165,000 members, and the National Association of Youth Clubs, with
over 3,000 affiliated clubs and 262,000 members, are concerned mainly with
the 14 to 20 age-group. Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all aim at
giving young people opportunities to develop into mature members of
society. Representatives from clubs form local committees and these send
representatives to the national members’ councils.
The pre-Service organisations for boys (the Combined Cadet Force,
Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps) combine social, educational and
physical development with training for possible entry into the armed forces;
their combined membership is about 125,000. The Combined Cadet Force
(CCF) contingents are based on schools in which education is continued to
the age of 17 or beyond. Training normally begins at 14 and the boys can
choose whether they will join the Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force
sections. The Army Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps are for boys in
schools that do not have CCF contingents or for those who have left school.
The Sea Cadet Corps, although not a pre-Service organisation, helps boys
who wish to make their career at sea; its membership is about 17,000. The
Girls’ Venture Corps, with about 6,400 members, formed in 1964 from the
Girls’ Training Corps and the Women’s Junior Air Corps, has an Air Wing
offering aviation courses.
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales
has about 34,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish
Association of Young Farmers’ Clubs has about 7,500 and Northern Ireland
Young Farmer Clubs over 4,000 members: in addition to encouraging
interest in agriculture and appreciation of country life, the clubs provide
training in the arts of citizenship and develop ability to serve the community.
The Welsh League of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership
of about 43,000; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among
the youth of Wales’.
The Youth Hostels Associations in England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have a network of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particu¬
larly intended for young people of limited means. They seek to promote
knowledge and love of the countryside, and are closely linked with each other
and with similar organisations in other countries.

Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross
Society, St. John Ambulance Brigade and the political parties.

Organisations
Concerned with
Youth Work
King George’s Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 by King George V, to
promote the welfare of the younger generation. Since its inauguration it has
disbursed nearly ^i-8 million to the headquarters of the principal voluntary
youth organisations and to many local projects, particularly those of an
experimental nature.
In 1967 about 114,000 young people between the ages of 14 and 20 took
part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, which is a scheme operated by local
authorities, schools, youth organisations, industrial firms and other bodies,
and is designed as a challenge to boys and girls to reach certain standards of
achievement in three progressive stages in leisure-time activities. The scheme
for boys covers sections on public service, pursuits and interests, expeditions
and fitness. The scheme for girls is divided into sections on design for living,
interests, and adventure and service. A number of Commonwealth countries,
including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, now operate the scheme.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains in Great Britain five schools for boys
which offer 26-day character-building courses, based on adventure and
overcoming testing experiences. There is a similar school for girls, with
modified courses. About 5,000 boys and 850 girls take part each year. The
courses are mainly for boys and girls aged 16 to 19 years; but there are also
junior courses for boys and girls aged 14 to 16 and senior courses for young
people up to 25 years old.
The aims of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish
Council of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association
bring them into touch with many youth organisations (see Chapter 19).
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large
number of town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for
general or particular purposes; photographic societies, folk dance, table
tennis or jazz clubs, for instance.
7 Planning and
Housing
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and it is
essential to plan land use for a satisfactory national distribution of employment
and population, to undertake a programme of urban renewal, to build new
towns and to preserve the amenities of the countryside.
From 1909 successive Acts of Parliament recognised the principle of the
planned use of land, but because the pattern of development over much of
the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban concentrations
the powers granted to planning authorities were inadequate for the task in hand.
The 20 years between the two world wars were decades of rapid social
and industrial change and of developments in industry, engineering, house¬
building, and motor transport; the population was increasing and becoming
more mobile; there was a widespread demand for improved standards of
accommodation and consequently a greater need for systematic planning than
had hitherto been required. At the beginning of the 1930s a major effort was
made to strengthen planning law and to extend the planning powers of central
and local authorities. This resulted in the Town and Country Planning Acts
of 1932 which remained the basis of planning law for 15 years.
Although inter-war planning legislation improved sanitary and environ¬
mental conditions and did something to preserve amenities, its general effect
was unsatisfactory mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the problems
involved in compensating property owners who stood to lose by the intro¬
duction of positive planning schemes. Local authorities often hesitated to
exercise their powers effectively for fear of being involved in financial liabilities
beyond their means, and as a result there was still much unregulated urban
development spreading over the countryside.
Renewed efforts to tackle these problems were made immediately before
and during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert com¬
mittees were appointed to study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth
and spread of industry, (2) the restriction of planning by the financial and
administrative difficulties of compensation and betterment and (3) the
encroachment of urban development upon the countryside. After the second
world war other committees studied the question of new towns and national
parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees
have now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament. The major Acts relating
to town and country planning are: the Town and Country Planning Acts
1947 to 1963; the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts 1947 to 1963;
the Land Commission Act 1967; the New Towns Acts 1946 to 1966; the
Town Development Act 1952; the Housing and Town Development (Scot¬
land) Act i957> tL® National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949;
the Local Employment Acts i960 and 1963; the Control of Office and
Industrial Development Act 1965; the Industrial Development Act 1966;
and the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act i960.
PLANNING AND HOUSING 177
Town and country planning in Northern Ireland is governed by the
Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931; the Planning (Interim
Development) Act (Northern Ireland) 1944; the Planning Acts Amendment
Act (Northern Ireland) 1944; the New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965;
the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965; and the Land Development
Values (Compensation) Act (Northern Ireland) 1965.
Planning in
Great Britain
Development Plans
Regional
Planning
The Town and Country Planning Act 1962 (which consolidated earlier
planning legislation in England and Wales), and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act 1947, are the principal Acts that govern the pattern
of land use in Great Britain. They provide for the co-ordination of planning
by means of development plans drawn up by local planning authorities and
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary
of State for Scotland or the Secretary of State for Wales; and they control
development by making it subject, generally, to the permission of a local
planning authority or of a central government department. They also give
extensive powers to public authorities to acquire and develop land for planning
purposes, and deal with questions of amenity, such as, the preservation of
buildings of special historic or architectural interest, and of trees and wood¬
lands, and the control of advertisement display. The Land Commission,
established in 1967, has wide powers to acquire, manage and dispose of land
for development, and to impose a levy on land transactions in order to recover
for the community a share of development value.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts local planning authorities
(in England and Wales, the councils of counties and county boroughs, the
London authorities and, in some areas, joint planning boards; and in Scotland,
councils of counties and of large burghs, and the councils of the two small
burghs of St. Andrews and Thurso) are required to prepare and submit
development plans covering the whole of their areas to the appropriate
Ministers for their approval. Each development plan consists of a written
statement of intentions illustrated by maps describing the major projects in
the plan and is accompanied by a report giving the background to the plan
in terms of existing land use, communications and similar matters. Plans
normally cover a period of about 20 years; they must be reviewed at least once
in every five years, and may be extended and altered at any time so that they
are kept up to date. Local planning authorities control development in accor¬
dance with the development plans. Proposals for changes in their plans must
be advertised by the planning authorities and the ministers concerned must
consider objections and representations from the public. Usually a public
local inquiry has to be held before the proposals are decided.
In a White Paper (see Bibliography, p. 501) the Government has announced
its proposals for changing the form of development plans so that the Ministers
will be responsible for approving the physical planning strategy for each area
while the local planning authorities will assume responsibility for the detailed
implementation of official policy in the preparation and adoption of local
plans. Changes in the administration of development control and of planning
appeals are to be made to increase efficiency.
Machinery for planning on a regional basis has been set up by the Govern¬
ment (see p. 248). Studies showing the economic and social resources in
several regions have been made (see Bibliography, p. 506) and certain areas,
where land, communications and facilities are favourable, have been proposed
as places where development should be concentrated.
i7B
The Location
of Industry
New Towns
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Provisions relating to the location of industry and offices have been made in
the Town and Country Planning Acts, the Local Employment Acts, the
Control of Office and Industrial Development Act 1965, and the Industrial
Development Act 1966. General problems of industrial development are
dealt with jointly by a number of government departments, but the consent
of the local planning authority is, as a rule, required for any new industrial
building, any extension of a building or any change in the use of an existing
building. Financial incentives to encourage the location of industry in
particular areas have been made available by successive governments (see
p. 264). Special control of office building in and around London and in
Birmingham was instituted in 1965 and has since been extended to the whole
of south-east England and the Midlands.
The New Towns Act 1946 (now consolidated for England and Wales in the
New Towns Act 1965) gave the Minister of Housing and Local Government
and the Secretary of State for Scotland power to make an order designating
any area of land (which may include any existing town or other centre of
population) as the site of a new town; in 1965 the same power was given to the
Secretary of State for Wales. The appropriate minister must consult the local
authorities in the area about the proposal and an opportunity is given for
objections to be made by the public. Once the site has been designated, the
minister appoints a development corporation (consisting of a chairman, a
deputy chairman and up to seven other members) to be responsible for the
development of the new town.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the
consent of the appropriate minister) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory
purchase, land or property within the designated areas, or, in some cases,
land near to or outside those areas, and they may provide buildings, roads and
services essential for the development of the towns. Ministerial approval of
proposals for development, given after consultation with the local planning
authority, constitutes planning permission.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and is repayable over 60 years out of the income from
the property. The corporations submit annual reports (which include
copies of their audited accounts) to the ministers who lay them before
Parliament.
As each new town in England and Wales is substantially completed the
development corporation is dissolved and its assets and liabilities are handed
over to a Government appointed central agency—the Commission for New
Towns—which was set up in 1959. The Commission has taken over respon¬
sibility for the maintenance and management of land and property in
Crawley, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn. No new towns central
authority has been proposed for Scotland, where new town development is at
a less advanced stage.
Twenty-four new towns have been, or are being, established in Great
Britain; nineteen in England and Wales and five in Scotland. Ten of the new
towns in England and Wales (Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Hatfield,
Hemel Hempstead, Stevenage, and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in
Sussex; Bracknell in Berkshire; Milton Keynes in north Buckinghamshire; and
Peterborough in Huntingdonshire) are designed to help to relieve housing
problems in the Greater London area. Of the others, Corby in Northampton¬
shire, Aycliffe, Peterlee and Washington in Durham, and Cwmbran in Mon¬
mouthshire are serving the special needs of their areas; Skelmersdale in
PLANNING AND HOUSING
179
Lancashire and Runcorn in Cheshire are to meet the overspill needs of
Liverpool and north Merseyside; Redditch in Worcestershire and Dawley
in Shropshire will take population from Birmingham.
It is estimated that one million Londoners will need to be housed outside
London by 1981. In order to meet this need the Government is considering
plans for the large-scale expansion of Northampton, and Ipswich in Suffolk.
Other areas which are being studied for possible large-scale growth are the
Southampton-Portsmouth region in south Hampshire and around Ashford
in Kent.
To help in solving the housing problems in Manchester, Liverpool and
Birmingham proposals are under consideration for the expansion of
Warrington, for large-scale development in the Leyland-Chorley area of
Lancashire and in the Wellington-Oakengates area near Dawley. Newtown
in mid-Wales is to be developed to promote economic growth in the area.
Studies are also being made of the possibilities of development in the Dundee
and Tayside area and the regions of the Humber and the Severn rivers to
provide for a rapidly growing population.
The Scottish new towns (Cumbernauld in Dunbartonshire, East Kilbride
in Lanarkshire, Glenrothes in Fife, Irvine in Ayrshire, and Livingston in
West Lothian and Midlothian) are helping to house people from Glasgow.
Livingston and Irvine are also to be centres for industrial activity in the
central belt of Scotland.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use.
They are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experi¬
ments, both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
More than half a million people have moved into the new towns during the past
20 years and an extensive building and civil engineering programme has
provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, churches, health centres and
libraries as well as public buildings including the town hall and law courts.
Roads, water supplies, sewerage, gas and electricity, police, fire and bus
stations, postal, telegraph and telephone facilities have also been provided;
most of the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various
kinds. All towns have become concerned with the increasingly high level of car
ownership of their inhabitants and are making more adequate provision for
parking and the segregation of pedestrians from motorists.
A number of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres
and, as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support,
offices and hotels as well as full entertainment and recreational facilities such
as skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming pools, sports stadia,
golf courses and youth centres are gradually being provided.
Under the New Towns Act 1946 Parliament approved a fund of £50 million
to provide for advances to the development corporations for work on the
new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts and now stands
at ^800 million; a total of over £505 million had been advanced to the
corporations by March 1967.
Town
Development
Schemes
The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of congestion
in large industrial towns in England and Wales (such as London and
Birmingham) by encouraging the transfer of population from these areas to
places suitable for expansion where employment is provided. Schemes have
been approved for providing some 132,000 dwellings in this way, of which
about one-third have been completed or are under construction. Most of the
expanding towns, for example, Basingstoke in Hampshire, Thetford in
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
180
Norfolk, and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, are already well established;
further large-scale development is to take place at Swindon in Wiltshire.
The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957 makes similar
provision for Scotland. Schemes have been approved for some 20,000
dwellings; about a quarter of these have been completed.
Urban The renewal and re-shaping of existing towns and cities is being undertaken
Renewal to meet the growth in population and the impact of more traffic. Glasgow,
for example, has started a programme of rebuilding 30 areas, housing nearly
a third of its population and accommodating much of the industry and
commerce of the city. The Buchanan report (see p. 348) which assessed the
conflicting demands of traffic and environmental standards has influenced
many authorities’ redevelopment plans. Special studies are being made in
Bath, Chester, Chichester and York to consider the particular difficulties of
preserving features of historic interest in ancient towns, in the face of com¬
mercial development and of the increase in motor traffic.
A centre for environmental studies has been set up by the Government to
advance education and research in the planning and design of the physical
environment.
Green Belts In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
special character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, the policy
has been adopted of establishing ‘green belts’ around all or part of certain
urban areas. Green belts are areas which it is intended should be left per¬
manently open and where, in consequence, there is a proscription against new
development.
Preservation
and
Development
of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and
Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of
State for Wales, and the local planning authorities. Lists of buildings of
special architectural or historic interest are being compiled (covering 180,000
so far). The respective ministers (on the recommendation of the appropriate
Historic Buildings Council) are responsible for administering the grants
available for the repair and maintenance of buildings of outstanding historic
or architectural interest. Grants totalling over £6 million have been made
towards the cost of urgently needed repairs to over 1,200 historic buildings in
England, Scotland and Wales. Under the Civic Amenities Act 1967 local
authorities have powers to protect areas of special architectural or historic
interest in towns. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is responsible
for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and (under the Ancient Monu¬
ments Acts) for the protection of ancient monuments of which over 700 of
the more important are in its care.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts local planning authorities
have power, for example, to protect trees and woodlands by means of tree
preservation orders (some 5,000 of which are in force throughout Great
Britain), to prevent mineral workings becoming permanent eyesores by
attaching suitable conditions to planning permissions, and to restrict or
regulate the display of advertisements in the interests of amenity or public
safety. Local authorities are empowered, under the Clean Air Act 1956, to
declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from chimneys
constitutes an offence.

Voluntary amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England,
the Association for the Preservation of Rural Scotland and the Council for
the Preservation of Rural Wales; the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths
Preservation Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Protection
of Ancient Buildings; the Georgian Society; the Pilgrim Trust; and the
Historic Churches Preservation Trust. The National Trust for England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, which was founded in 1895 and now has some
165,000 members, is (apart from the Crown and the Government) the largest
land-owner in the United Kingdom. It owns and protects from harmful
development 400,000 acres of land and some 190 historic buildings and
gardens for the benefit of the public—often acquired through gifts (some¬
times by arrangement with the Treasury in lieu of death duties, see p. 379).
With Government support it is at present engaged on a £2 million campaign,
Enterprise Neptune, to preserve 900 miles of coastline.
The National Trust for Scotland is an independent body founded in 1931.
It has about 31,000 members and has under its care some 70 properties,
covering in all about 70,000 acres.
The Civic Trust, financed through covenants from leading industrial
firms, was founded in 1957 to encourage high quality in architecture and
planning and to stimulate public interest in the protection of beauty in town
and country. It has, for example, produced plans for the redevelopment of
town centres and for a recreational area in the Lee Valley. The Trust makes
use of local initiative; it has separate sections in the north-east and north-west of
England and in Wales and Scotland and advises some 600 local civic societies.
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 provided that
selected areas of beautiful country in England and Wales should become
national parks, where the characteristic landscape would be safeguarded and
facilities for open-air recreation provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission was set up by the Act and given the job of
selecting these National Parks. Ten have been established: Northumberland,
the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North York Moors and the Peak
District in the north of England; Snowdonia, the Pembrokeshire Coast and
the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dartmoor in the south-west of
England. They cover a total area of 5,258 square miles, or 9 per cent of the
total area of England and Wales. They have various forms of administration,
based on representation of the local planning authorities of the areas in
which they are situated, as well as members nominated by the Minister
of Housing and Local Government or by the Secretary of State for Wales.
The Commission also has power to designate other areas in England and
Wales as ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’. By 1967, 21 such areas had
been designated covering some 3,700 square miles.
The land in these Parks and designated areas remains in private ownership,
but agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by
the local authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the natural
beauty of the landscape by high standards of development control, and by
positive measures attracting Government grants such as tree planting and
preservation, removal of eyesores and improvement of derelict land. In
National Parks, public enjoyment is promoted, for example, by the provision
of car parks and camping and caravan areas and the setting up of information
centres with the help of Government grants. All National Parks and some
designated areas have warden services.
182 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Responsibility for making proposals for long-distance footpaths or bridle¬
ways also rests with the National Parks Commission; once the proposals are
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government or by the
Secretary of State for Wales, it is the responsibility of the local authorities to
give effect to them. Ten routes—in all, nearly 1,300 miles—had been approved
by 1967. Large stretches of these paths are already public rights of way; the
first long-distance footpath to be completed (the Pennine Way, which
stretches for some 250 miles) was opened in 1965. The establishment of
further routes is under discussion.
In a White Paper, Leisure in the Countryside {England and Wales) (see
Bibliography, p. 501), the Government proposes to set up a Countryside
Commission to replace and extend the work of the National Parks Commis¬
sion. The new body will be responsible for promoting public enjoyment of
the countryside generally. Measures envisaged include the creation of
country parks within easy reach of towns to meet the needs of motorists and to
relieve pressure on the National Parks; and the increased use of reservoirs,
canals and restored derelict land for leisure activities. Local authorities are
also surveying coastal areas under their responsibility to establish which parts
should be protected and used for recreational purposes and which are more
suitable for development.
Although there are no National Parks as such in Scotland, five large areas
have been designated as national park-direction areas. They are: Loch
Lomond—Trossachs; Glen Affric—Glen Cannich—Strath Farrar; Ben
Nevis—Glen Coe—Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon—
Loch Maree—Little Loch Broom. In this way close supervision is maintained
over development in these areas and the local planning authorities concerned
must refer proposed developments to the Secretary of State for Scotland for
consideration.
It is also proposed to set up a Countryside Commission for Scotland under
the Countryside (Scotland) Bill 1967 to provide and develop facilities—
including country parks and long-distance routes—for recreational purposes
as well as to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the countryside.
Forest Parks The Forestry Commission (see p. 337) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven Forest Parks in some of the finest country in Britain: Argyll, Glen Trool,
Glen More, and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the Forest
of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and Wales;
Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park (adjoining the Northumber¬
land National Park to the west) which includes forests on the borders of
Northumberland and Cumberland in England and of Roxburgh in Scotland.
The total area of the seven parks approaches half a million acres. Camping
facilities are provided in all the parks.
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a Forest Park, is
also open to the public.
Nature Responsibility for nature conservation is exercised by the Nature Conser-
Conservation vancy on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council (see p. 212),
of which the Conservancy is a component body.
The Conservancy derives its powers in this field from its royal charter and
the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, as amended by the
Science and Technology Act 1965.
The Conservancy conserves wild plants and animals and the environment
in which they live (see p. 213). In July 1967 there were 122 national nature
reserves in Great Britain, covering 256,400 acres. The largest (covering more

managed by local authorities, using powers under the National Parks Act in
consultation with the Conservancy.
Thirteen forest nature reserves have also been set up; of these nine have
been created by agreement between the Forestry Commission and the Nature
Conservancy and are managed by the Commission.
The Council for Nature (established in 1958) is an independent voluntary
organisation of some 450 natural history and conservation societies concerned
with averting threats to wild life in Britain. It receives grants from the
Department of Education and Science and other bodies.
Under the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931 local authori¬
ties are empowered to prepare planning schemes for their areas in order to
secure proper sanitary conditions, amenity and convenience in the laying out
and use of the land.
The planning provisions of the 1931 Act are permissive, but the Planning
(Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland) 1944 brought under planning
control all land not subject to a scheme under the 1931 Act and empowered
local authorities to secure more effective control of development until planning
schemes came into operation.
Under the 1944 Act authorities prepare outline advisory plans which
indicate broadly the proposals for their areas and provide a foundation for
more detailed plans. The outline plans also facilitate the control of develop¬
ment until planning schemes are completed. Where application is made to
an authority for permission to develop, the authority may grant the application
conditionally or unconditionally or may refuse it altogether. In the event of a
refusal or conditional approval, the applicant may appeal to the Ministry of
Development for Northern Ireland (the department primarily responsible)
or to an independent person appointed by the Ministry for the purpose. In
1964 a White Paper was published proposing radical changes in the admin¬
istration of planning in Northern Ireland (see Bibliography, p. 501). The
Government intends to set up a Central Development Office with
responsibility for regional and area plans while local authorities would
prepare ‘action’ plans for projects within their areas.
Planning in Northern Ireland entered a new phase with the publication
of Sir Robert Matthew’s Belfast Regional Survey and Plan, in 1964, and the
Report on Economic Development in Northern Ireland, in 1965. These reports
have led to a greater emphasis on regional planning and their general thesis
of preserving and enhancing Northern Ireland’s physical environment has
been accepted by the Government.
The Government and local authorities are co-operating in limiting the
growth of the Belfast urban area; a development plan is in preparation. The
New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 provides machinery for the develop¬
ment of new towns and for the major expansion of existing towns. Craigavon,
in County Armagh, is being developed as a new city; plans are also being
prepared for the expansion of a number of other key towns including Antrim,
Ballymena, Coleraine, Londonderry and Newry.
The Ministry of Development co-operates with the Ministry of Commerce
in the selection of industrial sites in order to secure the best possible use of the
land and to facilitate the efficient provision of housing and other services, espec¬
ially communications, in connection with industrial development (see p. 266).

designate National Parks; to create nature reserves; to provide facilities for
visitors to such areas; to put areas of outstanding natural beauty or of scientific
interest under a special form of planning control; and to secure the clearing
of derelict sites in rural areas. Five areas have been designated as areas of
outstanding natural beauty. The Ministry of Finance has responsibility for
the preservation of ancient monuments and historic buildings.
There are two forest parks in Northern Ireland, at Tollymore Park, County
Down, and in Gortin Glen Forest in County Tyrone.
HOUSING
There are over 18 million dwellings in Britain: nearly 16 million in England
and Wales, 1,720,000 in Scotland and about 420,000 in Northern Ireland.
Over one house in four is owned by public authorities (in Scotland the figure
is almost one in two), nearly half are in owner occupation and most of the
remainder (mainly older houses) are rented from private landlords.
Between 1945 and March 1967 over 6 million new houses and flats were
built; one family in three now lives in a post-war dwelling. Most of the new
dwellings in Britain are houses (usually of two storeys); the remainder are
flats or maisonettes, mostly in blocks of from 2 to 20 storeys, although a few
blocks may be higher. High blocks are generally built in central urban areas
where they replace old, overcrowded dwellings. In the new towns and on
new housing estates they provide focal points and help planners to achieve
higher densities of population per acre where desirable, while still providing
open spaces.
Accommodation in a house designed for a family of four or five people
includes one or two living rooms, a kitchen, a bathroom and a water closet,
two or three bedrooms and a store. A typical 3-bedroom house built by a local
authority in England and Wales in 1966 had a superficial area of about 945
square feet and cost £2,782 to build.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in
England, by the Secretaries of State in Scotland and Wales and the Minister
of Development in Northern Ireland.
Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that the provision of housing
in their areas is adequate. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the
local housing authorities are the councils of county boroughs, boroughs,
urban districts and rural districts, the Greater London Council, the London
borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London. In
Scotland all town and county councils are housing authorities. The actual
building of dwellings is undertaken by the local authorities (or by building
firms under contract to them) and by private builders, usually for sale to
owner-occupiers. In recent years about one-quarter of the dwellings built by
local authorities have been of the single bedroom type, suitable for old people.
The Government has set a target of building 500,000 dwellings a year in
Britain by 1970—half in the public sector1 and half in the private. Although
1 In addition to local authorities, this includes new town authorities, the Scottish
Special Housing Association, a statutory body established in 1937 to erect houses for
letting to supplement building by local authorities (it now owns about 63,500 houses
and by 1970 will be building at the rate of some 5,000 houses a year), and the Northern
Ireland Housing Trust set up in 1945 for a similar purpose which has built about a
quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war houses.

the numbers of households and dwellings in Britain are roughly equal they are
unevenly distributed and there is a heavy demand for housing in the areas
of economic prosperity. There is also a continuing need for accommodation,
amounting to some 150,000 dwellings a year, for the growing number of
households as the population increases. In addition, it is estimated that about
3 million dwellings are required to replace slums and old houses which lack
essential amenities in industrial areas. A further y^o,ooo or so dwellings are
required to overcome shortages and provide a margin for mobility as well as
to replace losses due to redevelopment.
In two White Papers on the housing programme published in 1965, one
dealing primarily with England and Wales and the other with Scotland, the
Government said that the output of new housing in the public sector in
Britain should be expanded to about 250,000 by 1970, primarily to meet the
urgent need for low-rented accommodation in large towns.
Recognising also the increasing demand for dwellings for owner-occupation
the Government, in agreement with the builders and building societies, aims
at the provision of some 250,000 annually by 1970 in the private sector in
Britain. To ensure that a high priority is given to housebuilding by the
construction industries, control over less-essential building has been intro¬
duced. T. he Building Control Act 1966 provides for a licensing system
for certain commercial projects worth more than £100,000; an Order
has been made temporarily reducing the limit to £50,000. The Land
Commission (see p. 177) is helping to make land more readily available for
housebuilding.
Research into building techniques and into new methods of house construction
as well as into the needs of families, is carried out by the Research and
Development Groups of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and
of the Scottish Development Department, the Building Research Station, the
architects departments of major local authorities and the research groups in
big constructional firms. All government building research and development
is co-ordinated by the Directorate-General of Research and Development at
the Ministry of Public Building and Works. The National Building Agency,
set up in 1964, gives technical advice on housebuilding, particularly the use
of industrialised methods (see p. 287). Ways of increasing productivity are
under study by economic development committees set up for the civil
engineering and building industries and by a committee of the Ministry of
Public Building and Works, which is concerned with small builders who
undertake the maintenance and improvement of existing houses where, for
example, prefabricated plumbing and bathroom units can be used.
The housing programme is putting heavy demands on the construction
industry. A number of local authorities work in consortia to make the best
use of industrialised systems (with standardised components) in their house¬
building programmes. The Government believes that by 1970 some 40 per
cent of housebuilding in the public sector should be by these methods, which
offer the advantages of rapid construction on the site, greater independence of
weather conditions, and the use of fewer skilled workers than traditional
building methods require.
Control of building standards is generally exercised through regulations made
by the central departments, which also give guidance on design and layout to
local authorities.
186 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Central Housing Advisory Committee, a statutory body, issues reports
on housing standards. For example, the Parker Morris report (see Bib 10-
graphy, p. 501) suggested standards that should be achieved in new dwellings ;
those relating to space and heating have been made mandatory for local
authority housing schemes. A study of standards at which older dwellings
should be maintained has been followed by a survey of the condition of such
dwellings in England and Wales (see Bibliography, p. 502). In Scotland basic
housing standards are laid down in the building regulations; a report on older
houses there was published in 1967 (see Bibliography, p. 502). For building
in the private sector the National House-Builders’ Registration Council sets
standards and enforces them by inspection and certification. Many building
societies and local authorities make a condition that they will lend money on
mortgage (see p. 187) only for dwellings built by house-builders registered
with this Council or built under professional supervision.

Subsidies and
Rents
Private Purchase
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by
raising loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on
loans, is met from rents supplemented by subsidies from the Exchequer and,
in some cases, from the rates (see p. 76). Local authorities may raise loans
for housing either on the open market or by borrowing from the Public Works
Loan Board (see p. 77). In Northern Ireland local authorities, the Housing
Trust and housing associations may borrow from the Government Loans
Fund. 11
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for different purposes, have been
provided in Britain since 1919, when they were first introduced to enable
local authorities to build houses for letting at moderate rents. However, the
value of normal flat-rate subsidies has been eroded by rising building costs
and interest rates. A new kind of subsidy was introduced in the Housing
Subsidies Act 1967 which provides a basic subsidy equal to the difference
between the interest charge (at current borrowing rates) on a loan raised to
cover the approved capital cost of a dwelling and the charge if the loan had
borne interest at 4 per cent a year. For example, the basic subsidy payable on
a house costing £3,000, assuming a borrowing rate of per cent, would be
about £67 a year for 60 years. Supplementary subsidies are paid for high
building; to councils with insufficient resources to provide urgently needed
houses; for houses required in connection with a major transfer of industry,
for expensive sites; for precautions against subsidence; for building in certain
materials; and for overspill. Similar subsidies are paid in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland annual subsidies are paid to local authorities, the Northern Ireland
Housing Trust, new town development commissions and housing associations
and ‘lump-sum’ subsidies are paid to private people who build dwellings for
letting or owner-occupation.
In selecting tenants for council dwellings local authorities give preference
to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions. Rents are
generally low in comparison with current building costs. About two-fifths of
the housing authorities in England and Wales operate rent-rebate schemes,
under which tenants with low incomes or with large families are able to claim
a reduction in the standard rent. In Scotland over one-third of councils
operate rebate schemes, although rents generally are lower than in England
and Wales. The Government is encouraging the expansion of such schemes.
Loans to enable people to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are available from various sources, including building societies, insurance
companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities. The local

authorities are expected to concentrate their efforts primarily to helping
people with special housing needs who are unable to obtain loans from other
sources.
Building societies, of which there are about 600, are the most important of
these agencies. They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term
loans on the security of property bought for owner-occupation. Many are
now prepared to make advances of up to 95 per cent of the value of the houses
in certain cases. Loans are usually repayable over periods of up to 25 or even
30 years, by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. A
scheme to help people with low incomes to buy their dwellings on mortgage
was introduced in the Housing Subsidies Act 1967 and is due to come into
effect in April 1968. Under the scheme borrowers will have the option of
either claiming income tax relief on interest payments on their loan (as at
present—a system which helps people who pay a high rate of tax more than
those who pay little or none), or receive through the lending agency a
Government subsidy, whichever they consider to be of the most financial
benefit to them. The subsidy will reduce the rate of interest they pay by up to
2 per cent, subject to a minimum remaining interest charge which in most
cases will be 4 per cent.
In England and Wales dwellings may be bought on freehold or leasehold
terms. This means roughly that a freeholder buys both the dwelling and the
land on which it stands (there are special provisions for flats), while the
purchaser of a building lease buys only the right to the use of the dwelling
for a stated period, and agrees to pay an annual ground rent to the owner of
the ground for the use of the land on which the dwelling stands; at the end
of the period the ground landlord regains the use of the land and the owner¬
ship of the dwelling on it. Under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 lease¬
holders of an original long lease (more than 21 years) who have occupied a
house for at least five years may, with some exceptions, buy the freehold
compulsorily from the ground landlord at site value plus any development
value, or extend the lease for 50 years.
The Housing Act 1961 authorised Exchequer loans to approved non-profit-
making housing associations for the building of houses to let at unsubsidised
rents. This provision was increased and extended by the Housing Act 1964
under which a Housing Corporation was set up to stimulate the formation of
housing societies. Building societies advance to a housing society two-thirds
of the cost of each approved housing scheme, the Corporation providing the
remaining third. The housing societies build dwellings either to let at
unsubsidised rents or for co-ownership by a group of occupants. Co-owner¬
ship gives the occupants most of the advantages of house ownership at
a lower cost. The Corporation also has power to buy land for the housing
societies.
Private owners in England and Wales can obtain Exchequer assistance for
the improvement of houses or conversion of large houses or other buildings
for housing. Cash grants may be made by local authorities, with Exchequer
assistance, to people converting or improving existing buildings for housing
at a cost of over ^100 per dwelling. The grants may amount to half the cost,
with a maximum grant of £400 for each dwelling or £500 if a house of three
or more storeys is converted. Subsidies based on costs up to £2,000 were
authorised by the Housing Subsidies Act 1967 for housing associations in
England and Wales, which acquire, convert and improve dwellings for rent.
Housing associations in Scotland can also obtain grants.
188
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local authorities are obliged to make ‘standard grants’ for the provision
in houses built before 1945 of a bath, wash basin, water closet, hot-water
supply and food store; these cash grants cover half the cost of the work,
subject, normally, to a maximum grant of j£i55 (£>35° certain circum¬
stances), or smaller sums if some of the five items already exist. Grants for the
provision of some of these facilities may be made where further improvement
is not practicable. Grants for improvements to houses owned by local
authorities are available from the Exchequer but on an annual basis over
20 years. The Acts under which these improvement grants are available are
the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1958, the House Purchase and Housing
Act 1959, and the Housing Acts 1961 and 1964. Over one million grants were
made between 1949 and March 1967.
Improvement grants and standard grants are also provided in Scotland and
Northern Ireland with, in addition, provision for accommodation for farmers,
agricultural workers and approved workers.
Local authorities also have power to make loans under the Housing Acts for
the acquisition, conversion, improvement, repair and alteration of houses.
Under the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959 they may make loans of up
to 100 per cent of the house’s value.
Control of Rents Rent control was originally introduced in 1915 as a temporary war-time
measure and successive Acts have varied its scope. Under the Rent Act 1957
there was a large measure of decontrol but the Rent Act 1965 re-introduced
control over most privately rented unfurnished dwellings—those of annual
rateable value up to £400 in London and fzoo elsewhere. Tenants have a
wide degree of security of tenure and the rent may be fixed on application
by landlord or tenant. Rents are determined by locally appointed rent officers
or, if the landlord or tenant objects to the rent determined by the rent officer,
by independent rent assessment committees appointed by the Minister
concerned. Once determined, the rent is not normally reviewed for at least
three years. For furnished premises under the rateable value limits a tenant
may go to a rent tribunal for determination of a reasonable rent and may be
given security of tenure for up to six months with a possibility of further
periods if the tribunal so decides. Eviction without a court order from fur¬
nished or unfurnished premises of any rateable value and harassment of
occupiers are criminal offences with severe penalties.
Measures of control and de-control also apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951
and 1956 legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the
rent of certain controlled houses. The 195^ Act also released from control
houses with a net annual value of over £$0 (with certain safeguards) and
houses with a net annual value of over £26 of which the landlord was in
actual possession when the Act came into force, or of which he subsequently
obtained possession.
Slum Clearance About two million people have been rehoused since the mid-1950s as a result
of slum clearance programmes. It is expected that in about ten years’ time
the great majority of the housing authorities in Great Britain will have
succeeded in getting rid of all their present slums. In certain areas, however,
particularly the older industrial towns, including Birmingham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Manchester, four of the biggest cities in the country, the
proportion of unfit houses is so high that clearance may take much longer.
Local authorities with major slum and overcrowding problems are being given
priority to clear their slums and to undertake major programmes of urban
renewal. Their housing programmes for the next few years have been doubled
PLANNING AND HOUSING
189
or trebled compared with recent years and the ministers are making more
building land available to them by the designation of new towns nearby.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists,
or can be provided by them, for people displaced from slum clearance areas.
Where an unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the
owner retains his land, he normally receives no compensation. If the local
authorities acquire an unfit property in order to demolish it themselves and to
rebuild on the land, the normal basis of compensation is the market value
of the house as it stands or the value of the site after clearance, whichever
is the less. The slum clearance code provides for special payments for con¬
demned houses which have been wrell maintained. Additional payments may
also be made in certain cases to owner-occupiers and business occupiers.
8 The Churches
The Church of
England
Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom and
may manifest his faith in teaching, worship and observance without inter¬
ference from the community or the State. Churches and religious societies
of all kinds may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs
in speech and in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from
the seventeenth century onwards; in many cases relaxation in the adminis¬
tration of laws discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the
repeal of the legislation concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with
the passing of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration
Act of 1688 granted freedom of worship to Protestant dissenters. In 1828
the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed nonconformists from
political disabilities and made it possible for them to be appointed to public
offices; Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act 1829; the Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled Jews to become
members of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed on
prospective students and members of the academic staff of the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were successively abolished by Acts of
1854, 1856 and 1871. Nowadays, there is no religious or denominational bar
to the holding of public office, except in the case of the Lord Chancellor,
where there is some doubt whether existing statutory provisions would permit
this office to be held by a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principle ministrations and
are paid a salary by the State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman
Catholic Church and ministers of other denominations may also be appointed
or specially called in as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 154) provided by
churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained
from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries
are made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official
returns, and each church adopts different criteria in counting its members.
The membership figures given in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The Church of England is the established church, and claims to be the
ancient catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth
century, it repudiated the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic
episcopate, and the creeds and sacraments upon which its doctrines are based;
therefore it claims to be both ‘catholic’ and ‘reformed’. Its form of worship
is embodied in the Book of Common Prayer, which was first compiled in 1549.
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown in that the Sovereign, who
must be a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the
Faith’ (a statutory title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or
her accession to uphold it. The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by
the Archbishop of Canterbury; prayers for the Sovereign and other members

I9I
of the royal family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; Church
of England archbishops, bishops and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on
the advice of the Prime Minister1; and all clergymen take the oath of
allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is also linked with the State through the House of Lords,
in which the archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 senior diocesan
bishops have seats (see p. 34). This makes it possible for the views of the
Church leaders to be expressed freely on any moral issue raised in connection
with the corporate conduct of the State as well as on specifically ecclesiastical
issues—a matter of particular significance in view of the fact that the clergy
of the Church of England (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the
Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are legally disqualified
from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church must obtain Parliament’s consent2 to change its form of
worship, as laid down in the authorised Book of Common Prayer; canons
(Church rules) cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen;
and the Measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from its regulations)
also require parliamentary approval and the Royal Assent.
The Church of England is organised by geographical areas into two provinces
and 43 dioceses. The Province of Canterbury contains 29 dioceses and that
of York 14. Each diocese is subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which
there are about 14,400 in all. The Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of
All England and bishop of his own diocese of Canterbury; the Archbishop of
York is styled Primate of England and is bishop of his own diocese of York.
The baptised membership of the Church is about 27^ million, that is two-
thirds of the population born and resident in the two provinces but only about
35 per cent of this number is confirmed.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative
bodies in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of
Canterbury and York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting
of an upper house of bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each
cathedral chapter, archdeacons and elected clergy. The Convocations meet
not oftener than three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the
National Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the
Church Assembly. It was set up in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations,
and was given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England
Assembly (Powers) Act 1919. It can discuss any matter connected with
the Church of England, but may not make any doctrinal statements, nor
infringe upon the rights of the Convocations. It consists of three houses:
bishops, clergy and laity. The first two houses are composed of the members
of the Convocations; the house of laity consists of men and women elected
every five years by the lay members of diocesan conferences, and the con¬
stitution allows for ten co-opted members.3 * * *
1 The Church Assembly has appointed a commission to consider what constitutional
modifications are desirable and practicable in the present relationship between Church
and State.
2 Consent has been obtained for the experimental use of alternative forms, if and when
authorised by the Church.
3 A reconstituted Church Assembly, which would take over the authority of the
Convocations of Canterbury and York and would bring the laity into closer contact
with the clergy in all church matters, has been proposed by a commission set up by the
Archbishops of Canterbury7 and York to work out a form of synodical government for
the Church of England.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after
passing through various stages in the Assembly, are presented to an ecclesias¬
tical committee of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 3° members,
of whom 15 are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker
of the House of Commons. This committee lays the measures, together with
a report upon them, before both Houses. If both Houses so resolve, the
measure is sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, after which it has the
same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though it may
reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting
of boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work,
such as education, recruitment and training for the ministry,1 and Church work
at home and overseas. The Church Assembly, through the Schools Council
of its Board of Education, is responsible for some 7,100 Church of England
schools of all types, for approximately half of which the Church bears a
quarter of the cost of improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity with
the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils
are appointed by the parochial electors, that is persons who are baptised, are not
members of any other church, are 17 years of age and over, and have applied for
membership of the electoral roll of the parish where they habitually reside or
worship. The estimated number on the parish electoral rolls is about 2f million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction
today consists largely of faculty cases, with very occasional cases of discipline
against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is necessary
for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church
or to a churchyard.
There are 25 Church colleges of education in England and two in Wales,
all of which are run by independent governing bodies. With substantial
grants from the Department of Education and Science a major programme of
expansion, including the opening of two new colleges, has been taking place;
this has raised the total number of students in the colleges to over 15,000.
The cost to the Church, mainly from funds provided by the Church Assembly,
has been about £3 million.
The Church Assembly has also completed a programme of modernising
and improving theological colleges (of which there are 26) and establishments
for the training of women in the pastoral work of the Church, and has provided
grants for the greater part of the cost.
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an
annual apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly
contributes to the Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority
is the diocesan board of finance, which administers the money contributed
by the parishes, and acts as trustee on behalf of the parochial church councils,
which have only limited powers of holding property. The Central Board of
Finance administers the Church Assembly Fund, supported by diocesan
contributions, and devoted to the maintenance of central services, including
capital expenditure on training colleges and theological colleges and the
grants for training candidates for ordination.
The State makes no payment direct to the Church as such, though it
pays for the services of chaplains in the armed forces and in prisons and
1 A commission, consisting of not more than 20 members (bishops, clergy and laity) has
issued a report on the reforms necessary in the deployment and payment of the clergy.

hospitals, and contributes substantially to the maintenance of Church schools
and training colleges.
The endowment income of the Church is mainly administered by the
Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the payment of
clergy stipends (which average just over ^1,200 a year for rectors and vicars)
and the provision of finance for pensions. The total net income from the
Commissioners investments (just over £21 million in 1966) has greatlv
increased during the past ten years; in broad terms, this has meant a rise in
the stipends of the poorer clergy and that the Commissioners have been able
to embark on schemes of assistance for providing better parsonage houses,
for Church buildings in new areas of population, and for better pensions for
clergy and their widows. The present basic pension for a clergyman is ^550
a year and ^275 f°r a clergy widow. Retired Church dignitaries receive larger
pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 19 autonomous provinces in the United
Kingdom and overseas and two regional councils overseas with a total
membership of over 40 million.
In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of England,
there are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales:
the Church of Ireland has 14 dioceses; the Episcopal Church in Scotland,
7 dioceses and some 98,000 members; and the Church in Wales 6 dioceses
and some 165,500 Easter communicants.
The Lambeth Conference for unofficial consultation between all Anglican
bishops meets every ten years; its next meeting is in 1968. The conference is
presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury; it has no executive authority,
but enjoys great moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline,
relations with other communions, and on the attitude of the Anglican Churches
to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Executive Officer of the Anglican Communion is the secretary of the
Anglican Advisory Council on Missionary Strategy, and exercises general
supervision on behalf of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference
over all matters affecting the welfare of the Anglican Communion which
call for attention between the meetings of the conference.
The established church in Scotland is the presbyterian Church of Scotland.
It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is
established and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union
1707, was further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act 1921, under which
it has complete internal self-government within the terms of the schedule to the
Act, ‘Articles Declaratory of the Faith of the Church of Scotland’.
Whereas in episcopacy church government is a hierarchy of persons, in
Presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal
status, and each of the 1,994 charges is governed locally by the Kirk Session,
consisting of the minister and elected elders (of whom there are about 48,660);
above this is the Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and
finally the General Assembly, which meets annually and consists of elected
ministers and elders presided over by an elected Moderator who serves for
one year. The Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly by the
Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has complete freedom in
all spiritual matters and the right to appoint its own officers and to decide
all matters of doctrine and discipline. Its decisions are not subject to
parliamentary debate or modification.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has given the
Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of Scotland
is estimated at about 1,233,800.
The Free
Churches
The Methodist
Churches
The Congregational
and Baptist
Churches
The Unestablished
Presbyterian
Churches
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as nonconformist
churches; and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established
Church of Scotland), Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches
are the Methodist, Baptist and Congregational Churches, and the unestabhshed
presbyterian churches throughout Britain. In addition, there are a number
of other protestant denominations in the United Kingdom as well as such
religious associations as the Society of Friends and the Salvation Army,
which have certain links with the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies
and practices of the established church. In general, the Free Churches base
their reason for existence on their distinctive convictions regarding organisa¬
tion and worship.
The largest of the Free Churches, the Methodist Church, which originated
in the eighteenth century following the evangelical revival by John Wesley,
took its present form in 1932, with the union of the majority of separate
Methodist Churches. It has over 690,000 adult full members. The supreme
authority is the annual conference and the system of government is in many
ways presbyterian, the leaders’ meeting corresponding to the kirk sessions,
with circuit meetings and district synods resembling presbytery and synod.
One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay
leadership. There are some 23,500 trained lay preachers sharing the work of
about 4,100 ministers and preaching in many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the
Independent Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary
basis and women (many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men,
and the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 5,500 members) which, while
retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives autonomy to each of its
157 individual churches.
The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain.
In 1831 most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union
(which in 1966 was reconstituted as the Congregational Church in England
and Wales). Local churches have formed county and national unions, whose
secretariat and assemblies have much influence, but no compulsive authority
over them, since great importance is attached to the autonomy of local church
meetings. Adult membership is approximately 198,000.
Like the Congregationalists, the Baptists are for the most part grouped
in associations of churches and the majority of these belong to the Baptist
Union formed in 1813. Baptists differ from Congregationalists in that they
practise the baptism of believers only; they do not baptise infants. The
Baptist Churches have about 290,300 members.
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a membership in Northern Ireland
of about 130,000. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of
Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in
I735> numbers some 122,600. The Presbyterian Church of England has nearly
68,000 members; its highest court is its general assembly; women are
admitted to the eldership and ministry.

Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of
Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church
of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian
Church of Ireland.
Among other Protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the
Unitarian and Free Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also
in the United States of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an
organised community in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the
British Province of the Moravian Church, which is an international missionary
church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which
was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; the Society
of Friends; and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends (Quakers) came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. A distinctive feature
is the way of worship: outward sacraments are not observed and there is no
separate ministry. The Society places great emphasis on work for peace, and
their influence in many parts of the world, especially in social reform and in the
relief of suffering, is very wide in relation to their numbers. There are 433
Quaker Meetings in Britain and over 21,000 members; and the Society has
nine schools (the pupils and staff of which are not exclusively Quaker).
The Salvation Army, founded in 1865 (as the Christian Mission), is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual
and social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to
those hitherto untouched by religious effort. The movement, in which
military rather than ecclesiastical terminology is used, has branches all over
the world, and its social work (particularly that connected with the welfare of
members of the British armed forces serving overseas) is well supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other
church, have about 330 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became
temporarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the
Scottish hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was
restored in 1878, while the Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct.
The normal government of the Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial
archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule in the whole of the United
Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation
is the province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an
archbishop. The chairman of the Bishops’ Conference in England and Wales is
the Archbishop of Westminster. A province normally comprises several
dioceses, each under a bishop aided by a chapter of canons and others, and
by priests in charge of the parishes into which the diocese is subdivided. In
England and Wales there are five provinces and archdioceses (Westminster,
Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiff and Southwark), 14 dioceses, and nearly
2,300 parishes; in Scotland there are two provinces and archdioceses (St.
Andrews and Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and about 400 parishes;
in Northern Ireland there are six dioceses (several of which have territory
partly in the Irish Republic and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one
hierarchy for the whole of Ireland) and about 170 parishes. In the whole of
the United Kingdom there are some five million adherents (including children)
to the Roman Catholic faith.
196
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education
of its children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between its own members and members of any other denomination should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children
in the United Kingdom are staffed by members of the religious orders for
men and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing,
child care, and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jewry Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being
the Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth
century an Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was
established, which increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial
cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on
the Continent during the second world war, the present Anglo-Jewish com¬
munity of some 450,000 is the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought,
each of which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox
(the original groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches
less religious importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the
Jewish faith, began in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of
the Liberal Jewish Movement which, in addition, lays emphasis on the re-inter¬
pretation of traditional Judaism in the light of modern thought and custom. Of
the Jews in Great Britain who belong to any kind of synagogue, about 80 per
cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group (Ashkenazi)
within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain number approximately 250. There has been an
increase in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now
attended by about one in seven Jewish children; other Jewish children attend
the ordinary State or independent schools and receive extra-curricular
instruction in the Jewish faith.
Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and
foreign countries have established centres for worship for their own communi¬
ties in the United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian
communities include the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with
some Estonian and Latvian Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There
are also churches belonging to the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Norway and Sweden, and centres where Estonian, Latvian and
Polish Lutherans worship according to their creed. In addition, the French,
Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed Churches are represented in
Britain, the first three having their own places of worship. There are also a
number of other religious sects of British or foreign origin; figures of
membership in Britain of most of them are not available.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims and the Buddhists.
The Muslims are the more widely represented, their number in Britain
being estimated at about 250,000, of whom over 90,000 are in London where
the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre, the Shiah Islamic
Assembly Centre and the East London Mosque are situated. The Shah
Jehan Mosque is at Woking, Surrey, and there are mosques or Islamic centres
in many of Britain’s larger cities.

There are several thousand adherents of Buddhism in Britain. The Buddhist
Society has its headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room; there are also
Shrine Rooms in the three Viharas in London, one of which is run by Thai
monks and supported by the Thai Government.
The British Council of Churches, composed of official representatives
from almost all the churches of the British Isles, with observers from the
Roman Catholic Church, and presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
facilitates common action between the churches and seeks to further the cause
of Christian unity. In addition, most, though not all, of the Free Churches in
England and Wales are members of the Free Church Federal Council, the
aims of which are to promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches,
and to provide a channel through which the Free Churches can communicate
and negotiate with central and local government authorities as a united body.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also
participate in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at
Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948. The council links together 226 churches in
over 70 countries for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding
between members of the two religions and deals with problems arising in the
social field.

Sciences and the Arts
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research as a
whole though private industry contributes a larger proportion of funds for
civil research. Considerable sums are also provided by public corporations,
independent trusts and foundations, and learned societies. The Government
also keeps under review facilities for training scientists and ensures that
adequate research is directed to matters of national interest.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
The Pattern of
Expenditure
According to Statistics of Science and Technology 1966 (see Bibliography, p. 504)
total expenditure on research and development has risen from £300 rnillion
in 1955-56 to £771 million in 1964-65. This represents 2-7 per cent of the
gross national product. The percentage of the total carried out by government
agencies has continued to decline, falling to 24^9 Per cen^ compared with
28-7 per cent nine years previously. This is due to a relative drop in the
proportion accounted for by defence. Research carried out in the universities
has risen from £14-4 million in 1955-56 t0 lSS'9 million in 1964-65, and
their proportion of the national total has risen from under 5 per cent to
7-4 per cent. The share performed by industry has remained constant at
about two-thirds, but the proportion financed by Government has declined
from 55 per cent in 1958-59 3^ Per cent in 1964-65. The figures show that
over the last triennial period the main growth areas have been in the
universities and in research financed privately by industry. The proportion
of the total spent by the research councils amounted to £43-7 million in
1964-65, or 5-7 per cent of the total. It had been increasing by about 12-5 per
cent a year in real terms, but the rate of increase is now declining.
Central Advis- The Central Advisory Council for Science and Technology was established
ory Council in January 1967, under the chairmanship of the Chief Scientific Adviser to
for Science and the Government, to advise the Government on the most effective national
Technology strategy for the use and development of the country’s scientific and techno¬
logical resources. The Council includes representatives of the Council for
Scientific Policy (see p. 199), the Advisory Council on Technology (see p. 200),
and the Royal Society (see p. 202), and a number of independent members.
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 central responsibility for
basic and applied civil science rests with the Secretary of State for Education
and Science, who, advised by a Council for Scientific Policy in relation to
the natural sciences as a whole, is responsible for directing and financing the
research councils (see p. 199). Responsibility for technology rests with the
Minister of Technology, who is advised by an Advisory Council on
Technology (see p. 200). Other government departments are responsible for
research and development related to their executive responsibilities.

through the University Grants Committee (see p. 164); and its responsibilities
for basic and applied civil science are discharged mainly through the research
councils, of which there are at present five: the Science Research Council
(see p. 204), the Medical Research Council (see p. 207), the Agricultural
Research Council (see p. 208), the Natural Environment Research Council
(see p. 212), and the Social Science Research Council. Others may be estab¬
lished under the terms of the Science and Technology Act. The Department
also has, in consultation with other departments, general governmental respon¬
sibility for Britain’s scientific space research programme, which is co-ordinated
by the Science Research Council. The Department is responsible for overseas
scientific liaison (see p. 215), and for promoting more efficient handling and
utilisation of scientific and technical information. For the latter purpose it
has set up the Office for Scientific and Technical Information.
In the exercise of his responsibilities for the formulation and execution of
government scientific policy (but excluding, at present, the social sciences)
the Secretary of State for Education and Science is advised by the Council
for Scientific Policy (CSP), which replaced the former Advisory Council on
Scientific Policy. The Council, which was set up in January 1965, consists of
a chairman and 13 other members; unlike its predecessor, the new Council is
composed entirely of independent members. There are, in addition, assessors
from the research councils and from the University Grants Committee.
Among the issues with which the Council is concerned is the balance of
scientific effort in those areas for which the Secretary of State is responsible.
The Ministry of Technology (see also p. 60), which came formally into being
in 1964, took over responsibility for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority (see p. 210) and the National Research Development Corporation
(see p. 215). On the dissolution of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research (DSIR) in 1965 many of its functions and resources were transferred
to the Ministry and in February 1967 the Ministry incorporated the functions
and responsibilities of the former Ministry of Aviation with the exception of
those civil aviation responsibilities which were transferred to the Board of
Trade (see p. 61).
The Ministry among other things has responsibility for engineering
standards and weights and measures and for the British Standards Institution
(see p. 263). It has direct control of substantial research and development

facilities including many of the research stations formerly under the DSIR
(see p. 205) and the research establishments of the former Ministry of Aviation
(see p. 206); it also aids with grants 46 autonomous industrial research
associations (see p. 206).
The Minister of Technology is chairman of the Advisory Council on Tech¬
nology, set up to advise on the application of advanced technology in British
industry. There is a deputy chairman and ten other members, representing
scientific, economic, trade union and industrial interests.
The Committee on Manpower Resources for Science and Technology,
established in February 1965, reports directly both to the Secretary of State
for Education and Science and to the Minister of Technology. It is concerned
with the total national resources of qualified scientific and technological
manpower and their effective employment. The Committee comprises 18
independent members, including the chairman, chosen for their wide experi¬
ence in educational and industrial matters, as well as departmental
representatives.
A number of other government departments remain responsible for certain
branches of research.
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research into road con¬
struction, safety and traffic flow (see p. 356), most of the basic work being
carried out by the Road Research Laboratory, at Crowthorne, Berkshire, and
by the Ministry of Defence. Research on radio aids for marine navigation is
undertaken by the Ministry of Defence, which is also responsible for inter-
Service electronic valve research at the Services Electronics Research Labora¬
tory. The Government’s programme of research on marine nuclear propulsion
is undertaken by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
The Ministry of Public Building and Works has a Directorate General of
mineworkers. The coal, electricity and gas industries are required to settle
their general programmes of research in consultation with the Minister, who
is assisted by an Advisory Council on Research and Development. Similar
provisions apply to the British Steel Corporation’s general programme of
research and technological development.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is
responsible for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly for civil
purposes. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are
at Bracknell, Berkshire. The Ministry also makes grants for fundamental
meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society
or in university departments.
The Ministry of Public Building and Works has a Directorate General of
Research and Development (see p. 288) and is responsible for the Building
Research Station, Garston, Watford, Hertfordshire, which is concerned with
the techniques of building design and construction, and the organisation,
productivity and economics of building work.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government sponsors certain
geographical, geological, economic and sociological research relating to the
use and development of land in England and Wales. Similar arrangements
are made in Scotland by the Scottish Home and Health Department, and in

Northern Ireland by the Ministry of Development. A Centre for Environment
Studies has been set up as an independent educational trust for research
to support such tasks as re-shaping towns, building new cities and dealing
with the effects of a fast-growing mobile population.
The Post Office Engineering Department undertakes research and develop¬
ment on many aspects of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and other government
departments. The Department’s main research station is at Dollis Hill,
London, and there are laboratories at Backwell, near Bristol, and at Castleton,
near Cardiff.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759 and now administered
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its three research departments are: the
Herbarium, concerned primarily with the classification and accurate
determination of plants; the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant
anatomy and plant physiology, cytology and genetics; and the Museum of
Economic Botany, dealing with the economic exploitation of plants. The
library, attached to the herbarium, was founded in 1853; it consists of more
than 55,000 botanical books, about 80,000 reprints and separately issued
items and a collection of over 150,000 drawings and paintings of plants. In
1964 the 400-acre estate known as Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, was
taken over by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The Royal Botanic Garden,
Edinburgh, founded about 1660, is administered by the Ministry of Public
Building and Works.
A Select Committee of the House of Commons on Science and Technology
was set up in December 1966. It is one of two specialist committees established
experimentally to give back-bench Members the opportunity to investigate
the policies and administration of the Government and to participate in the
formation of policy. The Members of the Committee (not more than 15 in
number) are nominated by the House. The Committee has power to call
witnesses and generally takes evidence in public. (The other specialist com¬
mittee is on agriculture.)
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded in 1939 to replace
the former Parliamentary Science Committee to provide for a regular exchange
of information between members of Parliament and scientists. It is one of a
number of unofficial all-party parliamentary groups which have grown up
spontaneously and have varying degrees of influence. Membership is open to
members of Parliament of any party in both Houses, and also to nominated
representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and technological
organisations in Britain as may be affiliated under its constitution.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
scientific knowledge. At present there are over 200 of them in Britain with
approximately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical
institutions and professional associations, many of which are playing a
distinguished part in promoting their own branches of science or are
interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
Prominent examples of these are the British Medical Association, the
Institutions of Civil Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers,

Royal Society
Royal Society

Chemical Engineers, Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the
Institute of Physics and the Physical Society and the Institute of Biology.
The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its
broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests
and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution
and British Association.
The Royal Society, or more fully, the Royal Society of London for the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique
place in the country’s scientific affairs and corresponds to national academies
of sciences in other countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high
honour. The Queen is Patron. There are today three main categories of
Fellowship: Royal Fellows, comprising the Queen Mother and three Royal
Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom there are about 70, and the main body
of Fellows numbering about 690. Election to the Fellowship, which is for
life, was for many years restricted to 25 persons a year and the foreign
membership to four a year but in 1965 the former was increased to 32 with
the intention of awarding some of the new places to applied scientists in
both the physical and biological sciences. The Society is governed by a
council of 21 members.
Its present activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication
of research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings’,
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson and Sir Henry Dale Research Professorships and eight
other research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid. The
highest medal awarded is the Copley Medal, for which scientists from all
countries are eligible; there are also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford,
Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals.
There are five lectureships: the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical
sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins (history of science); and
the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology). The Society has set up committees, some of
them jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements in education in
science and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences, especially
engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain
activities administered by it. The President of the Society is consulted on
scientific appointments to government research councils and Fellows serve
on most governmental advisory councils and committees concerned with
research.
The Society represents the United Kingdom in the international unions
comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions and appoints
national committees for each of them. It also plays a leading part in inter¬
national scientific programmes such as the International Biological Programme
(1965-70), and promotes exchange visits of scientists with many academies
throughout the world.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encourage¬
ment of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754,
however, one of the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress
and application to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils

this purpose chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society
regularly holds meetings for the delivery of lectures, and publishes a monthly
Journal, thus providing effective media for the exposition and assessment by
leading authorities of developments which have a public as well as a specialist
interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today, the
Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are given on
recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge. Its library of
some 60,000 books includes many early scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well
as by eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The Association has area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to
encourage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also made an important contribution to the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
In 1965-66 the total estimated university expenditure on research was about
£44-6 million. The largest government contribution was through the Univer¬
sity Grants Committee (UGC) (see p. 164).
Scientific research in the universities is also supported through the
Research Councils. This support takes two forms. Firstly, about half the
postgraduate students in science and technology in the universities receive
maintenance awards from the research councils, through postgraduate
scholarships, studentships or fellowships. These awards are in some cases for
periods of up to three years for training in research work and in others for
shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these awards is currently
about ^5-6 million a year. Secondly, grants are given to the universities by the
research councils for specific projects, particularly in new or developing fields
of research. In recent years the research councils, in addition to making
grants of this kind, have made funds available for expensive items of
university equipment required for specific programmes of research. The
research councils’ support for research in the universities, excluding expendi¬
ture by the Medical Research Council and the Agricultural Research Council
on their own research units within the universities (which remain under the
control of, and are wholly financed by, the councils themselves), amounted
in 1966-67 to over £18 million.
204 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
University Grants Committee amount to nearly a third of the total university
expenditure on research.
In addition to the universities, colleges of advanced technology in England
and Wales, which are acquiring the status and title of universities, and central
institutions in Scotland are playing an increasing part in scientific and
technological research and development. These colleges and institutions are
financed by the education departments but are now making a growing
demand on the support for research provided by the research councils.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects.

All universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have labora¬
tories or research departments.1 The Research Councils provide grants for
research projects in universities and award studentships for postgraduate
training in science and technology, as well as post-doctoral research fellow¬
ships ; the Ministry of Technology awards development contracts to university
departments and in certain cases the National Research Development Corpor¬
ation (see p. 215) can also support research work; and leading firms in such
industries as chemicals, oil, motor vehicles, textiles, electrical equipment,
food manufacture, and mining provide grants for specific research projects
or endow research fellowships, such as the Imperial Chemical Industries and
Leverhulme Fellowships, or professorships. Foundations which provide
similar benefactions include the Nuffield Foundation, the Ford Foundation,
the Carnegie Trust, the Wellcome Trust and Courtaulds’ Scientific and
Educational Trust Fund. Among individuals whose major contributions to
universities have included provision for research facilities have been Lord
Nuffield, with gifts to the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, Lord Austin, who
provided new buildings for the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, members
of the Wills family, who financed the Physics Laboratory at Bristol, members
of the Boot family at Nottingham and of the Brotherton family at Leeds.
The Ministry of Technology’s industrial liaison officers (see p. 215) are
based on universities or technical colleges.
According to the fourth triennial manpower survey carried out on behalf of the
Committee on Manpower Resources for Science and Technology in 1965, there
were 313,000 people in Great Britain with scientific and technological qualifica¬
tions (141,000 scientists and 172,000 engineers and technologists). There were,
in addition, 621,860 technicians and other technical supporting staff.
On the basis of available data, the annual supply of newly qualified
scientific engineering and technological manpower is expected to rise from
about 21,500 in 1965 to 26,100 in 1968 when the total should reach 358,700.
Technical supporting staff are expected to number 707,623 by 1968.

all branches of fundamental science other than those for which the other
research councils are responsible. It also supports research in engineering and
technology in the universities. Provision is made for it to carry out research and
development through its own establishments; to encourage and support
similar research by any other person or body; to provide and operate
equipment for common use by universities, technical colleges and similar
institutions; to make grants for postgraduate studies; and to disseminate
knowledge of science and technology. Its establishments include the Royal
Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux, the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh,
the Radio and Space Research Station, the Rutherford High Energy
Laboratory, the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory and the Atlas
Computer Laboratory (see p. 211). The SRC also co-ordinates the British
scientific space research programme (see p. 211) and provides the United
Kingdom contribution to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research
(CERN) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) (see also
pp. 211 and 216).
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the research
organisations of the larger firms. Industrial research organisations vary
widely between the largest firms employing thousands of qualified staff
and some employing very few; though the emphasis is on commercial
development, some fundamental research is done. Other main agencies are
government laboratories, universities and technical colleges, industrial
research associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and
consultant laboratories.
The Ministry of Technology is responsible for the following research stations.
The Joint Fire Research Organisation, controlled jointly with the Fire
Offices’ Committee, is concerned with the detection, suppression, and
inhibition of fires and the safety of life and property in fires. The Forest
Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, 36 miles west of
London, studies the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of home¬
grown and imported timber. The Hydraulics Research Station at Wallingford,
on the River Thames, studies problems of water flow in open channels such
as rivers, estuaries and harbours, and coastal erosion. The Laboratory of the
Government Chemist provides analytical investigating and advisory services
to all Government departments on request and especially to the Board of
Customs and Excise. It has a statutory function as official analyst or referee
in cases of disputed analyses under various Acts of Parliament. The National
Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride, south of Glasgow, carries out
research in mechanical engineering to help industry in developing new designs
and improving production processes. It has unique facilities for making
precision engineering measurements for testing hydraulic machinery and for
developing computer programmes for numerically controlled machine tools.
The National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, near London, conducts
research in various branches of non-nuclear physics, maintains British
primary standards and physical units and includes the former National
Chemical Laboratory, concentrating on basic chemical research applicable
to a wide variety of industries. The Torry Research Station at Aberdeen
(with a branch laboratory at Hull) investigates problems arising in the
handling, processing, and transport and storage of fish. The Warren Spring
Laboratory near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, provides facilities for research and
development, including pilot-scale work on subjects of national importance in
2o6

chemical engineering and mineral processing. It is also concerned with the
technological problems of atmospheric pollution. The Water Pollution
Research Laboratory at Stevenage carries out research on the methods of
treatment of sewage and industrial effluents and on the effects of pollution
of surface and coastal waters.
On the dissolution of the Ministry of Aviation in 1967, the Ministry of
Technology became responsible for the following research establishments: the
Aeroplane and Armament Establishment, Boscombe Down, Wilts; the Explo¬
sives Research and Development Establishment, Waltham Abbey, Essex; the
National Gas Turbine Establishment, Pyestock, Hants; the Rocket Propulsion
Establishment, Westcott, Aylesbury, Bucks; the Royal Aircraft Establishments,
Farnborough, Hants, and Bedford; the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern,
Worcs; and the Signals Research and Development Establishment, Christ¬
church, Hants.
The scheme by which the Government gives financial help to groups of firms
with similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to
carry out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917 and is now
operated by the Ministry of Technology. At the end of 1966 there were 46
such associations, with a combined income of £13*5 million (compared with
^5-i million in 1955), of which a little less than a quarter was contributed
by the Government. Suitably specialised associations are now available for
about 55 per cent of British industry, varying in size from the British Iron
and Steel Research Association (BISRA), with an annual income of j£i-8
million, of which about one-eighth is provided by government grant, to the
British Brush Manufacturers Research Association with an income of only
^18,450. The largest are those dealing with iron and steel, ships, production
engineering, coal utilisation, the electrical manufacturing, cotton and man¬
made fibres, welding and wool. (Particulars of these and other associations
are given in the relevant sections of Chapter 11, Industry.) The amounts of
the government grants are related to the contributions made by the industries
concerned.
The research associations are autonomous bodies governed by their own
councils, the members of which are mostly representatives of industry,
although the Ministry of Technology is also represented. The councils are
advised in preparing research programmes, for which they have complete
responsibility, by research committees representative of their industrial
members, often with the addition of university or government scientists.
The Ministry of Technology appoints two Visitors for each association;
normally one is a scientist and the other an industrialist—both of some
eminence. Nearly all research associations admit to membership manufac¬
turers in Commonwealth countries and many also admit those in foreign
countries. The associations make the results of their work known to member
firms by a variety of methods, among which are bulletins, technical reports,
lectures, films, training classes, exhibitions and mobile demonstration units.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 11), in particular those
concerned with fuel and power and transport. They also give support to
organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
According to Statistics of Science and Technology 1966, published in 1967, total
expenditure on research and development by the different industrial sectors

in 1964-65 (excluding establishments of less than 100 employees) was as
follows (in £ million): aircraft 138-5; electronics 70-6; chemicals and allied
industries 55-1; electrical engineering 26-4; mechanical and marine engineer¬
ing and shipbuilding 34-2; metal manufacture 6-4; motor vehicles, loco¬
motives, etc., 33-1; scientific instruments 10-4; textiles, leather, etc., 12-3;
food, drink and tobacco 13-7; mineral oil refining 9-9; other manufacturing
industries 34-7.
These figures include funds from government sources. But firms in many
science-based industries such as the chemical, pharmaceutical, electrical and
electronic equipment, oil refining, steel, vehicles and instruments, commit large
private funds to research and development in the normal course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research organised by private firms can be carried out
confidentially, so that the results remain the property of the sponsor.
Among British institutes of this type are: Fulmer Research Institute, Stoke
Poges, Buckinghamshire, now owned by the Institute of Physics and the
Physical Society, which concentrates on metallurgy and allied subjects;
Sondes Place Research Institute, Dorking, Surrey, which is mainly concerned
with chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering; Arthur D.
Little Research Institute, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, a British institute
working in close collaboration with a well-known American institute with a
similar name; the International Research and Development Company at
Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne; and the United Power Company at Heston,
near London. There are also consultant laboratories, such as Cambridge
Consultants.
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the
research funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act 1911. In
1920 the Committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council
(MRC), established under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid
provided by Parliament, now through the Secretary of State for Education
and Science. The MRC was granted a new charter in 1966.
In addition to financing the MRC, the Government gives substantial
support to medical research through block grants to universities distributed
through the University Grants Committee; and to clinical research through
the National Health Service. Certain government-financed research for
defence purposes, for example at the Microbiological Establishment at
Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications related to medical science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by private
charities or voluntary organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation and the
British Empire Cancer Campaign.
The Medical Research Council is responsible to the Secretary of State for
Education and Science and consists of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and
from 10 to 14 members. Not less than three-quarters must be scientifically
qualified, representative of the different branches of medical knowledge and
actively engaged in research. All members are appointed by the Secretary of
State, the scientific members after consultation with the President of the
Royal Society and the existing Council; and the Chairman and Deputy
Chairman after consultation with the Council.

Council
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health
and disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme the Council
is assisted by bodies specially appointed to advise on particular subjects.
Three of the more important of these are the Clinical Research Board, set
up in consultation with the health departments to assist the development of
clinical research; the Tropical Medicine Research Board, appointed in
consultation with the Ministry of Overseas Development, to advise on the
promotion and co-ordination of research in this field; and the Biological
Research Board, which advises on the promotion of research in the non-
clinical field. In addition, the Council is advised by committees concerned
with particular aspects of its work. The Council’s arrangements for the
support of research fall under four main headings: (i) investigations by
members of its scientific staff, mostly working in its own establishments;
(2) short-term grants to workers in universities and elsewhere; (3) long-term
grants in support of specific research programmes in university medical
departments (‘research groups’); and (4) fellowships and scholarships for
tenure both at home and abroad. The programme includes fundamental
studies of the structure and natural processes of the body; clinical and lab¬
oratory studies of disease; the development and evaluation of special methods of
treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of social and
occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.

London, is the Council’s main research establishment; in addition, there are
about 80 smaller establishments, known as research units, which are attached
in most cases to universities and hospitals in the United Kingdom. By 1970
it is hoped that the first phase of the Clinical Research Centre being built at
Northwick Park in north-west London as an integral part of the new district
hospital for the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board will be
ready. The Centre will be the clinical counterpart of the National Institute
for Medical Research.
The Council also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support
from the Ministry of Overseas Development, maintains laboratories in the
Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council,
the Government agricultural departments and by private industry.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931, consists of
not less than 15 and not more than 18 members, including the Chief
Veterinary Officer and certain appointments made by the Ministers of the
agricultural departments. In addition to distinguished scientists, the member¬
ship includes men with practical farming experience. The Council is under
the general oversight of the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
The Council is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural
research institutes and also has 10 institutes under its direct control and
14 units which it has established under distinguished scientists associated
with universities. In addition there are eight independent institutes in
Scotland financed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland with advice from the Council on their scientific programmes,
staffing and equipment.
The Council makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It awards research fellowships to enable
research workers of exceptional promise to undertake independent research

and also a limited number of postgraduate training awards for those wishing
to undertake a career in veterinary research.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has a Scientific
Advisory Panel, established in 1965, carries out applied research in its own
veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade, Midlothian,
and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire;
while at its infestation control laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey (with a field
station at Worplesdon), it co-ordinates work on the control of insect pests
of stored food and conducts research on the control of harmful mammals
and birds. The Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge has been
appointed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the third international
laboratory for biological students. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of
Agriculture is responsible for the promotion of agricultural research and
research divisions dealing with a variety of aspects have been established.
The Ministry maintains four laboratories for marine, shell-fish and salmon
and freshwater fisheries research, and four marine research vessels. The
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland maintains a marine
research laboratory and six research ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater
fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Stan¬
dards, Science and Safety Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food is responsible for formulating the Ministry’s general policy on the
acquisition and dissemination of scientific and technical information about
food and the food handling and processing industry; for furnishing scientific
advice to the other divisions of the Ministry; and for sponsoring or carrying
out experimental work. The division has its own experimental laboratories in
London and Norwich. The Food Research Advisory Committee, appointed
by the agricultural ministers, advises on food problems requiring investigation
or research.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to
silvicultural and allied problems (see p. 338). By means of grants, it also aids
forest research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
The Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the Atomic Energy
Authority Act 1954, is responsible for research and development in nuclear
energy. It is answerable to the Minister of Technology, who is responsible
under the Atomic Energy Acts 1946 to 1949 for promoting and controlling
the development of atomic energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The Authority has a
large programme of research into, and development of, the peaceful applica¬
tions of nuclear energy. As an essential part of the British Government’s
nuclear power programme, the Authority develops new types of nuclear
power stations to the stage at which they can be adapted for the generation of
electric power on a commercial scale and for this purpose it builds and operates
experimental and prototype nuclear reactors. Construction and operation
of the nuclear power stations themselves is the responsibility of the Central
Electricity Generating Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board.
The Secretary of State for Defence became responsible for the development
and production of nuclear weapons for the Services in 1966; in practice,
however, the AEA produces the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for
nuclear weapons under contract and carries out weapon research.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Atomic
Energy
Authority
The Department of Education and Science and the AEA collaborate with
a number of other government departments and with the Radiological
Protection Service on various aspects of health and safety in relation to atomic
energy. Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and
Agricultural Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee, appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
This committee advises ministers on regulatory aspects of safety measures in
the use of radioactive substances and apparatus producing radiation.
The Ministry of Technology and the Authority are jointly responsible for
co-operation with other countries in nuclear energy, partly through the
medium of bilateral agreements with a large number of individual countries
and partly through British membership of bodies, such as, the International
Atomic Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy Agency.
The Atomic Energy Authority, the members of which are appointed by the
Minister of Technology, consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and up to
14 other members, some of whom may be part time.
The Authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-
to-day government control (subject to the power given to the responsible
minister to issue directions to the Authority in matters of overriding national
importance), but differs from them in that most of its revenue is derived from
money voted by Parliament. The commercial activities of the AEA have
been separated from its other functions and are now financed through a
trading fund with an initial capital of about £37 million. Under the Science
and Technology Act 1965 the functions of the Authority have been extended
so that the Minister may, after consultation, require it to undertake research
and development outside nuclear energy.
It has submitted tenders for the construction of a nuclear power station
overseas as a prime contractor. The AEA is a member of the British Nuclear
Export Executive, established in June 1966.
The organisation has a London office, responsible for central financial and
administrative matters and for procuring raw materials. It also has a Radio¬
chemical Centre at Amersham which produces and markets radioisotopes,
about one-half for export. The rest of its establishments are divided into five
groups.
The Research Group’s principal establishment is the Atomic Energy
Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell. Others are the Wantage Research
Laboratory, which does research into new and improved uses of radioisotopes
and an establishment for research into plasma physics and controlled thermo¬
nuclear fusion at Culham. Harwell also runs an isotope school at Wantage,
and a postgraduate education centre, which provide training for home and
overseas students.
The Weapons Group, centred on Aldermaston, conducts research on and
development of nuclear weapons and other research work with civil, as well
as defence, applications. It has outstations at Foulness and Orfordness in
eastern England.
There are three groups with headquarters at Risley, in north-western
England. The Reactor Group works on the design and development of
reactors. It is responsible for the prototype Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) at Windscale, which has been operating successfully since February
1963 and which formed the basis of the design chosen for the first nuclear
power station in Britain’s second nuclear power programme (see p. 278).
The Group also includes the Atomic Energy Establishment at Winfrith,
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS

Dorset, where work on a wide range of reactor types is carried out. A prototype
Steam Generating Heavy Water (SGHW) reactor, with an electrical output
of 100 MW, has been constructed there and a number of experimental
reactors of different types have been in operation for some time. It is also
the location of the Dragon project, a 20 MW (thermal) reactor financed jointly
by the member countries of the European Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including
members of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The
Reactor Group also includes the Dounreay experimental reactor establish¬
ment in the north of Scotland, which houses a materials-testing reactor
and an experimental fast-breeder reactor. This has led to the design of a
prototype fast reactor station of 250 MW which is also being built at Dounreay.
The Group has research laboratories at the main establishments of the
Production Group, which is responsible for the operation of factories pro¬
ducing and reprocessing fissile material at Windscale (Cumberland),
Capenhurst (Cheshire) and Springfields (Lancashire) and the nuclear power
plants at Calder Hall (Cumberland) and Chapelcross (Dumfries), and for
the Calder Operations School. The work of this group is now mainly
commercial; it supplies all the nuclear fuel for the British nuclear power
stations built under Britain’s first nuclear power programme, and is also
supplying fuel for similar power stations in Japan and Italy. The group has
also secured large overseas orders for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. The
third group with headquarters at Risley is the Engineering Group, responsible
for the construction of plant, works and buildings, and for the design and
inspection of fuel elements for production purposes.
The provision of expensive facilities for research in high energy physics is
the function of the Science Research Council (see p. 204). The SRC estab¬
lishments concerned are the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, Chilton,
with a 7,000 million electron volt (MeV) proton synchrotron (particle accelera¬
tor), completed in 1963; the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory, Cheshire,
with a 4,000 MeV electron accelerator, completed in 1966; and the Atlas
Computer Laboratory, Chilton, which is also used for other scientific work.
Government responsibility for space activities is divided between the Secre¬
tary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence,
the Minister of Technology and the Postmaster General. Total expenditure
on civil space activities in 1966-67 is estimated at about £23 million; of this,
^6-6 million represents expenditure on Britain’s own projects and j£i6-2
million contributions to the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO),
the European Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO)
and Intelsat (see below).
The execution of the civil scientific space research programme is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
Scientific experiments in space are in the hands of scientists in the univer¬
sities and in government research establishments, under the general super¬
vision of the Space Research Management Unit of the Science Research
Council. The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental inter¬
national scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research
(COSPAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
In addition to its own national rocket programme, Britain is co-operating
with the United States in a programme which includes the launching of the
Ariel series of satellites and the incorporation of British experiments in US
212
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
satellites. The third Anglo-American artificial earth satellite, Ariel 3, launched
in May 1967, and the upper atmosphere Skylark rockets were designed and
produced in Britain.
The Ministry of Technology is responsible for conducting research into,
and for developing and producing, launchers, space vehicles and their
ancillary equipment. As an example, it is responsible at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment, for the development of the Skylark rockets used by the
Science Research Council, and is also carrying out a programme for the
development of satellite technology in Britain, which will use as a research
tool the Black Arrow satellite launcher vehicle being developed from the
successful Black Knight research rocket.
Two organisations, in which Britain is a member, have been set up to give
European countries the opportunity to participate more fully in space research
and technology. ELDO was established to develop large satellite launchers;
the British Blue Streak is being used as the launching vehicle for ELDO’s
Europa rockets. ESRO was founded to provide facilities for scientific experi¬
ments in space; it has a programme of launchings of sounding rockets and
satellites of various sizes.
The General Post Office is responsible for the use of satellites for civil
communications purposes and undertakes research work in connection with
communications systems using satellites. Under two inter-related international
agreements reached in 1964, in Washington, Britain, together with the US
and other countries in Europe and elsewhere, is taking part in International
Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat).
The satellite prediction centre at Slough, attached to the Radio and Space
Research Station, also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for
space research, co-ordinates optical and radio tracking activities in Britain.
Optical observation of satellites is carried out regularly by many individual
observers in Britain and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s outstation
(see below); radio tracking is undertaken at the Radio and Space Research
Station and by radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank and the Royal Radar
Establishment at Malvern.
OPTICAL AND
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
Large optical telescopes were first constructed in Britain by Herschel and
Rosse in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The latest addition to the
equipment at Herstmonceux is the 98-inch Isaac Newton telescope com¬
pleted in 1967. Grants by the SRC to the Radcliffe Trustees have enabled
British optical astronomers to have continued access to the 74-inch telescope
at the Radcliffe Observatory in South Africa for observations in the southern
skies. In April 1967 the SRC assumed responsibility for supporting and
managing this telescope. The Royal Edinburgh Observatory has been
re-equipped with modern instrumentation for use in stellar spectroscopy and
photometry. The British and Australian Governments have agreed jointly to
build a £4-4 million 150-inch optical telescope in New South Wales.
Radio astronomy, developed since 1931, is carried out mainly at Cambridge
University, at the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station of Manchester Univer¬
sity at Cheshire, and at the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern. Britain
occupies a pre-eminent position in this branch of research.
THE NATURAL

COUNCIL
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which was established
in June 1965, supports research in earth sciences and ecology. It is responsible
for the Nature Conservancy, the Institute of Geological Sciences (which
incorporates the Geological Survey of Great Britain, the Museum of Practical

Geology and the Overseas Geological Surveys), the Hydrology Research Unit,
the National Institute of Oceanography, and the former functions of the
Development Commission in relation to marine and freshwater biology and
fishery research. The NERC is now responsible for grants for research and
awards of fellowships and studentships within its field. In April 1967 it took
over responsibility from the Commonwealth Office for the British Antarctic
Survey.
The Nature Conservancy was set up in 1949. Its functions are to provide
scientific advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and
fauna of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves
in Great Britain, including the maintenance of geological and physiographical
features of scientific interest; and to organise and develop the research and
scientific service related thereto. Research stations have been set up at Merle-
wood, Grange-over-Sands, in Lancashire; at Furzebrook, Wareham, in
Dorset; at Bangor, Wales; and at Speyside, Inverness. There are field stations
at Moor House, Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross, and an experimental
station at Monks’ Wood, Huntingdon; at these, long-term ecological research
is undertaken into such problems as the relation of vegetation to soils and
climates, peat growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal erosion
and roadside spraying.
The NERC is also responsible for the support of long-term forestry research
in consultation with the Forestry Commission; it has financial and policy
responsibility for the research in seismology and geomagnetism carried out
by the Meteorological Office and co-ordinates research in meteorology
generally with that carried out by the Meteorological Office. It has established
committees for each main activity. There is close liaison between NERC and
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Scottish and Welsh
Offices about the work done by the Nature Conservancy and the Geological
Survey.
The Social Science Research Council began functioning in December 1965.
It has the same status as the other research councils and consists of a chairman
and not more than 16 nor less than 10 other members. It provides grants for
research projects at universities and other institutions, and makes training
awards to postgraduate students. The Council’s field of interest includes
economics; political science; psychology; social anthropology; social and
economic statistics; sociology and social administration; education; manage¬
ment ; and various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit which carries out a wide variety of sociological studies. The
Social Survey conducts sample survey inquiries at the request of government
departments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration
with universities and other independent research organisations.
Among other research agencies may be mentioned the zoological societies
and scientific museums.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.

Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester and
Dudley, and a small, private, natural zoo at Chessington, Surrey.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the
Commonwealth for the general study of natural history; it has extensh e
collections of extant and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and
meteorites. The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and
applied science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held
a leading place in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics,
and in the development of industrial machinery and processes, all of which
are represented in the museum’s collections. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the
Geological Survey, responsible for this work, has an outstanding collection of
exhibits in its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South
Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume
of information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication,
in which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still the
main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned societies
have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific information.
The Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) was set up in
1965 within the Department of Education and Science to promote more
efficient handling of scientific and technical information over the whole field
of the natural and social sciences and their related technologies. It also seeks
to co-ordinate such action as is taken with the work of other government and
independent organisations. It has responsibility for the National Lending
Library for Science and Technology and for grant-aid to Aslib (a specialised
library service).
The National Lending Library for Science and Technology at Boston Spa,
Yorkshire, aims to collect, for loan purposes, all the current literature of
science and technology including agriculture and medicine. The Library also
prepares and sells translations of Russian technical articles and books, and is
responsible for increasing the number of translations of foreign (especially
Russian and Chinese) scientific literature, in which work it collaborates with
the National Science Foundation of the United States. (A description of
general library services which also cater for scientific needs is given on p. 224-)
Aslib undertakes research into the operation of information services, gives
assistance in setting up and running them, provides a range of membership
services, and holds a Commonwealth Index of Translation covering scientific
subjects.
The National Reference Library for Science and Invention is administered
by the British Museum and receives its grant through the Department of
Education and Science. The former Patent Office Library is included in the
new library.
An Advisory Committee for Scientific and Technical Information was set
up in October 1965 to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science
on the conduct of, and support for, United Kingdom activities in scientific
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
215
and technical information, more particularly the work of OSTI and the
co-ordination of this work with other government departments and indepen¬
dent organisations
The Ministry of Technology and the AEA devote considerable sums to
advisory information services. The former has nine regional offices and
sponsors over 60 industrial liaison centres, based on universities or technical
colleges, which make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of
existing scientific and technical knowledge. A Production Engineering
Advisory Service equipped with mobile demonstration units has been
launched to bring knowledge of new techniques directly to the workshop floor.
The grant-aided industrial research associations circulate research reports and
provide information services to members. Besides information services
provided by its various groups, which include the Ceramics Centre and the
Non-destructive Testing Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an information
centre at its London headquarters, and a network of regional advisers on the
use of radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux
(see p. 216) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches
of agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research
in Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual
reports. The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research
results directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.

The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), an independent
body for which the Minister of Technology now has statutory responsibility,
was set up in 1949 under the Development of Inventions Act 1948 to secure
the development and exploitation of inventions in the public interest. The
Corporation can also assist research work where this is likely to lead to an
invention. Under the Development of Inventions Act 1965, up to £25 million
can be advanced from public funds without time limit. Projects so far
sponsored include hovercraft, electronic digital computers, advanced electric
motors, towed flexible barges (Dracones), Interferon (an anti-viral agent),
selective weed-killers, insecticides, a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell as a source of
electricity and a group of new antibiotics called cephalosporins. NRDC
support for hovercraft development has been given through wholly owned
subsidiaries, such as, Hovercraft Development Ltd., which holds and manages
the hovercraft patents and Tracked Hovercraft Ltd., formed in 1967 to
develop a hovertrain. NRDC is a minority shareholder in the British
Hovercraft Corporation Ltd., formed in 1966.
Most government departments concerned with science and technology make
special arrangements for dealing with international scientific relations but
the DES, through its International Scientific Relations Division, has a number
of inter-departmental responsibilities including the recruitment and scientific
support of Britain’s scientific counsellors overseas, who are seconded to the
Diplomatic Service. In areas of non-governmental collaboration, under the
aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions, the primary repre¬
sentative of the United Kingdom is the Royal Society.
The Government is concerned with inter-governmental organisations:
these include specialised agencies of the United Nations (the United Nations

the European Nuclear Energy Agency and the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research); space research (the European Space Research Organisa¬
tion) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. There are agree¬
ments between the United Kingdom AEA and other atomic energy authorities,
including that of the Soviet Union (and there are permanent representatives
of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in London and of the
United Kingdom AEA in Washington). Also, there are inter-governmental
agreements with Euratom, and bilateral agreements with other countries.
Britain is also represented on the three scientific committees of the OECD.
The Commonwealth Scientific Committee (CSC) consisting of the heads of
the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in
1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946, meets biennially.
Operating under the CSC is an executive sub-committee, membership of
which consists of officials responsible for scientific matters in the Common¬
wealth Missions in London, and representatives from British Government
departments, the Research Councils and the Royal Society. There are various
specialist committees. The secretariat for the Committee and its executive
sub-committee is provided by the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices.
A British Commonwealth Scientific Conference held in 1946 recommended
the continuance and extension of the scientific collaboration of the war years
by the creation of the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices, a group at
present consisting of the Scientific Liaison Offices in London of Australia,
Canada and New Zealand together with the International Scientific Relations.
Division of the Department of Education and Science.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
all Commonwealth countries, comprise three Institutes and 11 Bureaux, all
of which except one Institute are in Britain and each of which is concerned
with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as clearing houses,
for the interchange of information of value to research workers in agricultural
science throughout the Commonwealth and increasingly throughout the
world. This they achieve by scanning and abstracting journals of scientific
repute in all languages, by keeping in touch with agricultural research in
progress and by the dissemination of this information by the periodic issue
of Abstract Journals. Seventeen Abstract Journals, one Primary Journal and
an Index are published periodically and have a combined annual circulation of
about 28,750 copies. A list of research workers in agriculture, animal health
and forestry in the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland, published
from time to time, is a useful book of reference and enables research workers
to contact one another. The Institutes and Bureaux also issue monographs
on their own particular subjects and deal with inquiries received from research
workers in all parts of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Institutes and the
Bureaux of Helminthology provide taxonomic and identification services.
One of the main aims of the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM)
is the promotion of scientific research in the interests of developing countries.
The aid given covers specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits,,

conferences for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in
universities and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from
Britain, and providing support for existing research services overseas, for
example, in East Africa and the Caribbean. Some equipment is also given to
encourage scientific training and applied research. The Department works
with the many specialist bodies concerned, particularly the research councils
and the Ministry of Technology. It administers and supports the work of,
for example, the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, internationally
recognised as a world centre for locust research since 1931. The Ministry is
also responsible for the Tropical Products Institute in London which aims at
improving the economical viability of the less-developed countries of the
tropics, especially those within the Commonwealth, by research into new uses
for tropical plant and animal products. The ODM has provided ^2-95 million
in the financial year 1967-68 to meet the cost of its assistance to research for
the benefit of developing countries.
I he principal aims of the British Council (see p. 170) in the sciences (includ¬
es agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum reform
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Much emphasis is placed on the interchange of scientists between Britain
and other countries. Overseas tours and advisory visits by British specialists
are arranged and scientists recruited for overseas posts. In the other direction
the Council invites senior specialists to Britain for visits and discussions with
British experts, and makes awards to postgraduate students; it also administers
the programmes of a large number of senior specialists and students who
travel to Britain under the auspices of the UN specialised agencies, or under
various bilateral technical assistance schemes, or as private individuals. The
Council is also responsible for administering travel grants awarded under the
Foreign and Commonwealth University Interchange Schemes.
Information on Britain’s scientific achievements is provided either through
the Council’s overseas libraries or direct from the London headquarters
which includes specialist departments (and libraries) for medicine and science.
Material published or compiled by these London departments includes
British Medical Bulletin, British Medical Booklist, part of Scientific Research
in British Universities and Colleges (see Bibliography, p. 503), and publications
listing facilities for education and training in Britain.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
This section describes the assistance and encouragement given to the arts
by the Government, local authorities, voluntary societies and other
organisations. Although valuable support comes from private sources,
including trusts and commercial concerns, the Government and local
authorities are taking an increasingly active part. In 1964, for the first time,
a minister was appointed to take special responsibility for the arts. The
Government considers that its role is not ‘to dictate taste or restrict the
liberty of even the most unorthodox and experimental of artists’ but to
support the arts so that a high level of artistic achievement can be sustained

and the best in the arts made more widely available (A Policy for the Arts,
see Bibliography, p. 504). Government support to the arts can be grouped
under three heads: education, preservation and patronage.
The main educational functions are carried out in England and Wales
through the Department of Education and Science, in Scotland through the
Scottish Education Department and in Northern Ireland by the Ministry of
Education. In partnership with local education authorities and voluntary
bodies, they are concerned with schools, colleges of further education and
community centres. The Department of Education and Science is also
concerned with public libraries and is responsible for the \ ictoria and Albert
Museum, and the Scottish Education Department is responsible for the
Royal Scottish Museum.
The Government aids the preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage by
means of grants which largely finance most of the national museums and
galleries; through the Ministry of Public Building and Works, which looks
after ancient monuments and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government
which is responsible for historic buildings; and by giving financial help to
independent bodies concerned with preservation, such as the National Trust
(see p. 180).
General help for the arts is given through government grants for music,
drama, literature, painting and sculpture; these are channelled for the greater
part through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which
contribute to the aspects of the arts not provided for by other agencies. Other
state-aided organisations include the British Film Institute and the Council
of Industrial Design.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain in 1967-68
was over j£i4-i million. Direct allocations include ^7'2 million for the Arts
Council of Great Britain (£1-5 million more than in 1966-67) and nearly ^6-4
million for the running costs of national museums and galleries. In addition
nearly £1-4 million was allocated for the preservation of historic houses and
ancient monuments.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established in 1946 under a Royal
Charter. (A new charter was granted in 1967.) Its members are appointed by
the Secretary of State for Education and Science, in consultation with the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Its main objects are to develop
and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to increase
the accessibility of the arts to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland, which has similar aims, receives
a grant from the Northern Ireland Government. In 1967-68 this amounted
to £160,000. _ .
The British Council (see footnote, p. 170) takes an active part m displaying
overseas the best in British drama, ballet, music and the visual arts.
Local authorities do valuable work in encouraging the arts. Under the Local
Government Act 1948 they may levy up to a sixpenny rate in England and
Wales for expenditure on entertainment in all its forms, including cultural
activities. By amending legislation (the Local Government (Scotland) Act
1966), the same rate applies to Scotland. They may also spend money on
buildings for the arts and provide and maintain museums and art galleries;
the Arts Councils are authorised to give financial help to house the arts. Many
towns support orchestras and theatres. The Greater London Council which,
as the London County Council, built the Royal Festival Hall, has agreed to

contribute equally with the Government towards the cost of the National
Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.
Many voluntary bodies are concerned with promoting the arts and include
charitable trusts and foundations which give financial support. Industrial
patronage includes continuing support from the independent television
companies.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine. The
outstanding example is the Edinburgh Festival Society. Other arts festivals
organised on a similar basis are held in the City of London, Aldeburgh, Bath,
Belfast, Cheltenham, Harrogate, King’s Lynn, Leeds, Norwich and York.
Regional co-operation in arts patronage is growing with support from the
Government which encourages the formation of regional arts associations to
ensure that the whole range of the arts is more widely available to people
throughout the area. Such associations have been established in the north-east,
the north-west, Lincolnshire, the Midlands, the south-west, Greater London
and north Wales.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, winning 61 international prizes since 1949 and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at
home has been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display
on the part of museums and galleries, and by the varied activities of many
institutions, societies and private galleries.
Painting and sculpture receive state support by grants to national institu¬
tions and, indirectly, through purchase grants made to local art galleries and
museums, to local education authorities for art schools and other means of
promoting education in art, and to the Arts Councils, which take an active
part by organising exhibitions and building up their own collections of con¬
temporary British art. The Government is advised on grants and matters of
policy by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries and the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland.
Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council’s
exhibitions and lectures. In 1966-67 fine art exhibitions organised by the
Council were shown in 50 countries and the Council was also responsible
for British participation in five international exhibitions.
Over 900 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain.
There are 18 national museums and art galleries. Those in London probably
contain between them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within
one city. They include the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum,
the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, the London Museum
(to be amalgamated with the Guildhall Museum into the Museum of London),
the Wallace Collection, the British Museum (Natural History) and the
Science Museum (see p. 214).
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland,
the Royal Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the

Scottish United Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art. The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at
St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; and in Northern
Ireland there is the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office (see p. 224) and the Sir John Soane’s
Museum. In 1962 a small gallery was opened in Buckingham Palace for
exhibition of pictures from the extensive royal collections. Most cities and
large towns and many other towns have a museum devoted to art, archaeology
and natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes
by a local learned society or privately by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford
and Cambridge are rich in museums, many of them, as in other towns,
associated with the universities—for example, the Ashmolean Museum in
Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the country, and the Fitzwilliam
Museum in Cambridge. There are important museums and art galleries in
Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester,
Norwich, Reading, Southampton and York. In Northern Ireland there are
notable museums and galleries in or near Belfast (the Ulster Folk Museum
and the Northern Ireland Arts Council Gallery), in Armagh City and in
Londonderry.
In recent years there has been a notable development of ‘period-house
museums’, for which outstanding private houses have been taken over by
national and municipal authorities, and of folk museums. Many private art
collections housed in historic family mansions, including those in the owner¬
ship of the National Trust (see p. 180), are open to the public.
In the past decade several new or extensively altered museum buildings
have been opened, including those at Coventry, Derby, Doncaster, Durham
(the Gulbenkian Museum at the University), Leicester (Jewry Wall Archaeo¬
logical Museum), Liverpool, Manchester (Whitworth Art Gallery), Scun¬
thorpe and Sunderland. Developments are planned for museums in Belfast,
Bristol, Cardiff, Hull, London and Newcastle; a new museum has been
opened in Oxfordshire (jointly by the City and County Councils) and there
are schemes involving county council participation in County Durham,
Staffordshire, Pembrokeshire, Rutland and Worcestershire; other develop¬
ments are being initiated by local associations for the arts.
A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils
which cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the
Government and help to improve technical facilities.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The Association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for
professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Art
Exhibitions Bureau are a regular feature of many museums. All exhibitions at
the Whitechapel Art Gallery in east London are loan exhibitions (mainly of
contemporary artists). The National Gallery, the Tate Gallery and British
Museum also have loan exhibitions. The Greater London Council exhibits

modern sculpture in one of its parks every third year and is building an
exhibition gallery on the south bank of the Thames, due to be opened in 1968,
which will be administered by the Arts Council. Commercial exhibitions of
works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the year in the
galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in the Bond Street area).
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy;
the Royal Scottish Academy; the Society of Scottish Artists; the Royal
Society of British Artists; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours;
the Royal Society of Portrait Painters; the Artists’ International Association;
the Women’s International Art Club; and the London Group (all associations
of professional painters); and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Some of
these societies, notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their
own galleries in London. In Northern Ireland there are the Royal Ulster
Academy of Arts, the Ulster Society of Women Artists and the Ulster Arts
Club. Among regional societies are the Newlyn Society of Artists, the Midland
Group of Artists (Nottingham), the Birmingham Society of Artists and the
Penwith Society of Arts, while an increasing number of amateur art societies
throughout the United Kingdom hold local exhibitions and encourage local
interest in the fine arts. There are also exhibitions of children’s art, including
the National Exhibition of Children’s Art sponsored annually by the Sunday
Mirror.
All national collections are financed from government funds, both those that
are the direct responsibility of the Department of Education and Science
(the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museums) and the Scottish Education
Department (the Royal Scottish Museum) and those run by trustee bodies.
Besides meeting the administrative costs, provision is made for annual
purchase grants which rose from £125,000 in 1958-59 to £826,000 in
1967-68. The Government also provides special ad hoc purchase grants and
collections may receive works of art acquired by the Treasury in lieu of estate
duty. The buildings are maintained by the Ministry of Public Building and
Works. Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or
endowments, can be helped in building up their collections through the
annual government grant (£108,000 in 1967-68) administered by the Victoria
and Albert and Royal Scottish Museums. Financial help and pictures are also
given to museums and galleries by certain trusts and voluntary bodies,
particularly the National Art-Collections Fund.
The Council of Industrial Design (CoID), set up in 1944 by the Government
to promote higher standards of design in British industry, is concerned with
all aspects of industrial design from durable consumer goods to capital goods.
The CoID, with its Scottish Committee, is a grant-aided body sponsored by
the Board of Trade; its members include industrialists, retail management,
architects, designers and educationists. At the Design Centre in the Hay-
market, London, a selective but changing display of modern British consumer
goods is maintained; exhibits are chosen from Design Index, the CoID’s
illustrated record of 10,000 well-designed products. Special exhibitions
on particular themes are also arranged regularly. An annual awards scheme,
Council of Industrial Design Awards, covering capital goods and engineering
equipment as well as consumer products, was introduced in 1967. The
Duke of Edinburgh also presents his annual Prize for Elegant Design.
The Scottish Committee runs the Scottish Design Centre in Glasgow, and
there are three independent regional design centres, each maintaining a
duplicate of the Index, at Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham. The CoID
222
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Art Education
Architecture
organises temporary exhibitions in regional centres and overseas; arranges
regular conferences and training courses; and undertakes industrial study
tours in Britain. It publishes a monthly magazine, Design, and maintains
extensive reference and photographic libraries.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society
of Arts (see p. 202), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is
the representative professional body in Great Britain of designers engaged
in industry and commerce, and the Design and Industries Association (DIA),
a voluntary association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested
in the promotion of good design in industry. The Crafts Council of Great
Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are
all grant-aided by the Board of Trade. Their aims are to improve craft design
and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
Formal art education is given in publicly supported art colleges, university
art schools, the Royal Academy Schools and a few private art schools. There
are the colleges, art schools and classes administered by the local education
authorities; and at a senior level there is the Royal College of Art, London,
whose students have usually completed a course at a local education authority
college, and which awards its own degrees. Art is also taught at an advanced
level at the four Scottish Central (Art) Institutions administered by the
Scottish Education Department. University art schools include the Slade
School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’ College (London), the Ruskin Drawing
School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art, the Department of Fine Art of
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the School of Art of University
College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department
of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the
Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England and Wales three-year full-time courses leading to a Diploma in
Art and Design were instituted in 1963 and are available to students who have
successfully completed a foundation course. The Diploma is broadly com¬
parable to a university pass degree, and is administered by the National
Council for Diplomas in Art and Design (an independent self-governing
body set up by the then Minister of Education in 1961). The Council also
administers a scheme of post-diploma studies in a small number of colleges.
In Scotland each of the four schools of art awards a diploma which is roughly
equivalent to the pass degree of a university.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase
by schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for
Schools exhibition. A loan scheme for reproductions of works of art which is
used extensively by schools is operated by the Arts Council.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past.
Several government departments are concerned with architecture and
help to promote good design. The Ministry of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment, the Scottish Development Department, and the Northern Ireland
Ministry of Development are responsible for approving the layout and
design of local authority housing schemes, and set standards for local
Education and

authority housing. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is
responsible for the work of the National Building Agency (see p. 184) which
carries out research and development concerned with methods of building
more cheaply. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is responsible
for the design, building and maintenance work of all government departments;
it also has a research and development group which co-ordinates similar
groups throughout the government service. The Architects and Building
Branches at the Department of Education and Science and the Scottish
Education Department carry out research for school building programmes.
The Ministry of Health is implementing a very large building programme and
the Regional Hospital Boards, through their architectural departments, are
responsible for the design and construction of a large number of hospitals and
ancillary buildings.
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance, including new building developments.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 180)
seeks to promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to
encourage a wider interest in the appearance of towns.
1 he Minister of Public Building and Works has responsibilities for the
preservation of ancient monuments and the Minister of Housing and Local
Government for historic buildings in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland
these responsibilities are vested in the Ministry of Finance.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are
34 schools recognised for exemption from the Intermediate and Final
examinations of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and four
recognised for the intermediate examination only. In addition to these schools,
which may also have part-time courses, there are six schools of art and
technical colleges which have full-time courses leading to the external
examinations of the RIBA.
The Royal Institute of British Architects, the leading professional
architectural institution in Britain, has a membership of 22,000 with some
6,000 students. Allied to it are 51 architectural societies covering the whole of
the United Kingdom and most of the Commonwealth. The RIBA has one of
the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world. It is
concerned with a wide range of activities covering professional practice,
science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions, professional and
public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a variety of subjects,
presents exhibitions; and, through its Board of Architectural Education,
controls the training and examination of architects. The Royal Gold Medal
for Architecture is awarded annually by the Queen on the recommendation
of the RIBA. Among other associations are the Incorporated Association of
Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects and the
Faculty of Architects and Surveyors. Societies include the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and several which cover particular aspects
of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
224
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Libraries
Libraries in
Education
private libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on radio and television and there are numerous
periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature.
Government help is given through the Arts Council of Great Britain
which supports literature in a number of ways, including bursaries and
prizes for writers, a fund to aid literary projects, and subsidies to festivals of
literature and poetry. Similar provision is made, through the Arts Council
of Northern Ireland, for bursaries and aid for publications.
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary
prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the Queen’s
Gold Medal for Poetry, the James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography
and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of
promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Winston
Spencer Churchill Literary Award for an outstanding work in the history
of the English-speaking peoples, the Library Association Carnegie Medal
for an outstanding book for children, the Kate Greenaway Medal for the best
children’s book illustration and the Somerset Maugham award for young
writers.
The British Museum Library in London (over 7 million volumes) is the largest
in Britain. The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million volumes) is in
Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million volumes).
Together with the Bodleian Library of Oxford University (2^ million
volumes) and the Cambridge University Library (2§ million volumes) these
comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive
a copy of each new book published in Britain: the British Museum Library
must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Other national libraries are the National Lending Library for Science
and Technology (see p. 214), the National Reference Library for Science and
Invention (see p. 214) and the National Central Library (see p. 226).
The Science Museum, Victoria and Albert and the British Museum
(Natural History) in South Kensington all have large libraries and many
government departments have old-established libraries of considerable size
and importance, for example those of the Board of Trade, Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Ministry of Defence. The Public
Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and of most
government departments, as well as such famous historical documents as
Domesday Book. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the
Historical Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private
records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the John Rylands
Library, Manchester, the Signet Library, Edinburgh, and the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the learned societies and institutions
(for scientific societies and institutions, see p. 201). Examples are the libraries
of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the
Royal Institute of British Architects (see p. 223), the British Drama League
(see p. 229), the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, the Central
Music Library (administered by Westminster City Council), the National
Library for the Blind and the National Book League, which also houses the
Arts Council library of modern English poetry.
The great expansion in education in recent years has increased the strain on
library resources at all levels of education. The ancient university libraries
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
Public Libraries

225
of Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by any of the more recent founda¬
tions, although the combined library resources of the colleges and institutions
of the University of London total over 3^ million volumes and the university
libraries of Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool,
Manchester and Leeds each have over half a million volumes. However,
many universities have succeeded in building up large and important research
collections in special subjects; for example the Barnes Medical Library at
Birmingham and the Brotherton Library of English Literature at Leeds.
1 ne new universities, including the new technological universities, are also
rapidly building initial collections.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, give instruction in the use of libraries. This service is often
organised by the public library, and stock and staff are sometimes common to
both services. Liaison between schools and public libraries is frequent in
most areas and parties of school children are regularly introduced to the
public library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
about 400 public library authorities (county councils, county borough councils,
London borough councils, municipal borough councils and urban district
councils). The authorities in Great Britain, which provide more than 11,000
service points, have a total stock of over 91 million books. (These figures
do not include the libraries in the publicly maintained schools.) Nearly
one-third of the total population are members of public libraries.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 the Secretary of State
for Education and Science is charged with the supervision of the public
library service in England and Wales, acting on the advice of the two Library
Advisory Councils, one for England, the other for Wales. Under the Act,
public library authorities are designated and have a duty to provide an
efficient and free lending and reference library service for books and periodicals.
Outlying areas may be served by mobile libraries, of which over 450 are in
service, and facilities exist for people who are normally unable to visit a
library.
In addition to lending books, about a quarter of the library authorities now
lend gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding
loan collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all
library authorities provide children’s departments and reference sections and
art, music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields.
Most library authorities possess a significant collection of books and docu¬
ments on the history of their localities. Qualified and specialist staff are
available for consultation in all but the smallest service points.
The public library is often a local cultural centre. Film shows, lectures,
adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramophone
recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities. An
increasing number of libraries provide special facilities for these extension
activities.
The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 gave statutory recognition to
the voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales which
had grown up since the first quarter of this century. The ten regional library
bureaux in England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each
area) aim to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British
226 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
books by means of a national system of subject specialisation. They organise
co-operation through their own member libraries and through the National
Central Library, which is responsible for interlending at national and inter¬
national level and has a bookstock of its own of over 300,000 volumes built up
by purchase, gift and the operation of the British National Book Centre
exchange scheme with foreign libraries. The combined resources of libraries
available to the National Central Library, which includes university, indus¬
trial and other non-public libraries, amount to some 100 million books and
many thousand sets of periodicals.
There is a growing number of schemes for the exchange of specialist books
and periodicals as well as information. These are organised by associations of
industrial and commercial libraries which combine their resources, normally
through the local public or technical college library.
The Scottish Central Library carries out functions similar to those of the
regional bureaux and the National Central Library. Both Central Libraries
are financed in part by Exchequer grants. In Northern Ireland access to the
stocks of all co-operating libraries is available on application to the Belfast
public libraries, Queen’s University Library and the county libraries.
Library The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which
Associations was granted a Royal Charter in 1898 to unite all people engaged or interested
in library work; to promote the better administration of libraries and, inter
alia, to hold examinations in librarianship and to issue certificates of efficiency.
The Association in 1967 had a membership of over 15,000, of whom 1,600
were from overseas countries. It maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians,
publishes books and pamphlets, a Yearbook and an official journal, Ihe
Library Association Record. The Association and its branches, groups and
sections hold regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries of
which Aslib (the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux,
see p. 214) and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries
(SCONUL) are of major importance.
Books New books constitute the large majority of all books published in Britain.
In 1966 British publishers issued 27,424 separate titles, of which 21,049 were
new books and the rest reprints or new editions. In recent years there has been
a great increase in the number of paperbacked books of all kinds.
The above figures include only a small selection of government publications
by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisa¬
tion in Britain. The great majority of books, however, are produced by about
300 of the principal commercial publishers. These include the university
presses, notably the Oxford University Press (including the Clarendon Press)
and the Cambridge University Press.
Using the copies deposited under copyright law in the British Museum,
the British National Bibliography is published weekly, with three, six, nine
and twelve monthly cumulations, listing in a classified order, with indexes, all
new books and new editions, excluding reprints, of books published in Britain.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association; in 1965 the Book Development Council was set up to
promote British books overseas. The Society of Authors is a professional
association of writers. The National Book League has a membership covering
all who are interested in books: authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and
readers. It encourages an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain
and overseas. Knowledge of British books and periodicals overseas is greatly

assisted by the British Council through the lending and reference libraries
(over 180 which it runs or supplies), and through the many book and
periodicals exhibitions which it sends on tour overseas. (For sales and exports
of books in 1966 see p. 312.)
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a
grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society, the Apollo Society and the Barrow Poets are among the best known.
Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals, including the
National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-
Avon Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the
biennial poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
Government support for drama is given through the Arts Councils of Great
Britain and of Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to certain theatrical
managements operating on a non-profit-distributing basis (that is, using
profits to finance future productions), provided that such managements have
given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of practical
competence. The Arts Council of Great Britain operates a scheme to promote
new drama: guarantees may be offered to managements giving the first pro¬
fessional production of selected new plays; and promising authors may be
awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in operation to train stage designers,
producers and those wishing to take up theatre administration.
The British Council makes the British theatre better known abroad by
organising and sponsoring international tours by leading British theatre
companies and individual actors and producers, and by sending overseas
drama lecturers and exhibitions of theatrical design or of books dealing with
the British theatre, and by providing newly published plays through its
overseas libraries.
There are about 200 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of theatrical
activity is in London, where there are some 30 principal theatres in the
‘West End5 and several more in the suburbs, but important developments
are taking place in the provinces. In London, with six exceptions (Covent
Garden, Sadler’s Wells, the Old Vic, the Royal Court, the Mermaid and the
Aldwych) the theatres are let to some 25 producing managements on a
commercial basis for each production.
Among London companies receiving Arts Council grants are the National
Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, the English Stage Company,
which produces contemporary plays mainly at the Royal Court Theatre and
the Mermaid.
The National Theatre Company was formed in 1963; it will eventually
play in the new National Theatre, to be built on the south bank of the Thames

in London. The capital costs of the theatre will be met by the Exchequer and
the Greater London Council; grants towards the Company’s running costs
are being made by the Arts Council and the Greater London Council.
The Company, whose repertoire consists of classical and modern plays from
all countries, is large enough for simultaneous productions to be undertaken
in London (at the Old Vic Theatre) and in the provinces or overseas.
The Royal Shakespeare Company presents Shakespearean plays at the
Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, and international classical
and modern plays at the Aldwych Theatre, London. It will eventually have a
permanent London home in the proposed City of London arts centre in the
Barbican.
The provincial theatres are served by productions touring either before or
after London presentation, by companies specially formed for touring, and
by local repertory companies. An important development is the growth of
the civic theatre. The term is generally taken to include some companies which
have the use of their own theatres (as in Lincoln, Liverpool and Birmingham)
or rent them from a local authority (as at Bristol and Chesterfield), and those
like the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, and the Nottingham Playhouse which
were built by the city councils. These companies are assisted by the Arts
Council. Many of the leading dramatists, producers, designers, actors and
actresses in Britain started their careers in such companies.
A number of new theatres have been opened both in London and the
provinces in recent years, including, in London, the Mermaid Theatre and
the completely reconstructed Queen’s Theatre. Coventry’s Belgrade Theatre
opened in 1958, was the first full-scale theatre to be built by a civic authority
since 1939. Since then civic theatres have been built at Croydon, Eastbourne
and Torquay, and smaller theatres have been opened at Middlesbrough,
Richmond (Yorkshire) and Whitehaven (Cumberland). The Nottingham
Playhouse and the Phoenix Theatre, Leicester, opened in 1963, the Yvonne
Arnaud Theatre at Guildford in 1965 and the Adeline Genee Theatre at
East Grinstead in 1967. A Festival Theatre opened in 1962 at Chichester,
Sussex.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in
Ulster comedy; and the Belfast Arts Theatre presents some international
drama and lighter theatrical entertainment. The Lyric Players Theatre, a
non-profit-making organisation, under a board of trustees, presents Irish and
international drama, and plans to build a small theatre in or near Belfast.
All professional theatres are eligible for grants in respect of specific productions
approved by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
All plays are subject to the provisions of the Theatres Act 1843, which deals
with the licensing of theatres and plays and requires all new plays to be
approved by the Lord Chamberlain (the senior officer of the Royal House¬
hold), who may forbid the presentation of any play ‘for the preservation of
good manners, decorum, or of the public peace’. In the commercial theatre,
the Lord Chamberlain may require amendments to be made to the text of a
play, but the number of plays for which a licence is refused amounts to under
one per cent of the total submitted. In 1967 a joint committee of both Houses
of Parliament recommended that licensing and censorship in the theatre
should be abolished.
Most managers and artists are members of professional organisations such
as the Theatres’ Advisory Council, the London Theatre Council, the
Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West End Managers, the Theatrical
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 229
Managers Association, the Council of Repertory Theatres, British Actors’
Equity (the actors’ trade union) and the League of Dramatists. The trade
union of theatre staffs is the National Association of Theatrical and Kine
Employees.
Amateur
Theatre
There are thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain with an active
membership of some half a million. They are encouraged by local education
authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special organisations—the
British Diama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations,
the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of Ulster
Drama Festivals. Amateur companies which stage productions in their own
theatres belong to the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain; for instance,
the Maddermarket Theatre in Norwich and the Questor’s Theatre, Ealing.
Most universities have active amateur drama clubs and societies; an
International Festival of University Theatre, inaugurated by Bristol in 1959,
is held annually.

most important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (which is grant-
aided and provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the Rose Bruford Training College,
the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the Webber-Douglas
School, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Arts Educational
Schools, all of which are in or near London; and the Old Vic School in
Bristol. In Scotland there is the College of Dramatic Art which is an integral
part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow and is grant-aided
by the Scottish Education Department. An increasing number of universities
offer courses in drama.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the
history and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre
Institute has a British centre in London. The main purpose of the institute is
to foster international goodwill and understanding by interchange of students,
theatrical companies, personnel and theatrical information.
Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in
drama. A drama centre for the London education service is provided at
Toynbee Hall in east London. At Coventry special productions are arranged
for school children and members of the Belgrade Theatre’s staff teach at local
schools. Sheffield’s Theatre Vanguard puts on plays for and by children and
Nottingham has a Youth Theatre Workshop.
A large number of organisations such as the Unicorn Theatre Trust and
'Theatre Centre present children’s plays in London and the provinces. The
National Youth Theatre, whose members are all young people, presents
mainly Shakespearean productions in London, the provinces and abroad.
Music in all its forms draws large audiences; and music festivals, orchestral
concerts, choral singing, brass bands, chamber music, opera and ballet are
important features of British cultural life. The increase in musical appreciation
in recent years is shown by the size of audiences for concerts and for broadcast
music. Nearly 85 million gramophone records were produced during 1966.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library which lends to
other libraries and individuals. Another well-known music collection is the
Henry Watson Music Library at the Manchester Central Library.

Music Festivals
The Arts Council of Great Britain makes grants to a number of orchestras,
opera and ballet companies, and music societies. The British Council gives
financial assistance to some of the overseas tours of British orchestras, soloists,
and opera and ballet companies; it sponsors recordings of works by British
composers and maintains 102 libraries of British music (scores and records)
in 67 countries overseas and, at its London headquarters, a reference library
of records, scores and books on music.
The National Music Council, representative of many aspects of British
musical activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council which is
associated with UNESCO.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, adjacent to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room which were opened in 1967
for smaller-scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where
the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; and the Wigmore
Hall, an important recital centre.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the New Philharmonia, the
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the City of Birming¬
ham Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Northern Sinfonia
(Newcastle upon Tyne), the Scottish National and the BBC Symphony,
Northern and Scottish orchestras. There are also specialised string and
chamber orchestras such as the Philomusica of London, the English Chamber
Orchestra and the London Mozart Players. Many of these receive financial
aid from the Arts Council of Great Britain and local authorities; some of them
also receive assistance from commercial television and other business
organisations. The new permanent Ulster Orchestra has been formed in
Belfast by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, and replaces the former
part-time City of Belfast Orchestra.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC
Choral, the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic
Choir, the London Philharmonic Choir, the New Philharmonia Chorus, the
Bach Choir, the Royal Edinburgh Choral Union and the Belfast Philharmonic
Society. These and many other choral societies are associated with famous
orchestras in major choral works; most of them, together with hundreds of
similar choral and orchestral societies and music clubs, are affiliated to the
National Federation of Music Societies, through which they are supported
with funds provided by the Arts Council. Among societies which specialise
in encouraging the performance of the work of living musicians are the
Society for the Promotion of New Music, the Music Section of the Institute
of Contemporary Arts, and Macnaghten Concerts.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 200 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals such as at King’s Lynn, last a week or less.
Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales; the
Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the National Gaelic Mod, held at a
different place in Scotland each year; the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted
to contemporary British music; the Aldeburgh Festival; the Bath Festival;
the Coventry Festival; the Haslemere Festival; the biennial York Festival;

and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals, which include important choral
music, and which are held triennially. An annual international festival of folk
song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees
of local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music.
The Rural Music Schools Association is concerned with music-making by
amateurs in country districts; it brings together professional musicians,
teachers, administrators and amateurs.
Professional organisations which look after the interests of music and
musicians include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of
Musicians, the Composers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, leased by the Government to the Royal Opera
House, Covent Garden, Limited, which was formed in 1944 to make the
famous opera house the home of a national opera and ballet, and which
receives a grant from the Arts Council. The Royal Opera House has its own
opera company and a ballet company (The Royal Ballet) which give perfor¬
mances in London and elsewhere. The opera company numbers about 200
and has a permanent orchestra. The Royal Ballet has a high international
reputation and has made many overseas tours.
Seasons of opera and operetta are also given at Sadler’s Wells Theatre in
London; with two permanent opera companies, Sadler’s Wells plays in
London throughout the year, and for about 35 weeks in other centres.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international
cast is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies
include the English Opera Group, noted for its performances of chamber
operas by Benjamin Britten and other composers; the New Opera Company,
formed by members of the Cambridge Opera Group to produce new operas
in London; the Handel Opera Society; the Intimate Opera Company, which
performs works for very small casts in any hall available; and the Welsh
National Opera Company. Scottish Opera presents annual seasons in several
Scottish towns. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the Grand Opera
Society of Northern Ireland and the Studio Opera Group, both receiving a
subsidy from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. The Arts Council of
Great Britain presents three small operatic groups (Opera for All) which
specialise in introducing opera to audiences in small towns. There are also a
number of amateur opera societies.
Among other ballet companies are London’s Festival Ballet, the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company) and the Western Theatre Ballet
which specialises in contemporary works. The work of the Patricia Mulholland
Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland, which is sponsored by the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the
most prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of
Music in London, the Royal Manchester College of Music and the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow; all are grant-aided. There are also
the Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama,
both in London, and the Birmingham School of Music.

The London Opera Centre for Advanced Training and Development was
opened in 1963, and its building provides some rehearsal and other facilities
for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Its courses last two or three
years. The leading ballet schools are the Royal Ballet, the Rambert Ballet
School and the Royal Academy of Dancing which, with many private schools,
have played an important part in raising British ballet to its present high
standard. Other schools offering general education combined with drama
and/or ballet are run by the Arts Educational Trust and the Italia Conti School.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent concerts for children and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and the London
Schools’ Symphony Orchestra are noted for their high standard of perfor¬
mance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international
Jeunesses Musicales, encourages opera, ballet and other performances for
young people.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
over 160,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exam¬
inations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest
proportion (over 73,000) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The Royal Ballet sponsors a small group, Ballet for All, to give lecture-
demonstrations to the public and to schools.
Although cinema attendance has been steadily declining in Great Britain
since its peak of 1,635 million in 1946 to 290 million in 1966, and the number
of cinemas has declined from 4,709 in 1946 to 1,835 in July I967> British
films, actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated both at home and
abroad and frequently achieve success at international film events. Television
offers very large potential audiences for films and provides opportunities of
employment for technicians and actors.
London is one of the most important centres for the making of films for
international markets and export earnings are an important part of total
earnings. The Film Production Association of Great Britain is the trade
association to which many feature film producers belong.
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back
to 1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since
then, British documentary technicians have continued to produce high
quality factual films which have won numerous international awards. The
British Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in
industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film
Associations, the trade association of documentary, short, industrial, adver¬
tising and cartoon film makers, has about 100 members.
Films from abroad made in languages other than English often draw large
audiences in London and other large cities.
Although over half of British main feature production is supported by United
States interests at present, the Rank Organisation and Associated British
Picture Corporation maintain a substantial interest in production, distribution
and exhibition. Most British film producers are independent but make films
in association with these major interests. There are numerous companies,
many of them small, which produce short films.

There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
tilm Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production. Its
members are appointed by the Board of Trade and its funds are limited by
statute to £8 million. In recent years the Corporation was financially concerned
with about half the main feature films made in British studios, but this
proportion has now fallen in view of the American support available.
There is also a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund.
The money so raised is paid out as a percentage of a film’s takings, so that
the more successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the
fund. Started by the industry in 1950 on a voluntary basis, the scheme
became statutory under the Cinematograph Films Act 1957.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences
overseas about British life and achievement, including documentary films,
television programmes and newsreels; they are produced through the Central
Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by private
companies. These, together with films acquired from private industry and
public bodies, are distributed throughout the world, in English and many
foreign languages, by British Information Services. The British Council also
distributes overseas a wide range of specialised films mainly on the arts,
education, medicine, science and technology.
Films are also sponsored by the Government, some for specialised audiences,
on such subjects as science, agriculture, health and industry, as well as films
for the general public on, for example, road safety and health education.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Travel Association and the British
Productivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other
countries are available through the COFs Central Film Library and other
agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish
films covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Fo help British films to meet the keen American competition, legislation
passed in 1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent
legislation), under which a certain proportion of British films must be shown
in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade
annually after consultation with the Cinematograph Films Council, any
change being effected by statutory instrument approved by both Houses of
Parliament. For main feature films it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950.
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it
can be shown a film must be licensed by the local licensing authority. There
are about 700 of these (usually the local authorities or, in some areas,
magistrates). In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally
rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film
Censors, to which are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended for
public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative
of the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in
the films offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written
code of censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate
to a film; very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are
placed in one of three categories: ‘U’ (suitable for universal showing); ‘A’
(more suitable for adults than children who are admitted only if accompanied
by an adult); and ‘X’ (suitable only for adults; children are not admitted).

Film reviews appear regularly in the press and on sound and television
programmes and many organisations are interested in different aspects of
the film. There are numerous private film societies.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant.
The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films. It also
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the University
Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and Television.
The National Film Archive contains over 18,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and
about 500,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the
art of the film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames, in London,
shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it holds
a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the films shown.
The British Film Institute is promoting the development of regional film
theatres on the lines of the National Film Theatre and makes grants towards
their capital costs.
The Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in 1958 by the amalgama¬
tion of the British Film Academy and the Guild of Television Producers and
Directors, has as its aim to improve the standard of film and television
production and to stimulate public appreciation of the arts.
The National Film Theatre organises an annual London Film Festival,
which includes films receiving their first showing as well as films which have
been successful in international competitive festivals. A council on which
leading British film organisations are represented organises a film festival as
part of the Edinburgh International Festival.
The Cinematograph Act 1952 (which came into force in January 1956)
provided for the making of regulations by the Home Secretary to protect
the health and welfare of children attending film shows. Cinemas which give
children’s shows require a special licence from the licensing authority, which
may impose conditions. There are about 900 children’s cinema clubs which
provide special programmes on Saturday mornings. An important contribu¬
tion to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film Foundation, which
produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children
and publishes at intervals a list of films particularly suitable for children and
for exhibition at children’s matinees. The Foundation is a non-profit-making
body set up by the British film industry in 1951 and, under the Cinematograph
Films Act 1957, it receives grants from the British Film Fund Agency.
10 The National
Economy
BACKGROUND
Britain ranks about 75^ in size among the countries of the world, with
about o-i8 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, approaching
2 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks tenth. In density of population
it is fourth: of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands
are more crowded; and there are nine times as many people to the square
mile in the United Kingdom as in the United States. In terms of national
income per head it ranks appreciably below the United States and also below
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, and about on a
par with France and the Federal Republic of Germany. In world trade, it
ranks third, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total. It takes about a fifth
of the world’s exports of primary products, and provides about one-seventh of
the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
Britain, from its own soil, provides only about half of the food it needs,
and—apart from coal, low-grade iron ore and natural gas—it has few natural
resources; thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat,
meat, butter, fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber.
In return, it is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles,
electrical equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. No
other major country has such a small proportion of the working population
engaged in agriculture (less than 3^ per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an
area with a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the
sterling area use sterling in their international transactions, and it is the
currency in which about one-third of the world’s trade is conducted.
The Economy During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
before 1939 manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able
to support a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living.
During the period from 1870 to 1890 British industrial expansion had a
clear lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make
itself felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly
cotton textiles and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by
the continued demand for British textiles from India and other eastern
countries, and by the continued high level of overseas investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and
Japan, where labour was cheaper, established themselves firmly in the large
eastern markets, to a great extent replacing the more expensive and often
higher quality British products. The extension of the world demand for coal
was slowed down by the increasing use of oil, while coal from the newer
European mines competed keenly with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of
236
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Effects of
the Second
World War
The Post-war
Period
industries (for instance, locomotives and ships) world demand fell away a ter
a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share
of the expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products (for
example, vehicles and electrical goods). Most countries were tending towards
self-sufficiency, and some sought deliberately to protect nascent and even
established industries by tariffs and (later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the
terms of trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned
the effect of a fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high.
The loss of export markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple
industries—coal, cotton, iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering.
The result was heavy unemployment, the general rate of which averaged
14 per cent of the working population in the years 1921-39, reaching a peak
of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its worst. In
districts relying mainly on one or other of the staple industries, the rate was
much higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment
took place, stimulated by an increase in home investment which was aided
by the policy of cheap money, by some revival in world trade and, after 1935,
by the armament programme. The decade saw a strong expansion in the
vehicles, electrical, chemicals and aircraft industries, while the construction
of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the building and ancillary
industries. By 1937 average real income per head was about 14 per cent
higher than in 1929.
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic
capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and
arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. Some £1,000 million
worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in North America, and
new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated. By 1944 exports had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume as a result of the war effort.
Economic conditions in the immediate post-war period led to many of the
war-time restrictions remaining in force. Holdings of gold and foreign
exchange had been greatly depleted to pay for the essential war-time supplies
from overseas, and the export trade had to be rebuilt. Thus, rationing and
other war-time controls could only be relaxed gradually with the expansion
of production and the progress of recovery, this process being largely
completed by about mid-1954. The abolition of quantitative restrictions on
imports, other than from the dollar area, was largely completed by 1955-
Exchange controls on transactions between the sterling area and the rest of
the world were also progressively lifted, and in 1958 convertibility of sterling
on current account for all non-residents was introduced.
In the 1960s the main objective in government economic policies has been
to achieve faster economic growth and to overcome the recurring balance of
payments problem (see p. 243) which has from time to time necessitated the
creation of a margin of spare capacity greater than would otherwise have been
desired and has thereby impaired the general expansion of the economy.
THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of Britain’s national
economy in recent years. The source of Tables 11 to 14 is Preliminary Estimates
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 237
of National Income and Balance of Payments 1961 to 1966 (Cmnd. 3244) and
Economic Trends.
OUTPUT AND
EMPLOYMENT
In 1966 Britain s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the
value of total goods and services produced at home and net income from
abroad) is estimated to have totalled ^32>339 million. In real terms, that is,
after allowing for price changes, the increase over the ten-year period to
1966 has amounted to about one-third.
The working population has been rising relatively slowly; in the ten years
to the middle of 1967 it increased by about 1^ million (or some 5 per cent) to
about 26 million, of whom two-thirds are males. The expansion of the
national income over the same period has, therefore, been mainly the result
of higher productivity. Unemployment over the past two decades remained
very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the working population being
out of work, compared with 14 per cent between the two world wars. It has
tended to remain above the national average in Northern Ireland, Scotland,
Wales and the north-east and certain other parts of England (where special
measures are providing additional sources of employment), but in London,
the south and the Midlands the number of unfilled employment vacancies has
usually exceeded that of registered unemployed, thus leading to strong
competition among employers for available labour. While some industries,
notably coalmining, the railways, cotton textiles and agriculture, have under¬
gone a marked reduction in their labour force—of the order of 400,000, in the
last five years—the needs of the expanding sectors of the economy have not
always been fully met. Retraining of workers is progressing but the overall
shortage of labour is likely to continue for some years and will have to be met
through the further raising of productivity, especially in manufacturing.

Manufacturing industry contributes about 35 per cent to the total output
of goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, construction
and public utilities (gas, electricity and water) makes up just under half of
the total; agriculture, forestry and fisheries account for just over 3 per cent;
and transport and communications, together with the distributive trades, for
20 per cent. The remainder, just over one-quarter of total output, includes
public administration, education, health and finance and other services. Over
the past ten years there has been a marked decline in the proportion contributed
by agriculture (though agricultural output is still rising).

It will be seen from the diagram above that the share attributable to fixed
capital formation rose appreciably between 1956 and 1966, in part reflecting
the growth of public investment, while public authorities’ current expenditure
on goods and services—which declined between 1953 and 1959 as a result of
reductions in defence expenditure—has risen relatively much faster over the
five years to 1966. Over the whole period the expansion in real terms of exports
of goods and services (34 per cent) and consumer expenditure (34 per cent)
has been broadly in line with the growth of the gross national product
(33 per cent), but in the case of capital formation the rate of increase (70 per
cent) has been more than twice as high.
Gross fixed investment has risen markedly in the last 15 years. In 1951 fixed
investment in the United Kingdom was about 15 per cent of the gross national
product; it has been maintained at a high level in recent years, reaching
over 20 per cent in 1966. Fixed investment in manufacturing, which accounts
for 22 per cent of all fixed investment, in 1966 amounted to £1,456 million at
current prices, an increase of 4 per cent over 1965. In real terms also the high
level reached in 1965 was maintained in 1966. Investment has recently been
especially high in the chemicals and electronics industries. Also, electricity
generation and transmission and gas are sectors with continuing large-scale
investment programmes. There has been a substantially expanded investment
in housing; in 1966 it was nearly 60 per cent higher than in 1961. In some

years, such as 1951, i960 and 1964, the level of economic activity has been
influenced by a high and rising investment in stocks and in work in progress.
More than 40 per cent of total fixed investment in each of the last 15 years,
except in 1961, has been carried out by the central Government, the local
authorities and the public corporations, the last accounting for an average of
about 45 per cent of public investment over the period, and the central
Government for about 15 per cent. Public investment in 1966 amounted to
£3,118 million, an increase of £312 million over 1965 reflecting increased
expenditure on education, hospitals, roads, electric power supplies and other
services. Table 12 shows the division of gross fixed investment in 1956 and

higher than in 1951, on the same basis of calculation. About 30 per cent of
the total was attributable to dwellings and 22 per cent to assets in manufac¬
turing and construction.
The marked growth of investment has been accompanied by a substantial
increase in personal savings (see Table 13), which in 1966 amounted to
£1,967 million. As a proportion of disposable income (7I per cent) personal
savings were below the 1961 level of 9 per cent but well above that of 1956
(5|- per cent).

“ Gross saving, that is, before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation and
for tax, dividend and interest reserves.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. There has been
increased investment by the personal sector itself in new dwellings and fixed
assets. Life assurance premiums and other forms of contractual savings, such
as superannuation funds, have grown almost without interruption for many
years and now contribute over half the total. National Savings have also
increased since the early 1950s, although in 1966, exceptionally, there was
a decline of £30 million. Building societies are able to attract considerable sums
of personal savings, deposits having reached a peak of £762 million in 1966.
The largest contribution to savings comes from companies. Up to 1959,
these provided about half the total, but the proportion has since fallen to about
40 per cent in 1966. In that year there was a decline of 6 per cent compared
with 1965 on account of a fall in profits in the United Kingdom.
Public corporations, as part of the policy of financing a larger share of their
investment needs from their own resources, have raised their savings total
considerably in recent years and the 1966 level accounted for about a twelfth
of total savings.
Current expenditure, that is, excluding public investment and other capital
expenditure but including interest paid on debt, by the central Government
(including the national insurance funds) and the local authorities rose by
46 per cent at current prices over the period 1961 to 1966 and in the latter
year amounted to about two-fifths of the gross national product. The main
causes of this increase have been the continuing growth of the social services,
especially education, and defence expenditure, which accounted for 16 per
cent of the total current expenditure of the public authorities in 1966
(compared with a peak of 27 per cent in 1953).
Several appreciable increases in taxation rates, imposed partly to reduce
the volume of demand on resources, have raised sharply the inflow of revenue.

Thus the yield from taxes on income in 1966 went up by £426 million,
or over 10 per cent; and taxes on expenditure brought in an additional
^474 million following an increase of ^408 million in 1965. Revenue from
the taxes on income in 1966 accounted for nearly 40 per cent of central
Government receipts, and taxes on expenditure for 38 per cent. National
insurance, national health and other contributions accounted for 16 per cent
and the remainder was from rent, dividends and interest and trading income.
Revenue from rates imposed by local authorities rose by 67 per cent from
1961 to 1966. Rates account for 38 per cent and grants from the central
Government for 40 per cent of current receipts of local authorities.

Personal
Income and
Consumer
Expenditure
Income from employment in 1966 totalled ,£22,346 million and accounted
for 71 per cent of total personal income (against 60 per cent in 1938). The
diagram on p. 242 shows the composition of personal income and expenditure
in 1966.
Of a total of 27-6 million incomes in 1965, there were only about 30,000
incomes of more than ,£6,000 a year after tax. About a quarter (6-8 million) of
incomes after tax were in the ^250-^499 range and 5-5 million were in the
next range of £500-^749. The number of incomes after tax of £1,000 a year
and above rose from 1 - i million in 1955 to 7-2 million in 1965. Just over 75 per
cent of the yield from income tax and surtax came from persons with annual
incomes in this latter category, although the total incomes before tax of this
group accounted for just under a half of total income.
The ownership of property and personal assets tends to be more concen¬
trated than income after tax. Estimates made by the Board of Inland Revenue
indicate that, in 1965, 80 per cent of net personal wealth (including landed
property), amounting to about £70,700 million, was owned by just over
5 million individuals, nearly 10 per cent of the population.

While consumer expenditure rose by nearly 74 per cent at current prices
between 1956 and 1966 to reach a total of £24,007 million, in real terms (that
is, after discounting the effect of price changes) the increase was only about
33 per cent. The proportion devoted to food has been falling slightly each year
and now accounts for 25 per cent at current prices (1956, 31 per cent); outlay
on tobacco and alcoholic drinks is about 13 per cent of consumer expenditure.
In real terms expenditure on tobacco fell by 8 per cent between 1961 and 1966,
but substantial increases in taxes over the period caused total outlay to rise
by 24 per cent at current prices. At current prices housing absorbs 11 per
cent of total expenditure, and fuel and light about 5 per cent. Spending on
motor cars and motor cycles fell in 1965 and 1966 after rising strongly for a
number of years. There has also been a substantial growth in spending on
household electrical equipment (except in 1966), fuel and light, and clothing.
Outlays on running costs of vehicles have risen from £273 million in 1956 t°
£1,052 million in 1966. In general the pattern of consumer spending reflects the
social changes and other developments outlined in Chapter 1. The diagram on
p. 243 shows the change in consumers’ expenditure since 1958 in real terms
and at current prices.
PROBLEMS FACING THE ECONOMY
Throughout the post-war period, successive governments have sought solu¬
tions to a number of closely inter-connected problems facing the economy:
the problem of maintaining a sound balance of payments position and so
assuring the strength of sterling; the problem presented by the tendency for
incomes to rise faster than productivity and so leading to inflationary increases
in costs; and the need to achieve a higher rate of expansion of national output.
In recent years, the Government’s general approach to these difficulties has
been to promote structural changes in industry and the long-term develop¬
ment of the economy so as to mobilise more effectively economic resources
and to improve the nation’s economic performance. At times (most recently
in July 1966) the need to strengthen the position of sterling and to ensure
a sound balance of payments has required measures to restrict severely the
pressure of home demand.

The United Kingdom’s economic problems have been reflected in periodic
balance of payments difficulties, which have led to sharp checks to economic
expansion and productive investment; these in turn have left the country
vulnerable to further foreign exchange difficulties when expansion was
resumed. Britain’s exports have been growing at only an average rate of about
3 per cent per annum in volume over the past decade; the corresponding
increase in the volume of imports has been over 4 per cent per annum, and
imports of manufactures have risen particularly sharply. Despite a consider¬
able improvement in the terms of trade over the period the average current
surplus on visible and invisible trade together has not been sufficient to
finance Britain’s overseas expenditure arising from its overseas commitments,
private investment abroad and its position as bankers to the overseas sterling
area. The most important of these costs are overseas military expenditure,
which rose from ^101 million (net) to ^272 million (net) over the past ten
years, and economic grant assistance to less-developed or dependent territories,
which rose from £44 million to £85 million; in addition, there are government
loans to overseas countries and multilateral assistance in the form of contri¬
butions to international agencies. Britain also has to make repayments of
capital and interest from post-war loans from the United States and Canada,
the servicing of which requires about ^69 million a year.
At the same time Britain’s private overseas investment has averaged well
over ^300 million a year, a considerable portion of the outflow being to the
less-developed countries. Although this is partly offset by private investment
in Britain from overseas, mainly from the United States, in most years the
net flow has been outward.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Following an expansion of output in 1963 and 1964 there was a deficit on
current and long-term capital account of £763 million in 1964. A substantial
recovery has taken place since and the deficit was reduced to £357 million in
1965 and £187 million in 1966. In May 1967 Britain repaid in advance to the
International Monetary Fund £145 million of its drawing of £357 million1
made in 1964 and the whole of its £28 million loan from Switzerland. It is
intended to repay the balance of the 1964 drawing by the end of 1967, and
to repay by 1970 a further drawing of £500 million made in 1965. Even after
the repayment of Britain’s undisclosed swap (reciprocal credit) facilities with
other central banks and the servicing of the North American loans (see p. 243)
the reserves were rising in most months in the first half of 1967; they stood
at £1,012 million at the end of June 1967. The temporary surcharge on
imports was ended in November 1966. Besides measures to assist exports,
the Government’s long-term efforts are being directed towards improving the
efficiency and competitiveness of the economy so as to reduce the demand for
imported goods and improve export performance; and a reshaping of govern¬
ment commitments overseas.
The problems to overcome in achieving a faster rate of growth are in the main
centred on improving industrial efficiency and increasing productivity, but of
necessity require a variety of approaches. Among the most important of these
is the work of the Economic Development Committees in examining the
points of weakness in the most important industries, the work of the Ministry
of Technology in fostering the introduction and development of advanced
techniques, and industrial training programmes to meet the need for skilled
labour. The Government’s intention of using the purchasing power of the
public sector to assist industry in improving its efficiency was set out in a
White Paper, Public Purchasing and Industrial Efficiency (Cmnd. 3291),
published in May 1967. An Industrial Reorganisation Corporation has been
set up to promote desirable amalgamations and reorganisations in industry.
Taxation policy is being used to strengthen manufacturing industry relative
to services and other non-manufacturing activities with the introduction of
investment grants (in place of tax allowances) and a selective employment tax
(see p. 380). This has been accompanied by special financial assistance to
industry in extended development areas where resources are under¬
employed and by incentives to improve labour mobility including legislation
providing for redundancy payments and improved re-training facilities.
Efforts are being made to eliminate restrictive practices in both sides of indus¬
try and legislation against monopolies and mergers has been strengthened.
As in many other countries where full employment has prevailed over the past
decade and the demands on resources have been strong, Britain has had to deal
with continuing inflationary pressures. The almost uninterrupted upward
trend in prices has resulted principally from the tendency for money incomes
to rise faster than the volume of production, thus raising costs throughout the
economy.
Since 1956 the average annual rate of increase in domestic incomes has
been about 6 per cent, while the increase in the gross domestic product per
head of the labour force has been only between 2 and 2| per cent. Retail prices
rose on average by nearly 4 per cent a year between January 1956 and
1 The amount outstanding on this loan had in fact already been reduced to £292
million on account of other countries’ drawings of sterling from the Fund.

December 1966; while over roughly the same period average weekly earnings
of manual workers went up by about 6| per cent a year. Company profits are
subject to large cyclical swings, but since 1956 and especially since 1961 they
have increased more slowly than employment incomes. These trends are
illustrated by the diagram above. Successive governments in attempting
to contain the pressure of demand have relied extensively on monetary and
fiscal measures; on variations in the volume and cost of bank credit; on hire-
purchase controls; and on changes in the levels of taxation and public expendi¬
ture. In recent years government policy on prices and incomes has been
directed towards relating increases in money incomes to economic growth by
establishing machinery (see pp. 247-8) to examine wage and salary claims and
selected price increases, and towards increasing public awareness of the need
for voluntary restraint of demands for increased incomes in order to preserve
reasonable stability in cost and prices.
ECONOMIC PLANNING
A framework of longer-term economic planning and consultation between
Government and industry has been evolved in recent years within which the
aim is for economic growth and improvements in industrial efficiency and real
incomes to be reconciled with a high and stable level of employment, a favour¬
able balance of payments and the promotion of social justice. A new govern¬
ment department, the Department of Economic Affairs (see p. 50), which
among other things is responsible for economic planning, was set up in October
1964. It works in close consultation with the Treasury and other government
departments. A Ministry of Technology (see p. 60) was set up at the same
time, to stimulate a more rapid application of scientific and technological
246

advances in British industry. A number of other bodies dealing with economic
planning and consultation have been in existence for some years; they
include the National Economic Development Council (NEDC) and its
Economic Development Committees (EDCs) and regional planning bodies
dealing with the special problems of Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
The Department
of Economic
Affairs
The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) is responsible for framing plans
for economic development and for the general co-ordination of action to
implement them, including, in particular, policies for industry, the regions,
incomes and prices, and economic growth. It works with representatives of
management and unions directly and through the National Economic Develop¬
ment Council.

The National Economic Development Council was set up in February 1962
originally to examine the economic performance of the nation with particular
concern for plans for the future in both the private and the public sectors, to
consider uses of national resources and to seek agreement upon ways of
increasing the rate of sound economic growth. In 1963 it published a document,
Growth of the United Kingdom Economy to 1966, which set out the main
economic projections and outlined a coherent pattern of growth. It was
reorganised in November 1964 following the setting up of the DEA.
The NEDC brings together representatives of Government and industry
and makes possible wide discussion of planning and policy. The Prime Minister
chairs some meetings. Ministers from the economic departments are also
members or may attend meetings. Other members are the President of the
Board of Trade, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Technology, the
chairman of the National Board for Prices and Incomes, a number of repre¬
sentatives from private and nationalised industry, independent members and
the Director General of the National Economic Development Office (NEDO).
The Council, which meets at frequent intervals, is assisted by the NEDO,
whose permanent staff (not members of the Civil Service) is headed by the
Director General.
The NEDC has set up a number of Economic Development Committees.
With one exception each EDC is concerned with one of the major industries
and is composed of members from management and unions in that industry,
the responsible government department, the Department of Economic Affairs,
and other specialists. The EDCs assist in planning by advising on the implica¬
tions for their industries of developments in the economy and the potential
contribution of each industry to national growth. They also study and promote
the application of measures to improve efficiency in each industry.
National In the Government published its National Plan. This set a target of
Planning 25 per cent growth in output from 1964 to 1970, examined the prospects for
each sector of the economy and set out a programme of action to improve
economic performance. It was recognised that achievement of the growth
target would depend on success in dealing with the balance of payments
programme. The developments which necessitated the corrective measures
taken in July 1966, therefore, clearly invalidated many of the assumptions
contained in the Plan. The Government has stated that the programme of
action in the Plan remains valid. During 1967 there have been discussions in
NEDC and the EDCs to establish an agreed basis between Government and
industry for a further planning operation.

Long-term planning of public expenditure has been developed by successive
Governments, and annual surveys have been undertaken since 1961 (see
P- 375)’ One of the objects of such planning is to relate public expenditure
programmes, and their demands on national resources, to the expected
development of the economy. It is the Government’s policy in the light of its
assessment of economic and social priorities, to allow expenditure to grow
somewhat faster than the national income. In February 1965 the Government
announced its decision to limit the rise in expenditure by central and local
government to an average of 4^ per cent a year at constant prices between
1964-65 and 1969-70. The rise was not intended to be uniform each year and
it was announced in July 1967 after a further review that although there had
been deliberately above-average increases in the earlier years, it was hoped
that a rise of 3 per cent a year on average in the period to 1970-71 would be
sufficient to enable the programmes set out in the Plan to be fulfilled and thus
maintain the average of 4J per cent over the whole period.
In recent years it has become increasingly recognised that a generally stable
price level combined with sustained economic growth can be achieved only
within the framework of an incomes policy designed to keep the rise in money
incomes broadly in line with the long-term rate of growth in national
production.
The present Government’s incomes policy since 1964 has been developed
in consultation with representatives of management and workers. First, the
Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomes, signed in
December 1964, formulated the lines of action to be taken by the Govern¬
ment and by management and unions.
The next step was the setting up in April 1965 of a National Board for
Prices and Incomes (NBPI). The Board investigates all questions of prices
and incomes referred to it by the Government. It sits in private making as
thorough an examination of the issues involved as possible, using evidence
provided both by the parties involved and by outside inquiries. Up to August
1967 the Board published 40 reports on references made to it, including a
Second General Report (Cmnd. 3394) on its activities.
The third stage was the publication of a White Paper, Prices and Incomes
Policy (Cmnd. 2639), setting out considerations which should guide all
concerned with prices and incomes policy.
In September 1965 in view of the urgent need to make its prices and incomes
policy more effective, the Government announced its intention of introducing
legislation. In the interim a voluntary ‘early warning system’ was operated,
the purpose of which was to give the Government adequate opportunity of
considering proposals to increase wages or prices and whether to refer them
to the NBPI. Under these arrangements price increases were notified to the
appropriate government department while pay claims and settlements were
notified to the Trades Union Congress or to the Ministry of Labour. A
decision to refer had to be taken within 28 days. Where the Government
considered there was a prima facie case for reference to the Board there was a
further stand-still period of up to three months while the Board reported. This
system remains as part of the Government’s object of establishing a prices
and incomes policy on a voluntary basis.
On 20th July 1966 a stand-still on prices and incomes was announced in which,
for a period of 12 months, productivity would be allowed to catch up with
the excessive increases in incomes which had been taking place. The object

for the first six months (up to the end of December 1966) was to avoid as far
as possible increases in prices and incomes altogether; this was followed by a
period of severe restraint in the first half of 1967* In addition to wages and
prices the stand-still also covered other forms of remuneration, such as
directors’ fees, and company distributions.
The Prices and Incomes Act 1966, which received Royal Assent on 12th
August 1966, gave the Government powers of two kinds which could be
brought into operation by Order in Council. Under Part II of the Act powers
could be taken for a renewable period of 12 months to require notification of
increases in prices and charges, company distributions, and the terms and
conditions of employment. Under Part IV of the Act unrenewable powers
could be taken for a period of 12 months from the passing of the Act to require
that particular prices and wages should not be increased or should revert to
the level prevailing on 20th July 1966. Part IV of the Act was brought into
operation from 6th October 1966 to 11 August 1967, although only a limited
use had to be made of these powers, and Part II (as amended) came into force
on 12th August 1967 for a period of 12 months (see below).
A White Paper, Prices and Incomes Policy after 30th June 1967 (Cmnd. 3235),
outlines the current phase of the policy. It provides for more flexible arrange¬
ments for the regulation of prices and incomes by the re-application of the
criteria set out in the White Paper of April 1965 (Cmnd. 2639) (see p. 247)
together with the application of certain additional considerations, it also
provides for the continuation of the early warning system. The Government’s
powers to require advance notification of proposed increases in prices or
incomes under Part II of the 1966 Act were strengthened under the Prices
and Incomes Act 1967 which extended the maximum period of a stand-still
from three to six months from the date of a reference to the NBPI. The new
Act also gave the Government power to secure the suspension of an increase
either where it was made without early warning or before the Board had
reported.
The aim of regional economic planning is to secure a full and balanced
development of the country’s resources and to help achieve a faster and
steadier expansion in national output.
A system of regional councils and boards established in Great Britain in
1965 provides the basic machinery for regional economic planning. The
regional economic planning councils consist of about 25 part-time members
widely representative of experience in each area. The councils are advisory
bodies with no executive powers; they assist in the development of planning
in their regions and advise on the implementation of regional policy and the
implications for the regions of national policies. The regional economic
planning boards consist of civil servants representing the main government
departments concerned with aspects of regional planning in their respective
areas. Their functions are, in co-operation with the planning councils, to
help formulate plans for the region and to co-ordinate the economic planning
work of the government departments.
For purposes of regional planning, Scotland and Wales each form a single
region, and England has been divided into eight regions—Northern, Yorkshire
and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South-East, South-West, West
Midlands, and North-West (see map on p. 18).
Detailed studies of the regions are being made (in some cases studies
or development programmes for all or part of a region had been published or
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
249
commenced before the councils were appointed). Studies prepared by
economic planning councils of the Northern, Yorkshire and Humberside,
East Midlands, and the South-West regions have already been published and
the W est Midlands Council has published a report on the future of its region,
based on a previous study. A development plan for Scotland up to 1970 was
published in 1966 and one for Wales in 1967.
Northern Ireland The Northern Ireland Government has set up an economic council, comprising
representatives of both sides of industry and other interests, to examine
means of furthering the economic development of Northern Ireland. Since
Northern Ireland government departments have responsibilities for planning
in Northern Ireland, it was not necessary to set up a special planning board.
A plan for Northern Ireland’s economic development up to 1970 was published
in 1965.
11 Industry
The Structure
of Industry
Manufacturing
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised, and today fourteen people work in mining, manufacturing and
building for every one engaged in agriculture. It is the world’s third largest
exporter of manufactured goods, and the range of its industrial manufactures
reflects its position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary
from the many small workshops to vast organisations such as the National
Coal Board, a public corporation with about 450,000 employees; Imperial
Chemical Industries Ltd., a limited liability company which, with its sub¬
sidiaries, employs some 126,000 persons in the United Kingdom; and the
Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., with about 50,000 employees.
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes made by the Atomic Energy
Authority, locomotives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of the
Railways Board, and military equipment and supplies made in establishments
of the defence services. Staff of the Stationery Office do some printing and
bookbinding, while the repair, and to a limited extent the construction, of
post office equipment is carried on in factories run by the Post Office. Certain
factories giving employment to the severely disabled are operated by Remploy
Ltd., a non-profit-making public company financed on the Vote of the
Ministry of Labour, which appoints the directors (see p. 432). The Govern¬
ment holds 51 per cent of the equity of a major oil company, British Petroleum
Limited, and has a controlling interest in a few other companies.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more
than 10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour; the results
of the most recent of these surveys show that nearly a third of all employees
in such establishments are in those employing from 100 to 499 persons, while
slightly over a third are in establishments employing 1,000 or more persons.
A high proportion of the biggest establishments are in the heavy industries,
while the average size of establishments in industries making consumer goods
is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with
results obtained in earlier surveys suggest a slow but significant trend towards
an increase in the average size of manufacturing establishments.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of
manufacturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establish¬
ments, not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities.
The most recent analysis of manufacturing enterprises by size (employment)
is provided by the Report of the Census of Production for 1958. An enter¬
prise, as defined in the Census, normally consists of either a single firm or a
holding company together with its subsidiaries. Just over half of all employ¬
ment in British manufacturing industries in 1958 was accounted for by about
950 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest

Practices

70 or so accounting roughly for a quarter. A further indication of the size
of companies is the value of the capital employed (net assets). For the largest,
the Imperial Chemical Industries group, the figure exceeds £1,000 million;
about 50 companies registered in Britain have over £100 million net assets.
In some industries a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil refining,
non-ferrous metal smelting, the manufacture of motor vehicles and com¬
ponents, aircraft and aero-engines, heavy electrical equipment, bicycles,
tobacco, cement, and basic chemicals. Shares in these companies are usually
distributed among a great number of holders and it is rare for a few large
holders to have a controlling interest. For example, five of the largest public
companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders. With intensified
competition in the economy and in many branches of industry the growing
dependence of profitable operation on concentration and an increasing scale
of production, the trend towards mergers and regroupings has been particu¬
larly marked in the 1960s. Larger units of control have been established in
almost all the leading industries, for example, motor vehicles, aircraft frames
and aero-engines, electrical engineering, machine tools, brewing, textiles,
newspaper and magazine publishing. The growth of large industrial holding
companies, controlling a wide range of subsidiary companies with a diversity
of industrial interests, which had earlier been one feature of the changing
pattern of organisation in industry, appears to have been halted.
A new departure is the setting up of the Industrial Reorganisation Corpora¬
tion by the Government in 1966 with resources of up to £150 million provided
by the Exchequer. It is empowered to participate in schemes for concen¬
tration, rationalisation and modernisation of industry, in particular the
merging and regrouping of firms into larger units to meet the changing
situation in the markets for many of the most important products.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 288-314.
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by
private contractors, although the Ministry of Public Building and Works is
the largest single employer of building labour while nearly 45 per cent of
the industry’s output is for public authorities.
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and
civil engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work,
many of which operate outside as well as inside the building industry.
Building is an industry of small firms; more than three-quarters of the firms
employ fewer than 20 employees. For a fuller account of the building and
civil engineering industries, see p. 286.
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain (see p. 269) is operated as a single
co-ordinated enterprise under National Coal Board direction (see p. 270).
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk,
limestone, salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private
enterprises, usually owned and operated by limited liability companies.
About 85,000 workers are employed, excluding coalmining.
Legislation exists for scrutinising and, if desirable, for the investigation by
an independent administrative body of monopoly situations and for the
judicial examination of restrictive trading agreements. The Government
intends to seek Parliamentary approval to strengthen and extend legislation
252
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on restrictive practices and to introduce a temporary exemption procedure
for agreements beneficial to the national economy.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 provides for the registration
and judicial examination of restrictive agreements. It requires the entry in a
public register of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements
(including those relating to common prices, approved lists of dealers and the
limitation of production) which affect the supply or processing of goods for
the United Kingdom market. The Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agree¬
ments is responsible for keeping the register and for bringing the agreements
before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under the Act. The Court, which
includes laymen but is presided over by one of Her Majesty’s judges, is, in
effect, responsible for deciding whether or not an agreement is in the public
interest. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the Court that any
restriction in their agreement produces one or more of seven beneficial
effects set out in the Act, and that the restriction is not unreasonable, having
regard to the balance between the benefit it confers and any public detriment
likely to result from its operation, that restriction must be found contrary to
the public interest. Agreements are void in respect of restrictions so found.
The Court can make orders preventing the parties from operating their
agreement, or from making new arrangements having the same effect. Agree¬
ments relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this procedure but
have to be notified to the Board of Trade. The first full hearing before the
Court took place in October 1958.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements (except those within the scope of
the Restrictive Practices Court) in the circumstances indicated in the
Monopolies and Mergers Acts 1948 and 1965 may be referred by the Board
of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investigation and report. The
Board of Trade, in co-operation with the production departments (see p. 260)
concerned, take appropriate action on the reports but no Order can be made
without the approval of Parliament.
The 1965 Act strengthened and extended the legislation on monopolies.
It reorganised and enlarged the Monopolies Commission; provided for the
investigation, at the reference of the Board of Trade, of services and of
proposed or recently completed mergers; made special provision for news¬
paper mergers; and improved and extended the Government’s powers for
taking action on the basis of the Monopolies Commission reports including
new powers to prohibit mergers and break up undesirable monopolies and
mergers. The Commission has to date presented 38 reports, of which five
dealt with mergers.
Under the 1956 Act collective enforcement of resale price maintenance
was prohibited, but individual suppliers remained free to enforce resale
prices in the courts. The Resale Prices Act 1964 makes minimum resale price
maintenance unlawful, except in respect of classes of registered goods for
which temporary exemption has been sought under the provisions of the Act.
Where resale price maintenance is prohibited, it is also unlawful to notify
to dealers prices stated or calculated to be understood as the minimum price
which may be charged on the resale of goods in the United Kingdom, or to
seek to maintain such prices by withholding supplies. Suppliers may continue
to practise resale price maintenance on registered goods, pending a decision by
the Restrictive Practices Court as to whether a case for exemption has been
made out against the criteria in the Act. Periodically, the Registrar of Restrictive
Trading Agreements issues lists of classes of goods in respect of which the Court
has refused to make an Order exempting them from the terms of the Act.
INDUSTRY
253
Role of Public
Enterprise
Direct State participation in productive and commercial activities is effected
mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular
activity. Such bodies, though not part of a government department, are under
a considerable but varying degree of public control (see below). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate
major industries and services in the public interest. Altogether ten per cent
of the labour force works for these bodies.
The public corporation today is, generally speaking, a public body having
a clearly defined and specific task. Its managing board and its staff are chosen
for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are not civil
servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring
departments who are responsible for the management of the corporations.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer
grants to help them carry out duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations had been
established in those industries and services where it was considered that the
national interest required co-ordination or control by a public authority.
Their constitutions had no standard pattern and their governing bodies
differed in the method of appointment and in composition. Immediately
after the second world war, the nationalisation Acts set up public corporations
to run certain major industries and services, including coalmining, inland
transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply, and civil air transport.
These post-war corporations are less varied in the structure of their governing
bodies, which are appointed by the responsible minister.
The following corporations are now operating or controlling large-scale
industries or services:
Atomic Energy: The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
Aviation: The British Overseas Airways Corporation, British European
Airways, the British Airports Authority.
Banking: The Bank of England.
Broadcasting: The British Broadcasting Corporation, the Independent
Television Authority.
Coal: The National Coal Board.
Electric Power: The Electricity Council, the Central Electricity Generating
Board, the Area Electricity Boards, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric
Board, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, the Electricity Board for
Northern Ireland.
Gas: The Gas Council, the Area Gas Boards.
Steel: The British Steel Corporation.
Transport: The British Railways Board, the British Transport Docks Board,
the British Waterways Board, the London Transport Board, the Transport
Holding Company, the Ulster Transport Authority.
The Post Office is to become a public corporation in 1969 (see p. 367).
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members
of each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to
254
BRITAIN.' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Industrial
Association
how the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day manage¬
ment. It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister
any information, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In
practice, as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy
decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion
for him to issue a formal directive.
The Minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings taking one year with another. The
responsible minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to
say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which may accrue. As
regards finance of capital expenditure, the present system is that such finance
as cannot be met from internal sources is mainly provided, in the form of
interest-earning loans, by the minister from the Exchequer, bank advances
being used only for normal requirements of short-term capital.
The minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to
see that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually
done by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider
complaints and suggestions made to them, and to advise the board or the
minister on the changes they think desirable.
In a White Paper (Cmnd. 1337) issued in April 1961 the Government out¬
lined certain general principles which it believed had to be applied for the
administration of the nationalised industries to be efficient. Among them were
a balancing of revenue accounts over a five-year period, a closer definition of
the financial and economic obligations of the industries, and greater freedom
in price policies. In accordance with these principles, financial objectives have
been introduced for the nationalised fuel and power industries and for BEA,
the Post Office and the London Transport Board.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are
admissible only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration.
A House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries,
which examines the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries and
reports to Parliament, has been in operation since 1957.
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings
have increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different
purposes. Some of the more important of these are classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with the Government, and representation of their members’ point of
view.
2. The regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation of
prices (see pp. 251-2).
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying
completeness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of industry
where there are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices.
Employers’ organisations which deal with labour matters usually consist of
firms engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing process. Trade
associations mainly concerned with representations to the Government,
INDUSTRY

255
provision of common services or the regulation of trading practices are built
up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector
concerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may
undertake all the required functions.
There are about 80 national federations and probably altogether about
1,500 employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or
branches of the national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages
and conditions of work. The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely, but according to a
survey carried out between 1953 and 1956 by Political and Economic Planning
(an independent research organisation) some 1,300 were in existence, varying
greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI). It is recognised by the Government as a
channel for consultation between government departments and representa¬
tives of private employers as a whole. For its members it acts as an advisory
and consultative body providing them with information and statistics, ascer¬
taining their collective views and representing them nationally to the
Government and the public and also internationally, for example in the
Council of European Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on a
number of government advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and
on voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of some 13,000 companies and over 200
trade associations and employers’ federations. The nationalised industries have
joined as industrial associates. The CBI has a regional organisation in the
United Kingdom and is widely represented abroad.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and traders
and exist to promote the interests of local industry and commerce. The
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, founded in i860, is the central
organisation to which 101 local chambers of commerce (together with 22
British Chambers of Commerce operating in foreign countries) are affiliated.
In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the Council of Scottish
Chambers of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland, the Association of Northern
Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The main areas of industrial concentration in Britain are the London area,
north-east England, Yorkshire and Humberside, north-west England, the
Midlands, Severnside, South Wales, central Scotland, and Belfast in
Northern Ireland. All but two (London and Severnside) are the areas
associated with the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century, and all
but two (London and Belfast) are on or near major coalfields, then the
principal source of power. During the second quarter of the twentieth century
there was a tendency for the newer industries, such as those manufacturing
motor vehicles, electrical goods and rubber products, to develop rapidly in
the south (especially in and around Greater London) and in the Midlands.
In the last twenty years the older industrial areas which specialised in the
great staple industries—coalmining, steel, shipbuilding, heavy engineering
and textiles—and which remain for the most part of considerable importance,
have also acquired a much wider and more diversified industrial base, in part
the result of Government action and encouragement. Electronic products,
instruments, industrial components, clothing, man-made fibres and the
newer chemicals are examples of industries located throughout Britain.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The following is a summary of the geographical distribution of British
industry today, grouped by the areas covered by the regional economic
planning machinery (see p. 248).
London, situated at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary,
is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s
most important financial centre, one of the world’s three largest cities (with
Tokyo and New York) and one of the world’s three largest ports (with New
York and Rotterdam).
Greater London (see p. 71), including the urbanised fringe areas within
50 miles of Charing Cross, has a working population of over six million, of
whom over a third are in manufacturing industry. London is the main centre
in Britain of the clothing and food and drink industries, of printing, of
cinema film production, and of the manufacture of furniture, materials for
the arts, precision instruments and many other specialised products. Small
firms predominate in many of these industries and the average size of
manufacturing firms (particularly in inner London) is well below the national
average. London is also, especially its outer ring, an important area for light
engineering, chemicals and consumer goods and has some heavy engineering
plants and a number of leading research establishments.
Towards the periphery of the London conurbation and in the new urban
development outside it, industry, particularly the electronics and a variety of
consumer goods industries, has been expanding rapidly; some of the largest
aircraft plants are in these areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as
well as the factories, at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable, of two of the five
main motor vehicle manufacturers. There are other major motor vehicle
manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford (population 109,000), some 50 miles
north-west of London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there
are large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering works and
major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
The Channel coast has been much developed for tourist traffic and as a
place for retirement. A great part of the coast eastwards from Poole
(population 95,600) and Bournemouth (151,000) consists of built-up areas,
which from Brighton (163,000) eastwards are partly dormitories for people
working in London. Portsmouth (216,000) is a naval port and has some ship¬
building and general manufactures. Southampton (209,000) is the largest
port in Britain for ocean-going liners and its industries include ship repairing,
oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover, Folkestone
and Newhaven are packet ports.
Devon and Cornwall have a considerable tourist trade and some popular
retirement areas. Bristol, the largest city of the south-west (429,000) is a
leading port and commercial centre with aircraft, aero-engines, tobacco, food
processing, paper, printing and other industries and nearby, at Avonmouth,
are important non-ferrous metal and basic chemicals plants. Gloucester
(72,000), originally an inland port and commercial town, Cheltenham
(75,000), originally a resort town, and the area between and adjacent to them
produce a variety of manufactures, including machinery, instruments and
accessories and the well-known West of England cloth. Swindon (98,000),
besides its railway workshops, has important engineering works. Bath
(83,000), originally a resort town and the centre of an agricultural district,
has become noted for engineering and other manufacturing.
Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern
counties possess some sizeable towns. Cambridge (100,000) is a leading

centre of research-based industry; Ipswich (121,000) and Peterborough
(65,000) are noted for agricultural machinery and implements; and Norwich
(119,000) for footwear and food manufacture. Also at Norwich and the port
of King’s Lynn (28,000) chemicals are becoming important. Food canning
and freezing, based mainly on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly.
The fishing ports of Great Yarmouth (53,000) and Lowestoft (48,000) have
extensive fish processing plants, and are also becoming important bases for
companies engaged in the natural gas discoveries in the North Sea.
The main industrial area—the West Midlands conurbation—stretches from
Birmingham (1,103,000) through the Black Country to Wolverhampton
(267,000) and includes portions of Staffordshire, Worcestershire and
Warwickshire. It has an unusually wide variety of industry, including notably
the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all kinds
and also jewellery, rubber products, chemicals and domestic metalware. The
largest concentrations of motor vehicle manufacture, including components
and accessories, in the United Kingdom are situated in the Midlands, at
Coventry (332,000) and Birmingham.
The smaller conurbation of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent
(276.500) , is devoted chiefly to the manufacture of pottery and china and to
coalmining, although other industries are growing in importance, while
Stafford (50,500) has heavy electrical and other engineering works.
Other industrial centres are Rugby (55,500), electrical engineering;
Worcester (68,000), machinery; Burton-on-Trent (50,500), brewing and
rubber; and Kidderminster (44,000), carpets.
The thriving industrial cities and towns of the East Midlands include Leicester
(284,000) noted for hosiery and knitwear, boots and shoes and machinery for
making these products; Derby (129,000) for general engineering, aero-engines
and man-made fibres; Nottingham (310,000) for hosiery, cycles and a variety
of other engineering products, lace, pharmaceutical products, tobacco;
Northampton (121,500) footwear, engineering; Chesterfield (70,000) engineer¬
ing. Corby (45,000), a new town in Northamptonshire, has a steel industry
originally based on local deposits of iron ore, and at Peterborough (64,000)
there are several large engineering works. The richest and most highly
mechanised coalfield in Britain lies in the north-east of the area and continues
into Yorkshire. Some of the towns on the coalfield, such as Mansfield
(55,000), have important manufacturing industries, particularly textiles.
Manchester (625,000) is the commercial hub of the cotton and man-made
fibre textile industries, a very important financial and commercial centre and
a major port. It is also one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy
engineering and the production of machine tools, petro-chemicals, dyestuffs,
and pharmaceutical goods, while it has a wide range of other manufactures.
In the traditional cotton-manufacturing towns man-made fibres are also
processed alone or blended with cotton; the largest of these are Bolton
(158,000), Oldham (111,500), Rochdale (86,500), Stockport (142,000), Burnley
(78.500) , Blackburn (103,000), Preston (109,000) and Bury (62,500). In the
majority of these towns engineering industries, notably the manufacture of
printing, paper making, textile and electrical machinery and heavy commercial
vehicles (especially in the Chorley-Leyland area), have been increasing while
the cotton industry has been declining. The Lancashire coalfield also lies in
the Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas
trade, links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through the important

industrial town of Warrington (74,500) with its metal industries (such as
wire-drawing), Widnes (54,000) and Runcorn (27,500) with their chemicals,
and Ellesmere Port (49,500) with its oil refinery installations, before reaching
the Mersey estuary. St. Helens (104,500), to the north of the canal, is famous
for glass manufacture. Liverpool (712,000) is the second port of Britain, a
great commercial and insurance centre and, after London, the greatest centre
for processing imported foodstuffs and raw materials, being noted especially
for flour milling, soap manufacture, sugar refining and rubber products. Among
its older industries is ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across
the river at Birkenhead (143,500). Many new industries, including electrical
engineering, the manufacture of heavy industrial equipment and, more
recently, motor vehicle manufacture, have been established around Liverpool.
Salt, extracted in Cheshire, is used by chemical works on Merseyside.
Barrow (64,500), in the north-west of Lancashire, is well-known for ship¬
building and marine engineering. Blackpool (150,500) on the Lancashire coast
is Britain’s most popular holiday resort.
About three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s worsted and woollen indus¬
tries are found in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Bradford (297,000) is the
commercial centre of the wool trade and important for worsted; Wakefield
(60,000) produces both worsted and woollens; Morley (43,000) and Leeds
(508,000) have specialised in cheaper cloths, and Batley (48,500), Dewsbury
(53,000) and Spenborough (38,000) in heavy cloth, but their production is
becoming more diversified. Huddersfield (132,000) has a reputation for fine
woollens and worsteds and Halifax (95,000) for carpets. In most of the larger
centres of the wool industry a variety of engineering products are manu¬
factured. Leeds, the commercial capital of the area, has a large ready-made
clothing industry and important engineering plants. Farther south is the
heavy engineering centre of Sheffield (486,000), famous for its high quality
steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s extensive coalfields provide nearly a
quarter of Britain’s coal; Doncaster (86,500), also with tractor and nylon
manufacturing, and Barnsley (75,500) are the largest towns on the coalfield.
York (106,000) is noted for chocolates and confectionery manufacture and
has important railway workshops, and Hull (298,000), one of the world’s
largest fishing ports and with many manufacturing industries, including
engineering, vegetable oil processing, paints and sawmilling, is the most
important industrial town in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
On the south (Lincolnshire) side of the Humber lie Scunthorpe (70,000),
another important steel-making centre, and the major fishing port of Grimsby
(95,000) which has a food processing industry and also a growing chemicals
industry close by at Immingham.
The greater part of this region (Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire) is an area of mountains, lakes and
moors and is relatively thinly populated. Most of its population of 3-3 million
is concentrated in the coastal strip about 20 miles deep and 45 miles long,
from the coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees. Within this area the main
centres are Tyneside, including Newcastle upon Tyne (254,000), Gateshead
(101,500), Tynemouth (72,000), South Shields (108,500), Wallsend (49,000)
and Jarrow (26,500); and Tees-side, including Middlesbrough (157,000) and
West Hartlepool (78,500). Other large towns are Sunderland (188,500),
Darlington (84,500) and, in the west, Carlisle (71,000).
The whole region is more dependent than other parts of England on
traditional heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manufacture,

shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical plants
on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe), which
together employ nearly a third of the male workers. This proportion has
been falling steadily as the result of the establishment of industrial estates
and other government measures to attract new types of enterprise and promote
the diversification of industry. It is one of the most important areas for the
manufacture of electrical plant, and the many other industries include mining
machinery, rolling mill plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes,
paint, glass, clothing and scientific instruments. Atomic energy is important
in Cumberland with its two nuclear power stations.
Nearly two-thirds of the population of Wales and Monmouthshire (2-7
million) live in the two counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. In this
area are the coal mines which, though long worked and operating at increasing
depths, still produce nearly all Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and
other specialised coals, and still employ more workers than any branch of
manufacturing industry. Rhondda (98,500) and Merthyr Tydfil (58,000) are
the largest centres in the coalmining area. The steel industry, with some of the
most modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tin plate
and a large proportion of its sheet steel. In the past 30 years many new
industries have been established, often located on government industrial
estates; they include plastics, synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics, motor
vehicle components and light engineering.
The main urban centres are also the three major ports—Cardiff (260,000),
Newport (106,500) and Swansea (171,000). Milford Haven (13,000), a magni¬
ficent deep-water harbour recently developed, has two major oil refineries.
In North Wales a number of light industries, notably man-made fibres,
are located in the seaside resorts and some other towns, particularly
Wrexham (37,000), and there is a large steelworks in Flintshire.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population (5-2 million) is concentrated in
the central Lowlands, a belt some 65 miles wide and 15 to 30 miles deep
between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this
area are Glasgow (980,000) and Edinburgh (469,000). Clydeside, which
includes the city of Glasgow, is the United Kingdom’s largest shipbuilding
and marine engineering centre; it also has a great variety of general engineering
enterprises and other industries. The steel industry, sited mainly in north
Lanarkshire, produces a wide range of products. The widely dispersed
electronics equipment industry is represented by a growing number of firms
in such centres as Glasgow, north Lanarkshire, Dundee and central Fife, as
well as in Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are expanding
alongside the long-established engineering, printing and brewing industries.
Motor car manufacture has been established in Renfrewshire and in West
Lothian there has been a major expansion of commercial vehicle building.
Outside the central Lowland belt there is considerable industrial concen¬
tration in the vicinity of Dundee (185,000) and in Aberdeen (184,500) and
a number of towns outside these areas have been attracting light industries in
recent years. Dundee’s traditional manufacture, jute, has been supplemented
in the last two decades by office machinery, clocks and watches, refrigerators
and electronic products. In north-east Scotland is the largest concentration of
whisky distilleries.
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern Scotland
is hilly and rugged. These regions are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 277).

Northern Ireland
Relations
between the
Government
and Industry
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries both in the valley
towns of the southern uplands and in the Highlands and Islands.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small and it lacks minerals,
there is substantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around
the capital city of Belfast (403,000). The largest single shipyard in the United
Kingdom is sited in Belfast and other long-established activities include the
manufacture of marine engines, ropes, twine, tobacco and clothing. Northern
Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles—it is particularly
well known for linen. The textile industry is now extensively diversified;
Northern Ireland is one of the most important areas in Europe for man-made
fibre production and provides about one-fifth of Britain’s output. There has
also been extensive development in automobile components, oil-well
equipment, electronic instruments, telephone switchgear, toys, shoes, carpets
and synthetic rubber.
The Government can influence industrial activity in a number of ways—
through fiscal and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure,
through the policies of publicly owned enterprises, by physical controls, by
inducements, by exhortation and by the provision of services, information and
advice. Apart from labour legislation (see Chapter 16) and certain export and
import controls over a small range of products (see Chapter 15), there are few
physical controls over industry—the main ones are the use of the legislation
concerning monopolies and restrictive practices already described (see
p. 251) and the operation of powers to control new industrial and office
building and changes in land use. The latter are particularly relevant to the
improvement of the geographical distribution of industry (see p. 264).
There is a close and growing association between industry and the
Government through such channels as the National Economic Development
Council and the 22 Economic Development Committees for individual
industries (see p. 262) where views on matters of importance to the economy,
including productivity (see p. 261) can be made known and discussed.
Within the Government, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has
general responsibility for co-ordinating work on economic planning, growth
of the economy, regional development and policies affecting industrial
efficiency, and prices and incomes. The department through which the
Government’s day-to-day relations with trade and industry are chiefly
conducted is the Board of Trade (which has regional offices in the principal
industrial centres) and its responsibilities cover a wide range of industries
and materials. Other departments concerned with particular subjects of
concern to industry generally are the Treasury, which is responsible for fiscal
and monetary policy; the Ministry of Labour, the channel through which man¬
power policy is conducted; and the Department of Education and Science,
which is responsible for the promotion of education and for civil science,
operating in the main through the research councils.
For particular industries a system has grown up whereby a particular
government department acts as the main point of contact, the ‘production or
sponsor department’, for each major industry. The Ministry of Technology,
which was set up in 1964, is concerned with the application of advanced tech¬
nology and new processes in industry. It is, therefore, the sponsor department
for the mechanical and electrical engineering industries and for those manu¬
facturing electronic equipment, computers, machine tools, telecommunications
equipment, aircraft and aero-engines. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food is the appropriate department for food processing, the Ministry of

1 here are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for
matters within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The
Ministry of Commerce deals with industry, especially the encouragement of
industrial development.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office,
provides a comprehensive statistical service. Although departments them¬
selves compile statistics relating to their particular responsibilities, and may
publish them in their own standard publications, the comprehensive statistical
publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office. (For the principal
regular series of statistics published, see Bibliography p. 505.)
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,
and gas, electricity and water) was in the first half of 1967 some 2 per cent
lower than a year previously, about 34 per cent more than in 1958 and
about double the pre-war level. The course of production and employment
from i960 to 1966 is shown in Table 15.

Between 1958 and 1966 output in the chemicals and allied industries rose
by 65 per cent; in engineering and electrical goods by 52 per cent; in metal
manufacture by 25 per cent; in vehicles (including aircraft) by 29 per cent;
in paper, printing and publishing by 44 per cent; and in clothing and footwear
by 27 per cent (see diagram p. 262).
The increases in production in recent years have been due only to a small
degree to an increase in the labour force but mainly to a variety of factors
influencing productivity, including technical advances in products, machinery
and processes; the rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive competition
and sales promotion; and improved management of particular undertakings.
Gross fixed capital formation at home has been well maintained. In 1966
it amounted to 21 per cent of the gross domestic product and was estimated
to be over 60 per cent greater than in 1958. Part of this rising investment is
linked with the introduction of new techniques and equipment and in
particular of machines and instruments which lessen the demand for human
skill and supervision though they may require more skill from fewer people.
All of this is part of the process known as automation, which is giving rise to
far-reaching changes in the pattern of industry and in the internal organisa¬
tion and labour requirements of business enterprises and has already been

sists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional kind.
Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity thus depend
most directly on the decisions of individual undertakings. While the promo¬
tion of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry, govern¬
ment departments and educational and research establishments also have an
important contribution to make. Government budgeting and financial policies
also have a strong influence on the extent and direction of demand. These,
therefore, are framed to a large degree on a realistic assessment of the
possibilities of sustained economic growth.
Leading industrialists have been recruited as advisers in the Department
of Economic Affairs to help overcome specific obstacles to efficiency and
industrial expansion. They work principally through the Economic Develop¬
ment Committees (EDCs), which are offshoots of the National Economic
Development Council. The Committees cover particular sectors of industry
and bring together managements, union and government representatives.
Employers’ associations and trade unions are engaged in activities to raise
industrial productivity. Employers’ organisations often provide technical
assistance, conduct market surveys, and support schemes of vocational
education and training. The trade unions in many industries organise special
schemes for training young people, and also a variety of courses designed to
give trade unionists an understanding of modern management techniques.
Private consultants specialising in management and work study are available
to give advice to firms on measures to increase their productive efficiency;
there are also many specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned
with various aspects of productivity.
The British Productivity Council (BPC) was established by both sides of
industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity. It was set
up in 1952 to continue and develop the work of the Anglo-American Pro¬
ductivity Council. It is an independent body on which are represented the
Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, and the nationalised industries;
its work is financed by contributions from these bodies and by a government
INDUSTRY
263
grant-in-aid. Advisory committees have been set up to promote productivity
in the building trades, in agriculture and in retailing. Much of the BPC’s
work is done through 130 local productivity committees and associations
throughout the country, but it is also responsible for special countrywide
campaigns such as the Quality and Reliability Year in 1967. The local
organisations arrange meetings, inter-factory visits, courses, conferences, film
shows and exhibitions.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods
and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufac¬
turers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the
specification of requirements, thus promoting industrial efficiency. The BSI
is governed by a council consisting of representatives of the main organisa¬
tions of employers and workers, professional institutions and the larger
government departments.
The DEA is responsible for co-ordinating activities related to the promo¬
tion of productivity. The Board of Trade administers the government grants
to the BPC and the Council of Industrial Design. The Ministry of Technology
is charged with the function of extending the introduction of automatic control
systems and advanced techniques into industry, sponsors the BSI and
provides technical advisory services. It is also concerned directly wdth
research into such factors as productivity measurement techniques, produc¬
tion engineering and fatigue among operators.
A number of other departments have responsibilities which bear on pro¬
ductivity. The Ministry of Labour has a general responsibility for the
promotion of industrial training. The Ministry’s Industrial Relations Service
advises firms on personnel management and industrial relations. The
Department of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department
are responsible for the technical colleges, at which courses are available in
such subjects as work study and industrial engineering. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works provides a Technical Information Service for the
building industry; and the Ministry of Power and the British Productivity
Council sponsor the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides a number of advisory services
to the farming industry in England and Wales; similar services are provided
by the three Scottish agricultural colleges. In Northern Ireland these services
are provided by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Management During the present century and particularly during and since the second
world war, the increasing pace of technical, organisational and social change
has made the successful conduct of enterprises dependent on knowledge of,
and practice in, a complex of managerial techniques for dealing with technical
and human problems. In Britain, as elsewhere, there is a growing awareness
of the importance of management as a subject requiring special skills and
knowledge. This has been reflected both in a change in the general educational
qualifications of recruits to management and in the spread of systematic
education and training for management.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national
management body, independent, non-political and non-profit-making. Its
purpose is to study and promote scientific management, including manage¬
ment education and training, throughout industry, commerce, and public
administration. It has nearly 5,000 member companies and over 14,000
264
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
individual members. Management studies and education for management are
expanding rapidly in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher
education (see p. 167). Graduate Business Schools have been established in
London and Manchester.
Training courses for higher management are held at a few universities,
notably Bristol; by some firms of management consultants; and at the
Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames, and Ashridge College of
Management, Berkhamsted. The larger firms, especially those with wide-
ranging responsibilities, often provide general management courses for the
training of senior executives, and systems of informal training within an
organisation are numerous. There are also various bodies concerned with
specialised branches of management, for example, the Institute of Personnel
Management, the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute of Office
Management and the Institute of Marketing.
The growing number of professional personnel working as management
consultants—now over 2,000—and the use of the services of independent
management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff are indications
of the interest in the science of management in Britain.
Encouragement
of Expansion
in Productive
Industry
Under the Industrial Development Act 1966 cash grants were introduced in
place of certain tax allowances for capital expenditure on plant or machinery
used in the manufacturing, extractive and construction industries. The grant
scheme, which is administered by the Board of Trade, also covers capital
expenditure on computers, ships, hovercraft and mining works. The standard
rate of grant for these is 20 per cent (25 per cent in 1967 and 1968). In order
to maintain a greater incentive to investment in development areas (see
below) the rate of grant was fixed at 40 per cent (45 per cent in 1967 and 1968).
In contrast with the plant and machinery grants previously available in the
development districts, these new investment grants are not dependent on the
provision of additional employment.
Government
Help for
Industry in
Development
Areas
Some parts of Britain have long been less prosperous than others. Their rate
of economic expansion has been below average and their level of unemploy¬
ment above average as a result of the decline of old-fashioned industries or
the lack of job opportunities. For many years unemployment has remained a
persistent problem in Scotland, Wales and the north and some other parts of
England. This regional imbalance has been aggravated by the tendency for
new industries to concentrate in the Midlands and the south-east where, as a
result, the demand for labour is high and there are increasing problems of
congestion. An important aim of the Government’s regional policy is to
achieve a better distribution of industrial development between the different
parts of the country. The Government has in recent years taken important
measures aimed at securing balanced economic development.
Government aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and
has been developed in various ways since the end of the second world war.
In August 1966 the Board of Trade designated large parts of Britain as
‘development areas’ where industrial development is to be encouraged. These
areas have now replaced the previous smaller development districts. They
cover northern England, Merseyside and nearly the whole of Scotland, Wales,
Cornwall and north Devon. They contain a fifth of Britain’s working popula¬
tion, and, in their reserves of manpower, have the potential for steady
economic growth. The Board of Trade provides businessmen with detailed
information on industrial location within the development areas and offers
INDUSTRY
Northern Ireland
265
a wide variety of inducements to new or expanding businesses in these
areas.
Besides the investment grants on plant and machinery there is a wide range
of financial and other inducements available under the Local Employment
Acts i960 and 1963 to encourage industry to expand in the development
areas. The Board of Trade may build factories for leasing at favourable rents
or sale on deferred terms; make building grants of 25 per cent (and 35 per
cent in special cases) of the cost of an industrialist’s own factory; make grants
towards unusual expenditure incurred as a result of siting a project in a
development area; and make loans for the general purposes of an undertaking
(for example, working capital, plant and machinery, etc.). Factory building
and estate management are undertaken on the Board of Trade’s behalf by the
English, Scottish and Welsh Industrial Estates Corporations; premises
administered by the three Corporations total approximately 58 million
square feet and give employment to some 250,000 people.
Assistance from other government departments includes grants to local
authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites and for improving basic
services; and help from the Ministry of Labour with the cost of training
additional labour in development areas and of transferring workers in
connection with establishing new enterprises.
brom September 1967 manufacturing employers in development areas will
be entitled to an additional ‘regional employment premium’ for every employee
in respect of whom they can claim selective employment premium (see p. 380)
at the rate of 30s. a week for full-time male adult employees (with lower rates
for women, part-time workers, boys and girls).
Since 1948 control of new industrial building has been exercised through
the use of a system of Industrial Development Certificates. The control is
operated through the normal local planning machinery of the Town and
Country Planning Acts. Any application for planning permission for indus¬
trial development involving more than 5,000 square feet (or 3,000 square feet
in the Midlands and south-east) must be accompanied by a certificate from
the Board of Trade certifying that the development in question can be carried
out consistently with the proper distribution of industry. In considering
applications for certificates the Board of Trade is required to have particular
regard to the need for providing appropriate employment in the development
areas. In practice this obligation has led the Board of Trade normally to
refuse certificates for projects outside the development areas unless they are
satisfied that the project could not reasonably be undertaken in a development
area or in Northern Ireland. Subject to this priority, the control is also used
to encourage dispersal of industry to new or expanded towns taking population
from the more congested areas.
Under the Control of Office and Industrial Development Act 1965 the
Board of Trade also controls office developments of over 10,000 square
feet in the Midlands, the south-east and East Anglia and over 3,000 square
feet in the Metropolitan area.
Under its own legislation Northern Ireland provides for the payment of
investment grants at 40 per cent of the cost both of new plant and machinery
and of new buildings for the manufacturing, construction and extractive
industries in Northern Ireland. (For expenditure incurred in 1967 and 1968
the rate of grant is 45 per cent.) There is also provision for assisting firms by
means of loans to carry out major schemes of re-equipment, to move to
another area in particular need of industrial development or to undertake a

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Councils to

rehousing of their business in association with a major scheme of modernisa¬
tion and reorganisation.
As an alternative means of assistance the Northern Ireland Government
continues to use its comprehensive and flexible powers authorised under the
Industries Development Acts for projects which offer a reasonable amount of
employment. In such cases capital assistance of 45 per cent would normally
be available instead of the 40 per cent referred to above. (For expenditure
incurred in 1967 or 1968 the rate is 50 per cent.) For those projects which
offer exceptionally attractive returns in employment or are to be located in
areas in urgent need of development, grants towards operating costs could
also be made available in the initial stages of development. In suitable cases
loans can be made towards capital expenditure on plant, machinery and
buildings and grants may also be made towards such things as the cost of the
removal, including installation, of plant and machinery from an existing factory
to Northern Ireland.
Since 1945, 226 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland and
188 schemes of expansion carried out with government assistance, develop¬
ments which at present are employing over 62,000 persons. The Ministry
of Commerce is the Northern Ireland government department concerned with
the administration of this assistance. The Northern Ireland Economic Council
was set up in 1965 to assist in furthering economic growth. The chairman is
the Minister of Commerce and the membership includes representatives of
industry, commerce and the trade unions.
Certain regions and areas in England have industrial development associa¬
tions concerned with promoting local industry. These associations are
sponsored mainly by local authorities, trade associations and individual firms.
Several voluntary associations are concerned with Welsh industry. The
Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959, is the most prominent.
In Scotland, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
statute in 1965, works to stimulate the economic and social development of
the seven ‘crofting’ counties (see p. 328) in the Highlands and the Islands.
It provides grants and loans to industrial and other enterprises; it may also
acquire land, provide management services and set up and carry on businesses.
The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), a voluntary association,
promotes the general economic development of Scotland.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. Much of this
work is done under the aegis of the Development Commission1 with finance
from the Development Fund, notably the provision of advice and guidance
to small businesses in rural areas and country towns. In England and Wales
this service is provided by the Rural Industries Bureau acting in consultation
with the Rural Community Councils; in Scotland by the Scottish Country
Industries Development Trust. Finance for small industries in England,
Wales and Scotland is provided by the Rural Industries Loan Fund, also
financed by the Development Commission. The Fund works in close liaison
with the Rural Industries Bureau and the Scottish Country Industries
Development Trust. Another service provided by the Commission in Wales
has been the financing of small factories to stimulate rural industries and to
combat rural depopulation.
1 The Development Commission approves and administers advances by grants or loans
from the Development Fund, established by the Development and Roads Improvements
Fund Acts 1909 and 1910. At the present time the Fund may be used to help and
expand agriculture and rural industries and also to promote the development and
improvement of fisheries.

Consumption
(in Terms of
Primary Sources)
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal,
petroleum and, to a small extent, water power, nuclear energy and natural
gas; secondary sources produced from these are electricity, gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies slightly more than half of primary
energy and it will remain the principal source for several years. For supplies
of crude petroleum Britain is virtually dependent on imports. Water power
resources are small. A large-scale programme for the construction of nuclear
power stations has been in progress for more than a decade, and nuclear power
is already significant in electricity supply. Most of the natural gas used is at
present imported in liquefied form, but the continuing discoveries of commer¬
cial quantities of natural gas under the North Sea open up an additional source
of energy.
The pattern of primary energy consumption has been changing considerably
in recent years. The proportion of total energy provided by coal has been
declining steadily in relation to oil, the latter’s share having risen from one-
fifth in 1958 to over one-quarter in 1961 and to over one-third in 1966.
Trends in consumption are shown in Table 16 and in the diagram on p. 269.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum, are under
public ownership. General responsibility for ensuring the effective and co¬
ordinated development of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister
of Power. He is assisted in the formulation of energy policy by an Energy-
Advisory Council. Fuel research is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using
industries. The Minister of Power also has an Advisory Council on Research
and Development.

In general, fuel and power industries require heavy capital investment in
long-term projects and both internal resources and borrowing are used to
raise the large sums needed. Until 1956 long-term borrowing by the corpora¬
tions was through the issue of stock, except in the case of the coal industry,
which borrowed direct from the Exchequer. Under the Finance Act 1956
and subsequent legislation, all state-owned corporations were given power to
raise money by means of Exchequer advances from the responsible minister
with the approval of the Treasury; since then, all the corporations have
done so, and no issues of stock have been made. Investment by the nationalised
fuel and power industries is estimated to amount to XI>°31 million in 1966-67
and is likely to reach £1,065 million in 1967-68.
The responsible ministers—the Minister of Power in England and Wales
and the Secretary of State in Scotland—are required by statute to set up
consultative councils for each of the nationalised fuel industries to ensure the

protection of the interests of consumers of fuel. Councils were established
for coal in i947> f°r electricity in 1948 and for gas in 1949; each consisting
of a chairman and from 20 to 30 unpaid members appointed from nominations
put forward by interested bodies selected by the ministers as representing
consumers. In the electricity and gas supply industries councils and commit¬
tees have been formed on an area and district basis; for coal there are councils
at national level only.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry

employing over a million workers. Economic depression in Britain and

mounting competition in overseas markets caused a decline during the
inter-war years (1919-39) and both inland consumption and exports fell
substantially, bringing a reduction in the number of pits in operation.
Measures were introduced to rationalise production in larger and more
efficient units. During the second world war the industry came under the
control of the government.
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
and eleven members appointed by the Minister of Power. The NCB has the
exclusive monopoly to extract coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to
license private operators to work small pits and open-cast sites. It has no
monopoly in distribution, and retail sales remain largely in private hands, but
it has, however, some retail depots and makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers.
The NCB is responsible for the day-to-day running and the commercial
management of the industry, but is answerable to the minister (and through
him, to Parliament) for its efficiency. The minister has power to issue
directives on matters affecting the public interest, and to authorise borrowings
to finance capital investment.
The 438 collieries in operation at the end of March 1967 were grouped into
34 areas, which are the basic units for commercial management. The areas
in turn are grouped into eight geographical zones which roughly correspond
to the main coal-bearing regions; in each zone, a senior resident executive of
the NCB was responsible for co-ordination and for certain common-user
services. Reorganisation, which started in March 1967, will eventually reduce
the number of areas to 17.
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly
4 million tons between 1947 and 1956; sales fell sharply, however, between 1956
and 1959 and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit heads. Growing
competition from oil, increasing efficiency in the use of coal and reduced
requirements of the gas, steel and other industries contributed to the fall in
demand. Since 1963 undistributed end-of-year stocks have been maintained
at about 18-20 million tons. The fall in consumption is shown in Table 17.
Nearly two-fifths of total output is consumed by the electricity authorities
and over one-quarter by domestic and industrial users together. Coke ovens
and the gas industry are other large users. Consumption by the electricity
industry has increased by one-quarter since 1961 to 68 million tons in 1966,
whereas the requirements of all the other main classes of consumer have
declined. In the case of domestic users this fall has been slightly offset by
increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.
Coal exports have fallen heavily since the second world war due mainly,
at first, to increased internal consumption and, later, to keener competition
and the switch to other types of fuel in the most important markets overseas.
Exports fell from the post-war peak of 19 million tons in 1949 to 2-9 million
tons, valued at ^19 million, in 1966. The principal markets are in Western
Europe and the Irish Republic.
It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for
about 200 years at current rates of consumption. However, the very fact that
INDUSTRY 0>,T
2/1
the British industry was developed so early has meant that many of the best
seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has to be mined from deeper
and thinner seams and productivity can be maintained only by a high level of
re-equipment and constant modernisation.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (i) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire field, which produces about 48 per cent of the total output,
(2) the Durham and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and
(4) the Scottish field. Other important coal-bearing areas are those of
Lancashire and the West Midlands (Staffordshire and Warwickshire).
The main trends in coal production and manpower since 1950 are shown
in Table 17.

According to forecasts by the Ministry of Power, the fall in coal consump¬
tion shown in Table 17 is likely to continue, but the Government is taking
measures to support consumption with the aim of holding the demand for
coal at around 155 million tons by 1970. The NCB plans to improve the
competitive position of coal by restricting production to the most efficient
pits. Between 1967 and 1969-70 almost one-third of the pits are scheduled
to be closed and the total labour force will fall by 18 per cent to about
333,000 workers. Productivity has risen by about one-third since 1961, and
three-quarters of output now comes from new or reconstructed collieries,
some with a daily output of 6,000 tons and a few of up to 8,000 tons; at
mechanised faces output averages 67 tons per shift as compared with 3-8
tons at non-mechanised faces, the average for all faces being over 5! tons.
In 1966, output per manshift at NCB mines rose to over i-8 tons, with
36,000 fewer workers. Among measures contributing to higher productivity
are new designs for loading and mechanical handling, improved layouts for
pit-bottoms and the extension of horizon mining. Experimental remotely
controlled longwall faces have proved successful at two Midlands collieries
and are being installed in others. The Bevercotes colliery in the East Midlands,
the first in the world to be planned as a fully mechanised and automated
pit from the coal face to the surface, was opened in 1967.

PETROLEUM
The National Coal Board raises capital, including working capital, by borrow¬
ing directly from the Exchequer. At present there is a statutory limit of
^750 million on such borrowing. Within its limit the Board may, with the
permission of the Minister of Power, borrow temporarily (by way of overdraft
or otherwise). The greater proportion of investment, however, is financed
from internal resources.
Capital expenditure by the industry totalled £462 million from 1947 to 1955
and about £790 million in the nine years 1956 to end-March 1964. At the end
of the 1964-65 financial year the total capital debt to the Exchequer amounted
to about £960 million. In 1965 a fresh study was made of the NCB’s capital
structure, and legislation was enacted to effect a capital reconstruction
involving the writing off of £415 million of the existing debt. As a result, the
total debt to the Exchequer at the end of March 1966 was reduced to £575
million.
Under the nationalisation statute, the NCB has been required to break even
on its current account (taking one year with another) after meeting all proper
charges including provision for reserves. It has made surpluses in some years
and deficits in others. In certain areas, such as Scotland, Lancashire and Wales,
deficits have been persistent, and profits from the areas of high productivity,
for instance, the Midlands, have been inadequate to cover the losses sustained.
By March 1966 the accumulated deficit on the current account had reached
^115-8 million which was included in the ^4I5 iDillion to be written off (see
above). Interest payments and depreciation provisions will be reduced as a
result of this writing off.
To assist the redeployment of manpower and the elimination of uneconomic
colliery capacity, the 1966 Coal Industry Act authorises the Ministry of
Power to make grants, with contributions on an equal basis from the
NCB, to meet expenditure up to a limit of ^30 million over the five years to
I97I-
The NCB has three research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, providing facilities for
fundamental research; a Mining Research Establishment, for the investigation
of underground problems, at Isleworth, Middlesex; and a Central Engineering
Establishment for developing new machines and testing equipment, near
Bretby, Derbyshire. In 1959 the Board set up a new department concerned
primarily with the further development of new processes for making smokeless
fuels. In 1947 the NCB took over the Coal Survey, a national organisation
for surveying coal resources within Britain; it has 70 laboratories in the various
coalfields.
A number of autonomous research associations receiving grants from the
NCB and the Ministry of Technology include the British Coal Utilisation
Research Association, the British Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar
Research Association. Much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety
in Mines Research Establishment (SMRE), is closely related to the Board s
problems; the SMRE carries out research on explosions and fires, pneumo¬
coniosis, engineering and metallurgy.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962.

Sources of crude oil within Britain meet only 1 ton in every 900 of total
United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being imported from overseas.
Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields now totals about
77,000 tons. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the estab¬
lishment of several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Eakring,
Egmanton and Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire
(Gainsborough) and in Dorset (Kimmeridge).
Seismic prospecting in the North Sea has been going on since 1962. Under
the Continental Shelf Act 1964, the Minister of Power, by a system of licensing
for exploration and production, controls those activities in the areas over the
shelf appertaining to the United Kingdom. Britain’s share of the North Sea
shelf amounts to about 100,000 square miles. Licences covering about 42,000
square miles were issued in 1964 and 1965 (a few being in the Irish Sea).
Drilling, which started in 1964, has proved the existence of four fields of
natural gas capable of commercial production. A substantial field of natural
gas was also proved in 1966 in North Yorkshire, near Scarborough.
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce more than one-third of all oil entering into
international trade, with a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on
charter) amounting to nearly a quarter of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United
Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is nearly one-seventh of the world’s total.)
In 1966 the United Kingdom imported 70-4 million tons of crude oil valued
at £427 million, the largest single item among imported products; approxi¬
mately 22 per cent came from Kuwait, the other largest suppliers being Iraq,
Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela in that order.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption in 1966 totalled
slightly over 73 million tons, having risen by more than two-thirds since i960.
An outstanding feature has been the continued rapid advance in the use of black
oils. Fuel oil consumption (excluding refineries) has been expanding by about
9 per cent a year since i960 and totalled about 29-1 million tons in 1966.
Demand for gas and diesel oils (excluding those used in road vehicles) rose by
a further 0-7 million tons to 7-6 million tons in 1966. Sales of motor spirit,
after expanding by half a million tons annually for some years, increased by
nearly 1 million tons to almost 11 million tons in 1965; the increase in 1966
was about 250,000 tons.
The most important uses of gas and diesel oils in 1966 were for non¬
industrial central heating, agricultural tractors and the railways. Electricity
generation accounted for about 24 per cent of total fuel oil consumption,
excluding that used in oil refineries; the steel industry accounted for 14 per
cent; and non-industrial central heating for a further 11 per cent. Of the
remainder, the largest users were the cement, paper-making, general chemical,
glass, engineering, brickmaking and textile industries.
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical to
refine at the source of production. Since the second world war the industry
has favoured the siting of refineries in the consuming areas.
At the end of 1966 rated refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted
to 82 million tons a year. Of the 19 refineries in operation, three have a

capacity of under 0-2 million tons. The seven largest are situated at Fawley,
near Southampton (15-7 million tons, which is being raised to 16-5 million
tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (10-3 million tons); Isle of Grain (10 million tons)
and Shellhaven (9-8 million tons), both on the Thames Estuary; two at
Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire (6-2 million tons and 5 million tons) and
at Llandarcy near Swansea (8 million tons). Other important refineries are
located at Belfast, on the Firth of Forth (Grangemouth), at Billingham-on-
Tees, Heysham (Lancs.) and Coryton (Essex). These, and other projects in
hand or planned (notably on Humberside and Tees-side, both of which will
become important refining areas), will bring Britain’s total capacity to almost
100 million tons a year by the end of 1968.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) has
risen steadily; from 4 million tons in 1948 to 25^ million tons in 1954, 40
million tons in i960 and the peak total of 65 million tons in 1966. There is a
substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading
and seasonal requirements and the commercial arrangements of the major oil
companies. Exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products
to European countries, were valued at £112 million in 1966; imports of
refined products (including liquefied gases) amounted to ^191 million.
Three main oil pipelines are at present in operation in Britain carrying crude
oil from harbours capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries: in
Scotland, from Finnart on Loch Long to Grangemouth; in South Wales,
from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy; and in Lancashire, from
Tranmere to Heysham. Pipelines carry refined products from refineries to
major marketing areas, where the volume transported is sufficient to justify the
capital cost; for example, a complex of lines runs from the Stanlow, Cheshire,
refinery to the Manchester area and another, 78 miles long, takes petroleum
feedstock from Fawley refinery to the £100 million petroleum chemicals plant
at Severnside, near Bristol; others carry refined products from Fawley to west
London and London Airport and from Walton-on-Thames to London Airport.
Construction is in progress on a pipeline system with an initial capacity of
3 million tons a year to feed refined products to the Midlands from refineries
and installations on the Thames and Mersey, on a refined products line from
Stanlow to Hay dock, and on an ethylene line from the Tees to the Mersey.
Meanwhile, parts of the system of pipelines laid during the second world war
are being used by the petroleum distributing companies. The Pipelines Act
1962 is designed to secure the orderly development of privately owned
industrial pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,
in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). The first of these covers
the full range of petroleum research and development, from geology and
production to product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the
remainder are concerned with the evolution of new and improved fuels and
lubricants and the development of new uses for petroleum products and of
new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at
Godaiming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has
INDUSTRY
275
been a feature of the industry, and the Electric Lighting Act 1882 authorised
the Board of Trade to grant licences for the establishment of electricity
undertakings by local authorities or by companies (which the local authorities
might compulsorily purchase after a given period of time) to supply consumers
in given areas. By the turn of the century a variety of independent supply
systems had grown up all over the country. In 1919 the Electricity Commis¬
sioners were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a
national scale through voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity
Board was set up to construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting
individual power stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission.
In 1943 the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was
established as a public corporation to develop the water-power resources of the
Highlands. In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings (other than those
in Northern Ireland) were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested
in the British Electricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north
of Scotland where they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two
subsequent Acts (1954 and 1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and
gave the industry its present structure. Electricity supply employs about
250,000 people, including 5,400 in Northern Ireland.
Present
Structure
England and Wales
Scotland
In England and Wales, electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate Area
Electricity Boards; co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council. In
Scotland, two boards—the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB)—both generate and distribute electricity. In Northern Ireland,
the Belfast Corporation and the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland generate
and distribute electricity, and the Londonderry Corporation distributes only.
The Electricity Council is the central body of the supply industry with
responsibility for general policy and programmes and for advising the
Minister of Power; it is also responsible for a number of common services,
principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The Council
consists of a chairman, two deputy chairmen, the chairman and two designated
members of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the chairmen
of the 12 Area Electricity Boards and not more than three other members.
The CEGB controls the operation and maintenance of power stations and the
main transmission system (the national grid) and supplies electricity in bulk
to the 12 Area Boards. The CEGB consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and between six and eight members. Each of the 12 Area Electricity Boards
acquires bulk supplies of electricity from the CEGB and is responsible for
distribution networks and sales of electricity to its area consumers.
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act 1947 in
the area of each Board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective Area Boards. The Minister of Power
appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the Electricity
Council, the CEGB, the Area Boards and the Consultative Councils; approves
each Board’s capital development programmes and the industry’s research
programme; and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the industry’s
borrowing requirements. The Electricity Act 1957 requires each Board, and
not merely the industry as a whole, to pay its way taking one year with another.
The boundary separating the areas covered by the two Scottish Boards runs
roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of
Tay. Members of both Boards and of the respective consumer consultative

councils are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland; each Board
comprises a chairman and between four and eight members. The Secretary of
State’s responsibilities in relation to the Boards are similar to those of the
Minister of Power.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast are operated by the city
corporation and the remainder by the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland.
Generation at these stations is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint
Electricity Authority, set up by statute in 1967. The output of the stations
has, since 1948, been purchased in bulk and re-sold to distributors—the
Belfast Corporation for Belfast and district, the Londonderry Corporation
for the City of Londonderry, and the Electricity Board for the rest of Northern
Ireland.
As Britain has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water
transport for moving it, most of its electricity is produced by coal-fired steam
generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any scale is
comparatively recent, water-power resources being relatively small and in
remote areas. Since 1965, however, nuclear energy has been contributing a
sizeable volume.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Great Britain at the end of 1966 totalled 42,972 megawatts (MW), an increase
of over one-third since i960.
In the years i960 to 1966 an annual average of over 2,000 M\\ of
generating capacity was installed, including 3,600 MW in 1965 and 2,507 MW
in 1966. It is planned to commission nearly 20,000 MW of capacity in England
and Wrales in the period 1966-69 inclusive. In the north of Scotland it is
planned to increase capacity from 1,749 MW at the end of 1966 to 1,840 MW
by 1970. The South of Scotland Electricity Board’s proposals provide for its
total capacity of 2,730 MW at the end of 1966 to be increased to 5,600 MW’
by 1970.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where, of the total installed
generating capacity of 857 MW, 300 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in
coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 2,594 million kilowatt-hours in 1966.
Generation by the public supply in Great Britain exceeded 181,000 million
kilowatt-hours in 1966; conventional steam power stations provided 88 per
cent of the total and hydro-electric and nuclear stations about 2 per cent and
10 per cent respectively. The high rate of expansion of output, which has been
a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has been maintained. The
total volume generated increased by 42 per cent between 1961 and 1966.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively
small—under 20,000 million kilowatt-hours in 1966. dhe major sources
outside the fuel industries themselves are the chemical, iron and steel and
paper industries and the nuclear power plants of the Atomic Energy Authority
(AEA).
An analysis of electricity generation in Great Britain is given in Table 18.
In the mid-1950s, when a coal shortage seemed likely, programmes for oil¬
firing at conventional thermal stations and for generating from nuclear energy
were introduced. There are 14 oil-burning power stations, or parts of
stations, operating in Great Britain (excluding old stations converted to oil¬
firing to conform with clean air legislation). They are mainly situated on river
estuaries and thus able to be fed conveniently from oil refineries. Oil-fired
stations of 2,000 MW are under construction at Fawley, on Southampton

Water, and at Pembroke, South Wales. A dual-fired station of the same size,
to burn either coal or oil, is being built at Kingsnorth, Kent.
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in
Britain, and although most of their electricity generation is based on coal, oil
consumption rose from a negligible quantity in 1955 to over 5-5 million tons
in 1962. The rate of increase has slowed down considerably, and consumption
in 1966 was 7-1 million tons. Average thermal efficiency of conventional
steam stations in England and Wales (that is, the ratio of power output to
the fuel consumed) rose from 20-75 per cent in 1947 to 27-33 Per cent
as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations, containing
much of the newest plant, had an average efficiency of 32-82 per cent in 1966.
Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
A cross-compound generating unit with an output capacity of 550 MW came
into operation in 1963 at Thorpe Marsh, near Doncaster. Forty-seven single¬
shaft units of 500 MW are being installed in 13 stations. The first came
into operation at the Ferrybridge ‘C’ station, Yorks, in 1966. Others will
be completed during 1967 at West Burton (near Retford, Notts), Eggborough
(Selby, Yorks), Ratcliffe-on-Soar (Notts), Aberthaw ‘B’ (Glamorgan), and
Cottam (East Retford, Notts). Station capacities are also increasing. By
1971, ten stations, each with capacities of 2,000 MW, with four 500 MW
single-shaft generating units, will be in service. Three larger generating
units, of 660 MW, will be installed at Drax (Yorks), which may have a final
capacity of nearly 4,000 MW. For location see map, p. 268. In Scotland, a
1,200 MW station at Cockenzie (1968) and one of 2,400 MW (four generating
units of 600 MW) at Longannet (1971) are under construction.
Large gas turbine units of 55 MW and 70 MW, based on aero jet engines,
have been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and
South of Scotland Electricity Board have installed 724 MW of such units.
Smaller gas turbines have been introduced at new stations to safeguard the
auxiliary supplies to the large new steam units, and also to provide capacity
for peak operation. Auxiliary units of this kind in service at the end of 1967
will total 576 MW, and by 1970 will exceed 1,000 MW.
Hydro-electric generation is confined to Scotland and Wales, and most of the
water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with their own
natural catchment areas. The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-
278

Electric Board in 1943 marked the beginning of an era of intensive water¬
power development in the Highlands of Scotland. A development scheme was
drawn up by the Board in 1944, showing the water-power resources which it
proposed to examine.
In 1966-67, 3,200 million units were sent out by the North of Scotland
Hydro-Electric Board from water-power, compared with 322 million in 1949.
At the end of March 1967 there were 54 main hydro-electric stations in
operation in the north of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 1,347 MW
and the largest—the Loch Sloy station—had a capacity of 130 MW; the Crua-
chan pumped storage section of the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of
400 MW from four reversible-pump-turbines, came into full operation at the
end of 1966. Under construction or survey were 199 MW of conventional
hydro-electric capacity together with a 1,200 MW pumped storage project at
Loch Sloy, a 600 MW project at North Devon, and one for 300 MW at Loch
Ness. In addition, there are stations generating electricity by water-power in
the south of Scotland (123 MW) and in Wales (473 MW). The latter includes
the 360 MW pumped storage station at Ffestiniog, which was completed in
1963. (In pumped storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is
used to pump water to higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to
operate turbo-generators.)
Some 10 per cent of Britain’s electricity was generated in nuclear power
stations in 1966 and the proportion is expected to rise to 12 per cent by about
1970. Britain has so far produced as much electricity by this means as the rest
of the world put together.
The AEA itself has four mains stations which produce electricity for the
national grid: Calder Hall, in Cumberland (185 MW electrical output);
Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire (188 MW); the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) at Windscale, Cumberland (35 MW); and the experimental fast
breeder station at Dounreay (15 MW).
Others are owned and operated by the electricity authorities. Under the
first commercial programme, originally announced in 1955 but since twice
modified, nine stations with a total installed capacity of 5,000 MW should be
in operation by 1969. So far eight (over 3,600 MW) have started operation:
Berkeley, in Gloucestershire (276 MW output capacity), and Bradwell, in
Essex (300 MW), were both commissioned in 1962; Hunterston, in Scotland
(300 MW), in 1964; and in the following year Hinkley Point ‘A’, in Somerset,
Trawsfynydd, in Wales (both 500 MW), and Dungeness ‘A’, in Kent (550
MW); Sizewell, in Suffolk (580 MW), was commissioned in 1966; Oldbury,
in Gloucestershire (600 MW), in 1967; and Wylfa, in Anglesey (1,180 MW),
should be completed by 1969. These stations, like Calder Hall and Chapel¬
cross, are all magnox stations—graphite-moderated, carbon-dioxide cooled
using natural uranium metal fuel elements canned in magnesium.
Under a second programme announced in 1964 and extended in 1965, a
further 8,000 MW installed nuclear capacity is planned by 1975. The first
station in this programme, Dungeness ‘B’, is based on the AGR at Windscale
which uses ceramic uranium dioxide fuel canned in stainless steel, a logical
development of the magnox system. Due to come into operation in 1970 with
a net electrical output of 1,200 MW it will be the most powerful in the world,
and the first in Britain to produce electricity more cheaply on base load than
the best coal stations. The second and third stations, Hinkley Point ‘B’ and
Hunterston ‘B’, are under construction.
A large prototype fast reactor (PER) of 250 MW capacity is being built by
the AEA, to be completed in 1971, at Dounreay where in October 1962 the

experimental fast reactor became the first of such type to produce electricity
for public use and to operate at a high power level.
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1966 those of the CEGB totalled some 9,350 route
miles (16,250 circuit miles), of which 203 miles were operated at 400,000 volts,
2,000 miles at 275,000 volts, 6,840 miles were operated at 132,000 volts and
the remainder at 66,000 volts and below. In Scotland there were some 4,000
circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of 1966, of which 1,100
circuit miles operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts.
Energy movements on the grid in England and Wales are controlled through
the eight operational areas, set up for that purpose and distinct from the
regions in which the generating side of the industry is organised; each area
has a separate control, and the operations are co-ordinated by a National
Control in London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control
centres at Pitlochry (North of Scotland) and at Kirkintilloch (South of
Scotland).
To reduce the number of new transmission lines needed to meet the
country’s increasing power demands, most of the new ‘supergrid’ of main
transmission lines now operating at 275,000 volts are, since 1965, being up¬
rated to operate at 400,000 volts. The development of the grid system has
made the British system the largest integrated power network in the world.
Twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable
of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current), have been
in operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
A direct current transmission link to reinforce supplies in the London area
is being installed; due for completion in 1970, the scheme—the first of its
kind in the world—will have a capacity of 640 MW.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board,
supplemented from other sources, such as industrial plants and the nuclear
power stations of the AEA. There are over 17-5 million consumers. Industrial
concerns are the biggest users of electricity. The principal domestic uses of
electricity are for lighting, cooking and for space and water heating, but the
demand for numerous other domestic purposes is rising steadily.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with
the distribution of electricity to consumers in the north of Scotland. It has
about 450,000 consumers, many in remote areas, and well over four-fifths of
crofts have a supply of electricity. The South of Scotland Electricity Board
supplies about 1-5 million consumers, including almost all of the farmers in
the area.
About 11 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United
Kingdom in 1966 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. The
industry in recent years has based its capital needs for five years ahead on an
average annual increase in demand of about 7 to 9 per cent; its plans up to
1972-73 are based on an average annual growth of 7-3 per cent.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry has been expanding
very rapidly: from £249 million in 1956 it rose to £359 million in 1961 and
£714 million in 1966. More than two-fifths of the industry’s capital require¬
ments have been financed from internal resources. The statutory limit to
borrowings by the industry in Great Britain is £4,980 million. The industry

(other than the NSHEB) is required to aim at a gross return of per cent
on its net assets.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Minister of Power, is
responsible for drawing up a general programme of research, comprising:
direct research carried out by the Electricity Boards themselves; sponsored
research undertaken for the supply industry by universities and colleges;
and co-operative research with other organisations, in particular the industrial
research associations to which the supply industries subscribe. The Council
itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the Electricity Supply
Research Council. Collaboration on research between the supply industry
and the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineering
Research Steering Committee set up in 1966.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the Central
Electricity Generating Board and comprise the Central Electricity Research
Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Glouces¬
tershire, concerned with nuclear problems, and the Engineering Laboratories
at Marchwood, on Southampton Water. In 1965 the Electricity Council
established a research centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire, at which intensive
research is being undertaken on distribution problems (to supplement the
work undertaken at the Central Electricity Research Laboratories) and on
appliances and methods of electricity utilisation.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities. The
North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board undertakes a wide range of research
and development work, both independently and in conjunction with the
British Electrical and Allied Industries Research Association, universities and
manufacturers. The South of Scotland Electricity Board has recently extended
its own research activities and is associated with those of the Electricity
Council and Central Electricity Generating Board in England.
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London,
was first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light
and Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London.
In the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting
and was provided by a growing number of company and municipal under¬
takings.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the
period between the two world wars when increasing competition from
electricity had to be met, and by 1939 the industry had become mainly a
supplier of heating rather than lighting.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
123,000 persons are at present employed, under public ownership and control
on 1 st May 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to
local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. The central body is
the Gas Council, appointed by the Minister of Power. It is both a co¬
ordinating council and, since the enactment of the Gas Act 1965, a trading
body, consisting of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman, the 12 chair¬
men of the area boards and up to three other members. Its general duties are to
advise the Minister on questions affecting the industry and promote the
efficient performance of their duties by the area boards. It has also specific
duties relating to finance, labour relations and research.

The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and opera¬
tional responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies
of the other publicly owned corporations, are responsible for manufacturing
gas and distributing it to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards, appointed
b) Minister of Power, consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chair¬
man, in some cases one or more full-time members, and usually five or six
part-time members, including the chairman of the Area Consultative Council.
There is no common pattern of organisation; each board is fully independent
and has devised its own subordinate structure. Each is required to pay its
way, taking one year with another. The operations of the area boards have
resulted, in the 17 years up to 31st March 1966, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of approximately £72 million, before taxation.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
The chief method of gas production in Britain used to be by carbonising coal
but oil-based production is expanding markedly; more than 40 per cent of gas
supplied in 1966 was derived from oil, and 3*1 million tons were used, three
times the amount in 1962. The gas industry used about 17 million tons of
coal (25 million tons in 1958) and another 24 million tons were carbonised
in coke ovens other than those of the gas industry.
About one-third of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas under¬
takings for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the
ovens or at steelworks. There are about 13 million consumers, the total having
shown no significant change since 1955. Manufactured gas and gas acquired
from coke ovens and other sources for distribution is about 900,000 million
cubic feet annually.
In 1966 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
6,600 million cubic feet, most of it for household use.
Three-fifths of all gas sold by gas boards is for household use and the remainder
for industrial and commercial purposes. Total consumption has been rising at
an average rate of about 7 per cent per annum since 1961, after a period when
growth was almost negligible. Sales reached a level of about 3,630 million
therms1 in 1966.
About 40 per cent of the domestic load is used for cooking and space heating
and water heating account for the largest part of the remainder. Most homes
in Britain are supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to
difficulties in storage and transmission, mains gas is not economic, and bottled
gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used.
Gas is used extensively in industries which require the control of temperatures
to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery industry and in
certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In 1965-66
sales of gas to industry totalled 928 million therms.
Production of coke at gas works in 1966 was 7-2 million tons (a fall of one-fifth
in two years) and at coke ovens 16-1 million tons, reflecting on the one hand
the increasing use of oil and on the other a fall from the high level of activity in
the steel industry in 1965. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce
about 3 million tons of crude coal tar and nearly 100 million gallons of crude

benzole a year. These latter by-products yield materials widely employed in
the newer branches of the chemical industry.
Under the Gas Act 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. In 1954 the industry’s borrowing powers
were increased to £45° million, in i960 to j£525 million, in !9^3
million and in 1965 to £ 1,200 million.
The industry had been spending about £5° million a year on capital
investment in the period 1955 I9^1 since 1961—62 expenditure has
increased sharply; in 1966—67 it reached £208 million and £285 million is
planned for 1967-68. Between vesting day (1st May 1949) and the end of
March 1967 about £ 1,178 million had been invested in fixed assets.
Considerable integration, by the linking of works for the transmission of gas
through gas grids and long-distance mains, has enabled production to be
concentrated in the most efficient units.
To maintain its competitive position, the gas industry has investigated
new and more economic methods of production and new sources of gas
supply. Although two plants which use the Lurgi method for the complete
gasification of inferior grades of coal have been commissioned, their capital
cost is high. More significant have been the developments in the gasification
of oil. In the 1950s these plants were small, produced gas at lower pressure
and were designed to meet peak-load needs. More recently the introduction
of processes using light distillates in large units producing gas at high pressure
has permitted even greater savings in both capital and running costs.
The work done in the Gas Council’s Midlands Research Station led to the
introduction of two new methods of manufacture, the Gas Recycle Hydro-
genator and the Catalytic Rich Gas processes, both of which enable a high
calorific value gas to be manufactured entirely from light distillate feedstock
without the need for enrichment from any outside source. The first plants
incorporating these processes were put on stream in i9^5" Gas made from
oil and gas purchased from refineries now amounts to nearly half of the total
supply available and the proportion is steadily increasing.
Since 1964 deliveries of natural gas from the Sahara have been made in liquid
form to Britain. A pipeline system distributes the gas from a terminal on
Canvey Island to 8 of the 12 Area Gas Boards.
Since the discovery of the first productive well in the North Sea in 1965,
sufficient natural gas has been found to supply twice Britain s current gas
consumption. The Ministry of Power has estimated that by 197® some 2,000
million cubic feet of gas per day should be available representing about
10 per cent of total energy requirements—and the Gas Council has stated the
industry’s plans to switch over entirely to natural gas within the next 10 years.
The first pipeline to pump natural gas to the shore, at Easington in
Yorkshire, was put on flow early in 1967.
The Gas Council expects gas consumption to increase by some 12 per
cent a year up to 1970 and therefore substantial expansion is required. The
need to provide additional storage capacity, particularly in underground
reservoirs of porous rock (regulated under the Gas Act i965)> an<^
strengthening of the distribution system will also mean substantial investment.
The Gas Council has a research committee which advises on the initiation
and implementation of research policy. Research organisations comprise five
stations in addition to Watson House at Fulham, London, for the design,

testing and development of appliances. Research is also carried out on behalf
of the Gas Council at Leeds University and at other universities and colleges.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and distri¬
butors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users
on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the
operation of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency
Service, was formed in 1954 and sponsored by the fuel and power industries
to promote fuel saving in industry. In addition to consultancy work, it provides
advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of forms, from
‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and power surveys and regular visits on a
contract basis.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. The sources of water are often distant
from the areas where supplies are needed, however, and water undertakings
are therefore mainly concerned with abstraction, storage, treatment and
distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and
boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings.
The Government has announced its intention of reorganising the water
supply industry under full public ownership. Ministerial responsibility in
England and Wales is shared by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment and the Secretary of State for Wales; in Scotland it lies with the
Secretary of State for Scotland; and in Northern Ireland with the Minister
of Development.
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service, largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick
and his colleagues who demonstrated the dangers arising from inadequate
water supply and sanitation. The Public Health Act 1848 laid the basis for
a long series of statutes dealing with public health. From the middle of the
nineteenth century onwards a number of water undertakings were set up
to provide water to the expanding urban population, and the water supply
system developed rapidly, although in piecemeal fashion and with some
overlapping and waste.
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water
supplies are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this
either by operating water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other
bodies are providing adequate supplies. Over one-fifth of the water consumed
is supplied by statutory water companies. The householder receives his
domestic water supply at a comparatively small charge, varying in different
areas, which he usually pays by way of a water rate levied, like other rates,
284

Present Supplies
on the value of his house. Industrial users are charged in most cases according
to actual material consumption.
The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of
State for Wales have a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of
water supplies in England and Wales and are advised by the Central Advisory
Water Committee on general questions relating to water and organisation of
supplies. Since the passing of the Water Act 1945, over 800 smaller water
authorities in England and Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or
by the creation of joint boards in order to improve the efficiency of the water
supply industry. In April 1967 there were in England and Wales 140 local
authority water undertakings, 83 joint water boards (including bulk supply
boards) and 4 joint water committees, 41 statutory water companies, 4
non-statutory water companies, and 1 private proprietor with statutory
powers. A number of private proprietors without statutory powers also
provide small supplies.
The largest undertaking in Britain is the Metropolitan Water Board, which
supplies over 360 million gallons daily to 6J million people in the London
area. It consists of 39 part-time members who are the elected representatives
of the various local authorities within the Board’s area of operations, together
with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Conservancies.
Public water supplies in England and Wales—reaching over 95 per cent of
the total population and about 90 per cent of the rural population—now total
some 2,500 million gallons a day, apart from large quantities taken privately
from rivers and underground.
Capital expenditure by water undertakings which averaged about £50
million a year in the period 1960-64 is now at a level of £60 million a year.
Interest, together with running costs, is largely met from annual income.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1965. By
March 1967 schemes costing over £100 million had been completed or were
in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, the needs of industry having grown so much that in many areas
they now exceed domestic demand. The use of water in irrigation of farm
land is also growing. In order that the country’s wrater resources should be
developed to meet these growing requirements the Water Resources Act 1963,
which came into full operation in April 1965, created a new administrative
structure consisting of 27 river authorities and a central Water Resources
Board. The river authorities, the Thames Conservancy and the Lee Con¬
servancy Catchment Board have a majority of members appointed by the
county and county borough councils in their areas. The remainder are
appointed by ministers for their knowledge of land drainage, fisheries, the
public water supply, and water in use in industry and in agriculture. The
authorities manage the water resources of river basins and carry out other
functions in respect of land drainage, flood control, administration of fisheries
and prevention of pollution. They are responsible for assessing water
resources and requirements, controlling and developing resources and
securing regulation by a system of licensing. Special arrangements exist for
the Greater London area, where the full range of river authority control is
not necessary. The work of the river authorities is co-ordinated by the Water
Resources Board, an expert advisory body which reports to the Ministry of
Housing and Local Government. Its duties include the review of national
water resources and requirements, the encouragement of the transfer of water

between areas according to need, the co-ordination of proposals of river
authorities for capital investment and the initiation of research. From 1969
water conservation is to be financially self-supporting, the cost being met
from charges levied by river authorities on the abstractors and users of water.
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local
authorities, either separately or in combination with each other; they supply
about 97 per cent of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales except that there is not the
same need to allocate water between competing interests and less reliance
needs to be placed on underground sources. The Secretary of State for
Scotland has a general duty to promote the conservation of water resources
in Scotland; require local authorities to provide supplies of wholesome water
everywhere in their districts, where this can be done at reasonable cost; and
provide for a uniform system of rating for water throughout the country. The
Scottish Water Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of State on general
questions relating to resources and supplies. The Rural Water Supplies and
Sewerage Act 1944, as amended, makes available to Scottish local authorities
grant assistance up to a maximum of ^45 million towards the cost of water
supplies and sewerage schemes in rural areas.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and
industrial consumption. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern
Ireland) 1945 made it obligatory for water supply authorities to provide a
supply of wholesome water to houses and schools in their areas where this
could be done at reasonable cost; the Minister of Development may make
grants towards the costs of schemes undertaken by these authorities. Before
1945 only the more densely populated areas had a piped supply, but progress
has been such that even in the thinly populated rural districts most households
have now been, or soon will be, connected to a piped supply.
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface
water resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain,
published annually by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. This publication
contains particulars of the run-off and related rainfall from a large number of
rivers, streams and reservoired areas. The Water Resources Board is respon¬
sible for the gauging, collation and publication of hydrological information:
the field work of surface water measurement is done by river authorities, water
undertakings and other bodies. Detailed studies of the resources and use of
water in specified areas have been published in the series of Hydrological
Surveys which cover approximately half of England and Wales. General
information on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the
responsibility of the Meteorological Office, while advice on ground water is the
responsibility of the Water Resources Board. The Hydraulics Research Station
of the Ministry of Technology at Wallingford and the Water Research
Association’s station at Medmenham carry out research into problems of the
design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of
surface water, and into other hydraulic problems.
Preliminary ‘desk studies’ have been carried out of barrages across Morecambe
Bay and Solway Firth. A full-scale feasibility study is to be made at More¬
cambe Bay. Barrage projects involve dams across or within tidal estuaries to
form a lake of fresh water.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Each river authority is responsible for the prevention of pollution of rivers
and certain tidal waters in its area and its approval must be sought before
polluting effluents are discharged. Control of pollution in the tidal Thames
is exercised by the Port of London Authority. In Scotland nine river purifica¬
tion boards have been set up. The Secretary of State for Scotland is advised
by the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee on questions affecting
the cleanliness of Scottish rivers. In several ports the petroleum companies
co-operate in the prevention of oil pollution from tankers and refineries.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage investigates
problems connected with the treatment of polluted water, the treatment
and disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and
prevention of pollution of surface water and underground water. Research is
carried out with general supervision and advice from the Water Pollution
Research Board.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry includes firms engaged on the construction,
alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, waterworks, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence
works, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal
prospecting and mining, and structural work connected with thermal and
hydro-electric power stations and telecommunications. The industry employs
1-7 million persons, including all grades, equivalent to some 7 per cent of the
total labour force and their net output provides about 7 per cent of the gross
national product.
It was announced in February 1967 that over the next five years the
construction industry would gradually adopt metric in place of Imperial
weights and measures.
Constructional work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities who employ their own labour. Over five-sixths of the work is
done by private firms. Although there are over 82,000 firms in the industry,
more than a fifth of them are one-man businesses. At the other end of the
scale are over 230 firms each with more than 600 employees.
Public authorities as a whole employ about 370,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work which
local authorities, for example, carry out with their own labour.
Over 40 per cent of operatives are occupied on building maintenance,
valued at over £1,100 million annually. The total labour force includes about
800,000 skilled craftsmen, who have been trained for four or five years under
the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. A further 108,000 are employed as
apprentices.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the
smallest projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either
by architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the constructional work by the contractor.

1 he Ministry of Public Building and Works (see p. 59) is responsible for
all the construction programmes undertaken directly by the Government
(except for roads), including work for the armed services, both at home and
overseas. It is also responsible for co-ordinating research and development
throughout the government service and seeks to influence methods and
techniques in the building industry as a whole.
The volume of output of the industry has been rising steadily; by the end of
1966 it was running at an annual rate of 37 per cent above the 1958 level.
The value of work done in 1966 amounted to £4,039 million, of which £589
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by
public authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £3,450
million (£2,734 million on new work and £716 million on repair work).
About 390,000 houses were started in 1966 and some £1,065 million of
housing work was carried out by private firms, a record for the total volume
of housing work. Of this, about £554 million, or 52 per cent, was for private
owners and the remaining £511 million for public authorities. It is planned
to build 500,000 dwellings a year by 1970. Increasing use is being made of
industrialised building methods employing prefabricated components.
The National Building Agency, which was set up by the Government in
1964, comes under the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Its main
function is to encourage the adoption of advanced methods of housebuilding,
especially industrialised building methods, as well as technical advice and
services, in particular, to local authorities. The Ministry plans that eventually
40 per cent of local authority housebuilding should be industrialised; the
current percentage is around 30.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam,
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, bridges,
canals, docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard
Kingdom Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom in
1967 were several major conventional power stations and nuclear power
stations (see p. 278); the io|-mile Victoria Tube line in London, costing
£60 million; and large-scale housing developments, such as the Thamesmead
(London) project to house 60,000 people, and the first stages of the new town
being built at Craigavon, Northern Ireland. Projects for road construction,
bridges and tunnels included a further 130 miles of motorways under con¬
struction (see p. 354), a £6 million high-level bridge over the Clyde, and the
£20 million second Mersey Tunnel. The £13 million Tyne Tunnel was
opened in 1967.
British constructional firms have been as active overseas as in the United
Kingdom. British consulting engineers, in particular, have built up a tradition
of knowledge and integrity which has caused their standards to become
international practice and their services to be in world-wide demand.
Among important construction projects by British contractors in hand in
overseas countries during 1967 were: a new township for the Government of
Bahrain, costing £6 million; the £10 million restoration of the Hejaz railway
288.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL FIANDBOOK
Research
in the Middle East; and a £5 million road scheme in Malawi. British consult¬
ing engineers were engaged on a number of projects where British contractors
were not commissioned for the construction work. Notable examples were an
airport at Baghdad, costing £12-5 million; construction of two water barrages
in West Pakistan (£27 million); and water supply schemes for Hong Kong
(^19 million) and Libya (£6-3 million). A new port at Dammam, to cost
between ^10 million and ^12 million, is being designed for the Saudi Arabian
Government.
It has been estimated that the total value of work carried out during the
year ending in March 1967 by over 100 British contractors, operating in 104
countries, was £172 million, compared with £169 million in the previous
year, and that the value of newT contracts obtained was £170 million, compared
with £190 million in the previous year. Consulting engineers had projects
worth about £1,400 million in hand on 1st January 1967.
The Directorate-General of Research and Development in the Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for co-ordinating research and
information services to increase efficiency in the building industry. On
1 st July 1967 the Ministry assumed responsibility from the Ministry of
Technology for the Building Research Station. The Station was originally
set up in 1921, thus making Britain the pioneer of organised building research,
and is concerned with research into all aspects of building.
The Civil Engineering Research Association which promoted research on
problems of civil engineering, agreed in March 1967 to enlarge its activities
to take in the whole field of construction with an information and advisory
service. The enlarged body, to be known as the Construction Industry
Research and Information Association, is financed jointly by the Government
and the industry.
The Heating and Ventilating Research Association, an industrial research
organisation, deals with problems of heating and ventilation of large buildings.
The major construction firms have research departments working on plant,
materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research include the
universities and colleges of technology. Most of the producers of primary
building materials have trade associations which maintain research institutions
chiefly devoted to seeking new and more efficient use for their materials:
the Timber Research and Development Association and the Cement and
Concrete Association are examples.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries supply a wide range of products, many
of which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by
over a third since 1958, and in 1966 was 1 per cent higher than the previous
year. In 1966 this sector spent £1,406 million on fixed capital equipment,
including £327 million on building work and £982 million on plant and
machinery. The number of employees in manufacturing industry (including
the unemployed and those absent from work through sickness and other
causes, but excluding employers and the self-employed) was 9-1 million in
June 1966, 38 per cent of the total number of employees.
The employment and production figures listed in Table 19 give an indication
of the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry.
Expansion has been particularly rapid in those industries utilising advanced

technologies such as electronics, the newer branches of mechanical engineer¬
ing, most branches of the chemical industry and man-made fibres. The
diagram on page 262 shows the changes in production between 1958 and
1966 in the major groups of industry.
In the subsequent sections, statistics of employees refer to numbers at
June 1966, and export statistics are taken mainly from the Overseas Trade
Accounts of the United Kingdom.
The metal manufacturing industries employ 624,000 persons. Of these,
356,000 are in the iron and steel industry, 122,000 in the manufacture of
iron castings, 60,000 in the manufacture of light metals, and 85,000 in the
copper, brass and other base metal industries. Exports of iron and steel
products and non-ferrous metals in 1966 had an aggregate value of £406
million.
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the
discovery of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking
in the second half of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s
fifth largest steel producing nation. Output of crude steel in 1966 totalled
290
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
24-3 million ingot tons, 10 per cent less than the record output of 27 million
tons in 1965. Capacity utilisation in 1966 averaged 79 per cent, compared
with 87-5 per cent in 1965. Total capacity at the end of 1966 was about
31 million tons. Pig iron production in 1966 amounted to 15-7 million tons.
Net deliveries of finished steel amounted to 19 million tons in 1966. The
3-7 million tons of iron and steel products which were exported had a value
of ^214-8 million; the United States (£32-7 million), Sweden (£13-5 million)
and Spain (£10-3 million) were the main overseas buyers.
The main producing districts are: South Wales (26 per cent of total crude
steel output); the north-east of England (16 per cent); Sheffield and district
(12 per cent); Scotland (11 per cent); Lincolnshire (11 per cent); and
Lancashire and Flintshire (10 per cent). South Wales concentrates mainly on
the manufacture of flat products, especially sheet steel and tinplate; the
output of the north-east coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy steel
products (plates, sections and rails), although a wide strip mill for sheet
production is now in operation in Scotland.
During the period 1950-66 over ,£1,400 million was spent on major
development schemes. Capital expenditure reached a peak in the years
1960-62 of over ^170 million a year on average, due mainly to the strip mill
expansion programme, falling to ^42 million in 1966. The emphasis is
increasingly on improving efficiency rather than raising total capacity. Britain
has some of the most modern plant in Europe, and by 1966 steel production
by the converter processes had increased from 8 per cent of total output in
i960 to 27 per cent; steel from electric furnaces had increased from 7 per cent
to nearly 14 per cent; and the share of the older open hearth process had
fallen from 85 per cent to 59 per cent.
Output per blast furnace has risen markedly in recent years, due both to
an increase in average size and to improvements in efficiency, such as im¬
proved preparation of raw materials, the injection of fuel and oxygen, and the
use of higher blast temperatures. Industry-wide scientific and technological
research is carried out by the British Iron and Steel Research Association.
Total annual expenditure by the industry is nearly £12 million.
Outstanding development projects completed in the last few years include
wide strip mills at new integrated works at Newport (Monmouthshire) and
at an existing works in Scotland; a new plant at Stoke-on-Trent, which is
based entirely on continuous casting for supplies of semi-finished steel; an
advanced unit for the mass production of alloy and special carbon steels at
Sheffield; the world’s largest electric melting shop and a new steelworks in
which a linked three-computer system controls production planning through¬
out, both at Rotherham.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public
supervision since 1932. The Iron and Steel Act 1967, which received the
Royal Assent in March, brings into public ownership 14 major steel companies
together producing well over 90 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and employing
some 70 per cent of the manpower in the industry. Their shares and securities
were vested on 28th July in the British Steel Corporation, which was formally
established in April. The Corporation’s specific duties include promoting
the efficient and economic supply of iron and steel products, exports, and
research and development; it is statutorily responsible for the finances of the
nationalised industry. The Act requires the Corporation to report on the
reorganisation of the industry within a year of its establishment. The Iron and
Steel Board, which had exercised a general supervision over the industry under
the Iron and Steel Act 1953, was dissolved. The remaining private sector

includes some 200 companies accounting for about one-third of the value of
the industry’s sales.
Output of iron castings totalled 3-9 million tons in 1966, 0-2 million tons
less than the record level of 1965. The main users of iron castings are the
general engineering industry, the motor vehicle industry, the manufacturers
of pressure pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries and the
steel industry. The engineering industry accounts for nearly one-third of the
total tonnage sold and about one-half of the industry’s turnover. There are
about 1,200 firms in the iron founding industry and the number of employees
is 112,000. Exports are included in the total of steel exports in the previous
section.
The non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a consumer
of aluminium, copper and lead Britain is second only to the United States
among western countries. Output in 1966 included: aluminium, 37,000 tons
of virgin metal and 181,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 43,000
tons of virgin copper and 142,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 111,000 tons
of secondary metal refined from scrap and 61,000 tons of virgin lead refined
from imported lead bullion; zinc, 100,000 tons of slab metal; and tin, 19,000
tons. Mining in Britain is confined to the working of lead and tin ores on a
small scale, although detailed investigation is taking place into the possibilities
of a considerable expansion of tin mining.
In 1966 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at ^ 149-2 million.
The main products exported, including semi-finished products, were copper
and copper alloys (£78-9 million), nickel and its alloys (£24-4 million),
aluminium and its alloys (£20-8 million) and tin and its alloys (^11-9 million).
The Federal Republic of Germany (£20-3 million), the United States (£17-3
million), France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Italy were the largest pur¬
chasing countries. Indirect exports are also substantial.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres
include South Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth. Firms are engaged
in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing and
the techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure diecasting are also employed.
Some non-ferrous metals, such as nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and
vanadium, are largely used in the making of high-speed and other special
steels. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties have emerged
with the growth of new industries having particular requirements, as, for
example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium), jet aircraft
(niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic apparatus (selenium, silicon,
germanium, tantalum). Scientific and technological research for the industry as
a whole is conducted by the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association.
Mechanical engineering comprises a wide range of industries, including all
types of machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools, mechanical handling
equipment, construction equipment, industrial plant, ordnance and small
arms, watches and clocks, and scientific instruments. Vehicle engines are
included in the section on vehicles (p. 298). The number of employees is
1-4 million and the volume of production from these industries rose by 49 per
cent between 1958 and 1966. In 1966, the aggregate value of the main products
of all sections other than tractors, small arms, scientific instruments and
watches and clocks, was ^2,233 million. Exports of non-electric machinery
were valued at £1,041 million in 1966, 12 per cent higher than in 1965.

There are over 300 firms, employing 38,000 people, in the agricultural
machinery industry, including three very large firms with more than 1,000
workers. In 1966 output, excluding tractors, was valued at £53-2 million and
exports were worth £26-6 million; the main overseas markets were France,
the Federal Republic of Germany, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands and
the United States. The number of self-propelled combine harvesters, forage
harvesters, pick-up balers and grain driers in use has increased in Britain in
recent years. Deliveries in 1966 included 3,800 combine harvesters, 6,600
milking machines, 15,600 pick-up balers and 2,400 grain and grass driers.
The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
Some 214,000 agricultural and industrial wheeled tractors were delivered in
1966, 171,000 (80 per cent) for export. In addition, 32,000 small market
garden tractors, were delivered. Exports of new agricultural and track-laying
tractors had the record value of ^104-5 million in 1966, 14 per cent more than
in 1965. Agricultural tractor production is dominated by two large organisa¬
tions. Tractors are exhibited at the annual Royal Smithfield Show and
Agricultural Machinery Exhibition in London; Britain has one of the heaviest
tractor densities in the world (see p. 323).
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry, and by the
early 1830s had developed to an advanced stage the boring machine and
screw-cutting lathe, as well as other machine tools. The industry’s output
today ranges from watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to machines
weighing hundreds of tons, including transfer lines for motor vehicle manu¬
facture and electronically controlled machine tools giving accuracies of one-
ten-thousandth part of an inch. Over 1,000 numerically controlled machine
tools have been installed in Britain.
The value of deliveries of metal-working machine tools rose by 5 per cent
in 1966 to £149 million (the highest ever recorded), compared with ^141-3
million in 1965. Exports in 1966 had a value of £41-1 million; and of the
orders on hand at the end of December 1966 (£101 million), 29 per cent were for
export. The United States (£6-1 million), India (£4-3 million), Australia (^3-7
million) and Canada (£3-6 million) were the main overseas markets in 1966.
The trend in the industry is towards the formation of larger groups although
the high degree of specialisation makes it possible for the small firm to
flourish. The industry is centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and
Lancashire, and to a lesser extent near London and Glasgow. There are
96,000 persons employed.
The Machine Tool Trades Association of Great Britain is the representative
body of most manufacturers and importers, and is responsible for the
International Machine Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years,
the next being due in 1968. The industry is served by its own research body,
the Machine Tool Industry Research Association, and its customers by the
Production Engineering Research Association.
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines. Deliveries of engines
(including parts) had a value of ^137-8 million in 1966 and exports (including
marine engines) were worth £27-9 million; in addition, parts exported were
valued at ^20-5 million. The total brake horse-power of the 336,500 internal
combustion engines delivered was n-2 million ranging in size from under
15 b.h.p. to over 4,000 b.h.p. Production is concentrated among the large
firms in the industry, and a total of 44,000 people are employed.

One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries, the textile
machinery industry developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. Its range of
output embraces all stages in textile manufacturing processes. Deliveries in
1966 were valued at ^110-7 million and exports (including products of some
associated industries) at j£82'3 million, an increase of 16 per cent on 1965.
Principal markets were the United States (£8-5 million), India (£7-6 million),
Pakistan (^7-6 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany (^5-5 million).
The industry, which has 52,000 employees, comprises many firms and is
situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee,
Leicester and Nottingham. It makes a wide range of machines and accessories
for the manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of
natural and man-made fibres. In the case of bast and leaf fibre machinery the
United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment; the
products of the industry range from individual units and accessories to
complete operating systems. The value of deliveries in 1966 was ^129-8
million (10 per cent more than in 1965), the main products being cranes and
bridge transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators and hoists. In
addition, British firms produced 17,100 powered industrial trucks, including
13,000 fork-lift trucks. Exports of mechanical handling equipment (including
industrial and works trucks) in 1966 were valued at £35 million. There are
many small firms in the industry; in all, 61,000 people are employed.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced. These include crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers, trenchers,
dozer equipment, dumpers, excavators and loading shovels, and crushing,
pulverising and screening plant. The labour force numbers 31,500.
The value of deliveries from the industry was £154 million in 1966; by far
the most important single item was earth-moving machinery (with a value
of £9i'5 million), while other important products were crawler tractors
(^28-5 million), and concrete mixing machinery (£io-g million). Deliveries
of contractors’ plant for export in 1966 totalled ^75-4 million; France, Spain,
Australia and Sweden are important markets.
The office machinery industry has been expanding rapidly and is now second
in size only to that of the United States. In 1966 the value of deliveries of
office machinery was £79-4 million including £45-6 million for export.
Deliveries in 1966 included 103,000 standard typewriters and 212,000
portable typewriters. The value of deliveries of accounting and similar
machinery was ^50-6 million, of which £33-2 million was for export, and of
other office machinery ^18-7 million, of which ^9-4 million was for export.
Exports of all office machinery (including electronic computers and data
processing equipment) were valued at £77-i million. The most important
overseas purchasers were the Federal Republic of Germany (£17-9 million),
France (£8-2 million), the United States (£7-5 million) and Australia (^6-4
million). British subsidiaries or associates of United States firms are prominent
in the office machinery industry. There are 65,000 persons employed.
The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding
industry; deliveries increased in value from £55 million in 1959 to a peak of
£94 million in 1966; the main products were hard metal tipped tools (£14

million), other metal cutting tools (£42-4 million), jigs and fixtures (£18-5
million) and press tools, moulds, etc. (£12-1 million). Export deliveries in
1966 totalled j£i6-4 million. The industry has a labour force of 72,000 persons.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and
steelwork, and 161,500 are employed in this branch. Of particular importance
are steam-raising boilers, lime and cement kilns, gas and coke oven plant,
sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, chemical and mineral oil
refining plant, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant, and
steelwork for bridges, buildings, etc. The industry has several large-scale
enterprises. In 1966 the aggregate value of deliveries (including rolling mills)
was ^560 million, 25 per cent higher than in the previous year.
British companies delivered water tube boilers to the value of £97 •1 million
in 1966 compared with £81-2 million in 1965 "> shell boilers and other boiler-
house plant accounted for a further £47-9 million. Water tube boilers of
advanced design and of large steam-raising capacity are produced for power
stations, whereas shell boilers are used for steam-raising and heating in
factories and buildings. Exports of vapour generating boilers in 1966 amounted
to £10-4 million.
The steelworks plant industry provides, in association with firms producing
rolling mills, almost all Britain’s requirements as well as plant for export.
The value of deliveries in 1966 was ^37-5 million; rolling mills and ancillary
equipment accounted for an additional £26-6 million. This industry consists
of a small number of firms, most of which are business associates or members
of a consortium. Spain, India, South Africa and Canada are a few of the
countries in which British firms are undertaking large-scale steelworks plant
projects.
The manufacture of specialised equipment for the chemical and oil refining
industries has expanded rapidly in recent years. Deliveries of chemical plant
had a record value of £127-9 million in 1966 compared with £86-4 million in
1965 and £53-7 million in 1964. If the whole range of equipment manu¬
factured by British firms for the petroleum industry is aggregated, Britain
ranks second to the United States as a supplier. The range of chemical plant
produced includes distillation columns, heat exchangers, high-vacuum drying
equipment, and plant for the manufacture of chemicals from all feedstocks
including petroleum.
Three major consortia consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical
engineering, civil engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries,
build nuclear power stations for the United Kingdom electricity authorities
(see p. 278), and have built stations in Italy and Japan. The Atomic Energy
Authority grants them non-exclusive manufacturing licences and is working
in close collaboration with them in research and development.
In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in preceding
sections, there are about 1,750 enterprises whose principal product is a type of
machinery not so far mentioned. The main products include: mining
machinery, printing and book-binding machinery, refrigeration appliances,
space heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, pumps and pump¬
ing machinery, industrial valves and cocks, compressors, scales and weighing
machinery, portable power tools, food preparing machinery and many other
types of equipment. The total value of deliveries in 1966 was some £762
million. There are 370,000 workers employed in these industries.

This industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances, extending
from domestic and commercial refrigerators of varying sizes to industrial
refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals and other
products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships. In 1966, 806,000
domestic refrigerators were delivered to the home market and 178,000 for
export. Total deliveries of refrigerating machinery had a value of ^53 • 1
million.
The value of deliveries of space heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment has been rising recently and in 1966 reached £79-3 million.
Exports of air-conditioning and non-domestic refrigerating equipment in
1966 had a value of £8-3 million.
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital
component in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil
and electric power industries. A wide range of materials is used, including
plastics and many different metals. The value of deliveries of pumps and
valves in 1966 was £142-3 million (15 per cent more than in 1965) and that
of air and gas compressors and exhausters ^45-1 million. Exports of pumps
and centrifuges were valued at million and exports of industrial valves
at £24 million.
The value of deliveries of other major products in 1966 was: mining machinery,
£58-8 million; food and drink machinery, £45-1 million; packaging
machinery, £26-6 million; and other machinery, £311-7 million. Important
export products in 1966 included: food and drink processing machinery,
£15-3 million; cigarette-making machinery, £9-3 million; paper-making
machinery, £12-6 million; and printing and book-binding machinery, £20-8
million.
The industry manufactures photographic, scientific, surgical and industrial
instruments; it has a labour force of 138,000 persons. A rapidly expanding
sector is that making industrial process measuring and control instruments—
an essential element of automation in industry-deliveries of which amounted
to ^69-7 million in 1966, compared with £41-3 million in i960. The value of
deliveries of other broad categories was: optical instruments, £10-2 million;
electric, electronic, and nucleonic instruments, £26-7 million; and nautical
and aeronautical instruments, £26-9 million. The total deliveries for 1966
amounted to £185-7 million.
Export deliveries of scientific instruments have been rising markedly,
amounting to £52-8 million in 1966, compared with £27-9 million in i960.
The Scientific Instrument Research Association conducts research on behalf
of the industry.
Deliveries of photographic equipment in 1966 totalled £98 million, including
£38-8 million for export. The main products in 1966 were: film (other than
cinematograph film), £30-2 million; sensitised paper and cloth, £20-4 million;
and cinematograph film, £12-9 million. Deliveries of photographic cameras
were valued at £2-9 million.
The present industry is largely a post-war development. It employs 15,000
people, the great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories are
located on new industrial estates in the older industrial areas, particularly in
Scotland. Sales in 1966 included clocks (£7-4 million), watches (£5-3 million)
and time switches (£7-6 million); export sales were valued at £4 million.

Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are nearly 4,000 enterprises, employing 252,000 people, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components, to conduct research and development
work, and to undertake general sub-contracting and repair work. (Some enter¬
prises are included because the mixed character of their work makes it
impossible to classify them under any single industry.) They include some
very large undertakings: several with more than 5,000 employees. Ball and
roller bearings, and chains, are important products; exports of the former
were valued at ^14-1 million in 1966, and exports of chains at £6-i million.
The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and
installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, including all types of
generating, transmission and distribution equipment; motors; telecommunica¬
tions apparatus; domestic appliances; and specialised laboratory and
electronic equipment. Annual output rose in volume by nearly three-fifths
between 1958 and 1966, and the total value of production in 1966 was estimated
at about £1,900 million.
Exports of electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances in 1966 were
valued at £346 million. Products are exported to all parts of the world; in 1966,
South Africa (£26-5 million), Australia (£25-3 million), the United States
(£20-9 million), the Netherlands (£15-2 million), New Zealand (£14-7
million), Canada (£14-4 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany
(£14-2 million) were the main markets.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of 920,000. The leading
organisation is the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers’ Association
while scientific and technological research on behalf of the industry as a whole
is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experi¬
ments of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity
as a source of cheap and abundant power. Sir Charles Parsons produced and
patented the first turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating
sets of today. The industry is providing the plant required for the large-scale
expansion programme of the electricity authorities in Britain and has built
all types of equipment for overseas countries.
In 1966 deliveries of electrical machinery were valued at £455-1 million,
comprising £156-9 million worth of rotating electrical machinery (motors,
generators and rotary converters), £68-3 million worth of transformers for
lighting, heating and power, £198-2 million worth of switchgear and control
gear and £31-7 million worth of other electrical machinery.
Exports of generators, motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers
amounted to £51-4 million in 1966, the main purchasers being South Africa
(£6-8 million) and Australia (£6-8 million). Switchgear, starting and control
gear exports were valued at £36 million.
Over 600 firms manufacture electrical machinery, including several with
over 7,500 employees. The total labour force numbers 236,000. Manufacture
takes place in many areas; among the most important are Manchester, Rugby,
Tyneside, Stafford and Larne (Northern Ireland).
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
British industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of

radar, the first public transmission television service, and the ‘printed circuit’,
which has led to far-reaching changes in methods of production in the radio
industry. The industry employs 306,000 people.
1 he consumer goods sector of the industry is concerned with the manufacture
of radio and television sets and radiograms. The industry is dominated by
several large firms. Output of television sets in 1966 fell to 1-4 million,
while the total value of sales was ^55 million, almost all in the home market.
Sales of radios and radiograms, numbered i-6 million in 1966 and were
worth £19 million. The industry is equipped to meet demand for colour
television sets with the introduction of colour transmission towards the end
of 1967.
1 he total value of deliveries of electronic apparatus in 1966 was £315 million,
including £83 million for export. Indirect exports of equipment incorporated
in other products, such as ships, aircraft and machinery, are also considerable.
The largest sectors of the industry, by value of deliveries, in 1966 were radar
and navigational aid equipment (of which 36 per cent of the deliveries of
£77 million was for export) and electronic computers (^61 million). Other
important sectors include electronic control equipment (^54 million), radio
communications equipment (£42 million) and electronic measuring and
testing equipment (^31 million).
Britain has the largest indigenous computer industry outside the United
States and has supplied over 1,000 installations in the United Kingdom.
One British company has supplied half the world’s radar-fitted merchant
ships, and many of the world’s airports outside the American continent use
British radar and navigational aids. The development of all-weather landing
techniques for aircraft has made notable advances in recent years.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telegraph and telephone networks and for many other purposes; its pro¬
ducts include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of
materials. It is supplying the high voltage cable to carry the rapidly expanding
output of electric power in Britain (see p. 276). The value of deliveries in
1966 was ^254-8 million, 16 per cent more than in 1965. Exports of electric
cables, wires, etc., were worth ^34-9 million; the main purchasers were
Hong Kong and New Zealand.
The industry has a labour force of 67,000 persons and includes three firms
with over 5,000 employees.
Britain is one of the largest exporters of telegraph and telephone equipment.
Shipments overseas had a value of £30-2 million in 1966. Research and
development work is done by firms in the industry in co-operation with the
Post Office; in future all new small- and medium-sized exchanges installed in
Britain will be electronic (see p. 371). The industry, employing 96,000
persons, is organised for large-scale operations, and includes several very
large firms.
Deliveries of other electrical goods in 1966 included: domestic electrical
appliances, £159-2 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles
and aircraft, £89-9 million; batteries and accumulators, £56-8 million;
electric lamps, £34-9 million; and other electrical goods, £140 million. By
number, deliveries included: 1-5 million electric blankets, 1-5 million vacuum
cleaners, 0-7 million domestic washing machines and 2-4 million electric

irons. In 1966 exports of domestic electrical equipment were valued at £28-5
million, including washing machines and parts (£7 million), refrigerators
(£,3‘7 million) and vacuum cleaners (£5-2 million); the main markets were
the Federal Republic of Germany (^2-6 million), the Irish Republic and
Australia. Exports of batteries and accumulators in 1966 were valued at
^14-4 million. The industry has a labour force of 215,000.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft provide a significant
contribution to exports; exports of transport equipment in 1966 had a value of
£792 million, accounting for nearly 16 per cent of total exports. The labour
force numbers 1,084,000 and includes: 500,000 in motor vehicle manufacture,
255,000 in aircraft construction and repairing, 219,000 in shipbuilding and
marine engineering, 78,000 in the manufacture of locomotives and railway
wagons and carriages, 26,000 in cycle and motor cycle manufacturing, and
5,000 in the making of perambulators and hand trucks.
Motor Vehicles
Cars
Commercial
Vehicles
Accessories,
Parts, etc.
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises
the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles. In the last few years
development schemes costing over £200 million have been completed and,
whereas the industry was at one time located mainly in the Midlands and
London areas, manufacturing and assembly plants are in operation on Mersey¬
side, in Wales and in Scotland.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the five largest firms
(British Motor Holdings, Ford, Rootes, Leyland Motor Corporation and
Vauxhall), who account for over 95 per cent of complete vehicle production;
the balance is in the hands of smaller, specialist producers of heavy commercial
vehicles, omnibuses, coaches, limousines and sports cars. The principal trade
association is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT),
which holds a motor show annually in London and a Commercial Motor
Exhibition every two years. The Motor Industry Research Association
carries out collective research on vehicles and components.
Car output in 1966 totalled i-6 million units, compared with 1-72 million
units in 1965. Exports in 1966 amounted to 553,000 cars with a value of
£233-9 million. The United States (£50-3 million) was again the largest single
purchaser; South Africa (£17-2 million), Canada, New Zealand and Australia
were the other main markets. About one-fifth of all exports went to EFTA
member countries and one-seventh to the EEC.
Production of commercial vehicles, including chassis, increased from 146,000
in 1946 to 439,000 in 1966. Exports in 1966 of new commercial vehicles
numbered 162,000 with a record total value of £142-1 million. South Africa
(£14-5 million), Australia (£13-3 million), New Zealand (£7-3 million)
and EFTA countries (£23 million) were the main markets for goods vehicles.
Since 1961 Britain has been the world’s largest exporter of commercial
vehicles.
Exports of parts and accessories for cars and commercial vehicles in 1966 had
a value of £142 million; engines and parts for motor vehicles were valued at a
further £58-7 million. Caravan and trailer exports totalled £9-4 million.
Cycles and
Motor Cycles
Cycles
Deliveries of bicycles have declined in recent years, the total in 1966
amounting to 1 -4 million. About 75 per cent of British manufacturing capacity
is in the hands of a single group of companies, and output is concentrated
in the Nottingham area. About 750,000 cycles worth £7-2 million were sent

overseas in 1966; the United States {fz million) was much the largest single
market. A small-wheel bicycle, developed in Britain, is the first major technical
change in the bicycle for 60 years.
Deliveries of all types of motor cycle amounted to 105,000 in 1966, slightly less
than in previous years. The total included 15,000 mopeds, 2,000 motor scooters
and 10,000 three-wheeled vehicles. Manufacture of motor cycles is dominated
by two large groups. Exports of motor cycles and parts totalled £15-3 million
in 1966, 50 per cent more than in 1965. The United States continues to be by
far the biggest market.
The British Railways Board has its own workshops which supply British
Railways and certain other users in Britain; private firms build locomotives,
carriages and wagons for British Railways, for industrial users and for
export.
Deliveries in 1966 included 163 electric locomotives, of which 100 were for
export, 304 diesel and diesel-electric locomotives, 471 coaching vehicles and
2,595 wagons. Deliveries of locomotives by private firms in 1966 were valued
at £15-9 million. The total value of exports of railway vehicles and parts in
1966 was £15-8 million; Nigeria (^1-7 million), South Africa and Kenya
were the largest purchasers.
Almost all the aircraft produced by the British industry today are based on
civil and military applications of the gas-turbine aero-engine, first developed
by Sir Frank Whittle. Turbo-prop aircraft in current production and operation
include the Argosy and Herald and the Hawker Siddeley J48 of which 162
have been sold or are on order. Two of a second generation of jet airliners,
the medium-haul Trident and the longer-haul Vickers VC 10, entered airline
service in 1964, followed in 1965 by a third, the BAG One-Eleven, the world’s
first jet transport designed to operate economically on short-haul routes.
Other civil aircraft in production include the HS 125 executive jet, the
Skyvan light transport aircraft, the Beagle range of light aircraft, using
piston and turbo-prop engines, the Handley Page Jetstream business airliner
seating up to 18 passengers, and the Islander, an economical feeder-line
aircraft. The Concord, the world’s first supersonic airliner, is being developed
jointly by Britain and France; the first prototype is expected to fly in
February 1968.
The industry produces a wide range of military aircraft. It is also engaged
on work on rockets, earth satellites and other aerospace requirements,
including the Blue Streak and Black Arrow satellite launchers. Hovercraft,
a new type of transport vehicle invented in Britain, are being increasingly
used throughout the world.
In 1966 the value of annual exports of the aerospace industry exceeded
£200 million for the first time. Exports of new aircraft and parts in 1966
(excluding electrical equipment) had a value of £130 million, compared with
jjfSo-q million in 1965. Leading buyers included the United States (^52-3
million) and South Africa (^14-5 million). In addition, exports of instruments
were worth ^4-1 million, and tyres £i-z million.
The construction of aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufac¬
turers (which are negotiating a merger) and one helicopter concern, though
there are a few important smaller companies outside these groups. Besides
extensive research work by the industry, research on a substantial scale on
problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by the Government,
chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine
300 * BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Establishment, both at Farnborough, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment
at Bedford.
The British aerospace industry has over 50 collaboration agreements with
overseas governments and companies.
Aero-Engines Aero-engines and parts provided some £740 million in export earnings from
1946 to 1966. In 1966 exports of new and used engines and parts totalled
£71 million; major customers were the United States (£14-5 million), France
(j£8-9 million) and Canada (^8-5 million). Thirteen different British jet
engines power over 30 types of aircraft currently in production overseas.
Nearly half of the world total of jet and turbo-prop airliners on order or in
service have British power plants. Famous engines in production include the
economical Dart and Tyne turbo-props, the Avon, Conway, Viper and Spey
turbo-jets and the revolutionary Pegasus lift-thrust engine for vertical take-off
and landing (VTOL) aircraft. The power plant for the Concord will be a
further development of the Olympus.
One company is responsible for almost all aero-engine production.
Shipbuilding
and Marine
Engineering
The building of large ocean-going vessels is concentrated in four main
areas: the river Clyde in Scotland, the north-east and north-west coasts of
England and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Numerous yards around the coast
build smaller vessels such as fishing vessels, yachts, harbour craft and
barges.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association with its headquarters in
London and a research station on the river Tyne.
Following the Geddes Committee’s report on the competitive position of
the industry in 1965, the Government set up the Shipbuilding Industry
Board in 1966. It will supervise the reorganisation of the industry into larger
groups and the rationalisation of facilities. One of the Board’s functions will
be to administer Government grants and loans to shipbuilders and ship¬
owners.
Merchant A gradual fall in tonnage launched from the 1955 peak of 1 - 5 million tons was
Shipbuilding halted in 1964, and launchings in 1966 were about at the same level as in 1965
totalling 1-08 million gross tons. British launchings were the fourth largest
in the world in 1966 accounting for 7-6 per cent of the world total,
compared with 8-8 per cent in 1965. Twelve oil tankers, totalling 244,000
gross tons, were launched in 1966. Launchings also included bulk carriers
totalling 350,000 gross tons and 18 cargo ships between 10,000 and 13,500
gross tons. At the end of 1966 orders on hand of merchant vessels of 100 gross
tons and over were 254, totalling 2-3 million gross tons and valued at £267
million. Of these vessels, 82 (1-2 million gross tons) were for export.
Modernisation in British shipyards over the last few years has involved
the replanning of yards, the erection of large prefabrication shops for welding
massive sections under cover, the installation of heavy-lift travelling cranes,
and much other reconstruction.
Ship Repairing There are many specialist ship-repairing establishments and most of the
larger shipbuilding firms also carry out repair work; about one-quarter of
ship-repairing activity is concentrated on the north-east coast of England.
Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the large ports.
Marine Engineering Many of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain or have closely associated
engine building works, building various types of marine slow-speed diesel

engines, usually under licence. One firm designs large low-speed diesel engines
and there are two independent builders of these engines. Steam turbines of
the highest powers are also built.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not already described
consists of a large number of companies with a total labour force of 601,000
in 1966; the main groups were tools and implements (25,000 persons), cutlery
(14,000), bolts, nuts and screws (46,000), wire and wire manufactures (45,000),
cans and metal boxes (39,000), jewellery, plate, and refining of precious
metals (28,000), and other metal industries (405,000). The total value of
exports in 1966 was about £155 million.
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred mainly in the city of
Sheffield and the industry’s reputation has been built up on the skill of its
craftsmen. Mass-production methods are, however, extensively used except
in the case of some of the highest quality wares, although firms remain
mainly small. The value of sales of cutlery and flatware in 1966 was £15-5
million, including export sales of .£3-8 million.
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, South
Wales and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as
saucepans, buckets and dustbins, mainly from aluminium and wrought steel.
The value of sales in 1966 was £23-4 million, of which £3-1 million were
sales for export.
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries, covering
the manufacture of such tools as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades;
Sheffield, Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important
centres. The value of sales of implements and tools, other than machine tools
and portable power tools, was £41-5 million in 1966, of which £12 million
worth were exported; the totals included sales of hand tools, at home and for
export, valued at £25-8 million and £11-5 million respectively.
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a long tradition.
Most of the firms in the industry are small. The law requires that gold and
silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked at one of the Assay
Offices situated in London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh. The
Birmingham office, located in the main centre of the jewellery industry, is by
far the most important. The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and
silversmiths’ wares and electro-plated nickel silver wares in 1966 was £27-6
million, of which £4-2 million was for export.
The chemicals industry, with a labour force of 479,000, comprises the
manufacture of: chemicals and dyes (227,000 employees), pharmaceutical
and toilet preparations (80,000 employees), explosives and fireworks (31,000
employees), paint and printing ink (48,000 employees), oils, fats, soap and
detergents (39,000 employees), synthetic resins and plastics (39,000 em¬
ployees), polishes and gelatine (14,500 employees), and fertilisers (10,000
employees). The industry is capital intensive; the fixed capital expenditure of
the industry, excluding mineral oil refining, amounted to over £1,100 million
during the six years 1961-66 and totalled £254 million in 1966. The value of
exports in 1966 was £469 million, or 9-3 per cent of total British exports.

Production in the general chemicals industries rose by 67 per cent between
1958 and 1966.
The inorganic chemicals industry dates back to the middle of the nineteenth
century; over half the output of this sector consists of a limited number
of relatively simple chemicals, such as sulphuric acid, caustic soda, chlorine
and ammonia, produced in very large quantities and serving as basic materials
for industry. Sulphuric acid has the largest production of any chemical and
3-1 million tons was produced in 1966. The remaining output of this sector
consists of a very wide range of chemicals of varying complexity. Almost all
inorganic chemicals are consumed in other manufacturing processes and
substantial quantities are used in the manufacture of such products as
fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals. Exports are important; about
one-quarter of output is estimated to be exported directly.
Production of organic chemicals (which include coal-tar chemicals) rose
by 146 per cent between 1958 and 1966. To an increasing extent petroleum is
the raw material used and it is estimated that in 1966 petroleum-based
chemicals accounted for 75 per cent of the total output of organic chemicals;
deliveries of feedstock for the petroleum chemical plants totalled 3-6 million
tons in 1966 compared with i-i million tons in 1959. The most important
products (by weight) in 1966 were ethylene (571,000 tons) and propylene
(311,000 tons). The main outlets for organic chemicals are plastics materials,
solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and detergents. Consumption of
dyestuffs is geared to demand by the textile industry; about 32,800 tons of
synthetic dyestuffs were produced in 1966.
Exports of chemical elements and compounds amounted to £110-8 million
in 1966. Exports go to a large number of countries including, in 1966, the
Netherlands (£12-7 million), the United States (£8-4 million), Australia
(£6 million), France, South Africa, Canada and Sweden.
The first plastic, Parkesine (later called Celluloid), was produced and
patented in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; other British discoveries
include polyethylene. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing
sections of the economy. Output of synthetic resins has more than doubled
since 1959 and total production in 1966 was 1,001,000 tons (an increase of
6 per cent over 1965), of which 685,000 tons consisted of thermoplastic resins.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—
notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PYC and used for a
wide range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene
(a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods). One of the newer thermoplastic materials is polypropylene,
a versatile material which can be fabricated as mouldings, films and fibres.
Rapid expansion of capacity for all the main types of plastics materials is
planned. Exports of plastics materials in 1966 amounted to 372,000 tons,
valued at £89 million. The main purchasers were Australia (£10-6 million),
the Netherlands (£6 million), South Africa (£5-3 million) and Sweden (£5-2
million).
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a com¬
mercial scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 1958. High styrene
rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil
resistance is required, are now in large-scale production, and neoprene rubber

is manufactured in Northern Ireland. Production in 1966 amounted to 191,000
tons, much of which came from the styrene-butadiene plant at Hythe, near
Southampton. Exports of synthetic rubber and latex totalled 58,000 tons
in 1966.
The development of artificial fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
the British scientists Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert. Two firms
predominate in the production of fertilisers and there are a large number of
firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. To encourage use, sales on the home
market are assisted by government subsidies paid to the farmer (see p. 327).
Output of nitrogenous fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen content) has been
increasing and in 1965-66 totalled 655,000 tons, while 420,000 tons (in terms
of phosphate content) of phosphatic fertilisers were produced; production
of compound fertilisers amounted to 2-7 million tons in 1965-66. The use of
ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen), ammonium phosphate, and, to a
limited extent, urea (mostly 45 per cent nitrogen) is resulting in more con¬
centrated fertilisers. The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, mainly
nitrogenous, was £7-9 million in 1966.
Sales of paint and varnish during 1966 amounted to nearly 92 million gallons
(including 13 million gallons of emulsion paint) valued at ^135-5 million.
Britain is the largest exporter of paints in the world; exports of pigments,
paints, varnishes and related materials in 1966 amounted to £32-7 million. The
industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form of surface coatings
for finished goods is also considerable.
In recent years many improved techniques have been introduced, in
particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments;
quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application have been
developed.
The whole range of drugs is produced in the United Kingdom, including
sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics,
vaccines, sera and naturally occurring drugs. Research expenditure totalled
j£ii-6 million in 1965.
Notable British contributions to the development of new products include:
the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming and its evaluation by Sir
Howard Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693)
by Sir Lionel Whitby; the introduction of the anti-malarial drug proguanil;
the discovery of griseofulvin; and, more recently, the isolation of the penicillin
nucleus and the development of several semi-synthetic penicillins and the
cephalosporin antibiotics. Several of the larger pharmaceutical companies in
Britain are subsidiaries of overseas firms.
In 1966 exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products rose by 10 per
cent to the record level of £73-i million, of which j£i6-i million worth were
antibiotics. The largest purchasers were the Irish Republic (^4-4 million),
Australia (^3-9 million), France (£3-5 million) and Nigeria (£3-4 million).
Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective weed¬
killer, MCPA, and more recently Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide
based on paraquat. Sales of pesticides and allied products were valued at
£26-5 million in 1966, 17 per cent higher than in 1965; herbicides (£14-8

million) were the largest single category. Exports of insecticides, fungicides
and weedkillers in 1966 totalled £13-5 million, a third more than in 1965.
Sales of toilet preparations were valued at £105 million in 1966, including
export sales of about ^13 million; home market sales of hair preparations
totalled about £30 million. Petroleum is the source of the principal raw
material used in the manufacture of organic surface-active agents in deter¬
gents ; the other main constituent, polyphosphates, is derived from inorganic
sources. Sales of synthetic detergents amounted to 365,000 tons in 1966,
including 61,000 tons for export. Deliveries of soap totalled some 339,000 tons;
two companies supply about 90 per cent of home sales. Sales of polishes in
1966 were valued at ^18-5 million, including floor and furniture polishes
worth j£8-5 million. Exports of essential oils, perfumery and toilet prepara¬
tions, soap and cleaning and polishing preparations were valued at ^40-1
million in 1966.
The textile industries in 1966 had a labour force of 816,000 persons, including
51,000 employees engaged in the production of man-made fibres: 109,000
were employed in the spinning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made
fibres, 103,000 in the weaving of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 176,500
in the woollen and worsted trades, 136,000 in hosiery and knitted goods,
71,000 in textile finishing and 43,000 in carpets. Over half the employees are
women. The total value of textile exports in 1966 was £261 million, somewhat
less than in 1965. Production of textiles rose by 17 per cent between 1958 and
1966. Considerable reorganisation is taking place within the textile industry,
connected with the increasing use of man-made fibres. Several large multi¬
fibre, multi-process groups have been formed under the leadership of
manufacturers of man-made fibres.
The Textile Council for the Man-made Fibres, Cotton and Silk Industries
was established in January 1967, superseding the Cotton Board. It is a
development council, that is, a statutory body with constitution and powers
laid down under an Act of Parliament, and is financed by a levy on the
industry.
Scientific and technical research for the industry is carried out by the
Cotton, Silk and Man-made Fibres Research Association.
Cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods industry and cotton piece-goods
its largest export during the nineteenth century. Increasing foreign competi¬
tion and the tendency of many countries to set up their own textile industry
have cut progressively into British markets and a global limit has been placed
on imports of cotton goods from low-cost countries during 1966-70.
Output in 1966 consisted of: 456 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 136 million
lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 233 million lb. of
doubled yarn, 62 million lb. of textured yarn, 915 million linear yards of
woven cotton cloth, and 619 million linear yards of man-made fibre and
mixture cloth. In 1966 exports of cotton yarn and woven fabrics (excluding
man-made fibres) amounted in value to £37-1 million, including woven
fabrics worth £26-6 million, for which the Irish Republic and South Africa
were the most important markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county
being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Manchester is the commercial centre and Liverpool is the chief port of entry
for raw cotton. Legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry was

introduced in 1959. Exchequer funds have paid for two-thirds of the cost of
removing surplus capacity, and also provided grants of about one-quarter
towards the cost of approved re-equipment and modernisation schemes.
The wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the most ancient of
Britain’s staple industries and has been important since medieval times. There
are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While the West Riding of
Yorkshire is by far the most important producing area, Scotland and the West
of England remain famous as specialised producers of high-quality woollen
cloth. In recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibre has been
blended with wool.
In 1966 output included 230 million lb. of wool and hair tops and 315
million lb. of woollen yarn. Production of worsted yarn amounted to 221
million lb. and of woven fabrics to 302 million square yards. In addition,
large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain. Consumption
of raw wool in 1966 was 388 million lb., compared with 518 million lb. in 1959.
Exports in 1966 included wool yarns (^20-1 million), woollen fabrics (^38-5
million) and wool worsted fabrics (^23-1 million). The main buyers of woollen
fabrics were the United States (^4-7 million), the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many and Canada. Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain) and other animal
hair and tops exported had a value of £56-4 million. Research is carried on
mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association. The National Wool
Textile Export Corporation is responsible for assistance to exporters and the
development of new markets.
The small or medium-sized business predominates in the industry and there
are only a few large firms.
Man-made fibres produced from cellulose were first made commercially
available in the United Kingdom in 1905, and much of the early development
of viscose rayon and acetate took place in Britain. Large quantities of chemicals
are consumed in their production, which is spread throughout the country;
Northern Ireland is of growing importance. Large firms predominate in the
industry. There has been a rapid expansion of output in recent years, the
1966 record total of 881 million lb. being 2 per cent higher than in 1965 and
23 per cent more than in 1963. Output consisted of 470 million lb. of staple
fibre and 411 million lb. of filament yarn in 1966. Of the staple fibre, 174
million lb., and of the continuous filament, 211 million lb., were of fully
synthetic materials.
Two main types of man-made fibres are manufactured: those made from
cellulose (such as rayon) and those produced by fully synthetic processes from
chemical substances (such as nylon). Viscose rayon is still the most widely
used of all man-made fibres and output in 1966 totalled 401-4 million lb.
It can be modified to produce a wide range of different fibres, such as Vincel,
a competitor to cotton, and Evlan, specifically developed for the carpet
industry. The world’s largest rayon staple factory is at Greenfield (North
Wales), with an annual output of 200 million lb., while other large rayon
plants are at Grimsby, Preston and Wolverhampton. Almost all the rayon
produced in Britain is made by a single company and its subsidiaries.
Triacetate {Tried), a stronger form of acetate, was first produced in Britain
in 1955-
Production of nylon, the first fully synthetic fibre, in the form of nylon 66,
started in Britain in 1941; another type of nylon (nylon 6) has been manu¬
factured since 1963. Total productive capacity of nylon is planned to reach

about 390 million lb. a year by the end of 1967 compared with about 160
million lb. in 1964. Nylon is used extensively in the manufacture of clothing,
fabrics and stockings, and has many industrial uses.
Terylene, a polyester fibre, was invented in Britain during the second
world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to blending with
wool. Annual manufacturing capacity totals about 100 million lb. A group
of fibres of growing importance are the acrylic fibres: Courtelle (a British
discovery) and Acrilan are examples. Synthetic elastomerics or spandex
fibres, which are man-made textile fibres having inherent properties of stretch
and recovery, are now produced commercially. Polythene {Courlene) and
polypropylene (Ulstron) fibres have been developed mainly for industrial uses.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns had a value of ^38-1 million in 1966,
and woven fabrics £16-5 million. Sweden, the Netherlands and South Africa
were the most important purchasers of yarns.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small-scale
enterprises. The industry is widely distributed, with Scotland and the east
Midlands as the two most important centres. Sales of knitted goods were
valued at £325-7 million in 1966 including £131-7 million worth of outerwear
and £76 million worth of socks and stockings. Exports of knitted clothing
and accessories were valued at £17-6 million in 1966; the largest buyers were
the United States, Switzerland and Canada. Exports of knitted fabrics
amounted to £5-9 million. The British Hosiery and Knitwear Export Group
co-ordinates the export activities of the industry and organises overseas
missions. The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, with
laboratories at Nottingham, undertakes collective research.
The linen industry is concentrated in Northern Ireland (the greatest linen¬
manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in Scotland.
Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on yarns
and the lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely of
coarse linens and canvas, although household types are also produced.
Northern Ireland manufacturers produced 46-9 million linear yards of cloth
in 1966, while weavers in Great Britain delivered 27-7 million square yards,
including 16-9 million square yards of sailcloth and canvas. Exports in 1966
included £8 million worth of linen fabrics and £3-1 million worth of flax
yarns and linen thread.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area—the centre of the
world’s oldest jute industry—and 17,000 people are employed in all. Jute is
used in the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and woven into fabrics for
a wide range of uses in the packaging, carpet, upholstery, building and motor
car industries. Research is being undertaken into new uses, for example,
plastics reinforcement. In 1966, 121,000 tons of raw jute were used, and
exports of jute fabric and yarn totalled £2-2 million.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to £19-4 million in 1966. The most
important lace product is from the warp knitting machines, with sales valued
at £io-6 million. Sales of lace products for export were worth £4-9 million
in 1966.
In addition to the products mentioned specifically in this section, British
textile firms manufacture a wide range of other goods, including many special
yarns and fabrics, net, household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and

curtains, and floor coverings other than carpets. Sales of narrow fabrics
(including elastic machinery belting and ribbon) totalled £42-6 million in
1966, including export sales of ^6-2 million. Sales of floor coverings of
linoleum, vinyl and other synthetic materials were valued at ^37-3 million
in 1966; just under one-fifth were for export. The British cordage industry is
the largest in Europe. Exports of ropes, cordage, nets and netting in 1966
were valued at £4-4 million.
In 1966 total sales of all types of carpets and rugs amounted to 112-7 million
square yards, valued at ^161-4 million. Exports in 1966 had a value of £13
million; Australia (£2-8 million) was the largest single market.
There are over 100 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of carpets,
including several large firms. In addition to the manufacture of woven carpets
such as Axminster and Wilton, over one-third of total sales by quantity in
1966 were of tufted carpets, a form of carpeting in which the pile, usually
containing a high proportion of artificial fibres, is inserted into a pre-woven
backing. Axminster-type carpets account for about 40 per cent of the value of
exports. The principal manufacturing centres include Kidderminster (in
Worcestershire), Halifax and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire),
Durham (in north-east England), Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland) and
several towns in Northern Ireland. About a third of the carpets produced (by
quantity) are made predominantly of wool and a growing proportion of
traditional woven carpets contain some man-made fibre.
There are 615,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear industries.
Some 446,000 are in the clothing industry, 109,000 in the footwear trade and
61,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture. The aggregate value of
their exports in 1966 was ^102-3 million.
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total deliveries
of made-up clothing have increased by 33 per cent since 1958. Consumer’s
expenditure on clothing in 1966 totalled £1,725 million. Exports in 1966,
including knitted goods, were valued at £52-7 million; the United States
(£10-i million) was the main purchaser. Exports of women’s outerwear rose
sharply in 1966. Substantial quantities of clothing are also sent by parcel post.
Although there are some large firms employing mass-production methods
on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. The principal manufacturing
centres are London, Leeds and Manchester, but several firms are also situated
on industrial trading estates throughout the country. Fashion is important in
the production of haute couture models and throughout the ready-to-wear
industry, and British designers are making an increasing impact abroad.
The Clothing Export Council, representing over 150 companies, organises
promotions for various sectors of the industry.
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1966, 14,900 tons of
sole and other heavy leather and 448 million square feet of upper, lining and
other light leathers were produced. Britain is one of the world’s leading
exporters with exports in 1966 valued at £23-8 million. The United States is
the largest single market (£4-9 million in 1966), followed by Canada (£2-5
million) and Italy.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging from

the heavy types for industrial uses, such as machinery belting, to high quality
leather for footwear, leather goods, gloves and clothing. The British Leather
Manufacturers’ Research Association is the foremost of its type in the world.
The British footwear industry is the third largest in the world. In 1966
manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 194 million pairs. Exports of all
types had a value of j£i6-6 million; the United States (£3-9 million), Canada
and the Soviet Union were the largest markets.
Factories are located throughout Britain. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region
of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on women’s and girls’
shoes. The Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide
reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ 849,000 persons in the
production of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports
in 1966 was £297 million. Exports of alcoholic and other beverages accounted
for ^136-8 million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £21-6 million;
cereal and cereal preparations for £41-6 million; fruit and vegetables for
£15-3 million; and coffee, cocoa, tea and spices for ^13-4 million.
The household consumption of bread, which has been falling, averaged about
2 lb. 7 oz. per week in 1966. In England and Wales particularly, the small
‘family’ type of baker, producing bread with some mechanical aids, is still
found, but the trend towards concentrating production in large mechanical
bakeries has become more pronounced; well over two-thirds of the bread is
made in these bakeries, which specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves; 4 groups
have a dominant position. In the smaller bakeries production of cake and other
flour confectionery is usually allied to bread production. There are 162,000
employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry; a further 43,000 are
employed in grain-milling.
There are 51,000 employees producing biscuits, and annual output has been
over 570,000 tons in recent years. Weekly consumption of cakes and biscuits
per head in Britain was 12-2 oz. in 1966. British biscuits have gained a world¬
wide reputation, and despite the problem of import restrictions in several
overseas markets, exports in 1966 were valued at £7-6 million.
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has 92,000 employees,
is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and many medium¬
sized and small firms. The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar,
cocoa beans, glucose, milk, nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and
sugar confectionery was 664,000 tons in 1966. Consumption of chocolate and
sugar confectionery in the United Kingdom is far higher than in any other
country, being equivalent to 7-8 oz. per head per week.
The value of exports in 1966 of cocoa preparations (including chocolate)
was ^10-9 million and of sugar confectionery, £12 million. The United
States and Canada were the main markets for cocoa preparations. Over 30 per
cent of total world exports of chocolate and sugar confectionery come from
Britain, the world’s largest exporter of these products.
Among the fruit and vegetable products manufactured are jam, marmalade,
sauces and vinegar. The labour force numbers 73,000. Output of jams and
marmalade, which fell from 329,000 tons in 1949 to about 215,000 tons in

berry, raspberry and blackcurrant jams are the most popular. Exports of
jams and marmalade in 1966 were valued at ^1-9 million.
In 1966, 708,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British
Navy was using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry
did not take place until after 1935. Processed and fresh peas (281,000 tons)
and beans in tomato sauce (272,000 tons) are the vegetables most in demand
as canned products. In addition, output in 1966 included 97,000 tons of
canned and bottled fruit, and 298,000 tons of canned soup. Strawberries are
the most important single fruit used for canning, followed by rhubarb and
apples. Sales of prepared fruit pie fillings are increasing.
Sales of frozen foods are rising in Britain, and nearly 98,000 tons of vegetables
and 1,300 tons of fruit were preserved by this method in 1966; peas accounted
for 63 per cent of all quick-frozen vegetables. Sales of dehydrated products,
including accelerated freeze dried foods, are increasing.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and
preserving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers 88,000. Output
of canned meat and meat products in 1966 rose to 102,500 tons, but the
quantity of bacon and ham cured fell to 205,000 tons. There has been a rapid
expansion of quick-frozen fish output, and some 78,000 tons were produced
in 1966; small quantities (8,000 tons in 1966) are also canned. Exports of fish
and fish preparations had a value of £9-9 million in 1966 and those of meat
and meat products were worth £12-8 million.
The industries producing beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks have a
labour force of 166,000. Exports were valued at £136-8 million in 1966,
11 per cent more than in 1965.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) reached the record level
of 41-6 million proof gallons with a value of £120-4 million in 1966; over half
went to the United States (£62-4 million or 22-7 million proof gallons).
Scotch whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century. It is blended from
20 or more different types, some from malted barley and some from other
grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 134-5 million proof
gallons (a record) of Scotch whisky produced in the 1966 distilling year will
not be on sale for some years. Stocks of whisky amount to nearly 600 million
proof gallons, representing ten years’ consumption. About four-fifths of
annual sales are to overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s.
The main distillers are in London and one company accounts for a large
proportion of total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own
distilleries abroad, exports had a value of £9 million in 1966.
There are 99,000 employees in the brewing and malting industry. In recent
years there has been a strong tendency towards the creation of larger brewery
units, partly to secure wide distributive outlets for the products of the large
brewing groups, many of which market beer throughout the country. In 1966,
30-2 million bulk barrels of beer were produced, the highest for some years,
and consumers’ expenditure on beer amounted to £887 million. Exports in
1966 of malt beer were 329,000 bulk barrels, worth £2-9 million. Firms are
experimenting with new methods, including continuous brewing processes,
and automated batch production plants are well established.

The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers, and malt extract manufacturers.
British malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1966
amounted to 40,000 tons, worth £2 million.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade although
sales are liable to be affected by the weather. Output in 1966 included 55
million gallons of concentrated liquid, and 243 million gallons of unconcen¬
trated drinks. Though there has been some amalgamation in recent years,
there are still several hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are two
very large firms among the 20 or so producing widely advertised brands which
are marketed on a national scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by
firms in the production of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based
drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted
drinks (in which the whole fruit is used). Sales of canned carbonated drinks
are increasing rapidly.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other
tobacco goods sold in Britain. In 1966 consumers’ expenditure on these
goods amounted to ^1,504 million (of which about 69 per cent was tax
revenue) and, in addition, exports worth £21-9 million (of which cigarettes
accounted for 89 per cent) were shipped to a large number of overseas
markets; Kuwait, Aden and Hong Kong were the most important. The main
centres of production are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Man¬
chester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two biggest
manufacturing groups account for a large proportion of total output. The
industry has 50,000 employees.
The tobacco industry used 301 million lb. of unmanufactured tobacco
in 1966 (1 per cent more than in 1965), all of which was imported. In 1966
the main sources were the United States, Canada and India. Total consump¬
tion of tobacco in Britain in 1966 amounted to 257-2 million lb., including
223-5 million lb. consumed in cigarettes, 29-7 million lb. in pipe and hand
rolling tobacco and 3-3 million lb. in cigars. In 1966, 118,000 million cigarettes
were consumed, 6,000 million more than in the previous year; 61 per cent of
the total were tipped compared with 16 per cent in i960.
This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 356,000, which includes 71,000
in the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 81,000 in the glass industry
and 66,000 in the pottery industry.
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by
the Romans, and manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabri¬
cation to highly mechanised systems. In 1966 about 7,068 million building
bricks were produced in Great Britain, 42 per cent of which were of the
Fletton type, made mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas. Refractory
goods (firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks)
are manufactured mainly for home use. Exports of refractory construction
materials in 1966 were worth ^6-i million.

INDUSTRY
311
Pottery The pottery industry is a long-established and complex industry, largely
located in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Staffordshire. Much of its raw material
is indigenous, such as china clay, ball clay and china stone from Devon
and Cornwall. It supplies nearly all home needs for domestic and industrial
pottery and its exports in 1966 exceeded £27 million and were the highest
ever. The United States and Canada are important markets.
The largest section of the industry, about half, makes domestic pottery,
sub-divided into china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham; the
other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, and
such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics
and laboratory porcelain are also manufactured. Among famous makes of
British pottery are Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton,
Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby. Total sales of domestic
pottery were £43-8 million in 1966 including export sales of ^18 million.
The industry employs 66,000 people, of whom 35,500 are women. There
has been considerable re-equipment; gas or electrically fired kilns have
replaced almost all the coal-fired kilns and new decorating techniques and
automatic and semi-automatic machinery have been introduced.
Glass Britain’s glass industry is the third largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of the
‘float’ glass process, which was developed in Britain and has been licensed
to glass makers throughout the world. Its use for internal decoration and as
a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years.
Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor industry. Other
products include glass bricks, tubular glass (produced on a large scale),
mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres,
and all types of glass containers (often made by fully automatic machinery).
A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality,
much of which is exported.
Direct exports of glass and glassware reached the record value of £26-3
million in 1966. Those of glass were worth ^16-2 million, the most important
markets being the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa. The
figures included ^4 million of float glass.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried out by the Department
of Glass Technology of Sheffield University.
Cement The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824, this material and the methods of its production have been the subject
of continuous technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity
of the industry, which has 18,000 employees, has increased substantially
since the war to meet the growing demands of the building industry and
further expansion is planned. The Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent is an
important producing area. Annual output totalled 16-5 million tons in 1966.
PAPER, PRINTING The paper, printing and publishing industries have 651,000 employees,
AND PUBLISHING inciU(jing 98,000 in the manufacture of paper and board, 68,000 in the pro¬
duction of cardboard boxes and packing cases, 145,000 in the publishing of
newspapers and periodicals and 264,000 in other types of printing and
publishing.

MANUFACTURING
INDUSTRIES
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until
1678, but records show that some paper was produced as far back as 1492.
The British paper and board industry is the largest in Europe. Total
production in 1966 of all types of paper and board maintained the record
level of 4-5 million tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 735,000 tons,
board for 1-3 million tons and other paper for the remainder. Exports of
paper, board and manufactured paper items were valued at £54 million in
1966, over 6 per cent more than in 1965. The main purchasers were the
Irish Republic, Australia and South Africa.
Wood pulp is the main raw material, but large and increasing quantities
of waste paper are also used. A £20 million integrated pulp and paper mill,
the first in Britain, was opened at Fort William, in the Scottish Highlands,
in 1966. Two-thirds of the timber it uses is home-grown.
There are a few very large groups in the industry and many medium-sized
and small firms. The large groups hold considerable interests abroad, includ¬
ing pulp and paper producing mills in the United States, Canada and other
parts of the Commonwealth and Europe. Sales of household paper products,
including facial tissues, have risen sharply. Sales of cardboard boxes and
cartons were valued at ^107-8 million in 1966 while those of fibre board pack¬
ing cases totalled £98-6 million. Sales of manufactured stationery totalled
^89-9 million in 1966. Wallpaper manufacturing is dominated by one firm; a
recent development has been the introduction of plastic and plastic-
coated wall coverings. Research is undertaken by the Paper and Board Industry
Research Association and the Printing and Allied Trades Research
Association.
The printing industry produces an immense range of goods, from national
newspapers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The
industry includes many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have
led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book
publishing sections. Four large firms each employ more than 7,500 persons.
General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains essentially
an industry of small firms.
Publishers’ turnover in 1966 amounted to £120 million, of which export
sales accounted for a record total of £51 million, forming a higher proportion
of output than in any other country. Consumers’ expenditure on books, news¬
papers and magazines totalled £339 million in 1965* Book titles published in
1966 totalled over 28,000, nearly 22,000 of them new ones. Popularity of
paper-backed books has increased rapidly in recent years. According to the
overseas trade returns, exports of printed matter, manuscripts and typescripts
were valued at £51-4 million in 1966, including books (£26-5 million), and
newspapers and periodicals (^7‘4 niillion), but these figures do not include
parcel post shipments, which are possibly as large again as the recorded totals.
The United States and Australia are the most important overseas markets.
The Book Development Council was formed in 1965 to promote the supply
and use of British books overseas. Firms have introduced the latest develop¬
ments in high-speed printing equipment, including electronic engraving
machines and advanced processes of photographic reproduction, and some
newspapers are now set by computer.
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
299,000 employees, rubber manufacture, with 134,000 employees, and a group
of miscellaneous manufactures which together embrace some 211,000

employees, including 95,000 employees engaged in plastics moulding and
fabricating.
Britain’s rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world, dating
from 1819. Macintosh invented waterproof garments, and Dunlop in 1888
devised the pneumatic tyre. Tyres and tubes represent more than half the
total output of the industry but firms also make a great variety of other rubber
manufactures, the most important being rubber footwear, conveyor belting,
cables, hose, and latex foam products.
The British industry is one of the largest in the world. In 1966 its consump¬
tion of rubber totalled 404,000 tons, comprising 181,000 tons of natural
rubber, 191,000 tons of synthetic rubber and 32,000 tons of reclaimed rubber;
the proportion of synthetic rubber used is increasing. In 1966, 212,000 tons
of rubber were used in the production of tyres and tyre products. Tyre
manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United States and other
overseas companies. Tyres and tubes exported were valued at ^26-4 million;
this figure excludes large indirect exports on vehicles. Direct exports of all
rubber manufactures (including tyres) in 1966 were worth -£47-9 million,
with Sweden, Australia, Denmark and the Federal Republic of Germany as
the main markets. In addition, the industry in 1966 exported about ^16-6
million worth of rubber footwear and £17 million of rubber gloves and other
miscellaneous products.
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe,
in Buckinghamshire, is an important centre for domestic furniture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture rose by 23 per cent in volume between
1958 and 1966, and in the latter year their value was £157 million. Exports of
all furniture were worth XI4'9 million in 1966. There are numerous enter¬
prises manufacturing furniture in Britain (including domestic, upholstered,
office, school and other furniture) with a total labour force of 95,600. The
bedding industry employs 16,800 people; sales of new bedding in 1966 were
valued at £33-3 million. Many firms are small but in recent years there has
been a tendency towards concentration.
Scientific research and technical information services are provided by the
Furniture Development Council and the Furniture Industry Research
Association. The Council is concerned with the management problems of the
industry and produces an annual statistical and economic review.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain, and embraces highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units. The value of sales in
1966 was £21-2 million, of which £2-5 million was for export.
The timber industry employs 100,000 people. Britain is mainly dependent
on imported supplies of timber (valued at ^194 million in 1966) but sawmill
output of home-grown timber totalled 21-4 million cubic feet in 1966. Other
products include plywood and chipboard.
The number of people engaged in manufacturing toys and sports equipment
in Britain is 41,000. Sales of toys in 1966 were worth £59-8 million and
exports had a value of £15-5 million. The United States and the Federal
Republic of Germany were the main overseas markets. Current trends are
towards increased production of small-scale precision models of vehicles (over
100 million a year are produced) and toys linked to television characters.
The value of manufacturers’ sales of games was £5-4 million and that of
sports equipment ^17-8 million, of which ^6-7 million was for export.
12 Agriculture, Fisheries
and Forestry
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and
most important industries. It occupies about 800,000 people in Great Britain
or just over 3 per cent of those in civil employment, provides about 3 per
cent of the gross national product, and uses 48 million of the 60 million acres
of land.
In Northern Ireland 2-7 million of the 3-3 million acres of land are in
agricultural use, and the corresponding proportions for employment and
gross output are 13 per cent and 15 per cent.
Land used for farming is conventionally divided into improved land suitable
for cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing, nearly all of which is
hill or mountain land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken,
heather or scrub trees. Rough grazing has a low potential output—usually
assessed at about one-sixth of that of agricultural land—but is valuable for
sheep. In England and Wales only about one-sixth of farming land is classified
as rough grazing. In Northern Ireland the proportion is about one-quarter,
but in Scotland it is about three-quarters. In the United Kingdom as a whole
there are 31 million acres under crops and grass. Improved land and rough
grazing together represent 81 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain
and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available for farming
is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing and industry; however,
the loss is more than outweighed by the increase in output from what remains.
The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west
and north, overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river
valleys are usually fertile, varying in texture from clay to sandy loam, silt
and peat. Clay soils everywhere necessitate under-drainage, and as all are
constantly leached by rainwater, lime has to be applied at regular intervals.
In hill country the area of improved land is often small, but is usually supple¬
mented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
Size and For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size
Ownership from a few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to
of Farms tenants. Social changes of the past half-century have completely changed the
pattern of rural life in England and Scotland. Estate duties have been a
principal factor in the breaking up of estates. Most surviving estates are still
owned by private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, local authorities,
and other corporate bodies hold considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many
have been bought by the tenants already in occupation. About half the farms
in Great Britain today are owner-occupied.
There are about 440,000 agricultural holdings in the United Kingdom,
giving an average size of about no acres. Slightly over half are part-time
holdings, the occupiers generally having another source of livelihood besides

farming. A recent survey has shown that there are about 220,000 full-time
holdings, and about half the industry’s total output comes from the 42,000
holdings classified as large ‘commercial’ farm businesses. A further 66,000
fall within the category of small ‘commercial’ businesses, which are able to
operate as viable enterprises. Of the remaining 112,000 full-time holdings,
farming is in general on too restricted a scale for commercial viability, and
amalgamations are being encouraged.
The average size of full-time holdings in England and Wales is between
M5 and 15° acres of crops and grass. In Scotland the crops and grass area of
the 29,000 farms worked on a part- or spare-time basis averages only 12 acres,
but for the 27,000 full-time farms the average is 147 acres.
In Northern Ireland the land is divided into about 67,000 holdings, almost
all of which are owner-occupied. About 40 per cent of these holdings are
either very small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing), so
that the number of effective farm businesses is about 41,000, of which rather
more than half provide a full-time occupation for the owner. The typical
farm size is between 40 and 70 acres of crops and grass.
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from
farm to farm. In England the farms devoted primarily to arable crops are
in the eastern part of the country, in East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire, and
the East Riding of Yorkshire. Potato and vegetable growing on a substantial
scale marks the farming of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire),
the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty
lands in south Lancashire. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed
amongst agricultural crops. In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast
are also primarily arable.
Interspersed between these arable areas, and also in the Midlands, the
south-east of England and the north-east of Scotland, there are large tracts
where, although much of the land is kept under the plough, the rearing and
fattening of cattle is an important enterprise. In the south-west of Scotland
dairying is extensively practised, but most of the north-west is devoted to
rearing sheep on rough hill land. The parts of England bordering the Pennine
hills and most of Wales are also sheep-rearing areas, though a good deal of
dairying, based on purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. Dairy farming
is widely practised throughout much of the rest of Britain. In Northern
Ireland mixed farming is practised, the most important products being milk,
fat and store cattle, pigs and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill
areas. Oats and barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the
only important cash crop is potatoes, both ware and seed.
There are three main categories of grassland in the United Kingdom—
temporary grass, permanent grass and rough grazing. Temporary grass may
be part of an arable rotation, providing a break of from one to seven years
between tillage crops, or it may be part of an all-grass system where its
advantages over permanent grass are that it can provide early and late season
grazing and often heavier crops.
Since the end of the second world war there has been an increase of about
1 million acres in the area of temporary grass and the total arable area is
about 5^ million acres more than it was pre-war. In England and Wales nearly
one-half of the 24 million acres of crops and grass (excluding over 3 million
acres of rough grazing) is under permanent grass, nearly one-third under
cereals and one-sixth under temporary grass. About three-quarters of all

agricultural land in Scotland is in rough grazing and of the 4-3 million acres
of crops and grass about one-fifth is in permanent and two-fifths in temporary
grass. Excluding about 640,000 acres of rough grazing the crops and grass
area of Northern Ireland is about 2 million acres, of which over half is under
permanent and nearly one-third under temporary grass.
Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and
diseases, and of the market; but over the past 30 years much has been done
in Britain to mitigate these risks. This has been partly due to the advance of
science, partly to self-help by farmers’ organisations, but largely to govern¬
ment action. The role of the Government as guarantor and provider of techni¬
cal and advisory services, is described on pp. 323-32.
The steady expansion in productivity which has taken place over the last 25
years is summarised in Table 20. Total cattle stocks rose steadily each year
between 1953 and 1961, but over the next three years showed a slight decline
and are only now beginning again to increase. The milk-producing herd
reached its peak level in 1962, thereafter suffering a temporary decline with
some recovery in 1965 and 1966. Numbers of sheep and lambs have shown
a fairly steady increase each year, while pigs and poultry have undergone a
considerable expansion over the past decade. Production of wheat at some
4 million tons a year has more than doubled since the end of the second
world war, while barley output at nearly 9 million tons a year is now o\er
four times the 1946 figure. There has been a marked fall in the production of
oats, and a smaller but significant drop in potatoes, a crop whose yield is
particularly prone to severe weather fluctuations. Between 1955 and 1966
output of pigmeat increased by nearly one-third, and eggs by nearly one-half,
and these, together with the increase in beef and milk output, resulted in
higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources. Imports of
concentrated feeds have in fact fallen slightly in recent years, from 6-i million
tons in 1960-61 to 5-9 million tons in 1966-67.
The index of agricultural net output (all holdings) at constant prices has
risen steadily. By 1953-54 it was about 56 per cent above the immediate
pre-war average. Using the average of i954—55 t° I95^—57=IO° as basis, it
reached 112 in 1959-60, 137 in I9^4_b5 an<^ in 1965-66; 135 is forecast
for 1966-67.
Since 1939 the population of the United Kingdom has increased by over
6| million, or about 14 per cent. In spite of this growth Britain now produces
about half of its total food requirements or two-thirds of all that can be grown
in temperate climates; this latter figure comparing with about one-half before
the second world war. Home production of the principal foods is shown as a
percentage by weight of total supplies in Table 21.
Table 22 shows how the level of the main food supplies passing into
consumption has changed since before the second world war and within the
last decade. The main trends reflected in the table are that consumption of
bulky foods (carbohydrates), such as flour and potatoes, tends to decline,
while that of high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, continues to increase
with greater availability and rising living standards.
The possibilities of wheat growing, which is mainly confined to England,
have been changed radically by the advent of new strong strawed and heavy
yielding varieties, mainly from Europe. These permit the liberal use of

brewing.
fertilisers, and spring dressings of nitrogen have become accepted practice.
Crop yields of 2 tons per acre are no longer unusual. Almost 3-5 million tons
were harvested in 1966, with yields averaging 31-2 cwt. per acre.
There are two distinct markets for barley—for malting and for feeding to
stock. Malting barley commands a higher price than feeding grain, but the
disparity has now decreased. New varieties have greatly enlarged yields.
Since i960 the acreage under barley increased by over 80 per cent and
production has doubled.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also widely
used on a co-operative basis.
In England and Wales the total acreage of fodder crops continues to decline
because in many cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically

by increased grass production and improved methods of conservation. In
Scotland the decline in the acreage of fodder crops has been less rapid and
the acreage of turnips and swedes is now greater than in England.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire where most of the beet
sugar factories are situated. The crop is grown under contract to the British
Sugar Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices and
also provides technical advice and assistance. Precision drilling is the usual
method of sowing and more than three-quarters of the crop is mechanically
harvested.
Early potatoes are grown in England and Wales in numerous, widely scattered
districts with favourable soils and climate. The crop is marketed during the
summer months and reaches the consumer within a few days of lifting. Main
crop varieties, which are normally stored before sale, are grown chiefly in the
Fen counties, Essex, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In Scotland, early potatoes
are grown in coastal areas of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, main crop
potatoes being grown mostly on the eastern side of the country; a substantial
part of the industry is concerned with supplying seed potatoes to English
and foreign growers. In Northern Ireland both ware and seed potatoes are
produced, and about one-quarter of the crop is shipped to Great Britain and
abroad. The long-term trend is for the area planted with potatoes in the
United Kingdom to diminish and for yields to increase. The acreage has
declined from 829,000 acres in i960 to an estimated 670,000 acres in 1966.
The yield in 1966 was 9-7 tons per acre compared with the record of io-i tons
per acre in 1965. Although cultivation and harvesting is largely mechanical
much hand labour is still necessary for planting and grading.
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when
converted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk
is produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Production and
liquid sales are now much greater than before the war. The average consump¬
tion per head is now about 5 pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by more
than 15 per cent and now average over 800 gallons a year. Freedom from
tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and through the artificial insemination
(AI) centres, operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations,
the influence of a small number of high-potential bulls is widely disseminated.
It is estimated that about two-thirds of Britain’s total cattle are bred by AI.
The Friesian breed is dominant in the dairy herds of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, but in Scotland the Ayrshire breed is the most numerous.
Milk production has also been stimulated by advances in grassland manage¬
ment, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of making high
quality hay; new methods of conversion into silage are being exploited. Most
dairy farmers practise some degree of intensive grass management, but hay of
the traditional type remains the basic winter feedingstuff; it is supplemented
with purchased concentrates.
Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards for equipment and
buildings used in milk production are prescribed by regulations made and
enforced by the appropriate ministers.
Livestock
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. It has been found that they meet the needs of breeders

Beef Cattle

in most countries and substantial export sales are made to buyers seeking
to replenish and improve their herds with British animals.
The majority of consumers no longer want joints from fully fattened beasts.
The average age of slaughter is about two years. Systems of semi-intensive or
intensive beef production were being increasingly adopted in the early 1960s
but their use is now declining. In the hill regions hardy herds of beef cattle
are kept, especially of the Galloway breed and its crosses; in marginal land
and lower areas the sires used are predominantly of the Aberdeen Angus,
Beef Shorthorn and Hereford breeds. Nowadays much beef derives from the
dairy herds, some females being mated to beef sires, the majority by AI.
There is a large and complex trade in store cattle (increased by animals
imported from the Irish Republic) whose general movement is from the
upland west to grazing areas in the Midlands and arable areas in the east.
Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary
research has provided vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the
epidemic diseases to which sheep are subject. More than 30 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a circumscribed area.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages: firstly, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more
rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on in due course
to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to the Midlands and the
south and east of England, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity.
Although wool is of considerable importance to the sheep farmer and
research into breeding for wool is being undertaken, the prime purpose of
British sheep farming today is the production of fat lambs, in response to the
change in the preference of consumers away from mature sheep.
Pig production is a complex enterprise, owing to the varying uses to which
the carcase is put. In Britain the carcase is used in three different ways:
for curing as bacon, for sale in fresh condition as pork, and for sausages or
other processed forms. Consumption per head, as pork, is now more than
double the pre-war level. For the several trades, pigs of three different weight
ranges seem to be called for but leanness is desirable in all three. Breeders,
in the main, aim at the long type required by bacon curers, for which there is
a classification system based on weight, carcase measurements of length
and back-fat. The Large White and Landrace breeds yield carcases which
meet the requirements of both the bacon and the pork trades.
Apart from type, breeders’ attention is now focused on utility qualities,
such as size and weight of litters, and on food consumed per pound of
liveweight gain. Litter recording and the performance and progeny testing
schemes for boars operated by the Pig Industry Development Authority are
providing basic data. The functions of this authority, which was set up under
the Agriculture Act 1957 to promote improvement in the production of pigs
and in the processing and distribution of pigmeat, are being taken over by
the Meat and Livestock Commission (see p. 330).
The organisation of the poultry industry has changed very considerably over
the past 20 years. Specialist techniques and intensive husbandry have been
introduced over a large part of the industry and considerable concentration has
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY

occurred. There are now several flocks of over 100,000 birds and only a
small proportion of total production is in the hands of the smallest producers.
More than two-thirds of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 1,000 or
more. With the rise in the poultry population and in the yield of eggs per bird
(now averaging over 200 eggs a year), the estimated production of eggs has
more than doubled the 1938 level and for several years nearly all eggs con¬
sumed in Britain have been home-produced.
Within the industry the trend is towards specialisation in the breeding and
supply of stock and in the production of eggs and table poultry. The mass
production of special table chickens, or ‘broilers’—about 185 million were
produced in 1966—has become a major industry.
Horticultural crops occupy only a small fraction of the cultivated land of
the country—about 21 per cent of the area under crops and grass—but
their value in terms of output per acre is very high. The total value of
horticultural crops sold in 1966-67 is estimated at about £188 million,
compared with some £374 million for farm crops in the United Kingdom.
About 370,000 acres are under vegetables and about 240,000 acres under fruit.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population,
notably in the Lea Valley, near London. It has also flourished in more rural
areas with favourable soil or climatic conditions—in Bedfordshire, Cambridge¬
shire, Hampshire and Kent, and in a concentration of smallholdings around
Evesham, in the Avon valley. Districts with mild climates, such as the
Penzance region of Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of
selected early crops. More recently, selected vegetable crops have been grown
in increasing quantities by farmers as an alternative to potatoes.
Specialised horticultural holdings range from a few acres up to about
300 acres, and many have glasshouses, frames or forcing houses. Use of
fertilisers, particularly of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the
field work is mechanised. The larger holdings normally have specialised
packing sheds, with washing and grading machinery, and irrigation plants.
More and more growers, however, are coming together in co-operatives for
marketing their produce and many of these co-operatives provide grading
and packing facilities for members.
Britain has some 4,000 acres of glasshouses, about half of the area being
used primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which
are the Lea Valley in Essex and Hertfordshire, and the Worthing district
in Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on a narrow belt of gravel and brick earth, over
500 acres are covered with glass. Production of tomatoes in the country is
estimated at about 75,000-80,000 tons annually and the value of all glasshouse
crops (including flowers) at some £35 million to £40 million per year.
Hard fruits grow well in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk
associated with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the
south, south-west and east of England, and Kent in particular. Production
of apples has been about equally divided between cooking and dessert varieties,
with Cox’s Orange Pippin heading the latter group, but production of cooking
apples is declining. About 27,000 acres of varieties of cider apple are grown
mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and Somerset for the cider-making industry.
In Northern Ireland there are 7,000 acres of cooking apples—Bramley
Seedlings—mostly concentrated in County Armagh. Plums and soft fruits
are grown in many counties; concentrations of plums are found in Kent
and Worcestershire, of blackcurrants in Norfolk, Kent and Hereford, of
cherries in Kent and of strawberries in Norfolk, Kent and Hampshire.
322
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Raspberries are exceptional in that of some 8,200 acres grown in Britain nearly
three-quarters are in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowrie district of Perthshire
and in Angus.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two main areas, in
Kent and Sussex and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Capital outlay
and cultivation costs are very high, but crops per acre average about 12 cwt.,
worth some ,£455. The total annual value of the crop is about ^8f million.
FARM
EXPENDITURE
AND EARNINGS
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments
(see Table 23).
The estimates show that Britain’s farming is based on livestock; two-thirds
of farmers’ income in Britain is derived from the sale of animals or their
products. The aggregate net income of farmers rose from £394 million
in 1960-61 to £472 million in 1966-67. The annual cost of government
support to the industry has averaged £270 million during this past five
years.
Growing items of farm outlay are machinery and equipment, amounting
currently to about one-sixth of total expenses. Feedingstuffs amount to
almost one-third. Since 1956 wages have risen by nearly 70 per cent, offsetting
the lower costs resulting from the reduction in manpower made possible by
mechanisation.
Until 1958 rents tended to lag behind other costs. This was due partly to
the reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and
partly to the terms of reference given to arbitrators. These terms were
modified in the Agriculture Act 1958 and since i960 rents in England and
Wales have gone up by about two-thirds.

THE ROLE
OF THE
GOVERNMENT
323
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
Each year fixed capital totalling about ^7° million is added to the value of
land and buildings (annual gross investment in fixed assets exceeds £175
million). The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is
provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an increasingly important
source of outside capital, both fixed and working; about half the total bank
advances to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit.
Accounts of some 2,200 farms in England and Wales, analysed by university
agricultural economists, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging
from £10 to £35 per acre. In Scotland a similar sample of 800 accounts shows
a wide range in tenants’ capital per acre, from about £3 on hill sheep farms
with extensive rough grazings to between £50 and £60 per acre on lower
ground farms. In Northern Ireland average valuations of occupiers’ capital
range from £80 on the smaller, more intensive farms to £40 per acre on the
larger farms. On all types of farms investment in machinery is a heavy item:
on dairy farms it is often 3^18 per acre and on arable farms up to £22 per acre;
on stock-rearing farms it may amount to £9 per acre.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with half a million
tractors in 1967, or one to every 35 acres of arable land. Power-take-off
implements now characterise arable farming; and some 65,000 combine
harvesters were in use in 1966. A wide variety of machines for harvesting and
preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed on all
except the smallest farms, many with mechanical means of handling milk.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply
and accompanying equipment. There are some 1,300 farmers’ machinery
syndicates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment
without tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out at
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Bedfordshire. This
Institute developed the first farm tractor in the world employing hydrostatic
transmission and also one of the most effective complete potato-harvesters
now in production.
The range of net incomes between individual farms is very wide, varying with
the type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the
occupier. The average net income for farms of different types usually varies
from about £5 to £15 per acre and generally there is a tendency for small
farms to show higher profits per acre than large ones, reflecting the more
intensive pattern of farming on small farms.
Profits per acre on arable farms have, with occasional seasonal exceptions,
been maintained at a higher level than on other types; dairy farming has
shown consistently increasing profits, coming near to arable farming in some
years, but profits per acre on stock-rearing farms have usually been lower—
these farms are generally larger than the other types, and are situated on poorer
land.
By the beginning of the 1930s the need for some form of State assistance
to agriculture had become pressing; it was during this time that the
Government initiated the various forms of protection and financial assistance
for agriculture.
324 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agri¬
cultural production was closely controlled by the State, with County War
Agricultural Executive Committees, composed of landowners, farmers and
farm workers, acting as the Government’s local agents.
Government Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act 1947* The
Policy main objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be ‘a stable
and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the
nation’s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is
desirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum
prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers
and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in
the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered to provide, for
the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the light of
annual reviews (see p. 325).
Post-war policy falls broadly into two periods, with the dividing line about
1954. During the first, the chief aim was to encourage expansion and a return
to something like the traditional pattern of British farming. With the ending
of the period of scarcity, policy has put stress on more economic production
of food of the kinds and qualities demanded by the market.
The Agriculture Act of 1957 assured farmers that the prices guaranteed
under the 1947 Act would not be steeply reduced, and at the same time
provided grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up to date.
The Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964 gave the Government powers
to introduce minimum import prices for agricultural and horticultural
products. These powers have been used in the case of cereals. In the same
year an understanding with overseas suppliers on the sharing of the bacon
market became effective.
Under the selective expansion programme announced in 1965 the agri¬
cultural industry is expected to increase production to meet the major part
of the growth in demand for temperate foodstuffs by 197° an<^ release
substantial manpower resources. The main emphasis in expansion is on the
production of meat, particularly beef. A substantial part of the increased
demand for cereal feed would be grown at home.
Machinery of The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
Government by the agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for Scotland the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister
responsible for United Kingdom aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture,
local aspects being the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Minister of
Agriculture. The agricultural ministers are assisted by a number of advisory
committees composed of general agriculturists and specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
divided functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject
or service. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through
its local offices, grouped in England in regions, each administered by a
regional controller working in close collaboration with the regional heads of the
technical services. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary
with similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 325
Commission and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the conservation
and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy inaugurated by the Northern Ireland Government.
It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, for which it acts as agent in the administration in Northern Ireland
of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
In November 1966 an Economic Development Committee (see p. 246) for
agriculture was established, comprising representatives of farmers, workers
and landowners, as well as official members.
CURRENT
SUPPORT POLICY
Annual Review
In February each year, in accordance with the 1947 Act, the agricultural
ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the industry.
Between annual reviews, a special review may be held if the ministers consider
it warranted, but this has seldom been necessary. In holding reviews, the
ministers are required to consult with representatives of agricultural pro¬
ducers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in the United Kingdom. The
ministers consider such factors as production trends and market requirements,
world market prospects, the cost of subsidies, the trend of profits in the
industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in
production costs, trading relations (especially with the Commonwealth) and
the national economic situation. In the light of their conclusions, they
determine guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool,
milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These guarantees apply to livestock
and livestock products for the ensuing 12 months, and to crops to be
harvested in the current year. Various grants in aid of particular kinds of
production or farming practice (known as ‘production grants’) are also
considered. Any changes in ‘relevant’ production grants (broadly, those
payable to occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into account. The
Government’s conclusions and its decisions on changes in guaranteed prices
and relevant production grants are published as a White Paper.
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 Act require the total
value of the guaranteed prices and relevant production grants in any year to be
maintained at not less than 97^ per cent of their value in the preceding year,
after allowing for changes in costs. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted
for any change in the basis of the guarantee) for each commodity must be
not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous year. For livestock and live¬
stock products—where farmers’ decisions need time to take effect—there is
a further provision that reductions in the guaranteed price for any product
must not total more than 9 per cent in a period of three years. The cost of
government support to the industry in 1966-67 was about ^228 million; the
estimate for 1967—68, adjusted for the effect of the 1967 review decisions,
forecast an increase to about £287 million.
Price
Guarantees
The general policy of the Government is to use methods of agricultural
support that allow the ordinary channels of trade to flow freely. The form of
guarantee most generally used is the deficiency payment, which means that
the Government makes payments to producers, related to the differences
between the average market price realised and the guaranteed price, for
output eligible for the guarantee.
The deficiency payments schemes for cereals and fatstock are administered
directly by the agricultural departments. New arrangements, first introduced
for the 1961-62 season, provided growers with an incentive to hold barley
326

until later in the season. ‘Standard quantity’1 arrangements for wheat and
barley were introduced for the 1964 crop* Deficiency payments for fatstock
are made weekly to individual producers on certified sales on a liveweight or
deadweight basis but there may also be a second payment at the end of the
year for cattle and sheep.
For most of the remaining commodities the Government operates the
guarantee through the appropriate marketing board, which takes account of
any payments from or to the Government in deciding what to pay producers
for their produce. In the case of milk there are five boards, and the full
guaranteed price is paid only on a ‘standard quantity’ relating to the volume
of liquid milk sales plus a reasonable reserve. Milk produced in excess of
the standard quantity is sold for manufacturing considerably below the full
guaranteed price. The retail price of liquid milk is determined by the
Government so as to cover the full cost of the guarantee and, taking one year
with another, there is no Exchequer subsidy. For eggs, a subsidy is paid to
the British Egg Marketing Board on all first-quality eggs sold to the Board
through packing stations. A deficiency payment is made for potatoes in years
in which the growers’ average price for potatoes for human consumption
(excluding new potatoes) is less than the guaranteed price; payment is made
to the Potato Marketing Board for the benefit of growers in Great Britain
and to the Ministry of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, for the benefit of
growers there.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to
fix in advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality,
after making allowance for the Board’s marketing costs.
Under the Sugar Act 1956 and the Agriculture Act 1957 the British
Sugar Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop produced
from a specified acreage (at present 443,000 acres) at a scale of fixed prices,
determined as a result of the annual review and related to sugar content.
Refined sugar produced by the Corporation is sold, under market-sharing
agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which
result from the transactions of both the Corporation and the Board are
ultimately reflected in the Board’s accounts. When these accounts show a
deficit a levy is charged on all sugar, imported or home-produced, entering
the United Kingdom market, including the sugar content of composite sugar
imports, and when there is a surplus a distribution payment is made corre¬
spondingly, so that taking one year with another the Board balances its account.
The price supports outlined above relate only to current production. To
increase productivity, however, the Government offers to farmers a wide
range of inducements, known as production grants, for improvements to land,
crops, livestock and equipment. In 1966-67 the Exchequer’s contribution in
the form of production grants was ^107 million. The form taken by these
1 The Agriculture Act 1947 postulates that the guarantees should be related to the
volume of agricultural produce which, in the national interest, it is desirable to produce
domestically (see p. 324). This is effected by including ‘standard quantities’ in the
guarantee arrangements for milk, pigs, barley, wheat, potatoes and sugar beet.
‘Standard quantity’ agreements vary in form but, in general, the basic guaranteed price
determined in the Annual Review is related to a specific quantity of produce marketed
annually on a national basis; if this quantity is exceeded, the producers’ average unit
return falls.

schemes varies considerably but they fall into three main categories. Firstly,
improvements to land fertility, which include a subsidy on fertilisers and
lime and grants for drainage and water supply; the Exchequer cost of these
improvements currently runs at nearly £48 million a year. The second type
of inducement is aimed at maintaining and improving breeding herds of
cattle and sheep (particularly in upland areas) and includes a calf subsidy on
animals destined for the beef herds; the total cost is about £46 million a year.
The third type consists of a contribution towards farm improvements
generally but with particular reference to farm buildings, silage, roads,
drainage, fences and other equipment. A special business management
scheme exists to help small farmers improve the efficiency of their holdings.
A grant is also available to farmers and growers to encourage the keeping of
farm business records as an aid to sound management decisions. Under the
Agriculture Act 1967 a hill land improvement scheme was introduced which
provides for 50 per cent grants for various improvements designed to increase
the productivity of hill land.
Under the Agriculture Act 1967 the Government is empowered to make
grants to meet 50 per cent of the approved costs of voluntary amalgamations
of small farms with other land to form commercial units; and to pay lump
sums or annuities to farmers who give up such holdings for amalgamation,
Where an owner wishes to dispose of an uncommercial holding the Govern¬
ment may buy it outright for this purpose.
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and liable to seasonal variation
in quantity and quality, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed prices.
Hitherto the principal means of support has been tariffs on imports, but
greater emphasis is now being placed on the need to strengthen the com¬
petitive efficiency of the industry so as to reduce its dependence upon the
tariffs. To this end grants of one-third are available to meet the capital cost
of a wide range of buildings, plant and equipment used in the production,
storage, preparation for market and transport of horticultural produce.
Additionally, small-scale horticulturists who are prepared to undertake a
three-year programme for improving the efficiency of their businesses may
qualify for a grant of up to £500. The cost to the Exchequer of these schemes
is about million a year.
Special arrangements for the agricultural and horticultural industries have
been made under the investment incentives procedure which replaced invest¬
ment allowances in 1966. Broadly speaking, the Minister of Agriculture is
empowered to pay grants of 10 per cent of approved expenditure on fixed
equipment, plant and machinery, and agricultural tractors, and 5 per cent
supplements to other improvement grants with a basic rate of 45 per cent
or less. For expenditure incurred between January 1967 and December 1968
grants will be paid at 15 per cent for tractors and self-propelled harvesters,
and at 12^ per cent for fixed equipment.
A number of facilities for specific purposes enjoy government encouragement
and support.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agri¬
cultural property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. (see p. 390). The Corporation’s funds are derived mainly from public
issues of stock, but it receives a measure of government support. Similarly

in Scotland, loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural land in
Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
Improvement loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and
buildings are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement
Company, whose funds are provided privately.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. Half of the loans issued are short-term for agricultural
machinery and the remainder are medium- or long-term loans for such
purposes as the purchase of livestock and the erection and improvement of
farm buildings and farm dwellings.
The Government is enabled to support financial bodies who assist farmers,
growers and their co-operatives to raise capital by guaranteeing loans made by
banks. The two financial bodies concerned are the Agricultural Credit
Corporation and the Agricultural Finance Federation, though the latter
provides guarantees for co-operatives only. These guarantees may extend to
a maximum of 15 years and are available (within prescribed annual limits)
for the provision of fixed and semi-permanent machinery and equipment,
and also for the supply of working capital.
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and
Wales have had powers to provide land for smallholdings. County councils are
obliged by Statute to provide smallholdings and the Minister of Agriculture
is empowered to contribute towards their losses. In England and Wales,
about 14,000 smallholdings are provided by local authorities and about
1,300 by the Ministry. The Minister may also make loans for working
capital to tenants of statutory smallholdings. In this way they can be helped
to obtain livestock, machinery, implements and other necessary items; tenants
must, however, have available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 420,000 acres of land
settlement estates, with some 3,700 holdings, mainly in the Highlands.
In the seven Scottish crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness, Inverness,
Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much of the land is
farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are generally either rented
at a cost of not more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding 75 acres.
In these counties there are about 19,000 crofts, which produce about
one-quarter of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems
of the crofting counties, which had for some time been suffering from a
declining population, led to the setting up, in 1955, of a Crofters Commission
(appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland) whose functions are to
reorganise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to promote
the interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting.
The Commission’s statutory powers include supervising the letting of crofts
and (if the crofters agree) the reallocation of land to form viable and self-
contained communities; it also acts as the Secretary of State’s agent in
administering development grants and loans, and collaborates with other
bodies interested in the welfare of crofters.
Land drainage in England and Wales is administered (since April 1965) by
27 river authorities (see p. 284), two catchment and 372 internal drainage
boards. Local authorities also have general drainage powers. There are no
Land Tenure
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 329
comparable authorities in Scotland, where agricultural drainage is the
responsibility of owners and occupiers of land. River authorities have powers
to maintain and improve watercourses scheduled as main rivers. Their work
is concerned with the improvement of land drainage by increasing the capacity
of rivers and erecting pumping stations, the prevention of inland flooding—
both urban and agricultural—and the erection of defences to protect low-lying
areas from coastal flooding. River authorities also have powers relating to
water resources generally, freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and
their work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural districts. Their main function is
to keep the land drained in their area by improving the main drains and,
where necessary, by pumping from low-lying land.
The authorities derive their income directly or indirectly from ratepayers.
The Government pays grants towards the cost of the improvement schemes.
Grants to river authorities vary from 15 per cent to 80 per cent according to
the financial position of the authority. Internal drainage boards receive
grants at a flat rate of 50 per cent. Local authorities receive grants varying
from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is the drainage authority
in respect of watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or
minor watercourses.
In Great Britain about half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied. The traditional form of tenancy in England and Wales runs
from year to year; in Scotland longer leases for terms of 10 to 14 years are
more common, although most tenants farm on a year-to-year basis. The
tenancy agreement may be either written or verbal and may (but need not)
include provisions about such matters as rights of cropping, liability for repair
and maintenance, and compensation for tenant’s improvements.
In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of landlord and
tenant relationships has been written into legislation. The Agriculture Acts
1947 (England and Wales) and 1948 (Scotland) lay down the basic rules of
good estate management and good husbandry for owners and occupiers
respectively, while the Agricultural Holdings Acts 1948 (England and Wales)
and 1949 (Scotland) contain more detailed provisions.
The Acts provide for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings to which exemption can be given by the Minister
or Secretary of State, to continue in force from year to year until determined
by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can contest it
by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative
unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and Wales
the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court) that
his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or good
husbandry or that the land is required for certain purposes specified in the Acts.
The Acts lay down a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled
on termination of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between
landlord and tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing
agreement, by arbitration at intervals of not less than three years in England
and Wales and five years in Scotland.
MARKETING
Agricultural products are now marketed mainly through private trade channels
such as corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories;

or through producers’ co-operative organisations. For certain commodities,
however, marketing arrangements are influenced by boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation).
These marketing boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers
to regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under which
they are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members of the boards are
elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which have
powers to trade as the first selling agency for all producers not specially
exempted or, alternatively, to exercise a comparable influence by controlling
all contracts between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards
which maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving
producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for
eggs, hops, milk and wool fall into the first category and the potato board
into the second. Northern Ireland has its own marketing boards, based on
local legislation, for milk, pigs and seed potatoes and herbage seeds.
A Meat and Livestock Commission is being established under the Agri¬
culture Act 1967 charged with improving the production, marketing and
distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It has a range of executive
functions extending from breeding to retail distribution, one of the most
important of which will be to evolve a general scheme of carcase classification.
It is not empowered to trade in either livestock or meat.
Grants of up to one-third are available for the modernisation of major
wholesale markets; Covent Garden market is being moved to a new site in
south London, which should be in operation in the early 1970s.
To improve the presentation of home-grown horticultural produce, the
statutory grading and labelling of fresh home-grown and imported supplies
is to be introduced. By May 1968 grades will have been prescribed for apples,
pears, tomatoes, cucumbers and cauliflowers.
To assist the financing of research and development in the marketing of
agricultural and horticultural produce, million was earmarked in 1962
by the Government, a similar sum being set aside by the industry. By spring
I9^7 grants totalling about ,£1,072,000 had been approved. The scheme has
been extended to March 1968. The majority of applications have come from
producer groups and more than half relate to livestock or meat.
The Agriculture Act 1967 also provides for the setting up of a Central Council
for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation to promote and develop
co-operation in agriculture and horticulture and to administer a scheme of
grants. The scheme is expected to incorporate and extend grants for the
co-operative marketing of agricultural (at present available mainly under the
Market Development Scheme) and horticultural produce, and also to cover
co-operative activities in agricultural and horticultural production.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
veterinary profession in private practice. The State veterinary service,
inaugurated in 1865 and covering Great Britain, deals with situations beyond
the control of the individual veterinary surgeon. Centred on London and
Edinburgh, it is able, at any hour, to deal promptly with outbreaks of
notifiable diseases.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
331
For many years Britain has been free from many serious animal diseases,
. including rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies. A campaign is being
conducted to eradicate swine fever (hog cholera). Although the incidence of
foot and mouth disease is small, there was a series of outbreaks in the latter
part of 1966 and early 1967; in each case, however, the disease was eradicated.
In i960 the whole of the United Kingdom became a bovine tuberculosis
attested area. Bovine tuberculosis is now a disease of extreme rarity: all cattle
are tuberculin tested at regular intervals and reactors to the test are slaughtered,
compensation being paid to the owners. In 1967 a register of brucellosis-free
herds was started as a first step towards eradication of the disease.
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 19 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on
disease problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is
provided by investigation centres attached to agricultural colleges.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to
those in Great Britain. Its geographical isolation has meant that it is free
from nearly all the major epizootic diseases. A scheme for the eradication of
brucellosis is expected to be completed by the end of 1968. The full-time
veterinary service is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory at
Stormont, Belfast.
Plants Advice to growers on the general control of plant pests and diseases is given
by the advisory services. In addition, the State plant health service is res¬
ponsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones
from abroad. It also issues the health certificates required by other countries
to accompany plant material imported from Britain.
Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the development
of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of crops
subject to degenerative diseases.
Agricultural Although the increasing use of pesticides has contributed appreciably to
Chemicals the expansion of agricultural output in Britain, it has been recognised that
effective safeguards are needed against the dangers arising from their
uncontrolled use. The Regulations made under the Agriculture (Poisonous
Substances) Act 1952 provides protection for workers using the more toxic
chemicals. The voluntary Pesticides Society Precautions Scheme, operated
by the Government with the full backing of the industry, ensures that new
pesticides for use in agriculture and food storage, or new methods of using
existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough experimental work has
been done on their attendant hazards (including contamination of food and
harm to wild life) to allow the Government to make recommendations for
their safe use. There is also a voluntary Veterinary Products Safety
Precautions Scheme on similar lines.
A key role in the administration of both these schemes is played by the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals.
Reports of this Committee, published in 1964, concluded that there was no
evidence that the use of the persistent organochlorine pesticides presented
any immediate hazard to human beings and animals, apart from certain
species of predatory birds.

In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horti¬
cultural matters is available to every farmer and grower through the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s National Agricultural Advisory Service
(NAAS), which is organised on a regional and county basis. Every county has
a county agricultural adviser in charge of advisory work and is divided into
districts, in each of which there is a district agricultural adviser who can call
on an extensive system of specialist advisers. In Northern Ireland advisory
work is organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, with a county organisation
similar to the NAAS. In Scotland the advisory services, likewise similar in
scope to the NAAS, are based on the three agricultural colleges.
The Agricultural Land Service, through its qualified land agents, surveyors
and architects, provides a service without charge to owners and occupiers of
both agricultural and horticultural land needing advice on problems arising
from the ownership of land, and investment connected with it. The services
include general advice on the design, layout and construction or improvement
of all types of farm buildings as well as roads, fences and effluent disposal.
The Service also provides professional advice and services to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on these and related matters concerning
agricultural and horticultural land.
Basic agricultural research in Britain is described on p. 208. In England and
Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined in the Provincial
Agricultural Economics Service, which comprise ten university Departments
of Agricultural Economics and which is co-ordinated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In Scotland, agricultural economists are
on the staff of the three agricultural colleges. The agricultural departments
in both England and Wales and Scotland have economics and statistics
units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture also has an Economics and
Statistics Division and has, in addition, its own research institutions investi¬
gating problems of animal and crop production.
There are four types of institution which provide full-time education in
agricultural subjects: universities; agricultural colleges; in England and
Wales, county farm institutes; and in Scotland, farm schools. Twelve univer¬
sities in the United Kingdom provide degree and postgraduate training in
agriculture, and one other university offers postgraduate diploma courses. A
National College of Agricultural Engineering was established in i960 at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire. This is one of the national colleges (see p. 160)
established to train people for highly specialised industries, the needs of
which cannot be met at local technical colleges.
Two-year diploma courses and some specialised courses are given at five
agricultural colleges and at two of the county farm institutes in England and
Wales; three agricultural colleges in Scotland give two-year to three-year
diploma courses and also offer two- or three-term certificate courses. In
Northern Ireland there are two agricultural colleges and three more are
planned.
There are 31 county farm institutes in England and five in Wales run by
local education authorities. They provide residential courses in general
agriculture, dairying, horticulture, poultry husbandry and rural domestic
economy. Local education authorities also provide short courses and classes
for farmers, farm workers, horticulturists and domestic producers.

There are nine farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities,

for boys and girls of from 12 to 16 years. There is one residential agricultural
school in Northern Ireland, which provides short courses for boys and girls
over 15 years of age.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge
and London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
FISHERIES
The sea fishing industry is of especial importance to the economy of Scotland.
It is also an important single source of employment in some of the major
fishing ports. The industry falls into three main divisions, concerned res¬
pectively with white fish, herring and shellfish. The major element of the
catch (about 85 per cent by weight) is white fish: the catches of herring and
shellfish, although important, are relatively small. White fish are demersal fish
(such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and sole) which live on or near the sea
bed, and also pelagic fish (such as pilchard, mackerel and sprats) which live
mainly in intermediate waters or near the surface. Herring is a pelagic species
and constitutes a separate fishery. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as
lobsters, nephrops and crabs) and molluscs (such as escallops, mussels, cockles
and oysters).
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups:
the distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The
distant waters are those round Iceland and in the west Atlantic, Greenland,
Bear Island and the north coast of Norway, and the Barents Sea; the middle
water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near water grounds are
those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain.
The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The inshore
waters also yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, Milford Haven, North Shields and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great
Yarmouth and Lowestoft for herring. In Scotland the chief centres for white
fish are Aberdeen, Granton, Fraserburgh, the Moray Firth, the West Coast
and Shetland Islands; herring landings are made mainly at the east coast
ports of Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, the west coast ports of
Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban, Tarbert and Ayr, and in Shetland Islands. In
Northern Ireland the fishing ports are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring
and drift netting. Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant
and near waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for
catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the
Minches, the Firth of Clyde, and the Irish Sea. There are about 650 Scottish
and Northern Ireland seiners, and about 155 operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring
based on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east
coast ports of England, and autumn fishing off East Anglia based on Lowestoft
and Yarmouth. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of
Scotland, in the Isle of Man area and off southern Ireland.

Processing
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland,
north-east England and in the Irish Sea there are valuable catches of
‘Norway lobsters’ (nephrops or prawns).
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and
Fleetwood, numbered over 200 at the end of 1966. They are over 140 feet in
length and most of them make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in
the Arctic Circle. Recently, partly due to the introduction of freezer trawlers
and factory vessels, there has been an increasing tendency to fish the waters
bordering Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. These vessels spend
from one to three months at sea and freeze, in some cases as fillets, much or
all of their catch immediately it is taken. At the same date, near and middle
water vessels numbered 386; they are under 140 feet long and most of them
work nearer home, making voyages of from a few days up to more than
two weeks, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off the Faroes and
seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near water group are
vessels engaged in drift net fishing for herring; these vessels usually make
daily voyages. The inshore group consists mainly of vessels of under 80 feet
which, except for seiners, are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days
and more usually make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land.
In the British fishing industry in 1966 there were about 19,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 5,500 occasionally employed; about two-
fifths of the former and one-third of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 500 regular fishermen.
In 1966 landings of fish, both demersal and pelagic, by British fishing vessels
totalled 901,000 tons (704,000 tons of demersal fish and 197,000 tons of
pelagic), valued at about £58 million. Landings at British ports by foreign
vessels totalled about 120,000 tons of fresh and frozen fish (including 45,000
tons brought direct from the fishing grounds), valued at about £17 million.
British landings of shellfish yielded £3-6 million. Cod accounted for 43 per
cent of the total value of wet fish (that is, fish other than shellfish) landed by
British vessels; haddock (19 per cent) and plaice (10 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) in 1966
amounted to about 203,000 tons valued at ^62 million, including 30,000 tons
of canned salmon to the value of £20 million and other canned fish worth
£12 million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish
and imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 16,000 tons landed weight
in 1966. Although consumption had been declining slightly, on an edible
(fillet) weight basis, it was 16-8 lb. per head in 1966 in comparison with a peak
total of 287 lb. in 1948 (see Table 22).
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-
freezing for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and
development. The growth of quick-frozen fish production has altered
radically the structure of the industry. With the increase in quick-freezing
(which now processes about one-fifth of all white fish landings), new export
outlets have opened up for white fish, which in 1966 accounted for over half
the total British exports of fish and fish preparations, valued at £9-9 million.

Markets abroad for quick-frozen fish, mainly in Europe, have been expand¬
ing; the decline in exports of herrings has halted.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and to a much lesser extent for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1966 was 86,000 tons.
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or
draught nets in rivers and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used
for catching salmon in the sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries.
In England and Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately
£275,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to over £i-6 million, and in Northern
Ireland to some £198,000. In Northern Ireland, eels worth about £320,000
a year are captured by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 300 tons a day, but other large
cities also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is
through wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell
to inland wholesalers; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward ship¬
ment. Special express fish trains transport the catch daily from the ports to
inland centres, but increasing use is being made of road transport. Retail
sales are handled by some 25,000 to 30,000 fishmongers and fish friers; the
latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Trawler-owning companies have entered into the marketing and distribu¬
tive system. This process has been encouraged by the growing popularity of
quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail outlets, such as
grocers, as well as by fishmongers.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Health
and the Scottish Home and Health Department are concerned with questions
of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant
Shipping Acts, which are administered by the Board of Trade.
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act
1935 to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent
amending Acts have also been passed. The Board consists of a chairman and
three other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are
appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the
Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The Board, whose
activities are financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by govern¬
ment grants and loans, is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council,
consisting of 33 members representing all sections of the industry and
consumers.
The functions of the Board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The Board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and the improvement of existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain

loans from the Board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under
80 feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st May
i967, £1,794,000 in loans and £674,600 in grants had been advanced.
The White Fish Authority and the Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland of the Authority were set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act 1951.
The function of the Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate the white
fish industry, and that of the Committee to advise the Authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Authority is composed of a chairman and five members, and the Scottish
Committee of five members and a chairman who is a member of the
Authority. They are appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home
Secretary. The White Fish Industry Advisory Council was also set up under
the 1951 Act to advise the Authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions. It consists of 53 members representing the various interests of the
fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan
schemes—the rate of which was increased in 1966—for the purchase of new
fishing vessels and engines and the improvement of existing vessels. It also
administers loans for the purchase of nets and gear and processing plants.
Up to 31st March 1967, £32-9 million in loans and £17-2 million in grants
were approved for these purposes by the Authority. Its other activities are
financed by a levy on first-hand sales of fish.
To encourage the development of the sea fishing industry, Parliament has
authorised subsidies which vary according to the class of vessel used; they
are paid at the rate of so much per day at sea for the larger vessels and at so
much per stone of fish landed from the smaller boats. Subject to certain
conditions, herring sold for reduction to oil and meal attracts an additional
subsidy. No subsidy is paid for shellfish. Subsidies for white fish were first
paid in 1950, but were restricted to middle water (or nearer) catches until
1961, when they were extended to large vessels of over 140 feet in length
operating in distant waters; a total of £2-8 million was paid in 1966-67. The
herring subsidy commenced in 1957, and amounted to £284,000 in 1966-67.
There are also the schemes mentioned above which make provision for
grants and loans to fishermen for vessels and engines to assist in modernising
fleets, including shellfish vessels. Following the report of a committee of
inquiry on the fishing industry, the Sea Fish Industry Act 1962 guaranteed
the continuance of these grants and subsidies for a period of ten years up to
I972> but provided for annual reductions in the rates of white fish subsidies
payable to vessels of 80 feet or over in length.
FORESTRY
The total area of productive woodland in Great Britain is 3-38 million acres,
or about 6 per cent of the total land area. If account is taken of areas of
scrub and old felled areas, including those cut down in the second world war,
the total rises to 4-35 million acres, or yf per cent of the land area; about
half of the area is in England, two-fifths in Scotland, the remainder in Wales.
The high proportion of unproductive woodland is largely a legacy of two wars
and, while rehabilitation of these areas continues to proceed, it is unlikely
that all areas (for instance, because of remoteness and poor site conditions)
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
337
will be replanted. A measure of the extent of rehabilitation is provided
by the fact that the area of unproductive woodland has been reduced by
300,000 acres since 1945.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
i-6 million acres, represents 48 per cent of the total. The annual rate of
forest extension has of late been of the order of 47,000 acres by the Commission
and about 30,000 acres by private woodland owners. The Commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, especially of
Scotland, and consists mainly of conifers because of the difficult site conditions
encountered. The major species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine,
Scots pine and Norway spruce. In private planting the dependence on conifers
is high. In older woodlands and taking the country as a whole, the most
common coniferous trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and
the larches, while, among the broadleaved, beech and oak occur widely.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s total requirements of wood and wood products. Britain
imports 90 per cent of its needs by volume, and a higher proportion still by
value, the total import bill for wood and wood products averaging £490
million over the years 1962 to 1966.
The Forestry
Commission
and Forestry
Policy
Finance
The Forestry Act 1919 established the Forestry Commission as the national
forestry authority charged with promoting the interests of forestry, the
development of afforestation and the production of timber in Great Britain.
As more and more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage the
Commission has assumed an increasingly important role as a timber seller.
The Commission consists of a part-time chairman, four full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales
are responsible for forest policy. Northern Ireland has its own separate
organisation (see p. 339).
The Commission’s total estate covers some 2-75 million acres and includes
1-9 million acres of forest land, of which about i-6 million are under trees
in over 400 forests distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
All these forests are covered by management plans, which provide for such
work as planting, road construction, thinning, fire protection, and timber
production.
As already stated, a substantial amount of the Forestry Commission’s new
planting is carried out in Scotland, much of it in the Highland counties. The
poorer types of land are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable
for other agricultural purposes, but has become suitable for forestry as a
result of advances in the technique of deep ploughing.
Production of coniferous timber from Commission woodlands, mainly in
the way of thinnings, is expected to rise from about 1 million tons in 1966 to
about 2-7 million tons by 1980. Much of this kind of produce is meeting
traditional requirements of the coal mines but a great deal is also taken up by
the paper pulp industry and by new factories established to make chipboard.
The Forestry Fund was established under the 1919 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
their receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with
the amounts voted annually by Parliament. Receipts in 1966 were £4-9 million
and drawings from funds voted by Parliament amounted to £14-4 million.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Privately owned woods comprise nearly two-thirds of the total forest area in
Great Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The
size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several
thousand acres, and a high proportion of private woodland area is in small
ownership (that is, owners of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands
by the introduction of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme, initiated in
1947. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently
to timber production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan
agreed with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of planting
and management grants and technical advice. By September 1966 the total
area dedicated was 850,000 acres. In addition, there are the woodlands
covered by the Approved Woodlands Scheme in which a planting grant,
but no management grant, is made; and these bring the total area managed
under agreed plans to more than 1 million acres. Woodland owners are
represented, in their relations with the Foresty Commission, by the Forestry
Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations
of woodland owners: the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in
England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.
The Forestry Commissioners have encouraged the development of co¬
operative forestry schemes. The co-operative societies provide for landowners
and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing facilities, and
a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The Commission also
co-operates with the principal forestry societies, such as the Royal Forestry
Society of England and Wales and the Royal Scottish Forestry Society, in
disseminating technical knowledge.
In 1959 the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established
by timber merchants to promote the use of home grown timber.
The Forestry Act 1945 established national committees for England, Scotland
and Wales, composed partly of Forestry Commissioners and partly of persons
outside the Commission. These committees act in an advisory capacity,
particularly as to the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the Commis¬
sioners’ activities and relationships with other land users.
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing
and utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee (HGTAC) is a statutory body and includes representatives of
associations of landowners and timber merchants, under an independent
chairman. In 1949 the Forestry Commissioners set up the Advisory Committee
on Utilisation of Home Grown Timber (now a sub-committee of the HGTAC)
to advise on measures designed to promote utilisation of produce from
British woodlands. A voluntary scheme was agreed upon in 1961 for consulta¬
tion on proposals for afforestation of land within National Parks (see p. 181).
The Forestry Commission, the Timber Growers’ Organisation and the
Country Landowners’ Association undertook to advise their members to
submit their proposals to the park planning authorities.
The Forestry Commission maintains three forester training schools: in
England, at Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near
Betws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Faskally, near Pitlochry
in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the
Commission’s educational centre, and is used for practical courses for
Commission staff and for university students, landowners and agents,

planning officers, school teachers and others connected with, or interested in,
forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a
proportion of suitable graduates is recruited by the Commission as forest
officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near
Farnham, Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this
station and in experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted
^59°,ooo in 1966. This sum included grants for special forestry research
work to various institutions and to university departments including the
Commonwealth Forestry Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by
the University, the Commonwealth Office and overseas Governments.
Research into the qualities of home grown timber is carried out by the Forest
Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, and also by
grant-aided research associations.
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new
Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar
powers and duties to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the
Forestry Act 1919. At that time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres
for afforestation, of which 700 acres had been planted.
Forest policy in Northern Ireland is implemented by the Forestry Act
(Northern Ireland) 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act pro¬
vides the Ministry with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. It introduced measures
for the protection of all woodlands, whether owned by the State or privately
owned, against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace
since the end of the second world war. By 1967 nearly 136,000 acres had been
acquired, of which about 85,000 acres had been planted. The present
afforestation programme provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an
area of 150,000 acres of productive State forest.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and
from receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,200 people are
employed in field labour and ancillary work. The area of exploitable private
woodlands is at present about 33,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply at a low cost of young
trees from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the estab¬
lishment of new plantations, and by free technical advice.
Pomeroy Forestry School at Pomeroy House, Co. Tyrone, provides
training and refresher courses for forestry workers, school teachers and
others interested in trees and forestry.
13 Transport and
Communications
Technical
Trends
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed 6-2 per cent
of the total labour force in the United Kingdom in June 1966. Of the i-6
million persons so occupied, 30 per cent were engaged in road passenger
transport and road haulage contracting, 21 per cent in railways and 27 per
cent in postal services and telecommunications; sea and air transport absorbed
respectively 6 per cent and 2 per cent; port and inland water transport
and miscellaneous transport services and storage absorbed 14 per cent.
Transport and communications contribute about 8 per cent to the gross
national product and are responsible for the same proportion of the nation’s
gross fixed capital formation.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over 13-2 per
cent is registered in the United Kingdom, making the British merchant fleet
the largest in active employment. The British shipping industry is, however,
exposed to severe international competition. The position has been made
more difficult by the prevalence among competitors of such practices as flag
discrimination and the use of ‘flags of convenience’. While from 1956 to 1966
Britain’s merchant fleet increased by 10 per cent from 19-5 million to 21-5
million gross tons, the total tonnage of all other countries increased by 98 per
cent, from 71-7 million to 141-6 million gross tons. After being positive until
about 1959 the balance of payments for shipping services became adverse
until 1965; in 1966 the surplus was £12 million. Shipping makes one of the
largest contributions to Britain’s foreign exchange earnings. It is estimated
that in 1966 freights, charter receipts and passage money amounted to
^766 million, or about one-quarter of the total value of invisible exports.
The most recent estimate (for 1965) of gross earnings of the shipping industry
is about j£i,ooo million, nearly all arising from foreign trade.
During recent years, steam has steadily given way to diesel power, well over
50 per cent of all tonnage being diesel-driven in 1966. In a variety of ways
technological change has been proceeding more rapidly under current
conditions. Vessels are becoming obsolescent over a shorter period and as they
do so are being replaced by larger ships, whose building costs per ton tend to
be lower, and, equipped with labour-saving devices, their greater speeds and
faster turn-round facilities can reduce operating costs. The tendency to
greater average size has been the most marked in tankers and dry bulk cargo
ships. Particularly for the shorter sea routes, more ships are being designed
to carry fully loaded road vehicles, pallets and containers. Two British
consortia have been set up to build and operate specialist container ships,
1 One gross ton (g.t.) = 100 cubic feet. One deadweight ton (d.w.t.) = 1 long ton
(2,240 lb.). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed spaces on a ship.
Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before
submerging the load-line.

as containers involve less handling in port and ensure faster carriage from
door to door. As a result of the rapid rate of replacements, 58 per cent of
gross tonnage of Britain’s merchant fleet in 1966 was under ten years old,
the corresponding figure for tankers being 74 per cent.
The two liners from British shipyards of 30,000 gross tons and over operating
on transatlantic passenger services, the Queen Elizabeth (83,673 g.t.) and the
Queen Mary (81,237 g.t.), are being retired from service (the Queen Mary in
October 1967). The two largest liners to be built in the United Kingdom in
recent years, the Oriana (42,000 g.t.) and the Canberra (45,000 g.t.) came into
service in i960 and 1961 respectively on the services from Britain to Australia
and across the Pacific to North America. The Queen Elizabeth II (58,000 g.t.),
built for the transatlantic passenger route and for cruising, was launched in
September 1967, and will go into service early in 1969.
Of the 21-5 million gross tons of merchant shipping of 100 gross tons and
over registered, but not all owned, in the United Kingdom on 30th June 1966,
tankers accounted for 8 million gross tons and 13 per cent of the world’s
sea-going tanker tonnage.
In June 1966, 17-4 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 The usual employment
of this fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping
as follows: 7-2 million gross tons were employed as foreign-going passenger
and cargo liners; 3-2 million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 6-i million
gross tons as foreign-going tankers; and 0-9 million gross tons in coasting and
trade with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades).
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom
consists of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter.
Practically all these ships are owned by large liner companies. Many of them
operate wide networks of scheduled cargo and passenger services which,
between them, cover every ocean. The 3 million gross tons of ocean-going
tramp ships are operated by a large number of private owners, some of them
having only a small number of ships and some only one ship.
Examples of major British liner shipping companies operating scheduled
services from the United Kingdom are: the Cunard, to North America; the
Royal Mail, to South America; the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the Far
East; the Peninsular and Oriental (P. & O.) and the British India lines, to
India, Australia and the Far East; the Union Castle, to South and East Africa;
Elder Dempster, to West Africa; Furness Withy, to North America and the
West Indies; the New Zealand line, to Australia and New Zealand; and Shaw
Savill and Albion, to Australia and New Zealand. These and the other major
liner companies have for the most part amalgamated to form a small number
of major groups, of which the largest and best known are the P. & O., the
Furness Withy, the Ocean S.S., and the British and Commonwealth groups.
Over two-thirds of the total tanker fleet belong to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies. A newer type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier—
is in use on a substantial scale.
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft,
Admiralty vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries
(including over 1 million gross tons of tankers).

A credit scheme to benefit British shipowners ordering from British
shipyards was introduced by the Government in 1967.
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 394) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their
safety and operational efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying
and giving technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of
building, at regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A
satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may
accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register
and the Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the Chamber of Shipping. There
are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas. Other organisations represent companies specialising in a particular
trade or type of cargo.
The British Shippers’ Council, formed in 1955, represents the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and interna¬
tional concern.
The British Shipping Federation Limited is the employers’ organisation
concerned with labour relations and the regulation of employment throughout
the Merchant Navy. It is responsible for the administration of the Merchant
Navy Established Service Scheme, under which shipowners engaging crews
for ships of 200 gross tons and above engage them through the Merchant
Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to offer two-year
Company Service contracts.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations
of wages and conditions of service in the Merchant Navy.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight
rates or passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets
from time to time to review and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones.
Some of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined
together to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing
with trade to and from the United Kingdom.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet here to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world.

The Board of Trade is the government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping, having taken over this responsibi¬
lity from the Ministry of Transport in February 1965. Under the Merchant
Shipping Act 1894 and subsequent legislation, it administers many regulations
for marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll
line) that shows that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that standards of
safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision of adequate
life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline,
professional standards, health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the
work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the officers of the
Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is also a Registrar-
General of Shipping and Seamen, in whose office at Cardiff a complete
record of all British ships and seamen is kept.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those
provisions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the
United Kingdom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of
Commonwealth Governments.
The discharge of oil into United Kingdom territorial waters was first
restricted in 1922. Britain is a party to the 1954 International Convention
for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force
in 1958. The nations ratifying this convention (now numbering over 30) agree
to prohibit their national fleets from discharging persistent oil within a
certain distance of any coast (originally 50 miles but under amendments in
1962 extended in many areas to 100 miles or more) and also in extensive
areas of the north-east Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the whole of the
North Sea, and around Australia. The provisions were given legal effect for
British ships under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act 1955 which also prohibits
the discharge of any kind of oil from British and foreign vessels into United
Kingdom territorial waters. Amendments to the 1954 Convention were agreed
in 1962 and came into force on 18th May 1967; the Oil in Navigable Waters
Act 1963, applying the amendments to British ships, became effective on the
same date. The Convention as amended prohibits ships of 20,000 gross tons
and over, built after 18th May 1967, from discharging persistent oil anywhere
at sea.
Extensive operations to combat the effects of oil pollution were carried
out on and around British coasts following the wreck of the 118,000 dead¬
weight ton tanker Torrey Canyon near the Isles of Scilly in March 1967. The
cost to public funds has been estimated at between £2 million-^ million.
About 300,000 vessels pass through the Dover Strait every year. To reduce
the number of collisions one-way routes were marked by navigational aids
provided by the French and British lighthouse authorities in 1967—a scheme
worked out by the joint Institutes of Navigation of France, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Britain and agreed by the Inter-Governmental
Maritime Consultative Organisation, a United Nations agency with head¬
quarters in London. Further one-way routing along the English Channel and
elsewhere is under consideration.
The Board of Trade administers the Coastguard Service. This is primarily a
life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around the coast
for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by coastguard rescue
equipment or by informing other authorities who may be able to give help.

There are some 550 regular coastguards and about 7,000 part-time auxiliary
coastguards. During the year ended 31st March 1967 life-saving action was
taken on 3,363 occasions. There is close liaison between the Coastguard
Service and the Royal National Life-boat Institution. The latter maintains
lifeboats and fast inshore rescue boats around the coast of the United Kingdom;
it is supported entirely by voluntary contributions, and depends largely for its
operation on voluntary workers. From its foundation in 1824 to the end of
1966 the Royal National Life-boat Institution saved over 87,000 lives. Life¬
boats and inshore rescue boats were launched 1,783 times in 1966, and
rescued 817 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel
Islands and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its
first Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board
of ten Elder Brethren, elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the
Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and the Commissioners of Irish
Lights.
Trinity House is also the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 750 pilots
in 41 districts in England and Wales, including London, Southampton and
Milford Haven. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is the
pilotage authority. The Board of Trade also has certain responsibilities in
connection with lighthouses and pilotage.
At the end of 1966 there were about 113,000 United Kingdom personnel
and 31,000 aliens employed by the merchant fleet; of these, masters, deck and
engineer officers numbered 37,000.
The Board of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of
foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class
engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board
ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio-
telegraphy issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open
examination.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom
registered ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B. granted
by the Board of Trade, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate
a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on
deck, have obtained a certificate of efficiency as lifeboatman and have passed
a qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer.
Service as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examina¬
tion for a second mate’s certificate.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies
of apprentices, cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations
for the various certificates of competency.
A million residential school was opened at Gravesend in May 1967 to
provide training for at least two-thirds of the boys entering the Merchant
Navy. It is the largest establishment of its kind in the world.

and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take
two-year contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with
the industry as a whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the
normal unemployment insurance benefit, when they are ashore between
voyages.
There are over 300 ports in Britain. In 1966, 155 million tons of imports,
including 91 million tons of petroleum and petroleum products, passed
through the ports and 38 million tons of exports and re-exports, including
4 million tons of coal. Coastal traffic amounted to 112 million tons, principally
petroleum and coal.
As a result both of the anticipated increase in the country’s trade and of
technological changes affecting sea-going traffic (such as the shift to larger
tankers and bulk carriers implying a need for more deep-water berths,
demand for the development of mechanical handling methods, packaging of
general cargo in standard sizes and ‘roll-on, roll-off’ services) large-scale
modernisation of the ports system has become necessary. Capital investment
in ports has risen from about £18 million a year in the early 1960s to £35
million in 1966 and to about £45 million in 1967.
The National Ports Council, set up in 1964 as a statutory body under the
Harbours Act of that year, is financed by a levy on harbour authorities and is
primarily an advisory body, with the executive powers for the carrying out of
its recommendations vested in the Minister of Transport. It advises the
Minister on major port developments, and has various responsibilities in
relation to research, training and charges. Its main task is the preparation and
supervision of long-term national planning for the ports as a whole. The
Council is encouraging the improvement of port organisation by means of
amalgamation of harbour authorities in an estuary into a single port
authority; the Clyde Port Authority came into existence in 1966, and the
Tees and Hartlepools Port Authority in 1967.
In June 1966 the Minister of Transport announced proposals to make
grants of 20 per cent of approved capital expenditure to statutory and other
harbour authorities and persons carrying out harbour operations.
The Port of London, with 92 miles of waterway and about 4,000 acres of
dock estate, including 36 miles of quayage, is the largest port in the Common¬
wealth and, with New York and Rotterdam, is one of the three largest ports
in the world. Goods of every kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to
perfume, pass through the docks; about 59 million tons of cargo were handled
in 1966. Imports are distributed all over the United Kingdom, though the
port primarily supplies Greater London and the home counties. The Thames
Navigation Service, operating from Gravesend, provides navigational sur¬
veillance and information, by means of radar and radio telephone and other
methods, for vessels between the estuary and London Bridge.
Liverpool is the second largest port and the major export cargo outlet of
the United Kingdom. The port handles one-sixth of Britain’s grain imports
and has one of the largest grain-handling plants in Europe. In 1966, over
30 million tons of cargo passed through the port. In 1948 the Harbour Board
became the first port authority in the world to install radar to cover its sea
channels.

Manchester is an inland port, access to which is by the Manchester Ship
Canal. Petroleum is both the main import and export. At Eastham is the
largest oil dock in the United Kingdom, covering 19 acres.
Southampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic, and the principal
port for imports of deciduous and citrus fruits. Southampton’s value as a port
is enhanced by its deep water, double tides and its easy access to London.
A considerable volume of oil for the refinery at Fawley (see p. 274) is handled.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial north¬
east of England and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest
ship-repairing centre in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of
Yorkshire and the Midlands, and is one of the largest white fish ports in
the world. Other imports are grain, timber and oil.
The port of Tees is one of the largest centres for importing iron ore and for
exporting steel and engineering products.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales.
As well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its
immediate neighbourhood. It is also an important oil port.
Newport (Monmouthshire) and Port Talbot are two of Britain’s principal
ore-importing centres. Newport has an important and growing general cargo
trade.
Bristol and nearby Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the
city of Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade. About 8 million tons
of cargo are handled annually, including one-fifth of Britain’s tobacco
imports. There are extensive oil installations.
Clydeport, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the
industrial area of central Scotland, and is the principal outlet for exports of
Scotch whisky.
Grangemouth, Scotland’s second port, is associated particularly with oil
and timber.
Leith is the port of the city of Edinburgh. The chief import is grain and
the main export coal from the Lothian coalfields.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main
traffic across the Irish Sea.
Other major ports are Immingham, with an important trade in chemicals,
coal and petroleum; Cardiff, for iron ore, petroleum and general traffics;
and Milford Haven for oil.
A major development scheme is in progress at Tilbury, London; it will
provide some two miles of new quays and on completion in 1969 will make
Tilbury a major container terminal. Container facilities are also being con¬
structed at Liverpool, Southampton and other ports. Work is continuing
on a ten-year development plan at Hull, including improvements costing
nearly £7 million at King George Dock; a new oil jetty is to be provided for
large tankers at Immingham; and a -£17 million deep-water harbour is under
construction at Port Talbot, to serve as an ore terminal for the Steel Company
of Wales.
Since 1948 about a third of the total port capacity has been Government
owned; the British Transport Docks Board (see p. 349) owns the majority of
such ports which include Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Newport, Cardiff
and Swansea. The Government intends that all ports should be reorganised
on the basis of public ownership by 1970.

In 1966 shipping arrivals and departures at BTDB docks totalled over
90 million net registered tons (including fishing vessels), and the total cargo
handled was about 53 million tons.
Certain ports and docks used largely for the cross-channel services of the
railways are administered by the British Railways Board: examples are
Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay (at Harwich).
Other ports are controlled by public trusts on which are represented users
of the port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies), local
authorities and companies. Examples of ports under public trusts are London
(Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board),
and Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners).
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main,
set down in private Acts of Parliament. A model set of clauses dealing with
many of the details is set out in the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act
i847-
Most ports are represented on the Dock and Harbour Authorities’
Association, formed in 1917 to represent the common interests of port
authorities in their relations with government, shipowners and traders.
About 130,000 people are employed in the operation of ports in the United
Kingdom. At the end of 1966 there were 61,000 dock workers registered with
the National Dock Labour Board and doing physical handling of cargo, the
remainder including administrative, clerical and technical staff, and pilots,
lightermen and customs officials.
Because arrivals and departures of ships are liable to occur at irregular
intervals without conforming to set schedules a system of largely casual
labour has always existed at the docks in the past. However, a start was made
on ‘decasualisation’ in 1941 when war-time controls were imposed. In 1947
the National Dock Labour Board was established, with members appointed by
the Minister of Labour and representing both employers and employed.
The Board administers a scheme under which registered workers receive a
guaranteed minimum wage for attendance even when no work is available.
Following the publication in 1965 of the Devlin report (see Bibliography,
p. 510) the National Modernisation Committee for the Port Transport Industry
was set up, with members from management and labour, and independent
members, to negotiate complete ‘decasualisation’. New arrangements, placing
the entire labour force in employment on a permanent basis with licensed
employers, came into operation in September 1967.
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude
oil are berthed at special tanker terminals which are near the oil refineries
and are owned and operated by the oil companies. The maximum deadweight
tonnage of tankers that some of the most important terminals can accommodate
at present is: Finnart (West of Scotland) 100,000; Isle of Grain (Thames
estuary) 42,000; Coryton (London) 45,000; Tilbury Reach (London) 47,000;
Thames Haven (London) 60,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 65,000; Milford
Haven (Pembroke) 100,000; and Fawley (Southampton) 90,000. Long
pipelines connect Finnart with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth of
Forth, and Angle Bay (Milford Haven) with the refinery at Llandarcy (near
Swansea). Facilities are being extended to accommodate larger vessels; Finnart
and Milford Haven will be able to accept tankers of 200,000 tons.
A deep-water oil terminal, to cost £2-7 million, is being built at Immingham
to serve two new oil refineries.

Long-term
Trends in
Transport and
Traffic
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly
by road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland
waterways and pipelines are important in carrying certain types of freight,
particularly bulk cargoes. A small proportion of traffic goes by air.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is nationalised; namely,
the railways, passenger transport in the London area, certain road haulage
and road passenger services, most of the inland waterways and some of the
vessels on them. Many local authorities and private firms run road passenger
services, while road haulage is largely, and coastal shipping entirely, in the
hands of private enterprise.
In the last quarter of 1966 there were over 13 million vehicles licensed for
use on the roads. Of these, 9-5 million were motor cars and 1 -4 million motor
cycles. Road goods vehicles numbered 1 -6 million, of which 1 -9 per cent were
operated by nationalised transport services, which also owned 28 per cent of
the public road passenger vehicles.
In 1965, 60 per cent of freight, in terms of ton-mileage,2 travelled by road,
23 per cent by rail, 16 per cent by coastal shipping, and 1 per cent by pipeline.
The rapid growth of private and commercial motor traffic, causing congestion
problems of increasing severity, especially in cities and towns, and the changing
pattern of demand for transport services have led the Government to under¬
take a series of long-term studies of probable trends in transport and problems
which may arise therefrom. A survey of needs for inland transport facilities
over the next 20 years (the Hall report, published in March 1963) envisaged
an annual rate of increase in total traffic of 4 to 5 per cent; a large rise in
ownership of private cars by 1980; and a further switch of goods traffic from
rail to road. A systematic assessment of the future of the railway system was
also published in the same month (the Beeching report) and supplemented by
a further report in February 1965.
The study group set up to make an independent report on the long-term
problems of traffic in urban areas issued its report (the Buchanan report) in
November 1963. It estimated that Britain would have 40 million vehicles on
its roads by a.d. 2010 and proposed radical measures to rebuild and adapt
cities and roads to handle the growth of traffic.
A White Paper, Transport Policy (Cmnd. 3057), published in July 1966,
set out the Government’s plans to integrate and modernise the national
transport system. It proposed: that a decision should be taken on the size and
shape of the future basic railway network; that the British Railways Board
should be relieved of the responsibility for losses on services maintained for
reasons of social need; and that the Board’s financial and management struc¬
ture should be overhauled. Other proposals included a national freight
organisation, a review of road haulage licensing arrangements and nationalisa¬
tion of the ports. The necessary legislation is to be introduced.
Regional Passenger Transport Co-ordinating Committees covering the
whole of England and Wales were set up in 1967 and in January 1967 an
Urban Transport Research and Development Group was established to advise
the Ministry of Transport.

Financial Changes
The present role and structure of the nationalised transport undertakings are
the result of a series of legislative measures, starting with the 1947 Transport
Act under which they were taken into public ownership. In accordance with
this Act the British Transport Commission (BTC) was established on
1st January 1948 and assumed control of Britain’s railways, all railway-owned
steamships, docks, hotels and road transport interests, most of the country’s
canals (including all those owned by the railways), certain rivers (as navigation
authority) and the whole of the London passenger transport system. It was
also to arrange for the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance
road haulage firms.
Changes of policy following the coming into power of a Conservative
Government in 1951 were put into effect under the Transport Act 1953 which
modified the functions of the BTC. The Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage
Property) Act 1956 provided for the completion of the denationalisation of
road haulage, a process begun under the 1953 Act. Later it was decided that
the activities of the BTC were so large and diverse that they could not be
run effectively as a single undertaking. The Transport Act 1962 therefore
dissolved the BTC and set up four Boards for British Railways, London
Transport, British Transport Docks and British Waterways. Each of these
is responsible directly to the Minister of Transport, who appoints the
members.
Road passenger and haulage undertakings, such as British Road Services, the
Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibuses Group, Road Freight Shipping
Services, Thomas Cook and Son and other holdings, are operated as com¬
panies incorporated under the Companies Act, with their own boards; they
are grouped under a Transport Holding Company, responsible to the Minister
of Transport, who appoints its directors. The hotel property of the BTC was
transferred to British Transport Hotels Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, first
of the BTC and later of the British Railways Board.
The cross-channel shipping services operated by British Railways and
certain ports and docks used for them passed to the British Railways Board.
Each board is required to conduct its business so as to pay its way, taking
one year with another, and to set up general reserves. However, the British
Railways Board, the London Transport Board and the British Waterways
Board may receive financial assistance from the Exchequer for six years from
vesting date. All the boards may borrow up to specified limits from the Minister
with the approval of the Treasury. The Act facilitates operations on a commer¬
cial basis by conferring on the boards powers to sell or develop their land and
to construct and operate pipelines, and by freeing them from controlled charges
schemes. Except for railway passenger fares in the London Passenger Trans¬
port area, certain harbour charges and road passenger fares in an area including
London, the boards are free to fix the rates charged for their services. The
boards are also released from common carrier obligations as regards carriage
by rail or inland waterway.
The Treasury assumed responsibility for outstanding British Transport Com¬
mission stock (amounting to about ^1,450 million) and the four boards and the
Transport Holding Company assumed debts to the Minister broadly equivalent
in aggregate to the total British Transport Commission stock and existing debt
in respect of loans previously made by the Minister for capital purposes. Of the
BTC’s accumulated deficit, on revenue account 1948-62, £392 million had
already been met by grant, and the balance of the total deficit of £875 million
was written off.

Under the Transport Finances Act 1966 the limit on the Government
subsidy to the British Railways Board, previously £450 million to the end of
1967, was raised to £800 million to the end of 1968. The Act also enabled the
Government to pay a £16 million subsidy to the London Transport Board
over the same period.
A Nationalised Transport Advisory Council of up to 12 members advises
the Minister on questions relating to the co-ordination and other aspects of
the nationalised transport undertakings. Another body, the Transport
Tribunal, sits in two divisions, one having jurisdiction over changes of London
road and rail fares and the other hearing appeals relating to applications for
road haulage licences. The Area Transport Users’ Consultative Committee,
originally set up under the 1947 Transport Act to consider complaints and
suggested improvements of nationalised transport services, now participates
in the statutory procedure which the Railways Board and the London Trans¬
port Board must follow if they want to close a railway passenger service. The
area committee concerned in any particular case considers objections from users
and reports to the Minister, who then decides whether to consent to the closure.
There is also machinery whereby complaints on charges from coastal
shipping in connection with competition from the railways may be made to
the Minister of Transport.
Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and of the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when
George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century
of widespread railway development. The great period of railway building
was from 1840 to 1875.
The railways first came under centralised government direction during the
first world war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated
into four large regional groups under the Railways Act 1921. Thereafter they
suffered from the prolonged industrial depression and growing competition
from road transport, and following the second world war the Transport Act
1947 brought the railways under public ownership as a single enterprise,
British Railways. It was grouped in six regional sub-divisions and operated
under the overall management of a Railway Executive established as the agent
of the BTC. The 1953 Transport Act abolished the Railway Executive and
provided for decentralisation of the administration. Under the Transport
Act 1962 the British Railways Board was set up and came into existence on
1 st January, 1963, with sole responsibility for managing railway affairs. Under
the Act the railways were relieved of much of their burden of accumulated
debt and were given freedom to alter their charges at will, except for passenger
fares in the London area. The Board’s responsibilities for the operation of the
various parts of the system are delegated to five regional boards.
The process of rationalisation arising from changing public transport require¬
ments is reflected in the reduction of over 4,400 miles of standard-gauge route
since 1961. A total of 835 million passenger journeys was made and 214 million
tons of freight traffic conveyed on British Railways in 1966. The financial
position of the railways has not improved as quickly as was hoped despite
increases in fares and freight charges. The operating deficit in 1966 was
^71 '6 million, while there was a surplus of £6-4 million on other activities—
ships, harbours, hotels and letting of land. At the end of 1966, 338,951 people
were employed by railways, a reduction of 136,271 in four years.

In 1966 British Transport Hotels Ltd. managed 32 hotels, the catering
facilities on trains (including Pullman trains), as well as refreshment rooms at
204 stations, by agreement with the British Railways Board.
British Railways’ subsidiary, British Rail Hovercraft Ltd., set up in 1966,
runs regular hovercraft services across the Solent to the Isle of Wight.
In 1955 the BTC produced a modernisation plan which was designed to
transform virtually all the services offered by the railways. The plan has since
been modified in the light of ensuing economic and technical developments.
Capital expenditure has been substantial over the past few years and amounted
to ^107 million in 1966.
In spite of the considerable injection of new capital over the period 1955-62
British Railways incurred a steadily increasing overall deficit (including
interest charges), which rose to a peak of more than £150 million in 1962.
The new Railways Board was given the task of preparing a scheme for re¬
organising the railways in such a way that they could be run as a commercially
viable undertaking. In March 1963 a Report on the Reshaping of British
Railways (‘Beeching Report’) was published and was accepted in principle by
the Government. Its proposals included the withdrawal of passenger services
from about a third of the country’s railway system. These little-used lines
carried only 1 per cent of the total passenger traffic.
Other important proposals were for the improvement of inter-city passenger
services, with the emphasis on speed, reliability and comfort; the introduction
of express freight services (‘freightliner trains’) to link all the main industrial
areas; increased mechanisation in the carrying of coal (the railways’ most
profitable traffic); and the continuing replacement of steam by diesel and
electric traction. A further report, The Development of the Major Railway
Trunk Routes, was published in February 1965.
As promised in the White Paper on Transport Policy (see p. 348), a basic
network of railway routes, secure from closure, was announced in March
1967. The network covers 11,000 route miles. The position of the remaining
2,500 is still subject to review.
On main lines in 1955 there were about 18,000 steam, 7 main line diesel and
71 electric locomotives. At the end of 1966 the corresponding figures were
1,689 steam, 4,962 diesel and 340 electric locomotives. In addition, there
were 4,087 diesel and 7,293 electric passenger-carrying multiple units.
Passenger services have improved in speed and comfort with the replace¬
ment of steam by electric or diesel traction, which has also helped to reduce
operating costs. The replacement of steam locomotives is almost complete.
The replacement of out-of-date passenger coaches by new stock, with improved
amenities, is still proceeding.
On certain sections of the London-Bristol-South Wales line and of the
London-Edinburgh line passenger trains are permitted to run at up to
100 m.p.h. Similar speeds are also in operation on the London Midland
Region’s services on the electrified line between London and Manchester and
Liverpool, introduced in 1966. This electrification scheme was the largest
modernisation project undertaken by British Railways and included station
reconstruction, bridge works, a new colour-light signalling system and new
rolling stock. The total cost was ^160 million. The final stages of the scheme
involving extension of the electrified route to Birmingham and Wolverhampton
via Rugby and Coventry and to Manchester via Stoke were completed in
1967. Other electrification projects completed in 1967 include a £6^ million

extension to the Glasgow suburban service, and the ^15 million London to
Southampton and Bournemouth scheme.
There has been considerable development of motorail services (carrying
both passengers and cars) and in May 1966 the world’s first car-train terminal
was opened in London.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new and modern
type freight vehicles come into service and as facilities for concentrating freight
traffic at fewer and better equipped and sited marshalling yards and terminals
are completed. There are now fully automated marshalling yards at Tinsley,
near Sheffield, and Bescot, near Walsall, providing faster and smoother
working with considerable saving in labour costs. To exploit the trend towards
greater use of standardised containers an inland freight depot has been set up at
Lawley Street, Birmingham, for customs clearance of imports and exports.
‘Freightliner’ services using specially designed containers and rolling stock
now link many centres, for example, London with Glasgow, Manchester,
Liverpool and Aberdeen, and Glasgow with Liverpool and Manchester.
Efforts are being made to secure more bulk products traffic. Oil is being
moved from refineries under long-term contracts, while coal is being fed
direct from collieries to power stations in ‘merry-go-round’ trains, on which
coal is loaded and discharged automatically from a new type of high-capacity
wagon. Long-term contracts have also been signed for the carriage of cars,
china clay, milk, grain and newspapers.
A Railway Technical Centre has been erected at Derby; it covers 20 acres
and will eventually employ about 1,500 people. A projected 150 m.p.h.
gas-turbine passenger train is one of the developments under study.
Early in 1964 the British and French Governments agreed in principle to the
construction of a rail Channel Tunnel (either a bored tunnel or an immersed
tube). The construction cost is estimated at £155-^170 million (1966 prices).
It is expected that the Tunnel will be open in the mid-1970s.
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to
set up a central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established
by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909. In 1919 the
Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the newly established Ministry
of Transport.
In April 1967 Great Britain had over 200,000 miles of public highway.
There were 8,770 miles of trunk roads including 446 miles of motorway,
20,154 miles of principal roads, and over 170,000 miles of other roads. Roads
are classified according to their traffic value, those of purely local traffic
importance remaining unclassified. As a result of the Local Government Act
1966 the classification into classes I, II and III (still retained for certain
purposes) has been superseded in the making of grants for road building by
a new category of ‘principal’ roads. On maps and signposts the trunk and
principal roads can usually be identified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route
number. Trunk roads are the main arteries of national traffic and the whole
cost of their upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The Minister of Transport
is the highway authority for trunk roads in England and on these roads he
administers expenditure, which is provided wholly from central government
sources, although for many purposes he employs local authorities as his
agents. The highway authority for principal roads is, in general, the council
of the county or county borough in whose area the roads lie. The Minister
makes specific grants towards approved expenditure on construction and
major improvement of these roads and contributions from public funds

towards maintenance and other expenditure is made through grants to local
authorities. The Secretary of State for Scotland has corresponding responsi¬
bilities for roads in Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales for roads
in Wales. Roads, other than trunk and principal roads, are entirely the
responsibility of the local authority in whose area they lie.
While it was impossible for several years immediately following the second
world war to spend much more on the roads than was required for their
essential maintenance, a large and steadily expanding road-building pro¬
gramme has now been in progress since 1955. Public expenditure on new and
improved roads in Great Britain is estimated at over ^265 million in 1967-68,
and a further steady growth is planned. A substantial proportion is devoted
to work in urban areas. The current programme includes a considerable
mileage of motorways constructed for the use of limited classes of traffic
under powers granted by the Special Roads Act 1949 (consolidated in the
Highways Act 1959)- It also includes the building or reconstruction of 350
miles of all-purpose trunk roads.
The motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national
network of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this
programme will eliminate some of the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and
thus help to give free outlets from the big cities and from other main sources
of traffic to the trunk routes.
It is planned that 1,000 miles of motorways should be completed by the
early 1970s. At the end of May 1967, in England and Wales, 457^ miles had
been opened for traffic and construction had started, or tenders had been
invited, for a further 142I miles. The lines of a further 287 miles had been
fixed and draft schemes published for a further 165! miles. It is probable that
680 miles of motorways will be completed and in use by 1970. Among the
motorways in England and Wales open to traffic or under construction in
May 1967 were:
Mi—London to Yorkshire (Leeds). The projected length of this motorway
is 196J miles, providing links between London, Birmingham and the
north; 135! miles have been opened to traffic. A 4-mile extension south¬
wards into London (the Hendon Urban Motorway) was opened in 1967.
M2—Medway motorway, London to Dover. The 25 miles of this motorway
came into use in 1963.
M4—London to South Wales. The projected length of this road, which
will link London with Newport, is 140 miles. In the east, 24 miles are in
use from Chiswick to Maidenhead, including a one-mile spur to London
Airport; a section of 38^ miles of road from Newport (Monmouthshire) to
Tormarton (Gloucestershire) including the bridge over the Severn was
completed in 1967.
M5-Birmingham to Bristol. Of this 114-mile motorway eventually reaching
to Edithmead (22 miles beyond Bristol), the first 26 miles running south
from Birmingham were opened in July 1962 and a further 6 miles of the
northward link with the M6 was opened in 1965. There will be a connection
with the M4 north of Bristol. The 21-mile Ross Spur (M50), opened in
i960, links the M5 with the existing road system leading from Ross-on-Wye
(Herefordshire) to South Wales.
M6—Birmingham to Carlisle. The projected length of this road is 229!
miles (including the links in the Midlands with Mi and M5); the 125^ miles

linking Darlaston with Lancaster are open to traffic. It includes the 8|-mile
Preston bypass, the first section of motorway in Britain, opened in 1958.
The southward link connecting Darlaston and Dunston (14^ miles) was
completed in 1966.
M62—Lancashire to Yorkshire. A 6-mile stretch from Stretford to Eccles
bypass was finished in i960. A further 6 miles between Rochdale and
Huddersfield are under construction.
Draft schemes have been published for the 40-mile M3 from London to
Basingstoke, 34 miles of the Mu from London towards Cambridge, and the
26-mile M23 from London to Crawley. Part of the route of the M56 North
Cheshire Motorway has been settled.
In Scotland about 78 miles of motorways are planned including motorways
between Glasgow and Edinburgh and Edinburgh and Stirling and a 16-mile
section between Glasgow and Carlisle (the first 9-mile section, the Hamilton
bypass, was opened at the end of 1966). Altogether about 16 miles of motorway
are now open.
Notable schemes for improving existing trunk roads include that for the
Great North Road (Ai) between London and Newcastle, which is nearing
completion and will provide dual carriageways throughout. Improvements on
the A40 route, linking London with Gloucester and South Wales via Oxford,
include a i3|-mile bypass around High Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire, built
to motorway standards. The first stage of this was completed in 1967, and the
remaining stretch should be finished in 1968.
The largest bridge-building programme in Britain for over a century is
approaching completion. The £2-3 million Medway Bridge, which is part of
the M2 and one of the largest prestressed concrete structures of its kind in the
world, was completed in 1963 and the suspension bridge across the Firth of
Forth, one of the longest bridges in the world, was opened in 1964. The Severn
Bridge, incorporating major advances in suspension bridge design, and the
7,000-ft. bridge across the Firth of Tay were opened in 1966. Under con¬
struction is a £6 million high-level bridge over the Clyde.
The second Blackwall Tunnel (under the Thames) costing £6-5 million and
the ^13 ^million Tyne Tunnel between Wallsend (Northumberland) and
JarrowT (Durham) were opened in 1967. The ^11 million Dartford-Purfleet
tunnel (under the Thames) has been open to traffic since the end of 1963.
Work on the £20 million second Mersey Tunnel began in 1967 and is due for
completion in 1970.
Research on roads is carried out at the Road Research Laboratory (see p. 200).
Its aims are to find more economical ways of designing, constructing and
maintaining roads and of facilitating the flowr of traffic on them and to reduce
road accidents. The layout of roads, their traffic, the safety features of road
vehicles and the behaviour of road users are investigated, and new methods,
materials and processes are developed for building roads and providing
them with a smooth, safe and durable surface. The Laboratory has a Tropical
Section, which undertakes research and advice on road problems overseas.
In 1966 there were over 13 million motor vehicles licensed to use Great
Britain’s roads. Of these, i-6 million were goods vehicles and 94,000 were
public road passenger vehicles (that is, buses and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles
and road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the

railways. The first step towards government regulation of public road
transport was the passing of the London Traffic Act 1924, which gave the
Minister of Transport power to control the number of buses and their
journeys in London; this was followed in 1933 by the setting up of the London
Passenger Transport Board (see p. 359).
The Road Traffic Act 1930 ended the licensing of public service vehicles
(that is, buses and coaches) by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas,
of which there are now eleven, covering the whole country and each under
the control of three traffic commissioners (except for the London metropolitan
area, which has one) appointed by the Minister. The commissioners regulate,
by means of a licensing system, all public road passenger transport services,
and they sanction routes and time-tables in order to secure proper co-ordina¬
tion of services and eliminate unnecessary competition; they may also control
fares.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 established a system of licensing for
road haulage vehicles, which is still in operation, designed to restrict vehicle
operations to proved needs and to eliminate wasteful competition. A licence
has to be secured from the licensing authority (the chairman of the appropriate
body of traffic commissioners) before a goods vehicle can be used on the road.
There are three types of licence: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage;
the ‘B’ licence for public haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and
covering also the carriage of the licensee’s own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for
the carriage by traders solely of their own goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’
licences are examined by the licensing authorities to see if they are necessary
in view of existing transport services, and competitors may raise objections.
There is a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal against the decision of
the licensing authorities. The ‘C’ licence is granted on application, as of right.
All goods vehicle operators are bound by regulations concerning the fitness and
loading of vehicles, the movements of large vehicles likely to obstruct traffic,
the keeping of records, and driving hours and rest periods of their employees.
The main licensing provisions contained in the Road Traffic Act 1930, and
the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933, as subsequently amended, were con¬
solidated in the Road Traffic Act i960.
New licensing arrangements are to be introduced. It is proposed to
strengthen control of long-distance haulage and to abolish ‘C’ licensing for
light vehicles. Road haulage would be prevented from competing with British
Railways’ freightliner trains where these were considered to provide as good a
service.
From September 1956 to January 1963 the nationalised road haulage services
were controlled by British Road Services (BRS), a division of the British
Transport Commission, and operated through five companies, which together
owned about 16,000 vehicles: British Road Services Ltd. (general haulage);
BRS (Pickfords) Ltd. (special traffic and some contracts); BRS (Contracts)
Ltd.; BRS (Parcels) Ltd.; and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. Under the Transport
Act 1962, these organisations have been operating as companies incorporated
under the Companies Act, with their own boards. They are grouped together
under the Transport Holding Company, responsible to the Minister of
Transport. All the companies’ vehicles are subject to the licensing system.
The number of licensed vehicles in the road goods transport industry has
shown only a relatively slow growth, from 1-4 million in i960 to 1-5 million
in 1966, when 1,245,000 were on ‘C’ licence. Of the other 240,000 vehicles,
356

with ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences, about 19,000 are operated by British Road Services.
There are only a few operators with large fleets of vehicles in any of the licence
categories. ‘C’ licence vehicles include a large number of small vehicles used
locally in the delivery of groceries and other goods. Other vehicles in this class
are engaged in long-distance carriage of traders’ own goods.
With the exception of the London transport system which is operated by the
London Transport Board, road passenger transport in Great Britain is run
by about 5,000 operators, 95 of them being local authorities owning and
operating urban bus and trolleybus services. About 4,700 are independent
operators of coaches and, of these, 3,600 have not more than 5 vehicles. Most
of the remainder operate both bus and coach services and belong to three main
groups—Tilling, Scottish Omnibuses and British Electric Traction. The
British Electric Traction Group is a private concern but substantial share¬
holdings in many of its companies, without any controlling interest, are held
by the Transport Holding Company, who own Tilling and Scottish Omni¬
buses. The Tilling bus companies are grouped into six regions covering
England and Wales, with a total vehicle strength of about 9,400. The Scottish
group, with a vehicle strength of 4,700, covers most of Scotland, with the
exception of the major municipalities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and
Aberdeen and services in the Highlands and Islands.
There are some 250 concerns operating fleets of over 24 vehicles, about
one-third of which are local authorities, the largest being the Corporations of
Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester.
Britain has the highest density of road traffic in the world. In 1966, 7,985
people were killed on the roads and about 384,000 injured. This compares with
over 7,000 persons killed and 230,000 injured in 1934, when there was one-
fifth of the present number of motor vehicles on the roads—an indication
that the problems have, to some extent, been held in check by road safety
measures introduced since 1930. Since 1946 the volume of traffic has at least
trebled: but road accident casualities have only doubled. The fatal accident rate
in Britain is better than that in most other European countries, but slightly
worse than in the United States. Road accident statistics are compiled and
published by the Ministry of Transport, the Scottish Development Depart¬
ment and the Welsh Office from reports made by the police.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. The more important measures
directed primarily towards road safety include speed limits of 30 and 40 m.p.h.
in and around built-up areas and 50 m.p.h. on certain trunk and important
classified roads in rural areas; the provision of pedestrian crossings—some
illuminated by flashing beacons and marked with conspicuous white stripes
(‘zebra’ crossings); and the system of road markings and traffic signs (which
are being replaced by greatly improved signs over the next few years).
A 70 m.p.h. speed limit is in force on all motorways and, on a temporary
basis, on ordinary main roads where no lower limit applies.
The safety of vehicles, both in design and use, is controlled by regulations;
a system of vehicle testing, which applies at present to vehicles three or more
years old, is being gradually extended. Heavy goods vehicles were previously
subject to a separate procedure of spot checks but legislation enacted in 1967
established a system of annual tests and stricter requirements in respect of the
condition of vehicles.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Relief of Congestion
357
All drivers of motor vehicles, including motor cycles, motor scooters and
powered pedal cycles, unless they have either held a full British licence or
passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the test before
being granted a full licence to drive.1 Until they pass the test they must obtain
a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’ (Learner) plates
on their vehicle, and in all cases where vehicles are constructed to carry
passengers, other than pillion passengers, learner drivers must be accompanied
by a qualified driver (a person who holds a current driving licence for the
same type of vehicle as that driven by the learner). A learner driver of a motor
cycle is restricted, until he passes the driving test, to a machine not exceeding
250 c.c.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26
most serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users—pedestrians and drivers—and a sum¬
mary of the requirements of the law is set out in easily understandable form
in the Highway Code. A failure to oberve the code does not of itself render a
person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any
such proceedings.
A National Road Safety Advisory Council was set up by the Minister of
Transport in 1965 to keep under review the road accident situation in Great
Britain and methods of accident prevention, and to report on other matters
affecting road safety.
A Bill making it an offence to drive with more than a prescribed level of
alcohol in the blood became law in 1967.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads
are conducted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, acting
as the Government’s agent and with the participation of the local authorities.
The police and education authorities also help by arranging courses of
instruction, especially courses for children.
In a White Paper (see Bibliography, p. 511) the Government has announced
proposals for reducing accidents. These include the setting up of a central
road safety unit within the Ministry of Transport, extension of local authority
activity in safety matters, publicity and training campaigns, and a review of
pedestrian safety.
The Road Traffic and Roads Improvement Act i960 permits the employment
of traffic wardens (with strictly limited powers), and provides for fixed
penalties (the ‘ticket’ system) for parking offences. Other measures in the
Act, designed to reduce traffic congestion, include the granting of greater
powers of action to local traffic authorities. In 1965 the Greater London
Council became the traffic authority (formerly the responsibility of the
Minister of Transport) for the whole of Greater London. Several extensive
schemes for the improvement of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion
are being undertaken: these include ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new outlet
roads from cities; and the designation of certain stretches of trunk roads as
‘clearways’, on which waiting on the carriageway is (with certain exceptions)
prohibited. In London and most of the other large towns street parking in
certain areas is permitted only for limited periods and on payment at parking
meters, and increased off-street parking facilities are being provided; some
towns, such as Leicester and Cheltenham, are experimenting with other
methods of controlled street parking.

The System
Increasing use is being made of traffic management to promote the smoother
and more rapid flow of traffic. In i960 a Traffic Management Unit was set
up in London by the Minister of Transport. This was superseded in 1965 by
a Traffic Advisory Unit, with the object of making available to all traffic
authorities the experience gained in London and elsewhere since i960. The
main measures introduced are comprehensive control of street parking and
comprehensive one-way working systems. Others include the banning of turns,
particularly right turns, peak hour clearways and ‘tidal flow’ arrangements.
A computer-controlled system to regulate traffic is being installed in West
London.
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from
the collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester.
This marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain, with which
the names of Brindley, Telford, Rennie, Jessop and other great engineers are
associated. Canals played an important part in promoting industrial and
commercial expansion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The whole canal system was practically complete by 1830. As a result of
developing competition from the railways, however, about one-third of the
canal mileage had passed to the control of the railway companies by the middle
of the nineteenth century. During the two world wars government control of
railways included railway-owned canals. Under the Transport Act 1947, most
of the country’s canals passed to the British Transport Commission in
January 1948. From 1955 the canals were managed separately by the water¬
ways division of the Commission, known as British Waterways; under the
Transport Act 1962, control has been vested in the British Waterways Board
since 1st January 1963.
There are about 2,500 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain,1
some 2,000 miles of which belong to the British Waterways Board; the
remainder are mainly still in the hands of local authorities or private com¬
panies. Many of the Board’s canals are narrow waterways which can generally
be used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of carrying a load
varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder are broad waterways and canalised
rivers some of which can be used by craft of up to about 700 tons capacity.
The Caledonian and Crinan canals in Scotland are broad waterways. Of the
2,000 miles of inland waterways under the control of the British Waterways
Board some 300 miles are major commercial waterways and a further 100 miles
are used for specialised commercial traffic. It is proposed to maintain on a
permanent basis a substantial additional mileage for purposes of recreation;
an advisory council is to be set up.
For certain operational purposes, such as maintenance engineering and
estates work, the canals of England and Wales are administered from two
regional centres, one at Gloucester and the other at Leeds. Sales promotion
is, in the main, centrally and nationally directed by the Board’s headquarters
in London. In Scotland the canals (other than the Caledonian, which is run
by a manager) are, for engineering purposes, under the control of an area
engineer; estates work is supervised centrally.
In 1966 total traffic on British waterways amounted to just over 7-6 million
tons, of which 2-9 million tons were coal, 1-9 million tons liquids in bulk and
2-8 million tons general cargo. Some 95 per cent of the total traffic is carried

on about 400 miles of broad waterways, which are mainly canalised rivers.
Although the British Waterways Board is the largest single carrying
operator, most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders
in their own craft. The Board at the end of 1966 owned 14 tugs and 795
carrying craft, with a carrying capacity of 34,544 tons, including 88 power-
driven craft with a carrying capacity of 5,309 tons.
The British Waterways Board now controls about 300 miles of first-class
waterways linking important industrial districts with ports. Large investments
in improved facilities have been made. These waterways are the Aire and
Calder Navigation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, the Trent
Navigation, the Lee Navigation, part of the river Severn, including the
Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, the Weaver Navigation and the Grand Union
Canal (below Slough).
The total revenue of the British Waterways Board in 1966 amounted to
^4-7 million, of which only £o-(i million arose from the Board’s own freight¬
carrying activities. The sale of water is an important source of revenue and
has more than trebled since 1948. British Waterways encourages pleasure
boating and receipts from this source are rising, reaching £106,386 in 1966.
Income from fishing rights was £22,515 in 1966.
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from
Charing Cross, contains over 8 million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829
when the first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared on the London streets. The
first regular tram service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863 the first
underground steam railway, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great
trench for the line and roofing it over. In 1870 the world’s first tube railway,
the Tower Subway, was constructed under the river Thames; it was cable-
operated and ran for only a few months. The first electric tube railway in the
world, the City and South London Railway, was opened in 1890, and this was
followed in 1900 by the opening of the Central London Railway. Shortly
afterwards the steam-operated underground lines were electrified. Meanwhile,
horse-drawn buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses and
electric trams.
Until 1933 there were many separate undertakings providing passenger
transport facilities in London, but in that year they were all vested in a single
public corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with
the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the London Trans¬
port Executive took over control as an agency of the Commission.
Under the Transport Act 1962 the London Transport Executive has been
replaced by a financially independent board, the London Transport Board.
Exchequer loans finance the Board’s external capital needs. The limits
of its borrowing powers were raised by £50 million to £250 million in 1965.
Under the 1966 Transport Finances Act the Government is enabled to pay,
till the end of 1968, a subsidy of up to £16 million to London Transport to
meet losses due to road congestion, the fall in numbers of bus passengers and
general rising costs.
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger
transport services in the London area with the exception of the London lines
of British Railways and the taxicabs. (Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire

in the streets are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are
licensed annually by the metropolitan police.) London Transport’s operations
extend beyond Greater London to cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known
as the London Passenger Transport Area) within a radius of about 25 miles
from Charing Cross and with a population of io£ million. Between 1956
and 1966 the number of passenger journeys made annually on the London
Transport system fell from 3,914 million to 2,645 million, largely owing to
increased private motoring and changes in leisure-time habits, such as the
increase in television viewing.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south
and 32 miles from east to west. The total length of the railway over which
London Transport trains operate is 244 miles, of which 88 miles are under¬
ground. London Transport trains serve 273 stations, and its buses and coaches
travel over 3,200 miles of roads. To carry traffic over all this area, in December
1966 London Transport owned 4,069 railway cars and 7,922 buses and
coaches. The total staff employed was 73,816.
Improvements carried out by London Transport have included complete
renewal of the bus and coach fleet, replacement of trams and trolleybuses by
diesel buses, and extension and modernisation of parts of the Underground
system. In 1962 work started on the building of a new lo^-mile tube railway
between Victoria Station and Walthamstow, in north-east London. It is
estimated that the work will cost about £60 million and it is hoped to open
the northern section of the line towards the end of 1968, and the remainder in
1969. A j£i6 million, 3|-mile extension from Victoria to Brixton in South
London has been approved and should be open by 1972.
Public transport in Northern Ireland is in the process of being reorganised.
The Ulster Transport Authority is still responsible for all rail services in
Northern Ireland, but as a result of the withdrawal of certain passenger and
freight services in 1965 the total railroad mileage has been reduced to 203
miles. The Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 ended the monopoly of
the Ulster Transport Authority in the carriage of goods by road, and on
1st July 1966 a private enterprise system of road haulage under licence was
created. A new company has been set up to take over the road passenger
operations formally carried out by the Authority. Pending the enactment of
legislation, the Authority, which in the past provided all public road passenger
services in Northern Ireland, apart from Belfast city services, is giving consent
to a limited number of private operators to provide services in certain areas.
Legislation has been introduced for the winding up of the Authority, the
provision of an organisation to operate the present railway system and
the provision of a limited licensing system for private and passenger
operators.
On 31st March 1967, there were 13,971 miles of public roads in Northern
Ireland, comprising 387 miles of trunk roads, 983 miles of Class I roads,
1,728 miles of Class II roads, 2,869 miles of Class III roads and 8,004 miles of
unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Development is directly responsible for the trunk road
system and bears the entire cost of maintenance and reconstruction work on
these roads. In addition to major reconstruction schemes on trunk roads, an
extensive system of motorways is planned including an urban motorway
system in Belfast, part of which will be classified. About 31 miles were in use
by the middle of 1967.

The Ministry of Development administers the Road Fund (the proceeds
of motor vehicle taxation, driving licence fees, etc.), from which grants are
paid to the local authorities (county, county borough, borough and urban
district councils) who are responsible for the other roads. The rates of grant
range from 90 per cent for major improvement works on Class I roads to
25 per cent for maintenance work on the unclassified roads.
Gross capital expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March
1967 was £13-1 million, and expenditure on maintenance and minor improve¬
ments was about million. Gross capital expenditure in the five-year
period is expected to be about £75 million, compared with about
£41 million in the five-year period to 1966. Expenditure on maintenance and
minor improvements in the five-year period to 1966 was £27 million.
CIVIL AVIATION
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the
Coronation of King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular
mail and passenger services, which were inaugurated on 25th August 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow)
and Paris (Le Bourget).
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited, which received a government grant of ^1 million. This company
pioneered the commercial development of intercontinental air routes. By
1929 there was a through service from England to India. In 1931 the first
service was established to Central Africa. The first mail service to Australia
started in December 1934, followed by a passenger service in 1935.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation, took over
the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited
in 1940. British European Airways was established under the Civil Aviation
Act 1946 as a separate public corporation to cover the United Kingdom
and Europe. In addition to the two nationalised corporations, there are about
30 independent air transport operators.
General responsibility for the development of United Kingdom civil aviation
was transferred in 1966 from the Ministry of Aviation to the Board of Trade.
Under the post-war nationalisation legislation the air corporations had a
statutory monopoly of British scheduled services, and independent operators
were confined, broadly, to charter work. From 1949, and increasingly from
1952, the independents were allowed to develop new scheduled services,
provided they secured Ministerial approval and operated, technically, as
associates of the corporations. The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act i960
abolished the corporations’ monopoly and provided for a licensing system,
administered by an Air Transport Licensing Board, to which the nationalised
and independent operators could apply on an equal footing for licences for
scheduled or charter services, or for revocation or variation of existing licences.
The ATLB is an independent body of six to ten members appointed by the
Board of Trade. Its main function is to consider and decide on applications for
licences (or their revocation or variation). The ATLB must have regard to an
applicant’s financial resources, staffing, organisation, the need for the proposed
services, the adequacy of, and possible effect on, existing services, and any
objections or representations made by interested parties. It also has the
general duty of furthering the development of British civil aviation.

(BOAC)
There is provision for appeals on ATLB decisions to the Board of Trade,
who appoint independent commissioners to hear appeals publicly and report
with recommendations upon them. In the period from its inception to 31st
March 1967 the ATLB received some 8,400 applications for air service
licences of various kinds, including charters and package holiday tours, of
which some 6,500 were granted.
In 1967 the Government set up a committee to inquire into the affairs of
the civil air transport industry, including the methods by which it is regulated
and controlled.
The constitution and functions of BOAC and BEA are laid down in the Air
Corporations Act 1967 which consolidates, with certain exceptions, the
provisions of the Air Corporations Acts 1949 and 1966. Each corporation
consists of 5 to 11 members, including the chairman. The chairman of each
board is a member of the other.
In 1966 BOAC’s capital was reconstructed. The Corporation was relieved of
liability for Exchequer borrowings of £176 million, outstanding at 31st March
1965, and instead provision was made for an initial Exchequer investment in
the Corporation of £66 million. Of this, £31 million is loan capital, carrying
a fixed rate of interest, and £35 million is ‘Exchequer Dividend Capital’ on
which a variable dividend, related to each year’s earnings, is payable. The
accumulated deficit, amounting to £82-5 million at 31st March 1965, was
written off and a reconstruction reserve of some £30 million created. The
introduction of Exchequer Dividend Capital is experimental over a five-year
period. The statutory limit on BOAC’s borrowings and Exchequer Dividend
Capital is £90 million, which can be increased by Order to £120 million.
BEA’s borrowing limit remains at £110 million, which can be increased by
Order to £125 million.
The Board of Trade has certain statutory powers and duties in respect of the
air corporations, including the power, very seldom used, to give directions
of a general character as to the exercise and performance of their functions
in relation to matters affecting the national interest. With the approval of the
Treasury, the Board has power to make Exchequer advances within the limits
laid down by Parliament. The Board of Trade is responsible for approving
the lines of the corporations’ capital expenditure. The Board also sets, after
consultation with the corporations, their financial targets and, in BOAC’s
case, approves the amount payable annually as dividend. There is also close
consultation on overseas traffic rights and air safety. Day-to-day matters
concerning the corporations’ activities are the responsibility of the commercial
management of BOAC and BEA.
Total capacity-ton-miles offered on all services has more than trebled since
1959, and had risen to 1,680 million capacity-ton-miles in 1966. In 1955,
2-5 million passengers entered or left the United Kingdom by air, compared
with 5-7 million who arrived or departed by sea; in 1962 there were for the
first time more air than sea passengers, and by 1966 the figures had risen to
13-1 million by air and 8-7 million by sea.
BOAC is engaged on long-haul airline operations. Its scheduled services link
Britain with Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, Africa and
North and South America, and it also provides complete round-the-world
services. It co-operates closely with airlines of several other Commonwealth
countries; it also has financial interests in eight companies operating local and

regional services in the Far and Middle East and in the Caribbean in areas
adjacent to BOAC’s main routes.
The capacity offered on BOAC’s own scheduled services reached 1,380
million capacity-ton-miles at the end of March 1967, having risen by 54 per
cent in the last four years. Over half of this capacity was on the western routes
to North and South America. The overall load factor in 1966-67 was 54 per
cent: the break-even load factor (the figures at which operating costs are
covered) was again lower. The Corporation’s passenger fleet, made up
entirely of pure jets, consists (June 1967) of Super VC 10s (10 with a further
7 on order), VC 10s (12), Boeing yoys (19) and Boeing 336C all-freighters
(2 with another 2 on order). Six Boeing y4ys are also on order.
The VC 10, introduced into service in 1964, operates on African, Middle
East and Far East routes. The Super VC 10 (a larger and more powerful
aircraft than the standard version) went into service in April 1965 on trans¬
atlantic routes. Both aircraft have set up passenger-carrying records on many
routes. The Boeing 336C took over the transatlantic all-freighter operation in
January 1966. BOAC has reserved delivery positions on eight of the Anglo-
French Concord aircraft and on six of the projected US Boeing SSTs
(supersonic transports).
BOAC is building its own passenger terminal at Kennedy International
Airport, New York, to be completed by the autumn of 1969. The Corporation
opened a new round-the-world jet service across the South Pacific to Australia
in April 1967. It is making a substantial investment over the next ten years on
the installation of an advanced airline computer system to control a wide
variety of international activities, including accounting, flight planning, and
seat reservations.
BOAC’s financial position has shown a great improvement in the last two
years, after several years of deficits. In 1966-67 the Corporation earned a
record group operating surplus of over £23-3 million and net profits of
£23-9 million after interest on borrowings and taxation. Of its gross revenue
(£137 million) £91 million was earned in foreign currencies, of wdiich
.£59 million came from the sterling area and £32 million from the dollar
area.
BEA operates a network of services to over 80 places in Britain, Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East. Its services in Britain include a number
which cannot be operated on a commercial basis but which meet a vital
social need; these include services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
BEA maintains a close working relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft, by
agreement, use a number of European stopping points. BEA also co-operates
with other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. It has a
financial interest in several associated companies, most of which collaborate
with BEA in providing a network of services.
For the year ended 31st March 1967, the increases in capacity offered, and
passenger-miles and freight-ton-miles flown were 13-9 per cent, 11 -6 per cent
and 18-8 per cent respectively over the previous year; in the same year some
7-3 million passengers were carried, an increase of 7 per cent.
In 1966 BEA’s passenger fleet consisted of Vanguards, Viscount 800s,
Comets and Tridents. The Trident, introduced in 1964, is a three-engine
600 m.p.h. jet designed for medium-haul routes: delivery of 23 of these
aircraft was completed in 1966. A new version, the Trident 2, and 18 BAG
One-Elevens are on order.

Only twice in the past decade has BEA failed to show an overall profit.
In 1966-67 the corporation had an operating surplus of £4-3 million and there
was a net profit of £708,000 after payment of interest on borrowings. The
target level set for BEA by the Government for the five years to 1967-68
is a return of 6 per cent annually on net assets; an average return of 6-5 per
cent has been earned in the first four years (to March 1967).
The official body representing the majority of independent operators is the
British Independent Air Transport Association. The largest companies,
British United Airlines and British Eagle International Airways, however,
are not members. The Association also represents air taxi operators and a
large number of companies which, although not themselves aircraft operators,
have substantial air transport interests; total membership is 53.
Although the two State corporations had a statutory monopoly up to 1961
there has been a significant expansion in recent years not only of the number
of passengers and volume of freight carried but also in the diversity of services
operated. As well as a wide network of domestic and international services
the independent operators provide vehicle ferry services; specialised air cargo
facilities; and enable travel agents to offer low-cost all-in holidays abroad.
They have also been responsible for air transport of service personnel and
supplies all over the wrorld. They compete with BEA over several domestic
routes, including the busiest internal route in Europe, from London to
Glasgow. In 1966-67 they carried some 6J million passengers. To meet future
demand a programme of aircraft re-equipment is in progress. Several jet air¬
craft are already in service and further orders have been placed. Jet airliners
on domestic routes in Britain were first introduced by British United Airways
in 1966.
In addition to the public transport operators there are a large number of
companies engaged in miscellaneous aviation activities such as crop-spraying,
aerial survey and photography, and flying instruction.
The proportion of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air is increasing steadily.
In 1956, 1-7 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of exports (by value) were
carried by air. In 1966 the corresponding percentages were 9 and 10, and
the total value of exports, imports and re-exports by air was £1,094 million.
The chief export items are expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and vehicle
parts, and electrical and electronic products; furs and skins account for a large
proportion of the total value of re-exports by air.
At Heathrow, London, freight traffic is increasing at an annual rate of over
20 per cent and totalled 225,000 tons in 1966. Scheduled services of British
airlines carried 360,000 tons of freight in 1966, compared with 196,000 tons
in 1959.
The estimated number of aircraft on the United Kingdom register used for
business and private purposes is over 600, while approximately 500 are
owned by clubs, groups and training schools. About 14,000 student and
private pilots hold licences. About 130 companies use private aircraft and
some 80 companies are members of the Business Aircraft Users’ Association.
The Board of Trade has a general responsibility for civil aerodromes. It may
itself establish and maintain airports, and local authorities may also do so
subject to its approval. Aerodromes which are municipally or privately owned
Development
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 365
and which are used for the public transport of passengers and/or flying
instruction are subject to government licensing, inspection and regulation.
The Board of Trade is also responsible for the navigation facilities at a
number of main municipal airports.
The British Airports Authority, an independent statutory body operating
on a commercial basis, took over on 1st April 1966 the ownership and manage¬
ment of London’s two major airports (Heathrow and Gatwick), Prestwick in
Scotland, and Stansted in Essex. (The Government decided in 1967 that
Stansted should be developed as London’s third airport.) At these airports
the Board of Trade is responsible for the provision of navigation services
and may direct the Authority to take measures to control noise and
vibration.
There are approximately 124 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom;
in addition, 53 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under
civil control include 14 directly controlled by the Board of Trade, 3 in the
Channel Islands and 1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island
governments, and 41 aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 25 are
owned by municipalities. Nine of the Board of Trade’s aerodromes and 19
others are designated Customs airports; limited customs facilities are available
at a further eight aerodromes.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal airports have risen very
markedly in the last five years, and in 1966 United Kingdom civil airports
handled 234 million passengers. The number of movements of aircraft
engaged on commercial transport operations was 556,000.
For international scheduled services Heathrow and Gatwick are the main
airports, and Heathrow is the largest and busiest airport in Western Europe.
In recent years the annual increase in the number of passengers handled at
Heathrow has been about 1 million, reaching 12 million in 1966. Domestic
and European short-haul services are handled at the passenger building in
the central terminal opened in 1955. An additional building for short-haul
services is being constructed. To accommodate the rapid expansion expected
in freight movements, £23 million is being invested in a new cargo terminal
and associated developments due to be completed in 1969. Travelling time
from central London to Heathrow has been appreciably shortened since the
opening of a section of the M4 motorway in March 1965. There are plans to
build a rail link between Heathrow and central London (Victoria) and to
extend the Underground system to the airport.
The airport at Gatwick, 25 miles south of London, was opened in June
1958 as the second airport for the London area. The terminal building has
since been doubled in size; two more piers have been constructed and the
runway extended. Built alongside the main London to Brighton railway,
Gatwick airport is the first in the world to contain road, rail and air transport
in one unit. In 1966 Gatwick handled i-6 million passengers. A second main
runway is to be constructed.
A privately owned helicopter terminal (or ‘heliport’) is in operation at
Battersea on the south bank of the Thames.
Prestwick airport in Scotland has been developed to accommodate large
jet aircraft and a new passenger terminal building and freight area were
brought into use in 1964. The freight facilities are currently being extended.
A £6 million airport at Abbotsinch, near Glasgow, was opened in May
1966, taking over services from Renfrew. Owned and run by the Glasgow
Corporation, it is expected to handle over 2 million passengers a year by 1970.
Major developments completed in 1966-67 include a ^3 million scheme at

Manchester (Ringway), Glasgow (Abbotsinch) and Belfast (Aldergrove)
handled over a million passengers in 1966; Southend, Edinburgh (Turnhouse),
Birmingham and Prestwick each handled over 500,000.
The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, has been in regular public passenger service around the coasts
of Britain since 1965. New 160-ton large-capacity passenger and car ferry craft
are due to be introduced in 1968 as an extension to the present cross-Channel
services to France, making an all-year-round service possible for the first time.
The role of the Government in promoting air safety lies in research and in
setting up and supervising standards for both aircraft and personnel.
Research on aircraft design and construction is done at the Royal Aircraft
Establishments at Farnborough and Bedford, which are exceptionally well
equipped with testing facilities.
The Board of Trade determines the policy and legislative requirements for
the safe operation of civil aircraft, analyses accidents and initiates preventive
measures and research in flight safety.
All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must have a valid certificate
of airworthiness issued (or rendered valid) by the Board of Trade on the
recommendation of the Air Registration Board, which was set up in 1937 and
consists of 18 members, six of whom are independent, the others being
representatives of constructors, operators and insurers of aircraft. No aircraft
built in Britain is granted a certificate of airworthiness unless it has been
constructed in accordance with British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a
code compiled and frequently reviewed by the Board. Continued airworthiness
is ensured by regular inspection and by requiring aircraft to be maintained in
accordance with a schedule approved by the Board.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the Director of
Aviation Safety when he is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure
the safe operation of his aircraft. The Director is advised by the Board of
Trade’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline pilots) on
all matters affecting the operation of aircraft, except aircraft maintenance,
which is the responsibility of the Air Registration Board.
Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate official licence. Flight
operations inspectors check the standards maintained by the operators, which
must be adequate for purposes of the Air Operator’s Certificate.
In order to supplement the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines from
the Royal Air Force, which has declined in recent years, the College of Air
Training was set up at Ramble in i960. It is sponsored and financed by the
Government and two airways corporations. The Government may approve
independent colleges, whose standards are adequate for the training of
professional pilots. Three training schools, at Perth, Oxford and Carlisle,
have been approved so far.
Responsibility for policy, planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over the United Kingdom and the surrounding seas rests
with the national Air Traffic Control Services Organisation, under the joint
control of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Defence.

This organisation has an integrated policy and planning staff drawn from both
ministries.
In 1950 the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation introduced a
system of airways covering the main traffic routes with controlled zones
around the major airports. Subsequently, a revised and extended airways
system was brought into use to meet traffic needs. There are three main air
traffic control centres: at London for southern England, at Preston for the
north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the Atlantic
Ocean to 30° W.
A variety of radar installations and other equipment provide the means by
which the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of civil air traffic, and the
Instrument Landing System (ILS) is now installed at all major airports in
the United Kingdom. During the next few years virtually the whole of the
airspace over the United Kingdom above 5,000 feet will be brought under
surveillance by the latest types of primary and secondary radar equipment,
which will provide data to be used in two new air traffic control centres,
located at West Drayton (near London) and Prestwick. A subsidiary centre
will be located at Manchester to deal with traffic in the Manchester terminal
control area. Extensive use will be made in these centres of automatic data-
processing and other advanced electronic techniques.
The Board of Trade provides radio navigational aids to help pilots navigate
their aircraft in all weather conditions. In addition, the Board of Trade
supports the Decca Air and Marine Navigator System now operating over a
wide area of the United Kingdom and northern Europe, which can be used,
by arrangement with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted with the
appropriate receiving equipment.
Britain has pioneered in the development of all-weather landing systems.
The Blind Landing Experimental Unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment
at Bedford and private industry have worked together towards fully automatic
blind landing, which has now been achieved with passenger-carrying aircraft
of both BOAC and BEA.
Britain is a member of Eurocontrol, a European international agency con¬
cerned with the traffic control problems arising from the increasing use of
high-flying, high-speed jet aircraft. Set up in 1963 it provides control at the
higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft operating
according to civil procedures. A -£5 million experimental centre at Bretigny-
sur-Orge, near Paris, was opened in January 1967. An upper airspace control
centre is being built at Maastricht, Holland, and will come into use in 1971,
to provide services for air traffic in the north Germany-Benelux area.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides the postal and public tele¬
communications services of the United Kingdom. Although at present a
government department it is in effect a nationalised industry. It is to become
a public corporation in 1969.1
1 Details of the prospective change were given in a White Paper, Reorganisation of the
Post Office (Cmnd. 3233), published in March 1967. As in other nationalised industries,
the board will be appointed by and responsible to a Minister.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The present political head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General (see
p. 58). For most operational purposes Britain is divided into nine geographical
regions, each under a Director (two in London) with his own supporting staff.
In March 1967 the Post Office had 406,000 employees and 25,000 post offices.
The Post Office Act 1961 recognised the commercial character of the Post
Office by separating its finances from the Exchequer and giving the Postmaster
General sole responsibility for them. Post Office expenditure is subject
neither to Parliamentary control by Estimate nor to Treasury control. Income
is determined by tariffs which the Postmaster General fixes, subject only to
negative resolution of Parliament. The Post Office makes its own investment
plans, subject only to the same need for broad government approval as
applies to other nationalised industries. Like them, it is expected to aim at
an adequate return on its capital and to contribute suitably to the financing of
its investment. Its present financial target is an average return on net assets
of 8 per cent over the period 1963-64 to 1967-68.
Table 24 gives recent figures of income, profit and capital. Nearly all the
capital is invested in telecommunications, which are rapidly drawing ahead
of the postal services in size and profitability.
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from
the time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern
airmail transport. The first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830
between Liverpool and Manchester. The inauguration of the penny post
(the uniform charge for any inland distance being prepaid by means of
postage stamps, which originated in Britain) in 1840 was followed by a rapid
extension of the scope of the postal services. The registered post, ensuring
additional safety for valuable mail, wTas introduced in 1841. The money order
system, which had operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838, was
supplemented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed amounts.
Letterboxes had been instituted in London in 1855, and in 1883 the parcel
post was introduced. In 1919 the Post Office inaugurated its own motor
transport fleet and the first mail was carried by air in Britain in 1911.
Table 24 gives statistics of items of inland and overseas mail carried. Each
year about 7,500 tons of mail are carried by air within the United Kingdom.
Out of the 516 million items of overseas mail carried in 1966-67, 66 per cent
was carried by air, compared with 51 per cent in 1955-56. The air parcel
service now operates to all countries in Europe and to over 180 countries
outside Europe.
Several new highly-mechanised sorting office buildings were opened in
1967 and it is anticipated that further mechanised installations will be brought
into service in 1968.
Over the next eight years £48 million is to be spent on sorting machines
and research into new techniques. Over half of this sum will be spent on letter
coding and automatic letter-sorting machines. Letter segregating and facing
machines are being installed at over 20 centres. Postal address coding was
extended to a number of large towns in 1967.
A Postal Consultancy Service offers facilities to overseas countries to aid
them in the planning and mechanisation of their new offices; it is actively
engaged on a number of major projects overseas.

range of facilities for savings and investments (see p. 389). When the Post
Office ceases to be a government department (see p. 367) these facilities will
be carried on by a National Savings Department which will remain part of
the Civil Service. In much of the work at its counters the Post Office acts as
agent for other government departments or local authorities. The value of
some important items is shown in Table 24.

All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of
the Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission
of inland telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the
present automatic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now
one of the most up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection

between any of the 450 larger telegraph offices. The overseas telegraph
services were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable and
Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947.
The Post Office, which acquired the British services, operates all overseas
telegraph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign
telegraph companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd. continues to operate its cable
and wireless services in many dependencies and foreign countries.
Telegraph services to overseas countries are operated from Electra House in
London, the world’s largest overseas telegraph office, and from nine other
London and provincial area telegraph offices. Direct connection via the Centex
system between these British offices and the larger towns in Belgium, France,
Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy and Norway minimises delivery delay.
In addition, the Post Office is well to the fore in the development of telegraph
message relay techniques for services beyond Europe.
The Telex Service (opened in England in 1932) combines the speed of the
telephone with the accuracy of the printed word. Calls may be made direct
between the rapidly increasing number of telex users in the United Kingdom
(about 22,000 by the end of 1967) and also to over 300,000 subscribers through¬
out the world. For call charging purposes Britain is divided into 50 charging
areas, each with its own telex centre. The United Kingdom telex service is
fully automatic and immediate connection is made by direct dialling to any
subscriber in this country, and to many subscribers in Europe, New Zealand,
the United States and Canada. Other overseas calls are connected by operators
at the International Telex Exchange in London which provides a teleprinter
service to over 120 countries abroad. Once a call is established the subscriber
types his message on the keyboard of his teleprinter and it is then reproduced
simultaneously on both the sending and receiving subscribers’ installations.
Inland and overseas telex traffic is growing annually by about 25 per cent; the
Post Office is planning for a system of about 80,000 United Kingdom sub¬
scribers by 1980. The Post Office’s remotely controlled high frequency radio
station at Leafield, Oxfordshire, became fully operational in 1966. It is the
most advanced of its kind in the world and handles overseas public radio¬
telegraph, radiotelephony and telex services as well as broadcasting news
services overseas.
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Com¬
pany in 1912 it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in
the country. Hull Corporation was the only municipality to exercise its option
of operating its own service under licence from the Postmaster General; this
service (and the service in the Channel Islands, also operated under licence) is
connected to the Post Office trunk network. At the end of March 1967 there were
6,094 local telephone exchanges and about 11-4 million telephones in Britain.
In March 1967, only 259 exchanges remained to be changed to automatic
working. Trunk dialling by subscribers began in Bristol in December 1958; by
March 1967 the facility had been extended to 1,390 exchanges, serving 69 per
cent of all subscribers; by 1970 it will be available on over 90 per cent of
all telephones. The introduction of the new group routing and charging
equipment brings the advantages of quicker service, automatic accounting and
cheap long-distance calls of short duration, and constitutes the most radical
reform of the telephone service since the Post Office assumed national
responsibility for it. Telephones in London have been given all-figure numbers
in which exchange names are replaced by figures, and numbers in other large
cities are being similarly changed.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
371
Electronic exchanges are now being ordered for all new exchanges with
from 200 to 2,000 lines. The first operational electronic exchange in Europe
was opened at Ambergate, Derbyshire, in December 1966. Similar equipment
for larger exchanges is being tested.
Pulse code modulation systems are to be used to increase the circuit
capacity of lines on short-distance routes between exchanges. Equipment for
about 1,000 systems, each providing 24 circuits, has been ordered.
International subscriber dialling between London and Paris was inaugurated
in March 1963, extended to the rest of France, Belgium, Switzerland, the
Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands in 1964 and to Luxem¬
bourg in 1966. Edinburgh, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester
are now included in the network.
Operator-connected calls are handled at the London Continental Exchange,
from which nearly 1,700 direct telephone circuits give service to European
countries. These circuits are also used to send and receive pictures, and
special circuits are used for broadcast transmissions.
A radio tower, 620 feet high, has been erected in London to provide more
microwave radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television
circuits. It was opened for operational purposes in October 1965. There are
over 100 Post Office communications towers in use; one of 500 feet in
Birmingham was brought into operation early in 1967.
Special Telephone There are several specialised services available by telephone, including the
Services *999’ emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as
quickly as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade
services; the speaking clock; and a telephone weather forecast service available
in 25 centres. In London a telephone information service provides details in
English, French, Spanish and German of important events taking place in and
around the capital on the day of the call and a similar service (in English only)
in Edinburgh exists during the summer months. A recorded daily cooking
recipe is provided at 22 centres. A test match cricket score service operates
at more than 30 centres during the cricket season and a road weather service
is provided in collaboration with the Automobile Association at 18 centres
from 1 st October to 30th April.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959, enables the users of
vehicles fitted with suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive them
from, any telephone in the United Kingdom network. The area of this service
was initially restricted to South Lancashire and parts of Cheshire but a service
to cover the Greater London area was opened in 1965.
Computer Post Office computer centres are operating in London, Lytham St. Annes in
Operations Lancashire, Portsmouth, Derby and Edinburgh. An Act passed in 1967
enabled a computer data-processing service to be set up.
Private
Telecom¬

In March 1967 there were 103,000 private circuit stations not connected with
the public exchange networks. These are associated with circuits rented for
private use for telephone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo¬
telegraphy, television, music, or for the transmission of signals which
represent data for computers or operate other devices.

In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations
provide radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea
at ranges of up to some 500 and 300 miles respectively. There is also the
372

Communica¬
tions
long-distance radiotelegraph station, Portishead Radio, which communicates
with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or
aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1966-67 the stations handled 851 urgent and SOS calls
from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations operate a free medical advice service whereby the master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical authorities
on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard ship. During
1966-67, 439 medical inquiries were dealt with in this service.
The first transatlantic telephone cable, TAT 1, connecting Britain with Canada
and the United States, was laid in 1956. Many submarine telephone cables
have been laid in succeeding years. Cable and Wireless Ltd., in co-operation
with the Post Office, carried out the Commonwealth Comprehensive Telephone
Cable Plan. The plan was agreed upon in 1958, and covered the construction
of three long-distance telephone cable systems: CANTAT (2,100 nautical
miles), from Scotland to Canada, was opened in 1961; COMPAC (the longest
in the world at 8,130 nautical miles), connecting Canada, Hawaii, Fiji, New
Zealand and Australia, opened in 1963; and SEACOM (7,070 nautical miles),
connecting Australia, New Guinea, Guam, Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Singapore, was completed in stages from 1965 to 1967 and opened as a
complete system in March 1967. All three can provide 80 telephone circuits
throughout, apart from the heavily used section of SEACOM between Guam
and Australia, which can provide 160. The submarine cables are linked over¬
land across Canada and Australia by radio microwave systems. CANTAT
was the first single-cable ocean telephone system to use the new lightweight
cable developed by the Post Office and rigid two-way repeaters.
A deep-sea submarine cable system using transistors in place of valves has
been developed by British manufacturers in consultation with the Post Office
Research Station. The first of these systems will go into service in 1969
between Britain and Portugal and between Canada and Bermuda.
Many more circuits between Britain and Europe have been provided by
cables laid across the North Sea since 1964. Others are being laid between
Britain and Norway and the Netherlands.
The Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in Cornwall was
brought into operation in 1962. After participating in the experimental
phases of commercial satellite communication, it is now in regular use
providing telephone circuits for the public service between Britain and North
America, and occasional television transmission facilities across the North
Atlantic. Major extensions are being carried out; they include a second
parabolic aerial, to be completed in 1968, enabling the station to work to most
parts of the world via the satellites of the INTELSAT system (International
Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, of which Britain is one of the
founder members and the second largest shareholder).
14 Finance
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (that is, the
central Government and local authorities) finance their activities—how their
expenditure is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into
two categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but
also in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in
accordance with the proposals of the Government, as approved by
Parliament (principally the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central
government departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts
which do not pass through the Exchequer. The most important one is
the National Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Social
Security and used for the payment of benefits under the National
Insurance Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes
on dwelling-houses and other real estate) and income from property and
trading receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer,
and partly from loans raised in the open market (see p. 75).
The following broad account of government finance is concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government and other
public funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the
principle that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was
gradually evolved. The principle was established, at the end of the constitu¬
tional struggles of the Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once
the King was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free
to spend it as he chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House
of Commons gradually developed the modern system of controlling expendi¬
ture through the device of Appropriation which was embodied in the
Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866. But by a Standing Order of
the House of Commons dating from the early eighteenth century the Crown’s
consent is required for all new spending proposals. The House of Commons
cannot, therefore, initiate expenditure which must be proposed by a Minister.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such
financial control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of
Commons. This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seven-
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that
of the United Kingdom, see pp. 381-5.
2 The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in the
twelfth century.

teenth century, but as regards expenditure it was not effective until the
nineteenth century. The controlling power of the House of Commons is
acknowledged today in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of a new
session of Parliament, which is addressed to both Houses but contains a
special paragraph on expenditure addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power
to modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus,
to minimise the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of
embodying the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill.
Since the passing of the Parliament Act 1911, however, a Bill certified by the
Speaker to be a Money Bill may be presented to the Queen for the Royal
Assent and become law without the consent of the House of Lords if it has
not been passed by them within one month (see p. 40).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all
expenditure by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue
by taxation or borrowing. All government revenue, other than sums received
by government departments in the course of their normal activities (known
as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into the government account with the
Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated
Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously stated, being
National Insurance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of
this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and
revenue are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money
is spent and the sources from which revenue is obtained.
Central government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Acts of Parliament other
than annual Appropriation Acts. This expenditure includes the loans
made by the Government to nationalised industries, local authorities and
other public and private concerns for which the Treasury has specific
statutory authority to borrow. It also includes the Consolidated Fund
Standing Services which represent a permanent charge on the Consoli¬
dated Fund, covering the interest on and cost of management of the
National Debt, the financial provision made for members of the royal
family, and salaries and pensions of judges and certain high officers whose
independence of the Government is thought to be better guaranteed by
permanent grant than by annual vote.
2. All other government expenditure is authorised by annual Appropriation
Acts and includes expenditure on defence, on the social services and on
the general administration of the country. These are called Supply
Services because the House of Commons, when voting money, is granting
to the Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . . the
pecuniary necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that some
of this expenditure may also depend on legislation, such as the National
Health Service Acts, which relates to a specific object of expenditure.
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of
Commons during the 29 days (known as Supply days) which are allotted
by Standing Order of the House to consideration of Supply business in each
session. The choice of subject for debate on these days rests with the
Opposition. The House usually discusses general questions of policy relevant

to the Estimates, though any Estimate may be examined in detail if members
wish and if time allows (see p. 42).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April
are submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding December.
Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’ which
are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed
in the Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes.
No civil department may spend money granted on one Vote for the purposes
of another; but Service departments may do so providing they get
Treasury sanction, which, in turn, requires the retrospective authorisation of
Parliament. Within each Vote, ‘virement’, that is, the spending of money on
one subhead instead of on another, is permissible so far as Parliament is
concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
An insufficient Estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or
virement of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should
be brought to the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate.
The Treasury exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the
ordinary Estimates.
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller
and Auditor General, and by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees
of the House of Commons.
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the res¬
ponsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the
Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the
House of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments,
the Treasury has to look at the proposals for expenditure in relation to
prospective national resources and to weigh the advantages of administrative
proposals against the monetary and economic cost, taking into account
current government policy; to decide the relative merits of expenditure
proposed by different departments; and to eliminate any overlapping,
uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of depart¬
mental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates
of pay and the aggregate size of the staff in all government departments, in
addition to exercising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure.
The Treasury also lays down general rules of financial and accounting
procedure for departments and prescribes the principles on which depart¬
mental contracts shall be made and the limits within which losses may be
written off.
In 1961 the Plowden Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure
recommended in their Report [Cmnd. 1432) that regular surveys should be
made of public expenditure as a whole over a period of years ahead and in
relation to prospective resources, and that decisions involving future expendi¬
ture should be taken in the light of these surveys. Surveys, therefore, are now
made annually and have become an established part of the Government’s
machinery for the planning and control of expenditure (see p. 247).
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent
appointment with the status of an officer of the House of Commons. Since

1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller of the Exchequer he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Exchequer Account;
and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts and submits his
report on the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts, as required by
statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure that all expenditure
is properly incurred, for example, that no payments are made which go
beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been
obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged
by successive Public Accounts Committees (see the next paragraph) to
examine departmental expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any
cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee
called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, on the
motion of Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was
properly incurred in accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and
with any relevant Acts of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee
are to examine the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by
successive committees which have investigated whether full value has been
obtained for the sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which
the administration appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee
has therefore become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and
inefficiency. It embodies its findings in reports which may be debated in
the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury
in consultation with departments and put into effect, so far as they are
accepted, according to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is
submitted by the Treasury to the committee of the following session and
where the recommendations have been unacceptable to the Treasury the
committee may either accept the objections or return to the charge in sub¬
sequent reports.
This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed
annually except during the war years. In i960 it was made a select committee
set up each session under standing orders. The committee’s functions are
to examine the Estimates, to report how, if at all, the policy implied in the
Estimates can be carried out more economically and to consider the principal
variations between the Estimates of the current year and those of the previous
year and the form in which the Estimates should be presented. Usually,
the committee selects each year a few Votes for review.
Through the medium of seven sub-committees, the committee carries out
extensive investigations into the departments under consideration. In practice
the Estimates for the current year are not affected, but the committee’s
recommendations produce changes in future Estimates and strengthen
Treasury control. One of these sub-committees examines the spring Supple¬
mentary Estimates and the principal variations between the Estimates
presented and those of the previous year. The other sub-committees are
organised on functional lines, each sub-committee being allocated a different
sphere of government policy and administration. Additional parliamentary
time has been allocated for discussion of the reports of the Estimates and
the Public Accounts Committees.
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The
use of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor

of the Exchequer opened his Budget’, which is applied in Parliament to
the annual speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals
for balancing revenue and expenditure.
The Budget speech is normally the main occasion of the year for reviewing
the Exchequer finances and the economic state of the nation, and its formal
basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising money by taxation. In recent
years it has become the practice for Chancellors to discuss in the Budget
speech the prospects for the economy in the period ahead in some detail. By
the time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the Estimates of
expenditure under various headings will have been presented to Parliament
and published, and the expected total of government expenditure for the
year will be known. The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the
basis of existing taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as he considers
desirable on economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied in detail
in a Finance Bill. The interval between the Budget Statement and the Royal
Assent to the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by legislation
(mainly the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1913, as amended), whereby
changes in income tax, corporation tax, purchase tax, and customs and
excise duties have immediate statutory effect if adopted by Resolution of the
House of Commons.
The Budget also takes into account the finance needed to cover loans from
the Consolidated Fund, details of which are given in a White Paper issued
immediately before the Budget. In 1966-67 rather more than half of the net
issues from this Fund were loans to nationalised industries; just over two-
fifths were loans to other public bodies, largely the local authorities; and the
remainder were loans to overseas governments and private industry, and
miscellaneous advances and repayments.
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money
for government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated
that taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the
level of expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it was
realised that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore
the general level of economic activity. Since the second world war, Budgets
have been consciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring the total
demand for goods and services into balance with the supplies which could be
made available.
Taxation on income and capital affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of the income or capital, the proportion of
a high income or capital taken in tax being much greater than the propor¬
tion of a small one; at the same time, the services provided by the Government
(whether in cash or kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth,
but in some cases they are specially designed to benefit people with lower
incomes. Taxes on expenditure (see pp. 379-80) can be used to influence the
allocation of resources and the pattern of trade by discouraging or encouraging
the consumption of particular goods.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the
total demand for goods and services in the following way: if there is an
increase in government expenditure without an increase in taxation then
total demand for goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will
happen if there is a decrease in taxation without a decrease in government
spending. In this way the Budget can be used to counter unemployment.
On the other hand, if there is an increase in taxation without an increase
378
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sources of
Revenue
Income Tax
in government expenditure, or a decrease in government expenditure without
a decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods and services will
tend to fall. In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation or improve
the balance of payments. At the same time the Budget may also include
measures—as in 1966—to reduce the net outflow of long-term capital, or to
stimulate exports, or encourage savings.
In the United Kingdom the principal taxes fall into three main categories.
First, taxes on income wdiich include income tax, surtax and corporation tax;
secondly, taxes on capital which include estate duty, capital gains tax and the
tax on short-term gains; and thirdly, taxes on expenditure (including taxes
on the ownership or use of certain assets)—these include not only customs
and excise duties and the purchase tax, but also the selective employment
tax (on services), local rates, stamp duties, licence duties (for example, on
motor vehicles and dogs) and fines. Taxes on individual (though not corporate)
incomes are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates bear a
proportionately higher rate of tax. The Board of Inland Revenue collects the
taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties, the Board of Customs and
Excise collects the most important taxes on expenditure, the customs and
excise taxes and the purchase tax, while a variety of authorities are responsible
for the collection of the remainder, including the Ministry of Social Security
for the selective employment tax.
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April, which is at present 8s. 3d. in the £ (41-25 per cent). The tax
imposed on an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances and
reliefs, by reduced rates of tax on the first sections of taxable income1 and by
the surtax. In the case of a married couple the incomes of husband and wife
are aggregated and are treated as one income, but higher allowances are given
than for a single person. Earned income bears less tax than other income as
certain fractional deductions (‘earned income relief’) are allowable.
A single person earning ,£1,000 a year Pays in income tax, while a
married couple with the same earned income pay ^137; if the couple have
two children under the age of 11, their tax falls to £52; when the children
are between the ages of 11 and 16, the tax is £37; if the children are over 16
and receiving full-time education, only £22 is paid. The range of tax payable
by a single person varies from, for example, £41 on an earned income of £500
a year to £1,515 on an earned income of £5,000; if the income is unearned,
tax liability on £500 will be £54, and on £5,000 will be £2,440.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (Tay-as-
you-earn’) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling
them to keep up to date on tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including
companies) resident in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that
interest on certain United Kingdom government securities belonging to
persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt; and
income from certain classes of possessions abroad is chargeable not on the
amount of income arising but on the amount of income remitted to the United
Kingdom. The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and
reliefs is taxable income. For 1967-68 the reduced rates are: 4s. od. in the £ on the
first £100; and 6s. od. in the £ on the next £200. The remainder is charged at the
standard rate.

countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements
are not in force unilateral relief is allowed.1
The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged
on personal incomes exceeding ^2,000 a year after deducting certain personal
allowances in excess of the single person’s basic allowance. In addition, the
same earned income relief as for income tax and a special earnings allowance
(not exceeding £2,000) are deductible from earned income only. Surtax is
imposed at rates which increase progressively until, on the portion of taxable
income above £i$,ooo, the combined rate of income tax and surtax payable
in 1967-68 (being income tax for 1967-68 and surtax for 1966-67) reaches
18s. 3d. in the £. Exceptionally, among measures announced in July 1966, a
surcharge of 10 per cent (operative for one year only) was levied on surtax
liabilities for the year 1965-66 for payment on 1st September 1967.
The Finance Act 1965 introduced a new system of taxation of companies
by means of a corporation tax on profits instead of income tax and profits tax.
A company now deducts income tax from dividends and other distributions
and pays it over to the Inland Revenue as a separate matter from its own
liability. The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget
for the past financial year; for 1966-67 it is 40 per cent. The tax is assessed
on the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the
financial year in which the accounting period falls. The basic rule for the
calculation of income for corporation tax purposes is that, except for special
provisions, it is computed in accordance with income tax principles.
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or
not) which passes or is deemed to pass at death. Thus, it is not limited to
property owned by the deceased. It may, for example, extend to trust funds
to the income of which the deceased was entitled during his lifetime, and to
gifts made by the deceased within five years of his death (one year in the case
of a gift for public or charitable purposes). Estates with a net capital value of
£5,000 or less are exempt from duty, but on estates of a higher value there
is a progressive duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
Under the 1965 Finance Act tax is charged on capital gains accruing on the
disposal of assets after 6th April 1965. The charge is not retrospective and
is restricted to the part of any gain attributable to the period after 6th April
1965. Net gains of persons other than companies are chargeable to the tax at
the rate of 30 per cent. Certain assets are exempt from the tax, including a
principal private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000, private motor
cars and National Savings securities. The 1965 Act also amended the existing
short-term gains tax, making gains which arise from the disposal of assets
within 12 months of their acquisition chargeable to income tax (and surtax) as
unearned income of the year, and not to capital gains tax.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely, the duties on tobacco, purchase
tax, hydrocarbon oil, alcoholic drinks, protective duties, betting and certain
miscellaneous items. In British usage the distinction between customs
and excise depends on whether the goods are imported (customs duties) or
British produced (excise duties). These taxes are sometimes known as indirect

taxes since they are normally paid by the importer, manufacturer, or whole¬
saler who adjusts prices charged to customers accordingly. In 1967 the tax
burden was equivalent to 3s. yd. on a gallon of petrol, 4s. 2d. on a packet of
20 standard plain cigarettes, 37s. 6d. on a bottle of whisky, and io|d. on a
pint of beer of average strength.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them con¬
sumer goods, at three rates which are currently 11 per cent, i6| per cent and
27! per cent of the wholesale value. Articles subject to revenue duties of
customs and excise are in general exempt from this tax; other goods free of
purchase tax include food (other than confectionery, soft drinks and ice cream),
fuel, books and newspapers, young children’s clothing and footwear, certain
non-proprietary drugs and medicines, some household appliances and textiles.
Since 1961 the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had power to vary by
Order the rate of purchase tax and the other main customs and excise
duties (except the protective duties) by up to 10 per cent in either direction.
In the 1964 Finance Act this power was amended so as to allow one or more of
the five groups of Customs and Excise taxes (that is, tobacco, alcohol, oil,
purchase tax and the minor revenue duties) to be excluded from its use.
Provision was also made for the surcharges or rebates to be applied at different
percentages for different groups. These powers were exercised in July
1966 in the imposition of a 10 per cent surcharge on alcohol, oil and the
purchase tax, which was consolidated with existing rates of tax in the 1967
Budget. They require annual renewal.
The principal betting duties are: a pool betting duty (applying mainly to
football pools) including betting by coupon at fixed odds, which is charged at
a rate of 25 per cent of the stake money; and a tax introduced in the 1966
Finance Act at the rate of 2| per cent of stakes on most other betting. Gaming
is taxed at different rates by licence fees.
Taxes on motor vehicles are collected by the local taxation authorities (the
county or county borough councils in England and Wales and the correspon¬
ding councils in Scotland); the proceeds are paid by the local authorities
into the Exchequer. The licence duty on a private motor car is £17 10s. a
year; motor cycles and three-wheel vehicles, etc., pay £2, £4 or £8 a year
according to engine capacity.
A selective employment tax, designed to encourage economy in the use of
labour in the service industries, was introduced in the 1966 Budget; it
became operative in September 1966. It is paid by all employers throughout
the United Kingdom at a rate per week of 25s. for men, 12s. 6d. for women
and boys and 8s. for girls. Employers, however, are affected in various ways.
Employers in manufacturing industries receive a refund of tax and a premium
together amounting to 32s. 6d. for men, 16s. 3d. for women and boys and
1 os. 6d. for girls. Employers in transport, public service, including the
nationalised industries, agriculture, extractive industries and charities have
the tax refunded but receive no premium. Employers in service industries
and construction pay the tax without refund, but schemes have now been
introduced for the refund of the tax in respect of certain part-time workers
and employees working overseas.
In the 1967 Budget total expenditure for the financial year ending 31st March
1968 is estimated to reach £11,067 million, including £1,560 million for
Consolidated Fund Standing Services and £9,507 million for Supply Services.
The estimate for total revenue (after allowing for the Budget changes) is

£ 11,704 million of which .£10,679 million is receipts from taxation. A surplus
of £637 million is therefore expected. Loans from the Consolidated Fund
(see p. 374) are estimated to reach £1,580 million. Thus, after allowing for
the surplus of revenue over expenditure, the balance to be met by Exchequer
borrowing and special transactions is estimated to total £943 million.
Table 25 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources anticipated
in 1966-67 and 1967-68; Table 26 shows the anticipated surplus of revenue
over expenditure in these years and the Government’s borrowing require¬
ments; and Table 27 gives a general functional analysis of expenditure in the
Estimates.
Capital expenditure dealt with in the Budget statement consists chiefly of
loans from the Consolidated Fund to the nationalised industries, the local
authorities and other public bodies, such as the New Towns Development
Corporations; it also includes loans for overseas assistance. These loans, less
repayments, are financed by the surplus of revenue over expenditure, by the
proceeds of Government borrowing and special transactions; for instance,
borrowing from extra-budgetary funds, such as the National Insurance Fund,
and borrowing the sterling receipts, if any, accruing to the Exchange
Equalisation Account.
Exchequer borrowing may be in the form of borrowing from the public
either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 388) or by borrowing
on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of government
securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinancing maturing
issues (conversion issues) or to raise new money (issues for cash). Since 1956
capital requirements of the nationalised industries have been met in full by
the Exchequer, while those of the local authorities are met partly by the
Exchequer through the Public Works Loan Board (see p. 77) and partly by
the local authorities borrowing direct from the public in the form of mortgages
or stock issues or deposits (mainly placed by the overseas banks).
The National Debt increased particularly rapidly during and immediately
after the first and second world wars. It rose from £651 million in 1914 to
£7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in
1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On 31st March 1967, the total National
Debt (provisional) was £31,985 million, of which £1,821 million was repayable
in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian
Governments. Of the £28,585 million of internal debt, £4,158 million was
short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills, while the long¬
term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and certificates carrying
fixed rates of interest (ranging from 2% to 6 per cent) and with fixed or
indeterminate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under
which public revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the
Exchequer, from which no money can be withdrawn except on the authority
of Parliament. That authority is expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund
charges in permanent legislative form, and in the case of Supply Services by
annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates prepared by departments and
sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of taxation (customs duties and most excise duties,
purchase tax, income tax, surtax, corporation tax and capital gains tax) is

imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament over the whole country, and is
paid, in the first instance, into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From the
amount attributable to Northern Ireland, known as ‘Reserved’ Revenue,
there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom Treasury, under
the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the sum contributed by Northern
Ireland towards Imperial Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the
cost of the administration of the Supreme Court, and other Reserved Services,
and the cost of collecting Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the
‘Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes’, is paid over to the Exchequer of
Northern Ireland and joins with the proceeds of taxes imposed by the
Parliament of Northern Ireland, called ‘Transferred’ Taxes, and with other
non-tax receipts of a miscellaneous nature, to form the public income.
Among items of Transferred Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties,
betting duties, various excise licence duties, motor vehicle duties and selective
employment tax.
A joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry
of Finance for Northern Ireland, constituted in accordance with the Govern¬
ment of Ireland Act 1920, determines the amount of Reserved Revenue and
the cost of Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland for each year,
the amount of the Imperial Contribution, and such other questions affecting
the financial relations of the two Governments as may be referred to it.

Source: Estimates igSy-SS. Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1967-68 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £241 million and expenditure at £239 million.
After allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated at £2
million, there was a Budget surplus of £52,470.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £205 million on 31st
March 1967, is covered by repayable advances and investments held by the
Ministry of Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have
been established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for

specific purposes. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern,
the principal funds being those relating to National Insurance and govern¬
ment loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital money available mainly
for local and public authority borrowings; on 31st March 1967, a sum of
approximately ^171 million was outstanding against such borrowers.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It
comprises a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main
banking services; the United Kingdom offices of banks whose main business
is in other countries; merchant banks and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England is the central bank and its principal business is to act
as banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the
Government for important financial operations and as the central note¬
issuing authority; it also maintains relations with central banks overseas. It
was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate
body, and its entire capital stock was acquired by the Government under
the Bank of England Act 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England is responsible for co-ordinating
the application of the Government’s monetary policy. One of the main
instruments for this purpose is the Bank rate—the minimum rate at which the
Bank of England will discount approved bills of exchange and a key factor in
the general pattern of interest rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main
government accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and
registration of government loans. It also operates, as agent for the Treasury,
the administration of exchange control which has been in force since 1939.
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England
and these balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves. In addition, under
an arrangement made with the London clearing banks and Scottish banks in
1958, the Bank of England might call on these banks for ‘special deposits’
which, not being freely disposable, do not rank as part of their liquid assets.
The scheme, which affects the ability of the banks to lend, is being used to
keep credit conditions in line with the changing needs of the economy. The
Bank of England gives guidance to the main banking and financial organisations
on the advances policy it wishes them to adopt.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities,
together with a limited amount of coin, the part covered by securities and
coin being the ‘Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary
control. (The Scottish and Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to issue
notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by legislation for each
bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England notes and by coin.) In
practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Department of the Bank of
England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign exchange) reserves
being in a separate government fund, known as the Exchange Equalisation
Account; this account was originally established in 1932 for the purpose of
checking undue fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling, and is operated
by the Bank of England as agent for the Treasury. The provision of coin for
circulation is the responsibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
386
The
Commercial
Banks
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The principal commercial banks in the United Kingdom are the 11 London
clearing banks,1 5 Scottish banks and 3 Northern Ireland banks. They are
limited liability companies which in the main are subject to the ordinary
law relating to such companies. Together, their deposits amounted to over
£10,500 million at the end of 1966 and accounted for about two-thirds of the
total deposits of the banking sector, which also includes the overseas banks,
accepting houses and the discount market. They provided full banking services
throughout the United Kingdom, operating through nearly 14,000 branches
at the end of 1966. Several have interests in another clearing or domestic
bank, and in recent years have extended their connections with overseas
banks. Together with the Bank of England the London clearing banks
make up the membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House. In 1966
cheques, bills and drafts valued at nearly £38,000 million monthly and
credits (under the credit transfer scheme introduced in i960) valued at a
further £790 million monthly passed through the clearing house.
The primary business of the commercial banks is the receipt, transfer and
encashment of deposits. Deposits on current account on which no interest is
paid are repayable on demand, while on balances on deposit account interest
is paid at a rate generally 2 per cent below Bank rate. The London clearing
banks maintain a ratio of about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total
deposits. It is also a convention among the commercial banks that at least
28 per cent of deposits should be held in the form of liquid assets. Prior to
1963 the ratio was 30 per cent.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or
without collateral security); these are normally for a short term only unless
renewed. The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits
declined from about 43 per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent at the end of the
second world war but it has since risen and in June 1967 it was 48-8 per cent.
In recent years the banks have been asked to restrain the growth of their
lending and to ensure that, within the total, priority is given to finance for
exports and for productive investment in manufacturing industry and
agriculture: this has involved the restriction of advances to the personal
sector. The banks’ ‘liquid’ assets, that is, those that are quickly realisable,
are their loans to discount houses (money at call), and their holdings of
Treasury and commercial bills and certain export and shipbuilding credits
refinanceable with the Bank of England: they also hold a proportion of their
assets as portfolio (mainly British Government securities) or trade invest¬
ments. The diagram on p. 387 shows the relative size of bank advances to
different sectors of the economy.
The increase in the value of advances in recent years has been accom¬
panied by innovations in bank lending practices including the introduction
of schemes for personal loans repayable by fixed monthly instalments over
periods up to two years, facilities for limited service accounts at low cost
and credit cards (see p. 422). Improvements have also been made to money
transmission services including the abolition of credit transfer charges for
customers and the introduction of direct debiting which enables a creditor,
with the prior approval of the debtor, to claim money due to him direct from
the latter’s banking account.
A new departure in British banking is the Post Office giro which will
1 Three of these banks have their headquarters outside London at Liverpool and
Manchester.

provide a postal cheque service for all customers with a current account, but
no overdraft facilities. A central office is being set up on Merseyside and, it
is planned, will come into operation in 1968 or 1969.
There are also 43 British overseas and Commonwealth banks, many of them
having their headquarters in London. They provide a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of
trade not only between Britain and other countries but also between third
countries. Currently there are also in London 13 United States banks,
11 Japanese banks and over 40 other foreign banks.
The merchant banks have helped to give London an international reputation
as a world financial centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. They

are of two kinds, and are known as accepting houses and issuing houses
according to whether they specialise predominantly in the work of acceptance
credit1 or in transactions involving the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf
of their customers. They arrange to issue and themselves underwrite long-
and short-term loans to governments of, or concerns in, overseas countries
in sterling (where permitted by exchange control regulations) or in other
currencies which have been deposited with them; this latter type of transaction
has increased considerably in recent years. They are also engaged in the work
of the gold and foreign exchange markets, and they have many other functions
in connection with the financing of trade, investment management, and
insurance.
The London discount or money market is a distinctive part of the British
banking system. It consists of 12 discount houses and its principal function
is to marry the needs of lenders of money for short periods with those of the
borrowers of such money.
The discount houses borrow ‘at call’ from banks and other financial
institutions at a low rate of interest. To them the Bank of England acts as a
lender of last resort. The clearing banks do not borrow money directly from
the Bank of England; if they need to add to their cash resources they call
in part of their loans to the discount market. If, as a result, any particular
discount house is unable to cover its needs for cash elsewhere, it is obliged
to borrow from the Bank of England, traditionally at Bank rate or above
for a minimum of seven days; recently, however, the Bank has also lent at
market rates, usually overnight but sometimes for longer periods.
An important part of the money borrowed by the discount houses is
invested in British Government Treasury bills. The discount houses have
come to accept as an informal responsibility that they should cover the
Government’s need to borrow on Treasury bills, which are offered on tender
each week.
The clearing banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but they purchase, from the
discount market, bills which are of a maturity required by the banks.
The discount houses provide a specialised market in commercial bills
and in short-dated Government bonds (that is, those with not more than
five years to run before repayment) and local authority bonds.
The National Savings Movement, started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings, spread rapidly and soon developed into the present move¬
ment which encourages the widespread investment of savings in Trustee
Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National Savings
securities. The movement is led by the National Savings Committee for
England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and Northern
Ireland.2 The committees are bodies of independent persons representing
1 Acceptance credit has been defined as fundamentally a three-month operation
financing exports from and imports to Britain and to other markets. The expression
is derived from the method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’
or guaranteed by a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be
discounted for cash by a discount house.
2 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration
of Ulster Savings, but the furtherance and organisation of the savings movement in
Northern Ireland is the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is voluntarily
assisted by county and local committees and district groups.

regional savings organisations and various national institutions connected
with such matters as finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a
salaried staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often
assisted or promoted by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary
local savings groups.
Three forms of National Savings securities are now on sale: the National
Savings Certificate, the National Development Bond, and the Premium
Savings Bond. National Savings Certificates, in units of £1, are encashable
at par at any time; interest, which is free of income tax and surtax, is only
paid on encashment; the limit on individual holdings is 750 units of the
current issue. National Development Bonds, sold in units of £5 with a
maximum holding of £2,500, are repayable at par on one month’s notice.
Premium Savings Bonds are in units of .£1 and individual holdings are
limited to £1,250. After a qualifying period of three months the Bonds give
investors a chance to win tax-free prizes instead of receiving interest. There
is a monthly draw with prizes ranging from £25 to £5,000 and one quarterly
prize of £25,000. At the end of June 1967, £603 million was invested in this
form of savings. Nearly all British Government securities are held on the
Post Office Register and can also be bought or sold at most post offices in the
United Kingdom.
The Post Office Savings Bank, which celebrated its centenary in 1961, is
the largest organisation of its kind in the world. It provides a country¬
wide system for depositing and withdrawing small savings and has over
23 million active accounts. Ordinary Accounts bear interest at 2^ per cent and
the first £15 of interest is tax free. Up to £10 can be withdrawn on demand at
any post office, but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts.
The moneys are lodged with the National Debt Office and are invested
in Government securities. In June 1966 the new Post Office Investment
Accounts were opened; investors must have a qualifying deposit of £50
in the Ordinary Department. On these a higher rate of interest is paid.
All deposits carry a Government guarantee; in June 1967 they totalled
£1,798 million.
The Trustee Savings Banks, also started in the nineteenth century, operate
under their own trustees but are subject to statutory provisions and National
Debt Office surveillance. There are 77 individual banks with 1,405 Trustee
Offices and over 11 million accounts. Deposits can be made either in the
Ordinary Departments, the Special Investment Departments or the Current
Account Departments. The terms for deposits in the Ordinary Departments
are similar to those in the Post Office Savings Bank, paying the same rate of
interest (2^ per cent) with the same tax concession on the first £15 of interest.
Withdrawals can usually be made on demand though notice is required for
large sums. Deposits are invested with the National Debt Commissioners and
both capital and interest are guaranteed by the Government. The Special
Investment Departments offer a higher rate of return (between 5 and 5!
per cent, taxable). Deposits are limited to £5,000, but are not Government
guaranteed. At the end of June 1967 total sums in the Ordinary Departments
of the Trustee Savings Banks were £1,055 million and in the Special
Investment Departments £1,167 million. Most Trustee Savings Banks are
now operating cheque services, which were first authorised in 1964 on deposits
in the Current Account Departments. In April 1967 the Trustee Savings
Banks were given permission to set up their own unit trust.
At end-June 1967 National Savings totalled £8,430 million, about a quarter

Co-operative The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
Banks about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in
banking was recognised in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of
1876. The primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank
was to serve the co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has
become, but the clients of the bank now include trade unions and other
mutual societies, local authorities and individual depositors. The bank’s
headquarters are in Manchester. The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale
Society, which has its headquarters in Glasgow, has similarly engaged in
banking since 1948.
OTHER
FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of
many special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities,
which are supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are
mainly provided through the savings banks, finance corporations, hire-
purchase finance companies, the stock exchanges, investment trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are
in the main highly specialised, for example, discount and other finance houses,
stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
Finance Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Corporations Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in
1945 to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and
development. Although the Government displayed considerable interest in
their formation, the corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies
with no official representation on their boards and having no recourse to
public funds. Another finance corporation, the Commonwealth Development
Finance Company Limited, was established in 1953 to assist development
projects in the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note
are the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited and the Scottish Agri¬
cultural Securities Corporation Limited.

The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of
f 200,000 and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of industry
in the national interest in order to promote efficiency and employment.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of
j£I25 railhon. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance
companies, 30 per cent by investment trust companies and 30 per cent by the
Bank of England. At 31st March 1967, the capital called and paid up was
2 per cent (£500,000); the Bank of England paid £5 million in advance of call
I959- The liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital
represents security to the banks providing loans for the corporation’s working
capital. The value of its investments at that date was £99-4 million. The
enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
such as steel, shipping, diesel engines, oil and chemicals.
The ICFC has a smaller issued capital than that of the FCI and has as its
main object the provision of credit and finance by means of loan and share
capital of between £5,000 and £300,000 for small- and medium-sized
industrial and commercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases
where the existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the Stock
Exchange are not readily or easily available.
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC at 31st March 1967
was £30 million paid up fully and a line of credit of £6 million, both provided
principally by the London clearing banks and the Scottish banks in proportion
to their size, with a token participation by the Bank of England. In addition,
public debenture issues have been made to a total of £30 million. The current
resources of the ICFC, including reserves shown in the balance sheet,
therefore total more than £80 million.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company was set up in 1953 as
a new channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth
development schemes. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14% million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (2s. paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in the United Kingdom, and nf
million ‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 (10s. paid) are held by the Bank of England
and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. Commitments entered into
from its inception in 1953 up to the end of March 1967 amounted to the
sterling equivalent of approximately £37 million.
There are 23 stock exchanges in the British Isles, of which 15 are in England
and Wales, five in Scotland, one in Northern Ireland and two in the Irish
Republic. In addition the Provincial Brokers’ Stock Exchange operates in
no cities and towns throughout Britain and the Irish Republic. The
Federation of Stock Exchanges in Great Britain and Ireland, comprising with
one exception all these organisations, was set up in July 1965 to co-ordinate
their work. Four of the Scottish stock exchanges are linked, as are also the
stock exchanges in the north of England.
The London Stock Exchange is by far the most important of these stock
exchanges and is one of the world’s two foremost free markets in securities.
Some 9,586 securities are quoted on the London Stock Exchange; at the
end of March 1967 these had a total market value of £82,000 million. Over
8,400 securities of companies are quoted, including a number of leading over¬
seas companies. At nominal values 40 per cent of the securities represented
company issues and the remainder British and overseas government and
392
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Investment
Trusts and
Unit Trusts
corporation stocks; at market values the proportion was about three-quarters.
The London Stock Exchange is linked by cable or telephone with stock
exchanges all over the world. Therefore, a quoted company, subject to any
limitations imposed by the exchange control regulations, has a world-wide
market for its issues. This is an important factor in the raising of new capital
by government and commercial borrowers. Arbitrage transactions by brokers
—the buying or selling of a particular security on one stock exchange with the
intention of reversing it on another—play an important part in equating
price differentials between different markets and maintaining a continual
flow of business between centres.
The stock exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains
are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned. All the stock exchanges operate under strict
rules of conduct which they formulate themselves.
In recent years there has been a constantly rising demand, except for short
periods, for ordinary (equity) shares, partly in expectation that such shares
will maintain their real value or grow in value in periods of rising prices.
Insurance companies and pension funds now invest a larger proportion than
formerly of their assets in these shares, and the Trustee Investments Act 1961
permits trustees, under certain conditions, to invest up to half the funds they
hold in trust in equity shares.
The ownership of securities on the London Stock Exchange is much more
widespread than formerly: it is estimated that there are about million
shareholders in the United Kingdom and that their shareholdings are widely
distributed. The largest public company in Britain has nearly 600,000
shareholders and there are several others with more than 100,000.
Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks
and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company
registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is
to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies,
it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits
to build up reserves. Investment trusts grew to importance in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the managers
sell units to the public and invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of
Stock Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly
by an initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit, and partly by a
semi-annual service charge which is taken usually out of the income of the
trust. The level of both charges is controlled by the Board of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the trust deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving
has grown considerably since 1957. At the end of June 1967 there were about
11 million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised trusts,
numbering some 150, has risen from £60 million in 1958 to £690 million in
June 1967; it has more than doubled since mid-1963. There are now a wide
variety of trusts, both as to the range of investments covered and the ways in
which they cater for the differing needs of investors.

“ Including Industrial Life assurance, which is a type of life assurance in which the
premiums are collected at frequent intervals of two months or less by house to house
collection. It is conducted by both friendly societies (called collecting societies) and
companies, the former accounting for a net premium income of £39 million in 1965
and the latter for a further £204 million.
Insurance
Companies
Lloyd's
There are about 400 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom
but most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most
British insurers write several of the main classes of business although some
specialise in one class, particularly in life assurance, where about 40 companies
write only that type of business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition about 150 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the
international nature of the market. The natural centre of the market is in
London, but some of the large companies have their administrative head¬
quarters elsewhere.
In 1965 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies and
collecting societies amounted to £12,100 million, the bulk of which is in
respect of life assurance business. The accumulation of life funds has
increased greatly with the growth of group pension schemes.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance
funds and these represent one of the most important sources of funds for
investment in commerce and industry. More than a third of the total assets
of British insurance companies is invested in equity shares and debentures,
and this proportion has been rising slowly.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and of intelligence about shipping movements. Although in its earlier history
the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world¬
wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business, except
life assurance, of which the amount transacted at Lloyd’s is small.
Lloyd’s is now regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting

in 1871; the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are
administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact
insurance business.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business
is transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and
in competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through
Lloyd’s brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact
insurance with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to
transact business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give a security behind
the Lloyd’s policy which is second to none.
Today there are over 5,800 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
some 300 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping
intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on
behalf of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and
a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London repre¬
sentatives of the latter.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business is
carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance on the London market and partly
through branches and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic
principle of this international business is that resources capable of meeting
any potential loss are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and
industrial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived
mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares, which have a fixed value, are not dealt
with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The Building Societies Acts 1874 t0 prescribe the general way in which
societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a
few very large societies. At the end of 1966, 576 societies were in operation,
with total assets of £6,306 million. Eleven of the largest societies, however,
each with assets of over £100 million, account for 60 per cent of the total
funds. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1966 was £1,245 niillion.

OVERSEAS TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for less than 2 per cent of
the world’s population, the United Kingdom is the world’s third largest
trading nation, conducting about 13 per cent of international trade in manu¬
factured goods in 1966.
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in
international trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of
manufactures entering into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of
world imports of all goods was somewhat larger than that of world exports,
as imports into Britain were paid for both by exports of goods and by interest
on overseas investments and net receipts from shipping and a variety of
financial services. As other countries followed Britain in becoming fully
industrialised, it was natural that Britain’s share of world exports of manu¬
factures should fall. Even before 1914 this supremacy was being increasingly
challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United States,
and, although Britain’s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937 Britain’s
share in world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to
21 per cent compared with 22 per cent in 1929 and 30 per cent in 1913. In
the years immediately following the second world war, Britain’s share rose
again and in 1950 was nearly 25 per cent; but by 1966 it had fallen to about
13 per cent.
For over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
Britain’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for about half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries.
Its exports of goods and services together represent about a fifth of the gross
national product. It is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal
manufactures, electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. It is the world’s
largest market for foodstuffs, and among the largest for metals, cotton, wool,
petroleum and many other products.
For some hundreds of years Britain has also been an important centre of
entrepot trade, the importance of which, however, in relation to total United
Kingdom trade, has declined in the last half-century.
Changes in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The value of imports (c.i.f.) passed the £2,000 million mark in 1948 and,
with rapidly rising prices of raw materials, reached £3,892 million in 1951.
Because of the tendency in subsequent years for import prices to fall, the
1951 level was not reached again until 1957. Since i960 imports have
recorded peak levels except in 1961 and 1962. There was a particularly rapid
expansion in 1963 and 1964 but a smaller rise in 1965 and 1966 when they
were valued at £5,954 million. The increase in exports has been at a steadier
rate. The 1948 total of £1,567 million (f.o.b.) had increased to £2,566 million
by 1951, and thereafter increased in most years. In 1966 exports reached a
396
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
new record of £5,042 million, an increase of 7 per cent over 1965. This was
the eighth successive year in which the previous total was surpassed.
Between 1961 and 1966 the volume of exports rose by 21 per cent and
that of imports by 23 per cent. Since 1956 the terms of trade, that is, the ratio
between the general level of export prices and that of import prices, have
moved progressively in Britain’s favour except for small adverse movements
in the two years 1963-64.
The value and volume of exports and imports in selected years from 1958
to 1966 are shown in Table 29.

Commodity
Composition
Imports
The expansion of domestic agriculture has reduced Britain’s dependence on
imported food supplies and the proportion of imported foodstuffs to total
imports has not been above 40 per cent since before 1954. Imports of food¬
stuffs (including beverages and tobacco) in 1966 were £1,714 million (repre¬
senting 29 per cent of total imports by value). There has been a similar
downward trend in the proportion accounted for by basic materials—from
30 per cent in 1954 to 18 per cent in 1966 but in both cases the rate of change
has generally been less fast in recent years. Industrial production has tended
to increase faster than the consumption of imported raw materials. This is
partly because there has been a growing economy in materials’ consumption
per unit of output, partly because of a gradual switch from the production
of goods with a high material content (for example, textiles) to those with a
relatively low material content (for example, engineering products), and also
because of increasing use of substitutes and synthetic materials.
Imports of crude petroleum and lubricants are by far the biggest single
item by value among Britain’s imports: they accounted for 11 per cent (£627

1948 and 9 per cent in 1954.
The most marked change in recent years has been the rise in the proportion
of imports of finished manufactures from 6 per cent of total imports in 1956
to nearly 17 per cent in 1966. Strong growth in these imports is a common
feature in the trade of industrial countries. Most of the rise in recent years
has been in capital goods which account for nearly three-quarters of the
value of imports of finished manufactures. Imports of semi-manufactures
have also been increasing steadily and in 1962, for the first time, accounted
for a greater proportion of the total import bill than basic materials. This
long-established trend is due partly to the tendency for countries producing
the basic materials to embark upon subsequent stages of manufacture and
partly to the growth in production and exports of semi-manufactures by
developing countries. Imports, by value, of semi-manufactured (excluding
chemicals) and manufactured goods amounted to £1,185 million and £991
million respectively in 1966, accounting for 20 per cent and 17 per cent of
Britain’s total imports, compared with 16 per cent and 6 per cent in 1956.
More than five-sixths of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods.
By far the most important group are engineering products, which in 1966
accounted for 46 per cent of total exports, compared with 39 per cent in 1957.
Within this group, exports of many types of machinery, electrical equipment,
road vehicles, tractors and scientific instruments have expanded markedly
over this period. The share represented by chemicals has grown fairly steadily
and now represents 9-3 per cent of total exports. The proportion accounted
for by metals has tended to fall in recent years. Exports of textiles have fallen

from over 19 per cent of the total in 1948 to 9 per cent in 1957 and 6 per cent
in 1966. Exports of coal in 1966 were less than half of 1 per cent of the total,
in contrast to their importance in the pre-war period. Exports of petroleum
products, which have been about 3 per cent of the total in recent years, stayed
at 2-3 per cent in 1966, their level for the previous two years. The proportion
accounted for by foodstuffs has also shown little change in the past few years.

and Sources of
Supply, 1966
The growth of trade between Britain and Western Europe has been a notable
feature of the area distribution of trade in recent years, but conversely there
has been a decline in the proportion of Britain’s exports going to primary
producing countries. In 1954, 28 per cent of exports went to Western Europe,
but in 1962, for the first time, these exports began to exceed those to the
sterling area and by 1966 they formed 38 per cent of the total. Exports to
Western Europe increased by 9 per cent in 1966 following a rise of 4 per cent
in 1965. Exports to the European Economic Community (EEC) showed some
revival in 1966 compared with the previous two years and increased by 6 per
cent compared with 1 per cent in 1965 and 3 per cent in 1964, and an average
rate of some 9 per cent a year over the past decade. Exports to the European
Free Trade Area (EFTA) were 11 per cent higher than in 1965; this compares
with an average rate of increase of some 7 per cent a year over the past decade.
In 1966, 35 per cent of total imports came from Western Europe, with
increases from both the EEC and EFTA.

Re-Export
Trade
Relatively, trade with other members of the Commonwealth and with the
sterling area as a whole has tended to decline. Exports to the sterling area rose
in the early 1950s, but there were some falls in later years and the 1957 total
was not regained until 1963; exports to the area in 1964 and 1965 increased as
fast as exports as a whole but fell back slightly in 1966 and as a proportion of
total exports dropped back to 32 per cent, compared with 47 per cent in 1954.
There has been a similar relative fall in respect of imports. Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and India however, are among Britain’s most important
trading partners. The United States has been both Britain’s largest single
market and source of supply since 1957. The proportion of total exports
going to North America in 1966 (just under 17 per cent) almost equalled the
previous peak of 1959; exports were 20 per cent higher in 1966 than in 1965,
and the increase accounted for 45 per cent of the total increase in exports in
1966. Imports from the non-sterling Middle East continued to increase, almost
entirely as a result of larger shipments of crude oil. Exports to this area
rose by 7 per cent in 1966. The decline in recent years in imports from Latin
America was halted in 1966 when the total showed little change from the
1965 level; exports were also little changed in 1966. Britain’s trade with the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has been growing rapidly over the past
decade but is still small in relation to trade with other parts of the world.

Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they
were imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—such as
simple blending, cleaning, husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially
unchanged. Traditionally, the greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade
has been in raw materials and foodstuffs, for example, wool, rubber, tea, non-
ferrous metals and fur-skins. Commodities imported from Commonwealth
countries and sent on to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports
such as tea and wool, account for a considerable proportion of the total value.
In recent years a considerable re-export trade has developed in manufactured
goods, part of which is accounted for by machinery, for example, aircraft and
aero-engines, which have been repaired or overhauled in the United Kingdom.
In 1966, the value of re-exports reached a peak total of £194 million. The
principal items were: fur-skins, non-ferrous metals, tea, aero-engines, electrical

BRITAIN.' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Invisible
Transactions
and other machinery and chemicals. Over half of the re-exports went to
countries in Western Europe.
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom has usually imported more
goods than it exports; however the gap has normally been covered by net
earnings from invisible transactions. In recent years these have tended to be
around ^150-^200 million a year; but a number of special factors coincided
in 1966 to produce an unusually low £92 million. In that year total credits
were valued at £2,866 million and total debits at £2,774 million.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main
groups: government; transport (mainly shipping); interest, profits and divi¬
dends; travel; other services; and private transfers. Some of these figures

are precise (for instance, for government transactions), others are estimates.
The diagram shows the breakdown of the figures from 1964 to 1966.
Under the heading of government current transactions, the main items
on the debit side are military expenditure overseas and grants to developing
countries. Shipping receipts come mostly from export freights and cross trade
between other countries and also from passenger traffic. Shipping payments
arise mainly on account of foreign tramp shipping services. Shipping trans¬
actions produced net deficits between i960 and 1964 but have subsequently
registered net credits of £4 million in 1965 and £12 million in 1966. Civil
aviation has produced net earnings since 1958, amounting to £23 million
in 1966.
About half of Britain’s receipts under the heading interest, profits and
dividends come from investments in the sterling area. Net earnings under
this heading increased markedly after 1961 from £264 million to £451 million
in 1965; and were £417 million in 1966. The drop in 1966 was due largely to
the resumption of full interest payments on the post-war North American loans
and to factors of a temporary nature. The major items on the debit side
include the earnings of foreign investment in Britain, interest paid on sterling
held by other countries (which fluctuates with changes in short-term interest
rates in Britain) and interest payments on the North American loans. Major
components of other services include payments and receipts in respect of
insurance and films; expenditure of United States and Canadian forces in
Britain; net earnings of merchants; and royalties, commissions, banking and
other services.
Tourism yields a substantial income from overseas; in the ten years 1957-66
overseas visitors spent over £1,700 million in Britain. For 1966 alone these
tourist receipts, excluding fares, were estimated at about £215 million.
United Kingdom residents on holiday, or travelling for business or other
purposes overseas, spent about £301 million (excluding fares) in the same
year. The United Kingdom usually has a large net surplus on earnings from
tourism with North America and the overseas sterling area, but a substan¬
tial net deficit with Western Europe. The total number of visitors to the
United Kingdom in 1966, excluding visitors from the Irish Republic, was
estimated at over 3 million—an increase of some 15 per cent over the 1965
figure, and more than twice the number in 1956.
Britain’s national tourist organisation is the British Travel Association,
which derives the major part of its income from a government grant-in-aid.
The Association undertakes publicity overseas aimed at attracting visitors to
Britain and works towards the improvement in Britain of hotel accommoda¬
tion, catering, transport, entertainment and other amenities for the tourist. It
maintains offices (see Appendix, p. 485) or agencies in 16 overseas countries.
The Association works in close collaboration with the Scottish Tourist Board
and the Wales Tourist Board (contributing to their information and publicity
services), as well as the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which is a statutory
body receiving a grant from the Government of Northern Ireland. In Northern
Ireland the Ministry of Commerce can assist, by way of grant, schemes sub¬
mitted by local authorities for the promotion of tourist traffic.
Britain’s prosperity depends on the prosperity of those who buy her exports
and theirs will depend on how they sell their exports elsewhere. Thus Britain
is a strong advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade and to this end
has taken a leading part in setting up such organisations as the International
402
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
General Agree¬
ment on Tariffs
and Trade
Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) (formerly the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation)
and the European Monetary Agreement (formerly the European Payments
Union). Britain has had a large share in these organisations’ activities,
especially those to free trade from the restrictions which grew up in the
second world war and post-war periods. It also played a full part at the first
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held
in 1964 and is a member of the Trade and Development Board which acts on
behalf of the Conference between sessions. The Conference’s second plenary
session takes place in New Delhi, India, in February 1968.
Customs duties on imports into Britain are divided into two broad cate¬
gories: revenue duties (to which there correspond excise revenue duties on
comparable British-produced goods) and protective duties. Purchase tax is
chargeable on imported as well as home-produced goods but in the main the
charge on imports is deferred until the goods are sold by a registered to a
non-registered trader. In the financial year 1966-67 revenue duties charged
on imported goods yielded about £1,950 million, by far the greater part of
which came from tobacco and hydrocarbon oils (petroleum products). The
yield from protective duties in the financial year 1966-67 was £179 million,
or about 3 per cent of the value of all imports.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs duties were
those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. Certain
duties were imposed during the first world war (the McKenna Duties), in
1921 (for strategic reasons) and in 1925 (initially for revenue purposes) but it
was not until the Import Duties Act 1932 that any serious departure was made
from the principle of free trade. This measure provided a degree of protection
for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations with
foreign countries already in possession of a tariff structure. A series of bilateral
trade negotiations between 1932 and 1939 led to some modification in the
level of protection but in the next ten years, because of government purchase
and import controls introduced during and immediately after the second world
war, the tariff lost much of its importance. The substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls from 1949 onwards re-established the tariff as the
main instrument of protection.
The Import Duties Act 1958 replaced the existing legislation relating to
the protective tariff and brought it up to date in a single measure. Following
the passing of the Act, the tariff was recast into an internationally agreed form
(the Brussels Nomenclature), which came into use from 1st January 1959.
Under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957, the Board of
Trade is empowered to impose duties on imported goods of any description
which have been dumped or subsidised and which are causing or threatening
material injury to a particular industry.
In October 1964, as part of its immediate measures to deal with the balance
of payments situation, the Government imposed a temporary charge on
imports at 15 per cent ad valorem. In broad terms it applied to all imports
except food and feedingstuffs, fuel, unmanufactured tobacco and raw materials.
The rate was reduced to 10 per cent in April 1965 and lapsed at the end of
November 1966.
The United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified in
recent years as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under
the auspices of the GATT, which seeks to increase the volume of world trade

by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade, and by eliminating discrimina¬
tion in international commerce. Tariff reductions, and bindings against
increase, negotiated between countries under the GATT are applied equally
to all other GATT countries under the ‘most favoured nation’ clause.
As a result of the latest GATT tariff negotiations, the ‘Kennedy Round’
(May 1964-June 1967), average reductions of over 30 per cent will be made
by the major trading countries in their tariffs on industrial goods. Bilateral
agreements between the United Kingdom and the EEC, the United
States and Japan provide for reciprocal reductions which are estimated
to average 37 per cent, 40 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, and affect well
over 70 per cent of British exports of dutiable industrial goods to these coun¬
tries. The implementation of the tariff reductions will be spread between
1968-72.
The principle of Imperial Preference was introduced into the United
Kingdom customs duties in 1919 and at the Ottawa Conference in 1932
agreements were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries
providing for reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of
goods. The Import Duties Act 1932 had already provided for the duty-free
entry of goods from the United Kingdom dependencies.
Under the Import Duties Act 1958 goods grown, produced or manufactured
in the Commonwealth preference area may be exempted from duty or charged
with duty at a preferential rate (and the Commonwealth preference rate of
duty for nearly all goods is nil). Certain countries outside the Commonwealth,
including the Republic of South Africa and the Republic of Ireland, are part
of the Commonwealth preference area.
In May 1964 at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
in Geneva, Britain declared itself prepared to extend tariff preferences to all
the developing countries if other major industrialised countries would do the
same, if the Commonwealth countries concerned would agree and provided
that preferences were not created by introducing new, or increasing existing,
general tariff rates.
The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was set up under the Stock¬
holm Convention of January i960 by Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, with the object of creating an industrial
free trade area between the members and of working towards a wider European
settlement. Under the Convention, protective tariffs and quotas on trade in
industrial products between members of EFTA were to be eliminated by
1 st January 1970. The first tariff cuts were made in July i960, and duties were
finally removed (with certain minor exceptions) on 31st December 1966, three
years earlier than originally planned. Finland, which joined EFTA in 1961 as
an associate member, will make its final tariff cuts in December 1967. EFTA is
the first completed free trade area in the world and now forms a single market
of almost 100 million people. Since 1959 intra-EFTA trade has more than
doubled and has increased almost twice as fast as trade between the group
and non-member countries.
A free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic
came into operation on 1st July 1966. On that date the United Kingdom
removed all protective import duties on goods of Irish Republic origin
imported from that country. After 1st July 1975, with certain exceptions,
the Irish Republic will not apply any protective duties on goods of United
Kingdom origin.

In August 1961 the British Government applied formally to join the EEC
but negotiations were suspended in January 1963. In November 1966 the
British Government announced that it was to make a new approach to the
governments of the EEC member countries to see whether conditions for
negotiating British entry into the EEC existed. Discussions took place with
each of the Six in the early months of 1967 and in May 1967 the British
Government made an application for membership.
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the
industry, the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export
trade, especially of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through
exports merchants in the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to
importers and consumers abroad through their own agents or resident repre¬
sentatives in the countries concerned; in other cases, sales are made through
a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations or subsidiary sales
companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or
domestic trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may
find it more convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export
houses, commission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms. Since
January 1957 overseas trading undertaken directly by the Government has
been confined to imports of certain jute goods; the purpose of this is to
protect employment in Dundee, where the jute industry is concentrated and
forms the mainstay of employment.
Most of the restrictions imposed on the movement of goods and services
during and immediately after the second world war have been progressively
abolished. Because of the heavy balance of payments deficit in 1964 exchange
control requirements for investments outside the sterling area have been
revised and made more stringent.
Exchange control is confined mainly to transactions between residents of the
United Kingdom and residents of countries outside the sterling area and, for
current payments, has been greatly relaxed in the past few years. Since the
end of 1958 residents of all countries outside the sterling area have been able
to settle transactions between themselves in sterling. Sterling held by non¬
residents of the sterling area on an external account is freely convertible into
other currencies, including dollars.
The remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital
from the United Kingdom to non-sterling countries. Exports of goods to
destinations outside the sterling area are subject to exchange control and, in
general, have to be paid for within six months in an acceptable currency or
by sterling from an external account. Control is also exercised over imports
to ensure that currency authorised for their payment is, in fact, used for that
purpose.
Since April 1966 certain restrictions have been placed on the release of gold
for manufacturing purposes and on the buying, selling and holding of gold coins.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of
the administration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent
of the Treasury; and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the
commercial banks a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.

Following its illegal declaration of independence in November 1965, Rhodesia
was removed from the sterling area and all transactions between residents of the
United Kingdom and residents of Rhodesia became subject to exchange control.
A basic allowance of £50 per person is allowed for private travel to countries
outside the sterling area. The purpose of this restriction is to assist the balance
of payments. This allowance covers all foreign exchange expenditure, taken
in the form of cash or travellers’ cheques, and also the cost of hotel and other
travel services, except fares paid in sterling to travel agents in the United
Kingdom. The amount of sterling notes that a traveller may take out of the
country is restricted to £15 a journey. From November 1959 to July 1966
there had been no limit on the amount of foreign currency that United
Kingdom travellers could take abroad.
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 empowers the
Board of Trade to make statutory orders prohibiting or regulating the import
or export of goods. The powers of both import and export control derive
from the same legislation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, the United Kingdom Government has progressively removed quanti¬
tative restrictions from almost all imports from the countries of the free world.
The very short list of goods on which controls remain includes some items
of special difficulty and a few where restrictions are recognised internationally,
such as arms, ammunition and radioactive materials. They require a specific
import licence and quotas have been set up for most of them. Some quotas
refer specifically to individual countries and are usually shared out among
exporters by the authorities of the countries concerned. Others are accorded
on an overall or global basis; these are generally allocated by the United
Kingdom authorities to United Kingdom importers, usually on the basis of
their share of the trade in the commodity in the past. Apart from these
quantitative controls, some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied
on health grounds (for example, on animals, plants and drugs); and there is
also a temporary general import restriction on goods from Rhodesia.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner, United Kingdom exports
are not, except in a very minor way, subject to any government control or
direction. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise
exports of military and strategic importance, to conserve materials which may
be in inadequate supply, to assist exchange control operations in preventing
the export of capital in the form of valuable goods, and to prevent the export
of works of art classed as national treasures. Normally, individual licences are
required for specific consignments of goods subject to export licensing control.
Goods controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category of atomic
energy materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may, with certain
exceptions, be exported to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic, the
Republic of South Africa and the United States of America without licence.
There is also a temporary general export restriction on goods to Rhodesia.
The British Government1 assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions

and the Development Corporation for Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Ministry"
of Commerce provides a liaison service with the Board of Trade Export Services Branch
and the overseas posts.

Its general economic policy includes the use of fiscal, credit and other measures
to maintain a stable economy and to control excessive demand for goods and
services by the home market, and action through international negotiation
to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and payments.
Facilities exist for the repayment of protective duties paid on goods which
have been imported for export trade purposes. Since October 1964 an export
rebate scheme has been in operation designed to relieve exported goods of the
burden of certain indirect taxes (for example, hydrocarbon oil duty and some
elements of purchase tax) which enter into their production costs.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the Board of Trade or
the commercial posts of Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service overseas. There are
over 200 posts in all the principal cities and trade centres abroad and they
supply the Board of Trade with information of every kind aflfecting trade with
their territories.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial
conditions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities,
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for British
products, advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out
and pass on opportunities for export business and inquiries for British goods.
Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in appointing agents
and locating potential importers. From records kept in London, brought up
to date by reports from its overseas officers, the Export Services Branch of
the Board of Trade can provide information concerning any country on:
1. prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
2. governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions
and tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
3. methods of trading;
4. local tastes and preferences in design; and
5. the commercial standing of firms with which an exporter contemplates
business relations.
The Government’s official information services overseas help to promote
trade by publicising British industrial achievements and providing informa¬
tion on new developments in British industry.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department is an autonomous government
department responsible to the President of the Board of Trade. ECGD carries
on a commercial business, providing insurance for exporters against the main
risks in selling overseas. These facilities have been progressively developed
since the Department was first formed in 1919. From very small beginnings
the amount of business covered by ECGD has grown to reach over a quarter
of the country’s export trade. ECGD is obliged to carry on its business on a
self-supporting basis, and in no way does it provide subsidies to exporters,
nor is it a charge on the taxpayer.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the

United Kingdom exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions
in the buyer’s country, war between the buyer’s country and the United
Kingdom, cancellation or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence,
or ‘any other cause of loss occurring outside the United Kingdom and not
within the control of the exporter or the buyer, and not normally insurable
with commercial insurers’. Cover may commence from the date of contract
or (at lower premiums) from the date of shipment.
The main types of export insurance policy are:
1. Comprehensive policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to
six months’ credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the
whole of his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve months
(or, in some cases, three years) covered by his policy. For certain engineer¬
ing goods this type of cover is extended to goods sold on credit terms of
up to five years.
2. Specific policies which cover capital goods sold on credit terms normally
not exceeding five years. Specific policies are negotiated for each individual
contract.
In April 1961 ECGD introduced financial guarantees for United Kingdom
banks providing finance on a long-term basis for overseas purchasers of large
capital goods and works, and in January 1962 the London Clearing Banks, the
Scottish Banks and a number of insurance companies agreed to provide finance
at fixed rates of interest for such loans, and also in respect of other export
financing on longer than three years’ credit which was secured by an ECGD
guarantee to the bank concerned. In April 1965 bank guarantees covering
100 per cent of the credit, instead of the previous 90 per cent, were made
available for two or more years’ credit and at the same time the premium
was halved. In March 1966 a similar scheme was introduced to include the
financing of exports for credit between 30 days and two years. Cover is also
available for British concerns carrying out services (including construction
projects), for overseas firms or, under certain conditions, entering into an
international consortium.
The exporter or merchant is normally required to retain an interest in the
debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are given up to a maximum
of between 90 and 95 per cent of loss; 100 per cent cover is now available
for transactions involving over three years’ credit which have already operated
satisfactorily for one year. Premium rates are assessed separately for each
country and vary according to the risks and the terms of payment.
Some 300 exhibitions, of which about 200 were trade fairs, were held in
Britain in 1967, compared with 154 in 1954. Some of the specialised fairs,
such as the Motor Show and the Royal Agricultural Show, attract large
numbers of the public, as well as many trade buyers from home and overseas,
and provide an important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom products are shown at most of the large international
trade fairs throughout the world with the support and help of the Board of
Trade. For example, the United Kingdom is usually well represented at the
Milan, Hanover and Poznan Fairs. In addition, since 1954 through a subsi¬
diary company, British Overseas Fairs Ltd., the CBI has organised British
trade fairs in 12 major cities abroad, including the British trade fairs in Oslo
in 1966 and in Toronto in 1967. British trade fairs were also organised by
Industrial and Trade Fairs Ltd. (now merged with British Overseas Fairs
Ltd.), in Moscow in 1961 and Peking in 1964 and again in Moscow in 1966.

United Kingdom manufacturers have been prominent at the many important
specialised international fairs which are held in North America and Europe.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information,
advice and, in certain cases, free facilities. The amount allocated to the Board
of Trade for these purposes has risen from £60,000 in 1955-56 to nearly £3
million in 1967-68. (‘British weeks’ differ from trade fairs and exhibitions in
that they are primarily designed to promote sales of consumer goods in shops
overseas.)
The British National Export Council (BNEC), sponsored by representatives
of industry, trade, finance and organised labour in Britain, was established in
July 1964. The Council is an independent body but has the support of the
Government. A Commonwealth Export Council was set up in October 1964
to assist the BNEC in achieving its aims with respect to British exports
to the other members of the Commonwealth. Associated with both these
councils are ten Area Councils or Committees with the primary responsibility
for developing British exports to a particular market or group of markets:
Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean,
Southern Africa, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and
Israel.
The tasks of the BNEC are to keep all British export activity under review;
to initiate, guide and inspire export efforts of British industry; to co-ordinate
the work of the associated Area Councils and to provide the necessary finance
and services for this purpose such as the sending overseas of export missions.
There is an annual scheme for Royal recognition of export and technological
achievement by industry, namely, the Queen’s Award to Industry; the first
awards were made in 1966.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain
the market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for the
chief world markets in raw materials (see below), freight, insurance, and
precious metals. A sound commercial banking system and a flexible system
of central bank control have been built up, while specialised institutions such
as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the stock exchanges,
investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy particular
needs for short-term or long-term finance. The facilities provided by merchant
banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance
shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas
countries themselves.
At the same time, the banks which were already engaged in financing trade
naturally developed to become channels for finance for longer-term ventures.
British capital invested in overseas countries has assisted their development,
increased their output and exports, and provided markets for manufactured
goods. A substantial volume of loans has been floated in the London capital
market by Commonwealth Governments (see p. 4I3)- ^ number of specialised
institutions have also been established in recent years to assist the provision
of financial services for overseas countries (see p. 414).
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic
commodities. Among the more important are the Baltic Exchange (the market
for shipping and air transport, grain, seeds and vegetable oils), the London
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
The Foreign

The Sterling
System
409
Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra, hides and skins, rubber and
sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, the
Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn Exchange. A fishmeal
market opened in London in April 1967 and a soya bean oil futures market
in July 1967. These markets not only cater for the import of goods for home
consumption but do much business in effecting transactions between buyers
and sellers in other countries. In addition to these formal markets, there is
scarcely any product which cannot be traded through an intermediary in the
United Kingdom. For example, London is the world’s most important philatelic
market and also the leading international centre for the sale of works of art.
The Foreign Exchange Market is subject to United Kingdom exchange
control regulations governing the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in
the sterling area, but these regulations have been progressively relaxed in
recent years. The turnover of the market has increased materially since the
introduction in December 1958 of external convertibility for the principal
European currencies.
The market consists of about 130 authorised banks and nine firms of
brokers, all linked together by telephone in the United Kingdom, and by
telephone, telex and cable with overseas centres.
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak
of war in 1939, was reopened in March 1954, under the general supervision
of the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the leading
centre for dealings in gold, handling the major part of the gold coming on to
the free markets of the world. All authorised banks may deal in gold but,
in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the hands of the five members
of the gold market plus one or two others. Membership of the market confers
the right to be present at the daily price-fixing when the official London gold
price is settled.
An important development was the setting up of a gold pool, initiated in
i960 to co-ordinate the gold operations in London of certain European central
banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The pool consists of a
selling consortium, which is not in operation all the time but may be invoked,
to stabilise the market, when conditions demand, and a buying syndicate.
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for inter¬
national transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in
Britain. When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries,
which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the ‘sterling area’,
did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling.
In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely
convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more formally
defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes. The United
Kingdom imposes no exchange control on transactions with residents of other
sterling area countries.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada and Rhodesia), together
with Iceland, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Republic of
South Africa, South West Africa, the British Protected States in the Persian
Gulf, and Western Samoa, are members of the sterling area. These countries
contain one-quarter of the world’s population and account for one-quarter of
the world’s trade. The main feature of the sterling area is that the greater part
410
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the overseas trade of member countries is financed in sterling, they keep
their foreign reserves largely in the form of sterling and generally maintain
a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member countries
for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings in London in exchange
for sterling and can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require.
They generally also sell gold in the London market for sterling. The United
Kingdom reserves of gold and foreign currencies are held in the Exchange
Equalisation Account, which buys and sells exchange in the market as appro¬
priate. All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or
centralised rules of conduct.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments are published
quarterly and provide a summary of the most important transactions with
other countries, classified by type of transaction and by area. For a summary
of the balance of payments position between 1962 and 1966, see Table 31,
p. 411.
The transactions fall into three main groups—current account, long-term
capital account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is
composed of the balance of visible trade (that is, the difference between mer¬
chandise imports and exports and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles.
On long-term capital account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental
loans (including amortisation) and other identified net long-term investment
abroad by United Kingdom residents, or in the United Kingdom by non¬
residents. The third heading, monetary movements, reflects in part the
United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes identified
capital transactions not of a long-term character (for example, changes in
acceptances), changes in overseas sterling holdings and changes in the United
Kingdom reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
Britain has long been a net exporter of capital. To support this outflow
and, in particular, to give financial assistance to developing countries, it needs
a surplus on current account. It tends to import more than it exports but
its trade deficit has usually been more than offset by the surplus earned on
invisible transactions (see pp. 400—t)* Britain’s net invisible earnings are
now running at a lower level than some ten years ago, so that additional
emphasis is placed on expanding exports and narrowing the gap between
imports and exports.
Between 1945 and 1951 the balance of payments on current account
fluctuated widely. From 1952 to 1963 there were surpluses in all years except
for 1955, i960 and 1961. In 1964 there was a substantial deficit of ^395
million, which fell to £118 million in 1965 and to £59 million in 1966; this
latter figure was made up of a surplus of ^257 million in the current balance
with the overseas sterling area and a deficit of million in the balance
with non-sterling-area countries.
The net outward flow of long-term capital, which reached a peak of ^3^^
million in 1964 and was still at the relatively high level of £239 million in
1965, was reduced substantially in 1966 to £128 million. The reduction was
almost entirely in private investment where the net outward flow fell from
£155 million in 1965 to £49 million in 1966. This resulted from a fall of £41
million to £315 million in net investment abroad and a rise of £65 million to
£266 million in net investment in the United Kingdom, largely as a result of
"ABLE 31
Jnited Kingdom
jEneral Balance
»f Payments
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 411
measures taken in 1965. The net outward movement of official capital at
£79 million was a little less than in 1965. Within official capital, new loans to
overseas governments, largely as part of the aid programme, rose by £20
million between 1965 and 1966; repayments made by the United Kingdom
on intergovernment loans also rose by £32 million, instalments on the post¬
war North American loans having been paid in full for the first time since 1963.
Movements of capital, both short-term and long, may mean that changes
in the balance on current account are not necessarily reflected in the reserves
of gold and convertible currencies.
The general level of the reserves has not changed greatly since the early
1950s and has usually been in the region of ,£1,000 million. In 1964, when
there was a very large deficit in the balance of payments, they fell by £122
million. In 1965, however, they rose by £246 million because of official
external borrowing, mostly from the IMF, and in 1966 they rose by £34
million, primarily as a result of the transfer of ^316 million from the Treasury
portfolio of dollar securities (see p. 412). At the end of the year the reserves
amounted to ,£1,107 million, of which ,£693 million was in gold. Britain’s net
external liabilities in sterling (excluding liabilities to the IMF) amounted to
£3,632 million at the end of 1966. Nearly three-quarters of these were towards
countries in the overseas sterling area. Net external claims in non-sterling
currencies amounted to £34 million.
In addition to its reserves of gold and convertible currencies, Britain has
drawing rights on the IMF based on its quota, which was raised to £696
million in 1959 and to £871 million in March 1966. Under its stand-by
arrangement with the IMF, made in August 1962 and renewed in 1963 an<i
1964, Britain drew $1,000 million (£357 million) in 11 different currencies in

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
December 1964. At the end of May 1965, $1,400 million (^500 million) was
drawn and in March 1966 a further $123 million (£44 million); repayments
are not due to begin until the end of 1967, but in fact part was repaid in May
1967. Britain had recourse to the IMF’s facilities on three previous occasions,
of which the most recent was in 1961 when $1,500 million was drawn.
Informal arrangements between the central banks of certain European
countries to hold each other’s currencies, together with the gold pool (see
p. 409), provide further means of safeguarding the position of sterling.
In June 1966 ‘swap (credit) facility’ arrangements were entered into by the
Bank of England with nine overseas central banks and the Bank for Inter¬
national Settlements for offsetting the effect on the United Kingdom reserves
of fluctuations in the sterling balances of overseas countries. These were
renewed in March 1967. Alongside these arrangements an earlier facility
arranged in September 1965 with the United States authorities continued in
being, together with a renewable three-month credit facility with the Bank
of France. The total of these credit facilities is $1,000 million. In addition
there is a long-standing reciprocal ‘swap facility’ with the United States
Federal Reserve System of $1,350 million.
An additional line of reserves is provided by the portfolio of dollar securities
held by the Exchange Equalisation Account. Their value had risen to around
$1,400 million (£500 million) by February 1966 when part of the portfolio
(£316 million) was transferred to the gold and convertible currency reserves.
In the estimates of Britain’s external capital assets and liabilities at the end of
1966, it is emphasised that the various elements are fundamentally different
in kind and are subject to different methods of valuation1. But two main
features of Britain’s international capital position continue to stand out. One
is the heavy net long-term indebtedness of the United Kingdom Government
to overseas Governments, which amounted to -£1,218 million in 1966, although
this figure represents a reduction of ^316 million compared with a 1962
estimate.
In marked contrast to this heavy official long-term debt are the much
larger net long-term overseas assets of the private sector, which amounted in
aggregate in 1966 to about £5,500 million representing an improvement over
1962 of about £1,000 million. It is estimated that by the end of 1966 the gross
long-term assets of the private sector were approaching £10,000 million, of
which direct investment, including oil, accounted for some £6,500 million
(at book value) and portfolio investment for well over £3,000 million (at
current market prices).
Britain’s official long-term liabilities have mostly arisen from the second world
war and its aftermath. At the end of 1966 about £2,500 million was still out¬
standing, of which £1,836 million was owed to other Governments, the greater
part to the United States and Canada.
The largest item among official external long-term claims is British
Government aid in the form of loans (see p. 415).
Overseas investors in Britain are allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the
sale of their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued.
Earned profits and dividends can be transferred, irrespective of the amount;
transfers of this kind have never been restricted.

Private
Investment:
Outgoing
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 413
Overseas long-term investment in the private sector of the British economy
has increased substantially since the war. According to the Bank of England
estimates the market value of overseas portfolio holdings of British company
securities at the end of 1966 was of the order of ,£1,025 million. The book
value of net assets held in Britain (that is, overseas direct investment) by
companies incorporated abroad (except banks, oil and insurance companies)
was about £2,250 million, and the approximate book value of the net assets
of United States and European oil companies was some £925 million.
By far the largest proportion of private investment by overseas countries
in Britain is made by United States firms. It has been provisionally estimated1
that the total value of United States direct investment in Britain amounted to
$5,119 million (,£1,828 million) at the end of 1965, compared with $847
million (,£303 million) in 1951. Nearly two-thirds of these investments were
in manufacturing, one-fifth in the oil industry and rather less than one-tenth
in distribution.
Private investment abroad may take several forms: portfolio investment,
that is, investment in overseas securities including the loans raised by overseas
countries on the London capital market; or direct investment by the estab¬
lishment of subsidiary companies abroad, by ploughing back profits earned
overseas, or by acquiring an interest in an overseas enterprise.
Apart from the voluntary programme introduced early in 1966, and still
in force, aimed at slowing down British investment in Australia, South Africa,
New Zealand and the Irish Republic, the United Kingdom imposes no
restriction on investment in the sterling area by United Kingdom residents
and about 50 per cent of Britain’s total supply of private long-term capital
abroad and 60 per cent of its direct investment goes to sterling area countries.
Direct investment is frequently made from a firm’s existing resources.
However, borrowers outside the United Kingdom must in certain circum¬
stances obtain the consent of the Treasury (which is advised by the Capital
Issues Committee) if the amount borrowed exceeds £50,000 in any one year.
Borrowing by Commonwealth and Colonial Governments in the London
capital market has fallen in recent years, but averaged about £50 million a
year in the 1950s. The market’s facilities have been made available to the
member governments of EFTA. Finance is also made available by the
Commonwealth Development Finance Company (see p. 391).
Investment outside the sterling area is subject to Exchange Control regula¬
tions. Broadly speaking, direct investment is not permitted unless it promises
benefit to the United Kingdom balance of payments in the short-term.
Britain’s private long-term capital assets abroad include portfolio invest¬
ments which, at the end of 1966, had a total estimated market value of some
£3,200 million.
In addition, there are direct British investments abroad. Bank of England
estimates indicate that their book value, relating to all companies except oil,
insurance and banking, was worth about £4,500 million at the end of 1966.
The approximate book value of oil companies’ assets at the end of 1966 was
some £1,500 million. The total value of the overseas interests of British
insurance companies is not known but, again according to estimates, the value
of direct investments by these companies at the end of 1966 in the United
States alone amounted to about £400 million. The British insurance industry

also operates extensively in other foreign countries and throughout the
Commonwealth. A survey by the Board of Trade estimated that the flow of
private direct investment abroad by United Kingdom companies (excluding
oil) was about £314 million in 1966; 63 per cent was directed to the sterling
area. The figures include long-term and short-term investment and reinvested
profits.
Owing to the increase in recent years in British Government aid to developing
countries, intergovernmental loans form the largest item among official
external long-term claims. The total of such loans outstanding at the end of
1966 was £618 million and included £480 million in loans to governments of
overseas sterling area countries. New Government loans (less repayments)
totalled £113 million in 1965-66. Amounts owed by countries outside the
sterling area are mostly in respect of advances by the British Government in
the second world war. Other official lending, which amounted to ^162 million
at the end of 1966, includes investments of the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (see below) and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
In addition, there are the official subscriptions to, and shareholdings in,
international financial organisations (see below). The Government also owns
real estate overseas, such as embassy buildings and military installations.

The total disbursed to the developing countries between 1945 and 1966 in the

agencies providing financial aid and technical assistance amounted to over
£2,000 million; and in the four years 1963-66 it averaged £190 million a
year (see Table 32). Since the end of the 1950s Britain’s aid programme has
become world-wide in scope, and the net flow of resources to the developing
countries, including private capital as well as official aid, has exceeded 1 per
cent of the national income in each of the last five years. In 1966 total aid
disbursements amounted to £209 million; bilateral disbursements to 116

Economic difficulties in 1966 made it necessary to introduce measures to
restrain public expenditure and particularly expenditure overseas. As a result
the Government announced that the aid target for the financial year 1967-68
would be £205 million as compared with £225 million in 1966-67.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of her
responsibilities towards the dependent territories and the main emphasis
today remains on territories which are, or were until recently, a British
responsibility.
In 1966, ^138 million of bilateral financial aid (66 per cent of the total
programme) was disbursed to Commonwealth countries both dependent and
independent. Of the total of £158 million bilateral financial aid in 1966,
36 per cent was in grant form and 64 per cent in loans. Grants are pre¬
dominantly for budgetary aid and for general development; about two-thirds
of the loans are provided for general development purposes. The terms of new
development loans from Britain have been progressively softened since 1958
and a new policy of interest-free loans for certain developing countries was
introduced in June 1965. In 1966, the total value of loan commitments entered
into, excluding investments by the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) was over ^87 million and of these over 90 per cent were on interest-free
terms. Among the recipients of interest-free loans in 1966 were Ceylon, India,
Kenya, Malawi, Pakistan, Turkey and Uganda. Where loans are made on
interest-bearing terms waivers of interest are granted in appropriate cases.
Of all loans committed in 1966, 97 per cent of value carried grace periods for
capital repayments averaging about six years, while the weighted average
maturity of loans was about 24 years.
Until 1966 loans for development assistance in both independent Common¬
wealth and foreign countries were administered by the Export Credits
Guarantee Department. Loans for development and other purposes are now
administered by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the department
responsible for the official aid programme. They are used mainly for the
purchase of goods, equipment and services from Britain, although there may
be a substantial element for local costs in appropriate cases. Between 1958 and
the end of 1966 about 109 loans were negotiated involving a commitment of
£529 million, of which £396 million has been disbursed. The largest recipients
have been India and Pakistan.
Aid to dependent territories includes budgetary assistance, development
grants and loans under the Colonial Development and Welfare (CD & W)
Acts, technical assistance, and investments by the CDC. Grants account for the
predominant share of this assistance. In the post-war period aid to the
dependent territories increased to a peak of £ 100 million in 1961 but, with the
achievement of independence by many of these territories, this has declined
to £37 million in 1966. Britain is providing a total of £390 million for devel¬
opment and welfare schemes over the period 1946-70 of which £343 million
had been committed by the end of March 1967. Exchequer loans in this
context were introduced in 1959 to provide a supply of loan finance to replace
the traditional source—the London capital market. A total of £125 million
is being made available over the period 1959-70, and loans approved to the
end of March 1967 total ^90 million.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Although Britain’s formal responsibility to a dependent territory ceases when
it attains independence, its continuing needs have been recognised by offering
aid in appropriate forms. Almost all of the independent Commonwealth
countries have received help towards their development by way of loans; most
have received it for special purposes connected with the transition to inde¬
pendence. Some have continued to receive budgetary aid, and all except
India, Pakistan and Ceylon can receive CDC investment. In 1966 independent
Commonwealth countries received £128 million (68 per cent of bilateral
economic aid).
The CDC was set up in 1948 to provide finance and management for
development projects in Commonwealth countries, and acts on a commercial
basis, often in partnership with private enterprise or territorial governments.
It receives advances from the British Government (£7-2 million in 1966).
At the end of 1966, £109-2 million had been invested out of a total
commitment of ^132-8 million. Of the latter, £23 million was in the Far
East and £20 million in the Caribbean, and almost all of the remainder was
in Africa.
Expenditure on technical assistance, as a proportion of total aid expenditure,
has increased markedly from 5 per cent in 1962 to 15 per cent in 1966. The
largest component of expenditure (£20 million in 1966) is on sending or
maintaining experts including those in the Overseas Service Aid Scheme
(OSAS) and volunteers in developing countries; the next largest is for students
and trainees in Britain (£4 million).
Under the OSAS Britain meets the additional costs of employing experienced
expatriate British personnel in the public services. The scheme cost £15 million
in 1966 and covered over 10,000 expatriate officers in 41 Commonwealth
countries, principally in East and Central Africa. Britain receives large
numbers of students and trainees from developing countries. Over 9,000
were financed in Britain in 1966 under regional programmes of technical
assistance, by awards under the Commonwealth Education Co-operation
Scholarships and Bursary Schemes, and under the various schemes of the
British Council. At the end of 1966, of the 15,500 British experts and
volunteers who were working in developing countries and financed by the
British Government or recruited by multilateral agencies, almost 9,000 were
engaged in the maintenance and improvement of education, public adminis¬
tration and communications.
The first volunteers were sent overseas in 1958-59; the British Volunteer
Programme has since been expanded and there were 1,720 volunteers in
developing countries in 1966-67. This includes graduates and school-leavers,
whose recruitment, training and placing overseas is undertaken by a number
of voluntary bodies; 75 per cent of the British costs (£700,000 in 1966-67)
are met by the British Government.
Britain is the second largest contributor (after the United States) to the
World Bank group of institutions. Britain has provided £31 million to the
United Nations Development Programme since 1950 and has provided more
experts and training places under multilateral schemes than any other
country—750 experts and 168 training places in 1966. Other contributions
are to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
(UNRWA), the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) and the Asian Development Bank.
WHOLESALE
TRADES
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 417
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad
categories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products
(for example, vehicle components) and trade in consumer goods, involving
the network of distributive trades by which home produced or imported
goods reach the consumer. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is outlined
in Chapter 10, The National Economy.)
There have been a number of official statistical inquiries into the distributive
trades. Most recently, during 1963 and 1964, the results of a full Census
of Distribution for 1961 were published by the Board of Trade, covering the
retail and (related) service trades in Great Britain. This was the second full
census of its kind undertaken in Britain; the first, covering also the wholesale
trades, related to 1950. A large-scale sample census, however, was conducted
by the Board of Trade into the retail and service trades in 1957 and a full-scale
inquiry into the wholesale trade for 1959. Further censuses of the wholesale
trades in 1965 and the retail trades and certain service trades in 1966 have
been taken and the data obtained are being prepared for publication. Sample
monthly and annual inquiries are also undertaken, covering such aspects of
the distributive trades as turnover, stocks and capital expenditure. Most of the
figures given in the following pages derive from either the last published
censuses or the sample inquiries.
The first census of retail distribution and other services to be taken in
Northern Ireland relates to 1965.
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through whole¬
salers: sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling
organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order businesses);
and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers. Wholesale channels
are particularly in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural produce
and foodstuffs. The inquiry made by the Board of Trade in respect of 1959
showed that out of a total of 19,000 business units engaged in wholesale
distribution in Great Britain, over 3,000 dealt in clothing, footwear and
textiles, 2,000 in grocery and provisions, 2,000 in vegetables and fruit, and
over 3,000 in other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,000 dealers
(wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies,
and 7,000 dealers in other industrial materials and machinery. The value of
stocks held by wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1966 is estimated at £1,189
million; expenditure on capital assets during the year was about £177 million.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchan¬
dise handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port whole¬
salers (who sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or,
increasingly, is sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers.
Fruit and vegetables may be sold by growers to commission agents (who
dispose of the produce either to wholesalers or direct to retailers) or the
grower may deal only with wholesale firms. The sale of some agricultural
products is regulated by statutory marketing boards (see p. 326).
London’s wholesale markets are of outstanding importance in the
distribution of foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Covent Garden
handles about 1 -2 million tons of fruit and vegetables each year; over 405,000
tons of meat and poultry pass through Smithfield market each year; Billings¬
gate is the principal distributing centre in Britain for fish. Other markets in
London include those at Leadenhall (poultry) and Spitalfields (fruit and
vegetables).
418
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
societies, the two largest being the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd.
(CWS) and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. (SCWS), to
serve the needs of retail societies, membership being restricted to incorporated
co-operative organisations. The CWS had sales of over £480 million in 1966
and the SCWS had sales of some £90 million.
Two kinds of voluntary wholesale chains have developed in recent years
particularly in the food trades. Firstly, local retailers’ buying groups were
formed and later (since 1954) wholesaler-sponsored voluntary chains (groups
of independent traders linked to a wholesaler or a group of wholesalers). Both
kinds benefit from the lower operating costs of large-scale trading without
losing their independence and both are numerically of roughly equal impor¬
tance. The 1961 Census of Distribution showed that about 27 per cent (or
40 per cent in terms of turnover) of smaller grocers—mostly medium-sized
independents and small multiples with not more than nine branches—then
belonged to these chains.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of
Retailers
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under three main headings:
(1) multiple traders, that is, organisations other than co-operative societies
with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies (see p. 419); and
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small
multiple stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches). Busi¬
nesses in each of these categories may own department stores. Other retail
outlets include gas and electricity showrooms owned by the area gas and
electricity boards and mail order businesses (see p. 422). Table 33 shows the
number of establishments and turnover for some of the main groups of retail
business between 1957 and 1966.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. On
the one hand there were ten shops (nine of them department stores) with
sales in 1961 exceeding £5 million or having takings of more than £2,000 an
hour; at the other extreme there were more than 70,000 establishments taking
less than ^2,000 in a year. Some of these are market and street traders, whose
volume of business may be very small.
The 1961 census showed that, in comparison with 1957, a larger volume of
trade had been handled by almost exactly the same number of shops and by
much the same number of people. A notable feature was the continued

expansion of the large multiple firms; these showed a further increase between
1961 and 1966 relative to other types of shops. Independent shops, however,
still account for half of Britain’s retail trade.
According to the Census of Distribution there were nearly 70,000 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple departmental stores) in 1961, having
a total turnover of ^2,580 million. This form of organisation showed the
largest rise in numbers between 1957 and 1961 and their share in total sales
went up from 25 per cent to 29 per cent. In the food trades their turnover
increased by 42 per cent, compared with 11 per cent for independent retailers
and only 3 per cent for co-operative societies. Large traders of all kinds
(including co-operative societies) accounted for nearly 50 per cent of sales
in food shops as a whole and for 64 per cent of the sales of all clothing shops.
The 7,500 shops with a turnover of over £50,000 belonging to independent
businesses accounted for 12 per cent of total retail trade. The share in total
retail trade of co-operative stores dropped from 12 to 11 per cent between
1957 and 1961 though the number of stores increased slightly. They account
for a fifth of the turnover of all grocers and a third of the turnover of all
dairymen.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisa¬
tions engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also
their customers. Any operating surplus is returned periodically to members as
a dividend; the amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the
member’s purchases.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open
to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the
member to an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of
the society. Investment by individual members is limited to £1,000 (less in
some societies). Only a low rate of interest is paid on the shares.
At the end of 1965 there were 804 retail co-operative societies registered
under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Amalgamations are slowly
diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958 was 1,015). By far the
largest single society in Britain is the London Co-operative Society with just
over 1 million members and a turnover of over £60 million a year. Total
sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1966 reached about £1,100 million
(this figure includes certain activities not covered by the Census of Distribution
figure in Table 33). The approximate average rate of dividend paid to
members in 1966 was 9d. in the £.
Smaller independent shops have been giving ground only slowly in the face
of increased competition from the larger undertakings. The proprietors of
many of the smaller shops often have other means of livelihood. Average
turnover per shop has continued to increase, though by less than for the retail
trade as a whole. None the less, allowing for a 4 per cent increase in prices,
the average small independent shop sold more goods in 1961 than in 1957.
There were nearly 800 department stores in Britain in 1961, having a turnover
of nearly £550 million—about 6 per cent of the total turnover of all retail
establishments. Department stores were defined for the purposes of the 1961
census as having 25 or more persons concerned with selling clothing and at
least four other major commodity groups. Women’s, girls’ and infants’ wear,
haberdashery and other drapery were the most important categories of goods
sold, accounting for over a third of turnover. A firm or a group of firms

frequently owns several department stores. Three groups of this kind owned
145 stores in 1961 and co-operative societies owned a further 210 stores. In
1961 there were 53 stores each with a turnover above £2 million, accounting
for nearly 40 per cent of the turnover in this kind of business.
Out of a total of over 580,000 establishments recorded by the 1961 Census
of Distribution, and shown in Table 34, grocery and other food retailing
groups numbered over 278,000 establishments, and the clothing and foot¬
wear group over 92,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (exclusive of
electricity and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by 18 per cent
between 1957 and 1961, rates of growth varied appreciably between different
types of trade. The slowest growth between 1957 and 1961 was in the food,
drink and tobacco sector, in clothing and footwear, and in the category
including booksellers and stationers; this trend seems to be continuing, except
that tobacco and confectionery have gone ahead. The fastest growth in
specialised shops between 1957 and 1961 was in furniture, general household
goods (other than furniture) and chemists’ and photographic goods, but the
pace has apparently slackened since 1961. Gas and electricity showrooms’
business was buoyant between 1957 and 1961 (and still is for gas showrooms);
their combined turnover, however, is relatively small, amounting in 1961 to
slightly more than £100 million.

The aggregate number of shops in Great Britain decreased slightly between
I957 an<^ There were modest decreases in shops selling groceries,
clothing and footwear, and in the booksellers and stationers group, and a
noticeable fall in the number of confectioners, tobacconists and newsagents.
The highest proportionate increase was in the number of general household
goods shops.
Provisional results of the Northern Ireland 1965 Census of Retail Distribu¬
tion (and other services) show total spending of ^385 million through 22,000
establishments.
Retail prices, which had previously been rising for some years until 1958, were
relatively stable in 1959 an<^ I9^°> again moved upwards between 1961
and 1966. The rise was relatively large in 1964 on account of higher import
prices and increased taxes.
1 he development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has
probably contributed to the notable expansion in sales achieved by the
multiple stores. According to the 1961 Census of Distribution, self-service
sales exceeded £525 million, two and a half times the level of 1957, and the
average turnover in fully self-service grocery shops was over £55,000
compared with £13,000 in other grocery shops. About 9,500 stores, of which
9,100 were grocers, were operated wholly or partly on self-service lines
towards the end of 1961, compared with 4,000 in 1957, less than 500 in
I95° and 10 in 1947; by the end of 1966 it is estimated that there were
probably over 17,000.
Supermarkets may be defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling
area of 2,000 square feet. There were about 870 supermarkets in 1961, accord¬
ing to the Census of Distribution, of which 524 were owned by multiples,
308 by co-operative societies and 38 by independents. It has been estimated
that by the end of 1966 over 3,000 had been opened.
New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since
1955, and an increasing number of coin-operated machines are being installed
in factories (over 7,000 factories are estimated to provide facilities) and
commercial premises as well as in normal retail outlets. The range of goods
sold is widening; in addition to the traditional cigarettes, sweets and stamps
there are now machines selling hot and cold beverages, prepared foodstuffs,
stockings, paper-back books and other commodities including coal and various
solid fuels. Various estimates have been made of the trade done through
automatic vending machines; possibly some 300,000 machines are in use, and
total sales may be of the order of £20 million to £25 million a year. Traders
who owned and operated automatic vending machines, but were not otherwise
engaged in retail trade, had sales of over £4 million in 1961.
Some 11,700 mobile shops1 were reported in the Census of Distribution for
1961, with sales amounting to £93 million. Nearly a quarter of this turnover
was concentrated in Scotland (where the density of population is lower than
in England) compared with a tenth of all retail sales. Co-operative societies
accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against 6 per
cent in ordinary food shops. For the most part, mobile shops were concerned
with food sales; about 42 per cent were travelling grocers, and over 28 per
cent and 21 per cent respectively were greengrocers and butchers. Only a

very small proportion (about 6 per cent) were non-food shops, and these
specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
Stamp trading—the practice of giving stamps in proportion to the value of
goods sold, which may be exchanged later for a ‘free gift’—has expanded
rapidly in recent years. There are, however, signs that the rate of growth is
levelling off. According to an unofficial estimate made in 1964 they are saved,
on average, by about 36 in every 100 women in Britain, with a possibly
higher proportion in the London area, and are given by some 50,000 retail
outlets, the majority of which are food shops and petrol stations. The two
largest stamp companies in Britain claim about 90 per cent of the business,
the rest being shared among a number of small companies. Issuers of stamps
are required by law to mark them with their cash value and redeem them in
cash if so requested. Gifts distributed by the companies had a retail value of
about £8 million in 1965.
A facility which is being extended in Britain is the ‘credit card’. Users are
issued with a card on production of which their signature is accepted on
bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The issuers then meet
the bills and recover from the card-holder through a single account presented
periodically. Normally users are required to pay a regular subscription as
well.
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain in recent years. Mail order sales through all channels reached
£276 million in 1961. The 1961 Census of Distribution showed that the sales
of specialist retail mail order businesses had risen from ^126 million in 1957
to £227 million in 1961, a rise of 80 per cent; they showed a further increase
of 84 per cent between 1961 and 1966. Mail order sales in 1961 by large
retailers amounted to ^12 million, by manufacturers to £34 million and by
wholesalers to ^4 million.
An inquiry conducted by the Board of Trade showed that sales by manu¬
facturers direct to the public totalled £144 million in 1961, compared with
£70 million in 1950. Mail order sales accounted for 24 per cent of the former
total, sales to employees for 11 per cent, and charges for work done for 9 per
cent. Other direct sales, including sales by door-to-door salesmen, accounted
for the balance. Included in these sales were items as various as carpets,
washing machines, brushes, books and soft drinks.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those trades which offer a
service directly to the public, notably the catering and hotel trades, laundries
and dry cleaners, the garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and boot
and shoe repairers.
An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade relating to 1964 showed
that there were 151,000 establishments primarily concerned with catering
(defined to cover public houses, canteens, and fish and chip shops, as well as
licensed hotels and restaurants, etc.) with a total turnover in that year of
^2,036 million. Hotels and holiday camps (excluding boarding houses and
unlicensed hotels) had receipts of about ^286 million, of which ^124 million
was from residential accommodation. Nearly half the total turnover of the
catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks. Between 1964 and 1966

There were about 1,400 commercial laundry businesses with an annual
turnover of about £67 million in 1961. Between 1961 and 1966 turnover

increased by 23 per cent. Dry cleaning firms in 1961 had a turnover of £40
million which increased by 30 per cent between 1961 and 1966.
An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade for 1962 showed that there were
nearly 47,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain, with nearly 58,000
establishments. Their total turnover amounted to £2,979 million, including
transactions between traders amounting to roughly £6oo-£8oo million.
Traders classified as new vehicle dealers had nearly 14,700 establishments
and accounted for two-thirds of the total turnover. Over 14,000 establishments
were classified as being primarily petrol stations, and 12,600 were also general
repairers. Between 1962 and 1966 the motor trades turnover has increased
by 33 per cent.
Takings in hairdressing establishments increased very rapidly between 1950
(£38 million) and 1961 (£97 million). They rose again between 1961 and 1966
by another 15 per cent. There are about 40,000 hairdressing establishments.
There are some 10,000 establishments specialising in boot and shoe repairs
(excluding repairs handled through footwear shops); they had takings of £25
million in 1961.
Other establishments found in shopping areas and offering a service to the
public include launderettes (over 1,000 businesses were running these in 1961),
licensed betting offices (over 15,000 in 1964) and over 3,500 funeral under¬
taking businesses.
The annual expenditure of British industry on packaging has been estimated
at over £750 million. The expansion of self-service shops, the growth of sales
in the form of branded and standardised products, and developments in partly
prepared foods, for example, ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake
mixes, have been major factors in the great changes which have taken place in
packaging methods. Paper packaging, including cartons and boxes, remains
the most extensively used with a turnover of £340 million a year, the fastest
growing sector being paper sacks. New uses are being found for tinplate
(output, £120 million a year), especially in sales of soft drinks and beer. Glass
and plastic packaging each account for about £60 million a year. The use of
plastics continues to develop; output of polypropylene film reached some
4,000 tons in 1966.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers,
has been greatly helped by instalment purchase. Instalment credit debt
outstanding to the main providers amounted to £1,005 million at the end of
March 19671; nearly three-quarters was owed to finance companies and the
remainder to durable goods shops and department stores. There are a large
number of finance companies but a high proportion of the business is done by
a small number which operate on a national scale.
The Board of Trade has powers to regulate the terms of hire-purchase and
credit sales agreements in order to restrain the expansion of consumer credit.
The current terms are: a minimum deposit of 25 per cent on most durable
consumer goods except, mattresses and furniture (15 per cent), photographic
and optical equipment (33^ per cent) and cookers and water-heaters (10 per
cent). There is usually a maximum repayment period of 30 months for most

goods except cookers and water heaters (4 years), cars and motor cycles
(3 years), and photographic and optical equipment (2 years).
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1966 to over
£14^ million and at the end of 1966 the hire-purchase debt owed to them
amounted to ^15^ million.
Advertising
and Industrial
Information
Public Relations
About £439 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1966. About £289 million was expended on press advertising and £109
million (including tax) was spent on television advertising. The remainder
was divided between other media, such as posters, films, catalogues, window
displays, exhibitions, and free samples and gift schemes. Most of the advertis¬
ing is carried out by advertising agencies, which, in some cases, also provide
marketing, consumer research and other services; their representative
organisation is the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. The trade associa¬
tion for the industry as a whole, including agencies, advertisers and owners of
advertising media, is the Advertising Association. It was responsible for the
setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body whose
objective is the promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of
advertising, in particular through the British Code of Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce have in recent years paid increasing attention to
improving public understanding of their work and objectives. Public relations
consultancy firms and the public relations departments of advertising agencies
provide general services, apart from the increasing employment by industrial
organisations and trade associations of staff specialists in public relations.
Their professional body, founded in 1948, is the Institute of Public Relations:
not only commerce and industry, but the professions, national associations,
central and local government are represented within the Institute.
Consumer Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the
Protection consumer against specific abuses. Non-statutory organisations also exist to
further the consumer’s interests. Weights and measures legislation, one of
the earliest forms of consumer protection, was brought up to date and
extended in scope by the Weights and Measures Act 1963; it is strictly
enforced by qualified inspectors of local weights and measures authorities.
The Merchandise Marks Acts 1887-1953 are designed to ensure that the
marking of goods is both accurate and honest. The purity, hygiene and
description of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs Acts 1955, 1956
and 1958. The Consumer Protection Act 1961 gives the Home Office power
to make regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods.
The Hire-Purchase Act 1965 and the Hire-Purchase (Scotland) Act 1965
provide safeguards to the consumer who buys goods on hire-purchase or
credit sale terms. The protection extends to agreements up to £2,000
although most of the safeguards do not apply to credit sale agreements for
less than £30. Similar legislation has been in operation in Northern Ireland
since 1st July 1966. As a precaution against fraud, virtually every hire-
purchase agreement on a car is registered with H.P. Information Ltd., a
non-profit-making company whose members are car dealers or finance
companies concerned with car sales; dealers and finance houses can check
with it in confidence.
The British Standards Institution (see p. 263) has established a number of
standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial Design (see
p. 221) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.

The Consumer Council, financed by a grant-in-aid from the Board of Trade,
was set up in 1963 to concern itself with and promote the consumer’s interests.
Within the limits of its finance and terms of reference it is fully independent
and so is free to criticise government departments and to bring pressure to
bear on other bodies. It is specifically debarred from engaging in comparative
testing of products, from law enforcement action and from taking up
complaints on behalf of individual consumers. It works in close touch with
the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (see p. 129).
Advice to its members on the merits of consumer goods is provided by the
Consumers’ Association (CA), a private body financed by the subscriptions of
members. It arranges tests and makes reports on the quality of goods bought
on the open market and its findings are published in its monthly bulletin
Which ?, issued to subscribers. The Research Institute for Consumer Affairs,
established with a grant from the CA, undertakes research into consumer
goods and services, and publishes reports. There are also a number of local
independent consumer groups, which in 1963 formed themselves into a
national Federation of Consumer Groups. Assistance with certain aspects
of consumer guidance is also given by a number of other private bodies and by
certain government departments and local authorities. Individual trades and
industries have also taken measures to raise standards of quality.
The practice of resale price maintenance and its enforcement by the cutting
off of supplies was made unlawful under the Resale Prices Act 1964, though
exemptions may be granted on certain grounds by the Restrictive Practices
Court (see p. 252).

Formation of
Ministry of
Labour
Less than 200 years ago, government concern with all aspects of employment
was at a minimum. It was generally considered that it was not a function
of government to ‘interfere’ between employers and employed, and that the
unregulated pursuit of self-interest would of itself produce the best results
for both parties and for the community. The statutes passed in medieval
and Tudor times to regulate the level of wages and the training of craftsmen
were no longer applied, and it was a matter of principle that the new industrial
development based on the introduction of power-driven machinery and the
factory system should proceed without hindrance from any restriction on
the conditions under which workers were employed in the mills and mines.
Even associations of workmen seeking by joint action to improve their situation
were forbidden as a threat to civil peace and individual liberty.
State intervention came first in the sphere of safety, health and welfare. By
the end of the eighteenth century, a reaction had begun in favour of legislation
to protect the workers, especially little children, from excessive toil and
hardship, and the reformers became strong enough to secure the passage of
the first factory legislation in 1802. The first effective Factory Act was that
of 1833 which not only limited the hours of work for children but set up a
national system of inspection to enforce its provisions. Since that date,
legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the statutory
protection for employees has been passed at an accelerating rate. (The record
of legislation providing for monetary recompense for industrial injury or
death is part of the history of social security, see p. 136.)
Trade unions ceased in 1824 to be ‘actionable conspiracies in restraint of
trade’, but their activities were still closely circumscribed and they had no
proper legal status, while their development met strong opposition. However,
during the nineteenth century new unions of skilled and semi-skilled workers
grew up, more soundly organised and more acceptable to the public because
their ambitions were more restricted. A number of employers’ associations,
mainly local, were formed during this time, unions and employers learned to
bargain together, and procedures for conciliation and arbitration began to
be agreed. Following the recommendations of a Royal Commission, legisla¬
tion was passed in the 1870s clarifying and regularising the legal status of
trade unions. Today it is customary for employers’ associations and trade
unions to be statutorily provided with representation on advisory committees
and administrative tribunals concerned with labour questions. For workers
in trades with weak organisation, which were unable to secure and enforce
minimum standards of remuneration, the Trade Boards Act 1909 introduced
for the first time in the modern era a state-sponsored machinery to determine
and enforce minimum rates of wages.
In the following year, 1910, the first employment exchanges were introduced.
This move represented the defeat of the concept that people unemployed
were so through unwillingness rather than inability to find work. The
employment exchanges provided a nation-wide service for putting employers
LABOUR

in touch with workers and vice versa. In 1917 the exchanges were transferred
to the newly created Ministry of Labour. (The factory inspectorate was
added to its responsibilities in 1940-) This department is today the principal
instrument of the government’s labour policies in Great Britain; in Northern
Ireland employment matters are among the responsibilities of the Ministry
of Health and Social Services. The range of services has extended to take in
special help to particular groups, such as disabled and young people, the
provision and promotion of training, measures to foster good industrial
relations and good personnel management practices, and the administration
or supervision of schemes to give financial benefits to the unemployed, the
migrant worker, the redundant and those in training.
The experience of mass unemployment between the two world wars led
to a new appreciation of the role the government could and should play in
securing for the people the opportunity to work; the first legislation in Great
Britain dealing with structural unemployment was passed in 1934 and
provided inducements to industry to settle in areas of heavy unemployment.
In the last two decades governments in Britain have accepted an even wider
responsibility for securing, without interference with individual liberty and
freedom of choice, an adequate supply of manpower, in the right numbers,
with the right skills, in the right places, as part of its total concern, in association
and consultation with the representatives of employers and employees, for the
development of the whole economy.
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the middle of June 1966
was about 25^ million, some 48 per cent of the total population, and included
about 74 per cent of persons of normal working age (15 to 59 years for
women, 15 to 64 years for men). About 93 per cent of the men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 7 per cent consist
mainly of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of
some persons of private means. The proportion of women of working age
in or seeking gainful work is much lower, about 53 per cent, as many
housewives either do not wish or cannot manage to take employment outside
the home. Just over half of the women at work are married. Besides those of
normal working age, there are probably over a million older men and women
still at work. The great majority of the working population work for a wage
or salary, but about 1*7 million are employers or self-employed.
Northern Ireland, which has 2-7 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom, has 2-3 per cent of its working population. The ratio of
working to total population in Northern Ireland is about 40 per cent, and
farmers and smallholders working their own holdings account for about
one-tenth of the working population.
The rate of increase in the working population has slowed down (see Table 35)
since 1962 for demographic reasons. These include a tendency for young
people to stay longer in full-time education, a higher proportion of women
marrying and interrupting their working life (many re-enter the working
population later on when their family responsibilities permit), and a reduction
in immigration resulting in a change from a net inflow to a net outflow.
Because of the effect of the lower birth rates in the early 1950s and of the
change in migration patterns, no net growth in the working population

between 1966 and 1971 is expected, and because of the raising of the minimum
school-leaving age in 1971 it is expected to be lower between 1971 and 1975
than it was in 1966. After 1975 the working population is expected to increase
again, so as to show a total increase of some 3 to 4 per cent in the period 1966
to 1981, compared with an increase of some 6 per cent between 1956 and 1966.
Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may-
raise the numbers above the levels forecast, it is clear that increasing demand
for labour must be met by better deployment of manpower and improved
productivity. Married women form the only substantial reserve and the
Government is studying the nature of the obstacles to employing those who
are willing to work and how they may be overcome.

Deployment of The present industrial distribution of employees in civil employment is shown
Labour in Table 36. Rather less than 41 per cent are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 2 per cent in agriculture and
fisheries, even during the harvest season. Over 57 per cent of those in manu¬
facturing are in the metal, engineering, vehicles and chemicals groups of
industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work, for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. It is illegal to employ women in certain jobs, such as
underground work in coal mines. The industrial groups in which women are
chiefly employed are: the metal-using industries; the manufacture of textiles
and clothing; the food, drink and tobacco industries; the distributive trades;
and professional and miscellaneous services.
The numbers given in Table 36 as working in any industry or service
include those engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that
the totals given for the production industries are greater than the numbers on
productive processes. According to an inquiry made in May 1966 by the
Ministry of Labour into the occupations of employees in manufacturing
industries in Great Britain (in firms with 11 or more employees) 24 per cent

were administrative, technical and clerical workers (the ratio ranged according
to industry from over 36 per cent in chemicals and allied industries to under
12 per cent in clothing and footwear).
A manpower research unit was set up in the Ministry of Labour in 1963 to
examine manpower requirements over the whole economy and in particular
industries and occupations during a period five to ten years ahead. The
forecasts are designed to help the Industrial Training Boards (see p. 433) and
all concerned with training to meet future requirements in industry, youth
employment officers (see p. 431) and others giving vocational guidance to
new entrants to the labour force, and in economic planning generally.
The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole in the last 20 years has
been among the lowest in the world—usually between 1 and 2 per cent.
It has been particularly low in the south-east and Midlands of England, and
consistently higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest
dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the heavy
engineering and metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland

and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside. These areas have been
the subject of a series of measures of selective assistance to stimulate industrial
expansion; and more recently, counter-measures have been taken to limit
expansion in areas of manpower shortage (see p. 264). The general unemploy¬
ment rate in Great Britain at July 1967 was 2-1 per cent; the areas with the
highest rate were northern England, Wales and Scotland (3-7 per cent).
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 591,000 in
June 1966 (393,000 males and 198,000 females). The number of insured
employees was about 511,000. The largest productive industries are agricul¬
ture, engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agricultural work in
Northern Ireland is done without hired help.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1967 it was 7>7 per cent of the
insured employees. The Ministry of Commerce of the Northern Ireland
Government has wide powers (similar to those in Great Britain) to assist the
development and diversification of industry. It is using these powers
vigorously in an attempt to improve the situation.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The main government employment services are provided in Great Britain
through the Ministry of Labour’s country-wide network of some 1,000
offices, which act as employment exchanges. The services in Northern
Ireland are run on similar lines by the Ministry of Health and Social Services
but there are some variations related to the much smaller area of administra¬
tion and the higher rate of unemployment.
The primary function of the employment exchanges is to introduce, free of
charge and without obligation, suitable persons seeking employment to
employers requiring employees, thus providing an efficient service to employers
and job-seekers and meeting the needs of the national economy. Employers
and employees alike remain free to use general or specialised fee-charging
private employment agencies and direct recruitment by advertisement or
personal introduction. The employment exchanges accept on their registers
both those seeking employment (full or part time) and those in work who
desire a change, and every exchange receives particulars of posts vacant and
applicants available in other areas. Local employment committees, on which
employers, workers and other local interests are represented, are attached to
certain employment exchanges as advisory bodies to secure the full benefit of
local knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers.
The employment exchanges offer a selective service to certain groups of
employers and employees through specialised registers. All exchanges hold
a Commercial Register of situations vacant and wanted in the distributive
trades, clerical and typing posts and catering and other services. Nearly
40 of the larger exchanges hold a Professional and Executive Register concerned
with posts in the professions, management, science, business and technical
employment at home and overseas. There are nearly 30 offices, in places
where there are large groups of hospitals, which have officers specially
trained to deal with the employment problems of nurses, midwives and those
in related occupations. Elsewhere nurses and their employers are dealt with
LABOUR
431
at the local employment exchange. In view of the increasing number of
older persons in the population, employment exchanges have instructions to
make special efforts to find them employment and to encourage employers
to consider older workers on their merits.
Vocational guidance services for young people in co-operation with local
authorities (see below) and for the disabled as part of the Disablement
Resettlement Service (see below) are well established as is the selection of
candidates for the government vocational training scheme (see p. 434). The
Ministry of Labour also operates an Occupational Guidance Service for adults
staffed by specially trained officers at a number of the larger employment
exchanges. Guidance is given to adults of any age who may be in doubt about
the kind of work for which they are best suited.
Employment exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations
to young men and women considering a career and to older people seeking a
new one, for example, ex-Regular officers of the armed forces.
The Youth Employment Service in Great Britain is the responsibility of the
Minister of Labour, and is under the general direction of the Central Youth
Employment Executive (composed of senior officers of the Ministry of
Labour and the education departments) appointed by him. It is operated in
most areas through Youth Employment Offices established by local education
authorities in accordance with schemes approved by the Minister of Labour.
In the remainder it is operated by the Ministry’s local offices.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information
on careers, give vocational guidance, find suitable employment and keep
contact with young workers to help them settle down; a further function is
to help employers to fill vacancies for young people. Local youth employment
committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers and other appropriate
interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the Youth Employment Service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different in that
parliamentary responsibility rests with the Minister of Education and the
service is operated by a statutory board composed of representatives of local
education authorities and other educational and industrial interests. Of the
board’s expenditure, 80 per cent is met by the Ministry of Education and
20 per cent by local education authorities.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled persons
to get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving
age who is substantially handicapped as a result of injury, disease or congenital
deformity in obtaining or keeping employment. The Ministry of Labour is
responsible for the administration of the Service and is assisted by the
National Advisory Council on the Employment of the Disabled.
The help given falls under five main headings:
Vocational guidance is given at local offices by specialised disablement
resettlement officers (DROs) in consultation, as necessary, with the local
disablement advisory committees, hospital resettlement clinics and medical
interviewing committees, and also in the industrial rehabilitation units (see
p. 432).
Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifications and aptitude and to medical
guidance, and concentrating on what the person can do rather than on what

he or she cannot do, the DRO endeavours to find the work most suited to
each, with or without an intervening period of industrial rehabilitation or
vocational training. A Register of Disabled Persons is maintained, and in
mid-April 1966 the number registered was over 654,000; registration is
voluntary. All employers of 20 or more persons are required to employ a
quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except shipping, in respect
of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons. The number of
registered disabled persons unemployed in mid-April 1967 was under 58,000.
There are 30 Blind Persons Resettlement Officers (BPROs) attached to
offices of the Ministry of Labour whose particular responsibility is to place
blind persons in suitable work and assist them to settle or become resettled
in the working community.
Industrial rehabilitation is provided at 21 units run by the Ministry of
Labour (for medical rehabilitation of the disabled, see p. 143). The aim of
these units is to provide the final link between sickness and employment by
enabling men and women to adjust themselves gradually to normal working
conditions and to receive vocational guidance based on skilled assessment of
their aptitudes in a practical workshop situation. Attendance at the unit is
voluntary and maintenance allowances are paid. The staff includes a doctor,
occupational psychologist, social worker, DRO, industrially experienced
workshop supervisors, and usually a remedial gymnast, all under the general
leadership of a rehabilitation officer.
The Ministry gives financial assistance to two centres conducted by
voluntary organisations which provide similar facilities for the blind, and to
four schemes by other bodies for the rehabilitation of patients from mental
hospitals. It also helps with the cost of industrial rehabilitation in separate
centres for spastics.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government
Training Centres (see p. 434), educational institutions and employers’ estab¬
lishments. For the more seriously disabled there are special residential
training colleges run by voluntary organisations with the financial assistance
and technical help of the Ministry of Labour. There are also arrangements for
the training of special categories of disabled persons such as the blind, and for
providing grants to disabled persons who are of the appropriate educational
standard to undertake study or training for professional or comparable
employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company with no share capital,
provides sheltered employment for registered severely disabled people who
are unlikely to obtain work except under special conditions. At the end of
1966 it employed over 6,800 severely disabled men and women in 87
factories. Some 150 home workers were supplied with work from six centres.
The directors are appointed by the Minister of Labour; funds for capital
development and to meet operational costs are provided by loans and grants
from public funds.
The Ministry also gives financial assistance to local authorities and voluntary
organisations towards the cost of providing facilities for sheltered employment
for 2,000 severely disabled sighted workers and for 3,700 blind workers.
As part of the policy of encouraging geographical mobility of labour within
Britain to balance resources and demands, the Ministry of Labour makes
grants and allowances to help with costs of fares, temporary lodging and
acquisition of and removal to the new home, in specified instances. They are

available to unemployed workers moving to new employment, and therefore
settling, in another area, to key workers transferred by a firm into a develop¬
ment area to inaugurate a new plant, and unemployed workers recruited to
new plants in development areas and sent to the parent works for preliminary
training.
Commonwealth citizens from overseas are subject to control under the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which came into force on 1st July 1962
and applies, broadly, to all Commonwealth citizens1 (except for those who
were born in the United Kingdom or hold passports issued by the United
Kingdom Government). If they wish to come to Britain for full-time employ¬
ment, they must first obtain a voucher issued by the Ministry of Labour.
Vouchers are issued to Commonwealth citizens (subject to a numerical
limit laid down from time to time by the Government) on the application of
an employer who has a vacancy for a particular individual, or on their own
application if they have certain special qualifications or skills. (Commonwealth
citizens who wish to work in Northern Ireland, and who are not ‘Northern
Ireland workers’,2 need special Northern Ireland employment permits,
which are issued only in respect of definite jobs.)
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment
provided they hold a permit issued to the prospective employer by the
Ministry of Labour (the Ministry of Health and Social Services for Northern
Ireland if the proposed employment is in Northern Ireland). In Great Britain,
over 66,000 such permits were issued in 1966. Approximately 18,500 workers,
mainly skilled, came to work in industry and commerce, nearly 16,000 to
work in the hotel and catering industry, 12,500 for domestic work and 8,600
as student employees. Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in
the first instance but may be extended on the employer’s application.
Before a permit is issued, the Ministry of Labour must be satisfied that
there is a vacancy for which no suitable British or foreign worker already
long-resident in Britain is available, and that the wages and conditions of
employment are not less favourable than those enjoyed by British workers.
These conditions are waived for student employees who are admitted for
limited periods in order to improve their English and to gain a wider
knowledge of their occupations. A foreigner in employment in the United
Kingdom may not change his job unless his prospective employer has obtained
prior approval from the Ministry.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements
for assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in
other member countries.
As part of its plans for increasing productivity in industry the Government is
fostering the expansion and improvement of industrial training. The whole
framework of training in industry was strengthened by the Industrial
Training Act 1964. Under this Act the Minister of Labour is setting up
industrial training boards to be responsible for the quantity and quality of
industrial training in the industry concerned; up to June 1967 19 boards
had been set up. Each board can provide its own training courses or arrange

for other organisations to provide training. It raises a levy from employers
and makes grants to those whose training courses it approves. The Minister
meets the initial administrative costs of each board and is making grants
towards certain other expenditure: for example, training courses for trainers
and research projects. To advise the Minister of Labour on the administration
of the Act and on industrial training questions generally, a Central Training
Council (CTC) consisting of employer and trade union members, representa¬
tives of nationalised industries, educationists, selected chairmen of training
boards and others with a special interest in industrial training has been set
up. It also advises the Minister on the running of the Industrial Training
Service (ITS), which is grant-aided by the Ministry of Labour. The work of
the ITS includes assessing training needs both for industries and individual
companies, developing training schemes, and promoting group training
schemes.
In some of the industries for which training boards have not yet been set
up, apprenticeship training is governed by agreements between employers’
associations and trade unions. Practical training is provided mainly within
the individual firm, and associated technical education is obtained by attending
a technical college. Training of operatives is usually arranged by the individual
firm but in a few industries there are agreed national or regional schemes.
Government measures to stimulate training activity include grants for the
training of training officers on approved courses, for the appointment of
training development officers and for the promotion of group training
schemes. A direct contribution is made by the Government’s own training
centres (see below).
The Government Vocational Training Scheme, administered by the Ministry
of Labour, is intended to augment what industry is doing to overcome
shortages of skilled workers in industries of importance to the national
economy, as well as helping persons in special need, such as the disabled
(see p. 432) and ex-Regular Service men and women, to fit themselves for
suitable employment. Training is provided for suitable persons over 18 years
of age who are unskilled or whose prospects of employment in their existing
trade are poor. Employed persons as well as the unemployed are accepted for
training in trades of importance to the national economy. Most of the training
is provided at the 33 (being increased to 42) Government Training Centres
(GTCs), which are situated within easy reach of the main industrial centres
of the country, and between them offer courses in about 40 different trades,
with emphasis on those in which there is a shortage of skilled labour. Schemes
of training for particular trades are agreed with representatives of the employers
and workers concerned.
For the disabled and for ex-Regular Service men and women and the un¬
employed with special resettlement problems, training in other trades is also
available under the scheme at technical and commercial colleges and private
training establishments or by means of individual courses at employers’
establishments. For severely disabled persons training is provided at four
residential training colleges run by voluntary organisations with government
financial assistance.
During training, trainees are paid good allowances to maintain themselves
and their dependants. During 1966, 10,458 people were trained under the
scheme and over 90 per cent of them were subsequently employed in the
trade for which they had been trained.
Training can also be given in GTCs to men sponsored by their employers
where it can be fitted in with the Ministry’s other training commitments.

The employer continues to pay the trainee’s wages and is charged a fee for
the training provided.
The Ministry of Labour’s Regular Forces Resettlement Service helps
Regular officers and other ranks returning to civilian life to find suitable
employment. Nearly all those leaving the Services are successful in securing
satisfactory resettlement. The Ministry arranges special six-week business
training courses for Regulars and ex-Regulars (mainly ex-officers) at com¬
mercial and technical colleges; four-week courses in industrial supervision
are provided at the Ministry of Labour, Ebury Bridge House, London, for
non-technical warrant officers and senior NCOs (or other Service equivalent
ranks). In addition to full courses for a civilian trade, refresher courses and
conversion courses required for ex-Service men and women can be arranged
under the Vocational Training Scheme.
The Ministry is providing full-time training for a limited number of
apprentices. Instruction is given in four trades: engineering; radio and
electronics servicing; basic electrical work; and sheet and plate metal work.
The apprentices are sponsored by their employers, who pay their wages
during the course. A charge is made where the appropriate Industrial
Training Board has approved the training and has instituted a system of
‘off the job’ training grants.
The Ministry also provides assistance with training for firms on first
moving into a development area or expanding an existing business there.
The assistance includes grants for training carried out by the employer and
direct training of employees on the firm’s premises by staff loaned by the
Ministry.
A special service to industry is the Ministry of Labour’s Training Within
Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme. Its object is to develop the skill of
supervisors in instructing others, in human relations, in improving methods
and in preventing accidents (there are separate programmes for each of
these). There are special versions of TWI, usually in courses of a week’s
duration, for supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals.
Ministry Training Officers either give these courses or train employers’
nominees to enable them to run TWI courses in their own concerns.
In addition, courses in industrial teaching techniques for the training of
apprentices and trade instructors are available to outside firms as well as
GTC staff at the Ministry’s two Instructor Training Colleges (one in England
and one in Scotland).
Vocational training services at GTCs, TWI courses, and courses at
Instructor Training Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under
approved schemes (for instance, those of the ILO or the Colombo Plan).
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
There are few restrictions in Britain on the freedom of an employer to hire
an employee on any terms which the employee will accept. Recent legislation,
however, embodies certain safeguards for the employee. The Terms and
Conditions of Employment Act 1959 provides machinery for enforcing on
an employer the observance of terms or conditions established by collective
agreement in his industry; under the Contracts of Employment Act 1963
employers are required to give their employees written particulars of the
main terms of employment, and employees are given rights to minimum
periods of notice when their employment is to be terminated; and under the
43 6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Earnings
Redundancy Payments Act 1965 employees with a minimum period of
service of two years are entitled to lump sum payments if their jobs cease
to exist (for example, because of technological improvements or because
of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work,
the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to by industry as a whole.
Employers are under no legal obligation to recognise a trade union, or
to refrain from refusing to employ trade unionists; nor is a collective agree¬
ment with a trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of employment,
though the terms of a collective agreement may be expressly or by implication
incorporated in an individual contract of employment. However, it is by
collective agreements that in the majority of trades and industries minimum
or standard wages, normal working hours and other terms of employment are
effectively settled. The negotiation and observance of settlements continue
to depend primarily on the strength, integrity and representative character
of the signatory organisations rather than on any legal sanction. The deter¬
mination by statute of minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay is in
principle confined to those trades and industries where the organisation of
employers or workers, or both, is inadequate to negotiate collective agree¬
ments and to ensure their observance.
Although there is legislation on minimum standards of safety, health and
welfare in most places of employment, it is recognised that the causes of many
accidents are not amenable to statutory control. Therefore, voluntary action
taken by employer organisations, often in association with trade unions, is
encouraged.
The further considerations which affect workers’ satisfaction with their
jobs and promote harmony between employers and employed, which can be
summed up as ‘good human relations’ between management and individual
employees, are hardly susceptible of codification; they have been recognised
for some time and are receiving increasing attention from managements and
from voluntary and official organisations.
Minimum or standard time rates for the lowest-rated manual workers, as
determined by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between 4s. 6d. and
6s. od. an hour for men and between 3s. 3d. and 4s. qd. for women. Actual
earnings are usually higher. Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates,1
shift rates and overtime rates raise the level of average earnings.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted half-yearly by the
Ministry of Labour into earnings and hours of work in manufacturing
industries and some leading non-manufacturing industries in Great Britain,
the average earnings of full-time male adult manual workers in October 1966
were 8s. lod. an hour and £20 6s. id. a week. Full-time women manual
workers at the same date earned an average of 5s. 3^d. an hour and £10 is. 4d.
a week.
Minimum time rates for women manual workers tend to be set at around
70-90 per cent of the corresponding male rate, though the gap is gradually
closing. Women’s earnings are markedly lower than those of men, partly
because on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at
premium rates, but also because a smaller proportion of women do skilled
work. The Government has announced its intention of implementing the
principle of equal pay and is having talks with the Trades Union Congress
and the Confederation of British Industry about the problems involved.
1 Piece rates are of declining importance in manufacturing industries, where methods
of production tend to dictate the output of a worker, not his or her own skill or energy.

Earnings in coalmining and dock work, not covered by the Ministry of
Labour survey, are somewhat above the average; earnings are below the
average in railway work and agriculture.
Between April 1955 and October 1966 average weekly wage rates increased
by about 59 per cent and average weekly earnings by about 85 per cent. Part
of the increase has been offset by a rise in prices. The trends of manual
workers’ wage rates and earnings, salary earnings, and retail prices from 1955
to 1966 are shown in the diagram above.

BRITAIN.' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increases, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remunera¬
tion. Starting salaries may be in the range of ^600—^800 (lower for trainees
in their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The average
weekly earnings of male administrative, technical and clerical employees in
October 1966 were found by a Ministry of Labour survey to be £26 13s. gd.
The average weekly figure for females was £14 4s. nd.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £2,750 to £7,000 a year. The posts with salaries in the
range of £8,000 to £15,000 a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, top-
ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in government depart¬
ments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers,
some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher managerial
posts in industry, commerce and banking. A few persons in business draw
still higher salaries, while the earnings of star entertainers and certain other
very successful people exceed £25,000 a year.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for
doing the same work in journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as
Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and
solicitors. Women in independent professions are not expected to charge
lower fees than men. The principle of equal pay applies to non-manual work
in the public sector but remains the exception in private non-manual
employment.
The average earnings of all salaried employees increased by 86 per cent
between 1955 and 1966, as illustrated in the diagram on p. 437.
In October 1966 the number of hours actually woiked by manual workers
averaged 46 for full-time men and 38-1 for women on full-time work. Agreed
weekly hours are mainly in the range 40 to 42 and are generally worked as
either a five-day or a five-and-a-half-day week according to the industry and
the rule of the particular establishment. Hours actually worked by men are
somewhat longer owing to overtime working. While the hours of work of
adult men are not, in general, restricted by statute, normal hours of work for
both sexes and those of all ages are usually within the legal limits on the hours
of women and young persons.
National legislation in the United Kingdom limits and defines permissible
hours of work for women and young persons in a number of industries or
trades—the maximum permitted, with limited exceptions, being 48 hours a
week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for 6-day-week workers) in premises
covered by the Factories Act (see p. 439) for adult women over 18 and young
people between 16 and 18; young people under 16 are limited to 44 hours a
week. The employment of women and young people at night is prohibited in
industrial undertakings, except that in certain continuous process industries
young men over 16 may, subject to certain conditions, be so employed.
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of at least 12 days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or
statutory public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday
and Christmas Day, there are bank holidays in most parts of England, Wales
and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, the last Monday in May or first

in June, the last Monday in August or first in September, and the first
weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day); and in Scotland on New Year’s Day,
the last Monday in May or first in June and the last Monday in August or
first in September1. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and,
in addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and on 12th July
(commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); the Tuesday after Easter is
also a customary holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide
that payments should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
In some industries agreements provide for extended holidays related to
length of service, work status, or both.
Where statutory wage-regulating machinery exists, it consists of bodies
known as Wages Councils. These are composed of equal numbers of
representatives of employers and workers in the respective sectors of industry,
with additional independent members. Wages Councils may submit proposals
for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Minister of
Labour, who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals,
subject only to his right to return them as a whole for further consideration.
The Ministry’s Wages Inspectorate helps employers and workers to interpret
the provisions of wage regulation orders and sees that they are complied with.
Agricultural Wages Boards (there are separate boards for England and
Wales and for Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment
in agriculture.
A variety of additional benefits in monetary form exist in varying degree. It
has been estimated that, in 1964, 13 million employees were covered by
occupational sick pay schemes and between 11 and 12 million by occupa¬
tional pension schemes (additional or complementary to the state schemes,
see p. 134). A smaller number are covered by schemes for redundancy pay¬
ments above the statutory minimum (see p. 436). Such ‘fringe’ benefits are
rather more usual among clerical and professional employees receiving a
standard salary than among manual workers with a chance to earn overtime
and other additions to their pay. The former also tend to get longer holidays.
Senior members of firms may enjoy the use of a company car.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their
employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards
of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number
of statutes; some of these also deal with health and welfare.
About 220,000 industrial premises (factories, workshops, slaughterhouses,
shipyards and docks) and about 30,000 building and civil engineering sites
come under the Factories Act 1961 (consolidating earlier legislation), which
is administered by the Ministry of Labour and enforced by H.M. Inspectorate
of Factories, which forms part of the Ministry. About 700,000 premises come
under the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, which is also administered
by the Ministry of Labour; enforcement is shared by H.M. Inspectorate of
Factories and local authorities. Under these Acts, anyone intending to employ
other people in industrial or commercial premises to which they apply has

to notify the enforcing authority of his intention before he begins to employ
people and every fatal accident and every accident causing more than three
days’ incapacity must be reported; under the Factories Act provision is also
made for compulsory notification and for investigation of certain dangerous
occurrences.
The Acts are designed to secure the health, safety and welfare of employed
persons, and a wide range of provisions in the Acts and in regulations,
according to the nature of the premises, deal with such matters as: the
fencing of machinery; precautions against fire, dangerous substances and
special risks; the safe condition of the premises, cleanliness, lighting, tempera¬
ture and ventilation; and the employment of women and young persons.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and
quarries under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954; two statutes are concerned
with agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the
Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956; and specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (part
of the Ministry of Power which is responsible for safety in mines and quarries),
the Agricultural Inspectorate of the agricultural departments, and, as regards
railways, the Railway Employment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Transport.
The Board of Trade is responsible for administering the Merchant Shipping
Acts and for safety in air transport (most of the powers in respect of air
worthiness are delegated to the Air Registration Board, see p. 366), and the
Minister of Transport is responsible for road and rail transport safety matters.
There are at present no specific statutory safety requirements in hotels,
places of entertainment or educational establishments, except in so far as
they are covered by fire regulations applicable under local authority by-laws
to all large buildings or (in respect of their offices and shops) by the Offices,
Shops and Railway Premises Act. The Ministry of Labour has no statutory
responsibility in regard to safety in workshops or laboratories in educational
establishments, though it keeps in touch with university authorities and
the education departments. Employers, however, are bound by their common
law obligation to provide a safe system of work, and employers and educational
authorities may voluntarily seek the advice and help of the Factory Inspec¬
torate, which is given freely on request.
Safety depends, in fact, at least as much on the education and voluntary
efforts of the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations.
The voluntary accident prevention movement is strongly supported by
the Factory Inspectorate. Inspectors inquire into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulate expert advice by personal
exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appointment of safety
officers and the formation of works safety committees. The Factory
Inspectorate maintains an industrial health and safety centre in London, at
which various types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards
are displayed, as well as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment.
The Ministry also actively encourages the development of voluntary central
organisation within each industry at national level for the consideration of
safety matters and the formulation of policy on accident prevention.

Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing
extent with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information
and advisory services to their members. They participate also in joint standing
and advisory committees appointed by the Minister of Labour. Representa¬
tives of the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry,
the nationalised industries and other interests meet on the Industrial Safety
Advisory Council under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour.
Training for safety is an important facet of the accident prevention effort and,
to help in this work, the Ministry of Labour provides a safety course in its
TWI scheme (see p. 435). In 1965 the Central Training Council, which
advises the Minister of Labour under the Industrial Training Act 1964
(see p. 434), drew the attention of Industrial Training Boards to the need to
include specific provisions for safety training in their general training
recommendations.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) provides a
variety of safety courses for special needs at its Industrial Safety Training
Centre in Birmingham and elsewhere. Other courses are organised by bodies
such as local accident prevention groups and organisations such as the
Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. RoSPA also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences;
during 1965-66 it appointed a number of Regional Industrial Safety Officers,
primarily to promote safety activity among top-level managers. The British
Safety Council also provides safety publicity and offers safety training
courses.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities
and other academic bodies, and government research organisations into
problems of guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards,
protective personal equipment, construction methods, fires and explosions,
psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in particular
sectors of industry. A register of research into industrial health and safety
matters has been compiled by the Ministry of Labour to give an indication
of the scale and nature of research being undertaken. Industrial research
associations include amongst their more purely economic research projects
the improvement of working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing
Committee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at
divisions, areas and the largest collieries. It conducts courses of safety
training for workmen and officials and is constantly on the alert for new
methods of reducing risks. Its research programme includes a number of
projects with a direct bearing on safety.
The Minister of Power has a statutory responsibility for research concerning
the safety and health of coal miners. This responsibility is largely exercised
through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment with laboratories at
Sheffield and Buxton.
To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by the
use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is
operated by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and
with the full co-operation of the chemical industry.
Transport operators and Ministries concerned with road and air travel
give high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every
endeavour is made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic
densities, by improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and

equipment, by traffic regulation and control of standards of maintenance and
by training crews in competency and safety awareness.
Local authorities have power, under the Public Health Acts, to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work
and to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded
as nuisances the abatement of which can be enforced. Factories, certain other
industrial premises, offices, shops and railway premises must comply with the
health and welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act. These include: the cleanliness of workrooms, adequate
ventilation and suitable temperature and lighting, the avoidance of over¬
crowding and the provision of sanitary accommodation, and the protection
of workers against inhaling harmful dust or fumes; the provision of washing
facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking
water, first aid, and seats. Legislation concerning safety in other types of work,
for example, agriculture, also prescribes appropriate measures to promote
health and welfare.
The laws restricting the employment of children, young persons and women
form an important part of protective legislation. National legislation, besides
forbidding any employment of children under 13 years of age, forbids the
employment of children who have not reached the statutory minimum school¬
leaving age (see p. 154) in any industrial undertaking; of women and young
persons underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations
(for example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of
women in factories and workshops within one month of childbirth. It also
limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young
persons in factories, and for young persons in certain other occupations. Local
authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the Children and Young
Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the Education Acts 1944-48, which regulate
hours and conditions of employment of children under 15 years within their
areas within the limits of national legislation.
These are the main legislative provisions relating to health and welfare
at work, but it is essential to note that employers frequently achieve health and
welfare standards considerably higher than those prescribed by law. They are
helped to do this by the inspectorates, by government departments and
agencies, by employers’ associations and trade unions and by expert voluntary
bodies.
A number of employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their
employees over and above the statutory requirements. It is estimated that
there are about 430 factories with full-time and about 4,630 factories with
part-time doctors employed. In addition several thousand nurses are employed
in industry. Compulsory medical examinations under the Factories Act and
regulations are carried out by 2,300 part-time Appointed Factory Doctors.1
The big employers, including the state and the boards of nationalised
industries, have naturally taken the lead but a number of smaller factories
also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together in group
medical services. The Minister of Labour is advised on measures to further
the development of industrial health services by the Industrial Health Advisory
Committee which includes members nominated by the Confederation of

British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries,
the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and other
organisations closely concerned with the promotion of industrial health.
Occupational hygiene services can give valuable assistance in securing
healthy working conditions in industry. Her Majesty’s Factory Inspectors
give advice on occupational hygiene problems as part of their normal duties.
In addition there are at present two centres in Great Britain which undertake
studies of particular problems or health risks and also carry out routine
physical, chemical and biological tests for industry.
Prompt and effective action in industrial health depends, among other
things, on adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation
and research. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate,
which has specialised medical and technical branches. Research facilities are
provided by government agencies such as the Medical Research Council;
by university faculties of industrial health and social medicine; and by the
research departments of various industries and large industrial concerns.
Other types of amenity vary considerably from one firm to another. The
requirements of a factory, office or shop where the work is light, and where
many employees are women or young persons, are different from those of an
iron foundry or steelworks, where much of the work is arduous and is under¬
taken by men. Progressive firms are careful to find out what their employees
want, and welfare policy is often decided in consultation with the workers,
through regular consultative machinery or by other means. An increasing
number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facilities. Some have
their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes. The provision
of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become usual in large
undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Colliery canteens provide
meals for about 98 per cent of coal miners. Many offices and shops which are
unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted luncheon
voucher schemes. There are now over 15,500 firms using this service.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a personnel
department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of
organisation of personnel departments varies, personnel officers are generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour
relations. They also have particular duties with regard to recruitment,
selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage
agreements, the promotion of good communication and consultation and the
supervision of working conditions and employees’ amenities.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking
decides for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited
by collective agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently
been attached to selection; and courses for training personnel officers in
modern interviewing techniques, including the use of test procedures, are
now well attended.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to
extend by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human
relations in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or
conducted by the Social Science Research Council (see p. 213) and the
Medical Research Council (see p. 207). Voluntary organisations include
bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to
444

INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS
Employers5
Associations
subscribing firms, professional associations, linking individuals with a common
interest in particular functions of management, and bodies providing
specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In addition to the assistance the Ministry of Labour can give where
employees are recruited through employment exchanges, members of the
Ministry’s industrial relations service are available to give advice on personnel
policies, personnel management techniques and problems of human relations
at the workplace, as well as assisting in the formation and support of machinery
for negotiation and settlement of disputes (see below).
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965
and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. Many firms
voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial Safety Group for the
area, supported by representatives of industry, trade unions, insurance
companies and public authorities, is very active and makes a valuable contri¬
bution in the field of industrial accident prevention on similar lines to what
is done in Great Britain.
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organisations1 * * discuss and negotiate
terms and conditions of employment and other matters affecting the work¬
people at their work. In some industries these negotiations are conducted
simply by ad hoc meetings, which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary
joint machinery has been established on a permanent basis. Normally these
arrangements for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which
are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled to be referred
for settlement to independent arbitration. The machinery for settlement in
certain trades where wages cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary
agreement has already been described (see p. 439).
The existence of these employers’ and employees’ bodies facilitates liaison
between the Government and industry on labour matters in which they have
a common interest (though it does not preclude individual contact). Standing
arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the Government,
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Trades Union Congress
(TUC) (see pp. 445 and 446) and the nationalised industries through the
National Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the
Government on matters in which employers and workers have a common
interest. It meets quarterly under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour.
Subjects of importance to relations between management and workers
generally throughout industry which it has recently studied include dismissal
procedures and the preservation of occupational pension rights.
In 1965 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the whole range
and scope of employers’ and employees’ organisations, and the legal frame¬
work in which they operate.
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ organisations
wholly or partly concerned with labour questions. The primary aims of
1 Some employers, including the central Government and the public corporations
operating the nationalised industries, negotiate directly with the trade unions repre¬
senting their different types of employees.
LABOUR
445
such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions
of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of
safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and
the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes
which may arise. Different employers’ organisations vary in the emphasis
which they put upon these different aims and in the means by which they
try to achieve them. Some concentrate on defensive action, trying by
negotiation and representations to modify proposals of trade unions and
Government in their members’ interests. Others also try to give their
members practical help and advice in developing positive employment
policies and assistance on recruitment, training and further education.
There is diversity of structure as well as function. Generally, however,
employers’ organisations are organised on an industry basis rather than a
product basis. Some are purely local in character and deal with a section
of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole
of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national federations, while in others,
within which different firms are engaged on making different principal
products, there is a very complex structure with national and regional
federations for these different sections of the industry as well as for the
industry as a whole. Although there are some 1,400 employers’ organisations
dealing with labour matters, about 100 of these are national employers’
associations, many of which are in membership of the CBI and are the ones
that negotiate the important national collective agreements with trade unions.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local
organisations or through the regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council, central committee or general committee, which meets
perhaps once a quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect com¬
mittees and to ratify their work. A small paid staff under a director or
secretary carries out the day-to-day work of the organisation. There is
usually a small working group, consisting of senior officials and committee
chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent questions and co-ordinate the
work of the committees.
The Confederation The central body of employers’ organisations is the CBI, which deals with
of British Industry all matters (not only labour relations) affecting the interests of organised
employers and represents them nationally to the Government and the public
and also internationally, for instance, in the International Labour Organisa¬
tion. CBI representatives sit on various government advisory committees,
on other statutory bodies and on a number of voluntary bodies concerned
with labour matters.
Trade Unions During its long history the British trade union movement has passed through
many changes, and is currently undergoing re-examination within and
without.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some indus¬
tries nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over a great many years, and consequently, their
form and organisation vary considerably as to their traditions and attitudes,
for example, their degree of concern with political movements. Trade unions
started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen and
446
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Trades Union
Congress
spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently
trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and
administrative workers. A number of associations of professional workers,
formed primarily for the preservation and improvement of professional
standards, have also come to exercise many of the functions of trade unions,
including negotiations on salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational (for
instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed), while in others
the qualification is industrial (that is, they seek to recruit all persons in an
industry, whatever their occupation). In a number of unions recruitment is
based on a combination of these principles. A few large unions recruit members
in a number of different occupations and industries.
At the end of 1965 the total membership of British trade unions was about
10,180,000. There were 580 unions but about two-thirds of all trade unionists
were in the 18 largest unions, while just over a half were in the ten unions
with a membership of over 250,000. The number of trade unionists is
increasing but the number of unions has gone down owing to amalgamations.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local
branch (called a lodge in some trade unions). Every member of the union
belongs to a branch. He may attend its meetings, put forward suggestions
about terms and conditions of employment, discuss the work and policy
of the union, and take part in the election of the union’s officers. The branch
takes action on certain matters considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local
interest and forwards its views on wider issues for action by the union’s
national or regional bodies. Many unions also have shop stewards or other
representatives at the place of work to enrol members and collect dues, to
ensure that local and national agreements operate satisfactorily, to take up
with management the individual problems and grievances that arise and to
keep the union informed of developments at the workplace. Only in a few
trade unions is organisation based primarily on the place of work.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines:
elected officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist
staff, are in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to an
elected national executive council or committee which may be part-time or
full-time, and which is responsible to annual or biennial conferences of
delegates from the branches. Executive committees or councils play an
important part in the government of the unions; between conferences they
are the highest authorities and carry out policy decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some regional, district or area organisation.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations
whose main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade
unions in an industry in negotiations with employers. The scope and authority
of these federations and confederations vary greatly.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC which
will celebrate its centenary in June 1968. The TUC’s objects are to promote
the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 170 organisations,
of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate unions; approxi¬
mately 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These represent
about 8-9 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions
which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives
assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries at the request
of the trade union concerned.

The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a
week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and
to employees generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents
it during the remaining 51 weeks of the year. This is responsible for carrying
out congress decisions, for watching economic and social developments, for
providing educational and advisory services to unions, and for presenting
to the Government the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and indus¬
trial issues. It is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain
circumstances and, through the General Council’s Incomes Policy Com¬
mittee, to comment on claims for improvements in wages and working
conditions notified to the TUC by affiliated unions.
The TUC is a non-political body but under the Trade Union Act 1913
individual trade unions can, by a ballot vote of members, decide to set up a
political fund, financed by a separate levy, which any member can refuse to
pay without loss of his normal union rights and benefits. About 100 separate
trade union organisations, including most of the largest trade unions, have
such a fund and, in most cases, it is used to support the Labour Party.
Both the TUC and many unions conduct extensive educational services for
members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade unionism and
industrial relations principles and practice.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year.
There are 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together
in 22 federations.
Affiliation to the TUC is open to all trade unions anywhere in the United
Kingdom, but Scottish trade unionists have their own national centre, the
Scottish Trades Union Congress, similar within its objects to the TUC, though
there are some differences of organisation. The Scottish TUC, to which trade
unions may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland (a number of
unions are affiliated to both bodies), also accepts affiliation from trade councils
and has an affiliated membership of over 800,000. It holds an annual congress
and has consultations with the Government on issues affecting Scottish
trade unionists.
In most of the main industries there are, at national level, joint committees
(sometimes referred to as joint negotiating machinery) composed of represen¬
tatives of employers and trade unions. There are some 200 in all; about 130
of them are known as Joint Industrial Councils. Their functions vary
considerably, some being simply negotiating bodies, while others deal with
a wide range of subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned.
Provision is sometimes made in their constitution that a dispute on which it
is not found possible to reach agreement should be referred to some form of
conciliation or arbitration by independent persons, including the means
provided under the Conciliation Act 1896, or the Industrial Courts Act 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions
are not civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are
not in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms and
conditions is based mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual
respect and vigilance of trade unions and employers’ organisations, but can
be secured in particular instances through reference to the Industrial Court
(see p. 448).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Arrangements for negotiation and joint consultation also exist at district
and factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed either
between the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis,
or through regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils
or similar bodies and Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements
reached at a national level may be applied to their district or factory, but as a
rule have no power to alter the terms of such national agreements. They also
discuss new problems which may arise, and if no solution can be found at
factory or district level, refer them to the national body.
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred
by agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which
the parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of
Labour. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act 1896, and the
Industrial Courts Act 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry’s
own machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement
and not to supersede the industry’s own machinery. There is no legal
obligation on the parties to a dispute to notify the dispute to the Minister,
nor to place the question before a conciliator.
To assist conciliation in industry the Ministry of Labour has an industrial
relations service, staffed by specially trained officers who keep in touch with
the course of relations between employers and workers at national, district and,
in some cases, factory level and assist them, if requested, to settle their
problems by joint discussion and negotiation. Conciliators have no legal
powers.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both
parties, be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or
an ad hoc Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent
tribunal established under the Industrial Courts Act. The court normally
consists of three members—the president, one member experienced in
representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves
enforceable at law, but under the Terms and Conditions of Employment
Act 1959, reports that a particular employer is not observing the recognised
terms or conditions of employment in his trade or industry may be made to
the Minister of Labour by organisations which are parties to the relevant
agreement or award. If the matter is not otherwise settled, the Minister must
refer it to the Industrial Court which, after hearing the case, may issue an
award requiring the employer to observe the recognised terms or conditions.
Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of employment of
individual employees and so enforceable at law.
The Minister of Labour is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry
or Committee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute (the report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before
Parliament). Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such
bodies are not binding on the parties, they often provide the basis for further
negotiations leading to a settlement.
Over the past 30 years the number of working days lost each year through
stoppages of work arising from industrial disputes, that is through strikes and
lockouts, has been on an average about 2| million which, taking the working

population as a whole, works out at approximately one hour per worker per
year. These figures, however, only record the time lost at establishments
where strikes actually take place; they take no account of the effect in other
establishments or industries. Nevertheless, the time lost through strikes is very
much less than that lost on account of sickness, accidents and absenteeism
and the United Kingdom’s record over the past ten years or so compares
favourably with that of most other industrial countries.
Strikes in Britain are not in general caused by a breakdown in the collective
bargaining machinery. This on the whole works smoothly and well. In fact
it is estimated that about 95 per cent of all strikes, accounting for between
60 and 70 per cent of the time lost through strikes, are the result of unofficial
(and usually unconstitutional) action.
These unofficial strikes are therefore symptoms of a breakdown in relations
between management and workers at the place of work itself. The problem of
securing a fundamental improvement in relations between employers and
workers and the loyal observance of agreements and constitutional procedures
freely negotiated is currently the subject of public discussion as well as in
industry generally, but it seems likely that there is no single solution.
The concept that workpeople need to have a proper understanding of
management’s aims and plans if they are to co-operate with them has focused
attention on the quality of communication down the chain of responsibility
to workshop level (a matter which depends on personal relations and on the
adequacy of supervisor training) and prompted the establishment, in many
undertakings, of means for joint consultation, such as those provided by a
works council.
A wide range of subjects can be fruitfully discussed by works councils,
including hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety and
health, productivity, absenteeism, labour turnover, training and education,
and amenities generally. Works councils are usually kept informed about the
state of the firm’s business, and frequently consider problems resulting from
decisions to change production methods. It is, however, usual to exclude
all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and other
matters covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and
workers.
Other means of communication in use include posters, wall information
sheets, production charts, house journals, film shows and exhibitions.
The Ministry of Labour’s industrial relations service is ready to assist
these developments by advice on techniques, by the supply of publicity
material and by encouraging and promoting joint consultation.
While labour relations in government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there
are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are per¬
mitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations
(trade unions) and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and
joint consultation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley
Councils (see p. 68), corresponding to the Joint Industrial Councils in industry.
If there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or associa¬
tion may, subject to certain limitations, report the dispute to the Minister of

Labour for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent
body appointed by the Minister by virtue of his powers under the Industrial
Courts Act 1919.
Industrial employees of the central Government are organised by trades
and not by departments; negotiations regarding their wages and conditions of
employment take place on Trade Joint Councils and unresolved matters are
referred to the Industrial Court for arbitration. In the major employing
departments, Departmental Joint Councils also exist for the discussion of
matters other than trade questions which are of mutual concern to the
department and its industrial employees (and which are domestic to the
department).
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint con¬
sultation with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free
to choose the arrangements that suit them. The main difference from private
industry is that the corporations are not usually members of employers’
associations (although the majority are ‘industrial associates’ of the CBI). In
some industries they are sole or main employers, but even where part of the
industry is in private hands, as for example in road transport, the corporations
are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local implications. Most of the
industries use the facilities for arbitration offered to industry generally by the
Ministry of Labour, but coalmining and rail transport have their own special
arrangements. Consultations at all levels, including the workplace level, have
been arranged in all the nationalised industries according to the traditions and
needs of each industry.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was
best carried out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate
and specially constituted joint committees at all levels.
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same
principles as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of
Health and Social Services has powers and duties broadly similar to those
of the Minister of Labour in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions with head¬
quarters in Great Britain.
17 Sound and Television
Broadcasting
Broadcasting
Authorities
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
under powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Tele¬
graphy Acts 1949-1967, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio
communications, except under licence. The Marine etc. Broadcasting
(Offences) Act 1967 was passed to suppress unauthorised broadcasting from
commercial (‘pirate’) radio stations at sea.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal
Charter in 1927. Two television services are provided by the British Broad¬
casting Corporation (BBC 1 and BBC 2) and one by the Independent
Television Authority (ITA), which was established by the Television Act
1954-
Users of sound and television receiving sets must obtain an annual licence,
which can be purchased from most post offices. There were more than
17 million receiving licences current in the United Kingdom in June 1967 of
which 14,500,000 were for sound and television combined and 2,550,000
(including 820,000 for sets fitted in cars) for sound only. A combined sound and
television licence costs £5; a licence for sound only costs £ 1 5s. Registered blind
people are entitled to free sound licences or to combined licences for £3 15s.
One licence covers all receiving sets in a household, but a separate licence is
required for a set fitted in a car. A supplementary licence fee of ^5 is required
by owners of television sets equipped to receive colour programmes.
The constitution and finances of the BBC are currently governed by the Royal
Charter of 1964 and the Licence and Agreement with the Postmaster General
of 1963, and those of the ITA by the provisions of the Television Act 1964 and
the Licence issued to it by the Postmaster General in 1964. Both the Royal
Charter and the 1964 Act specifically define the services of the BBC and ITA
as a ‘public service’ with the purpose of disseminating information, education
and entertainment.
The BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General,
as the responsible minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions
of policy and may issue directions to the BBC and the ITA on a number
of technical and other subjects. The Postmaster General also has powers to
prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class of matter, or to
revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time; these powers, however,
are treated as major reserve powers, and no formal veto has ever been placed
on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA are
required to prepare annual reports and accounts, which are presented by
the Postmaster General to Parliament.
The number of hours of television broadcasting are regulated by the
Postmaster General; he has approved an arrangement which permits any one

service a maximum of 50 hours a week (30 hours a week for BBC 2), together
with extensions (averaging ten hours a week) for certain stated purposes, such
as religious and educational programmes, schools broadcasts, ministerial and
party political broadcasts, and outside broadcasts. In 1967 the BBC was
broadcasting about 53 hours of programmes from London in its domestic
sound services during a normal weekday.
The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a chairman, a vice-
chairman and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland), each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. As a corporate body, the governors
are responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation, including
the content and presentation of the programmes in sound and television,
and the provision and working of the necessary installations and equipment.
The BBC must refrain from expressing editorial opinion on current affairs
and on matters of public policy and is relied upon to treat controversial subjects
with impartiality.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of
councils, established in accordance with the terms of the Charter: for example,
the General Advisory Council; the National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland and Wales, which are responsible for domestic services in those
countries; and the regional advisory councils for the English regions and for
Northern Ireland. There are also a number of other councils and committees,
not specifically required by the Charter, but established by the BBC to advise
on such matters as religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting, further
education, science and engineering, music and agriculture. For each of the
new experimental local radio stations (see p. 454) there is a broadcasting
council, representative of the local community, appointed by the Postmaster
General.
The chief executive officer of the BBC—the Director-General—is
appointed by the governors and with him they discuss all major matters of
policy and finance. Under the Director-General are six directors (the chief
assistant to the Director-General, and the directors of radio, television, external
broadcasting, engineering, and administration) who, between them, cover the
whole work of the BBC, and who, with the Director-General, constitute its
Board of Management. The number of staff employed is about 22,000.
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by
Parliament, for the domestic services, which is related to revenue derived
from the sale of broadcast receiving licences; (2) an annual grant, voted by
Parliament, for the external services; and (3) profits from BBC publications,
mainly the Radio Times, which has a weekly sale of over 4 million copies and
attracts a large advertising revenue. The net revenue from the sale of licences
for the year which ended on 31st March 1967 amounted to ^71,573,000. In
the same year the surplus on trading, mainly from publications, amounted to
£607,000 and the grant for the external services amounted to £11,611,000.
The cost of providing the local radio services is raised mainly from local
sources.
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and, at present, eleven other members (three of whom have special
responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland
severally) appointed by the Postmaster General. The ITA owns and operates
the transmitting stations, but the production studios and equipment are
owned, and the actual programmes are provided, by programme companies

under contract to the ITA. Fourteen programme companies are at present
under contract: ABC Television Limited; Anglia Television Limited;
ATV Network Limited; Border Television Limited; Channel Television
Limited; Grampian Television Limited; Granada TV Network Limited;
Rediffusion Television Limited; Scottish Television Limited; Southern
Independent Television Limited; TWW Limited (Independent Television for
Wales and the West of England); Tyne-Tees Television Limited; Ulster Tele¬
vision Limited; and Westward Television Limited. Under new arrangements
which are to come into force in July 1968 contracts have been awarded to all
the existing companies except TWW Limited. In addition three new com¬
panies, London Weekend Television Limited, Yorkshire Television Limited,
and Harlech Television Limited have won contracts. A common news service
is provided by Independent Television News Limited.
The Authority has controlling and regulatory powers of a wide and
important character over the content and quality of programmes: for
example, it ensures that a ‘proper balance’ of views is expressed and has drawn
up a code on violence stating that special precautions are to be taken when
children are likely to be viewing. There are also safeguards in the Television
Act 1964 to prevent newspaper shareholdings in a programme company
leading to results contrary to the public interest.
In the discharge of its duties the ITA is advised by a General Advisory
Council and by three statutory committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting and advertising. A specialist panel advises on medical
and allied advertisements.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There are
also two deputy directors-general, and a headquarters and regional office
staff covering all technical, administrative, clerical, typing and office services,
which numbered 290 in 1967. There were also some 400 engineering staff
serving at the transmitting stations.
A standing committee, composed of four representatives of the ITA and a
representative of each of the programme companies, provides consultative
machinery between the ITA and the companies on matters, other than
programmes, affecting the companies as a whole. There is also an Independent
Television Companies Association, designed to further the collective interests
of the companies with such outside bodies as trade unions and sporting
organisations, and generally to ensure that they speak as far as possible with
one voice on public issues connected with television broadcasting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; the finance for its
operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the programme
companies. In the year ended March 1966 the ITA received about £8-6
million from this source. In return for the valuable public concession enjoyed,
the programme companies also paid to the ITA for transfer to the Exchequer,
a further sum (the levy) related to their advertising revenue; this amounted to
about £21 million during the same period.
The services provided by both broadcasting authorities were reviewed by
the Committee on Broadcasting i960, and subsequently the powers of the
ITA were renewed by the Television Act 1963 (which was incorporated in the
Television Act 1964). This Act also strengthened the Authority’s controlling
and regulatory powers in relation to the independent programme companies
under contract to it to produce the actual programmes. The BBC was con¬
firmed as the sole provider of sound broadcasting services and authorised to
introduce a second television service (BBC 2); this opened in 1964. Colour

television was introduced on BBC 2 in 1967 and by 1970 colour will be
available on the other television services.
The BBC operates its domestic sound broadcasting services from 59 long¬
wave and medium-wave transmitters at 43 transmitting stations, and from
204 very high frequency (VHF) transmitters at 67 stations. The VHP service
is available to over 99 per cent of the population of the United Kingdom.
Regular stereophonic broadcasts on the BBC’s VHF programmes began in 1966.
In addition there are 69 transmitters for the external broadcasting services,
41 in the United Kingdom and 28 overseas for relay purposes, including a
station on Ascension Island.
There are 143 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 63
are in London and 81 at various centres in the regional areas. The external
services use 38 London studios. There are also 39 semi-automatic studios
which can be operated by programme staff without engineering assistance.
The domestic sound services consist of Radio 1 (the Popular Music Service),
Radio 2 (previously the Light Programme), Radio 3 (previously the Third
Network), and Radio 4 (previously the Home Service). These separate, but
inter-related, services enable the BBC to provide a wide range of programmes.
Nine local radio stations, run by the BBC, are to broadcast on an experimental
basis in selected areas of Britain.
Each of the services has its own characteristics: Radio 4 (broadcasting 17
hours a day) is planned as a general service providing the principal news and
information services of the BBC. In addition a wide range of music and drama
is presented; broadcasts for schools are an important feature. The various
regions of Britain have their own version of the service. Radio 3 includes the
Music Programme (broadcasting io|- hours a day), which provides a range of
music during the day, educational sessions, a sports service, and the Third
Programme, which offers works of artistic and intellectual distinction each
evening (and has an estimated regular audience of i| million people). The main
purpose of Radio 2 (broadcasting 2\\ hours a day) is to provide a service of
entertainment and relaxation for the majority including, particularly, light
and popular music. Radio 1, in conjunction with Radio 2, provides a pro¬
gramme of continuous popular music each day. The local radio stations transmit
programmes of particular interest to the local community which they serve.
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link
of culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United
Kingdom and those in other parts of the world; to present events of world¬
wide importance with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British
opinion and the British way of life. These services are broadcast in English
and in 39 other languages for some 670 hours a week.
The services are divided into the European Services and the Overseas
Services:
The European Services broadcast over 250 programme hours a week and
are subdivided into four regional groupings: South European (Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Israel), Central European (Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, Finland), East European (Soviet Union, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia) and German. A French language service provides
programmes for both European and African listeners and there is also
an English service directed to the whole of Europe.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe,
broadcast over 400 programme hours a week. They comprise the BBC

World Service with its audience of English-speaking listeners, which broad¬
casts 24 hours a day and a number of regional services in English and 22
other languages. These regional services consist of the African Service
with programmes in English and African vernaculars; the Arabic Service;
the Eastern and Far Eastern Services with programmes in 14 Asian
languages; the Latin American Service with programmes in Spanish and
Portuguese; and other special programmes in Maltese for Malta, in French
for Canada and in French and English for Mauritius, as well as in English
for North America, the Caribbean countries and the Falkland Islands.
The external services include the Transcription, English by Radio and
Television, Topical Tapes, and Monitoring Services. The Transcription
Service records on disc and tape 750 BBC radio programmes annually,
distributing them to broadcasting organisations in all parts of the world.
The English by Radio and Television service produces English radio lessons
with commentaries in 36 languages, reaching an audience of several millions
by direct transmission from London and by re-broadcasts from some 260 local
stations. The English by Television series have been seen in over 50 countries.
Two television series designed for teachers of English and another for students
of science and technology have been produced in collaboration with the
British Council (see p. 170). BBC English-teaching courses on gramophone
records and tapes are on sale in most countries. The Topical Tapes Service
in English produces 300 hours of topical programmes annually, which are
purchased and re-broadcast by more than 50 subscribing radio organisations.
The Monitoring Service provides news reports from foreign broadcasts; it
has an exchange agreement with its United States counterpart which gives
virtually world-wide coverage.
The government departments concerned with overseas relations prescribe
the languages and hours of external broadcasting, but the content of the
programmes remains the responsibility of the BBC.
The BBC maintains offices in New York, Ottawa, Toronto, Buenos Aires,
Sydney, New Delhi, Singapore, Beirut, Berlin and Paris to encourage local
interest in the BBC, to promote the use of BBC television and radio material
and to provide the BBC with advice and help concerning programmes.
The offices are also responsible for promoting good relations with the local
broadcasting organisations.
In 1936 the BBC launched the world’s first regular public service by high
definition television. Two programmes are now being transmitted: BBCi,
which is available to over 99 per cent of the population of Britain from
87 transmitting stations; and BBC 2, at present from 30 stations, which is
expected to reach some 70 per cent of the population by the end of 1967.
BBC 1 is transmitted on 405 lines on very high frequency (VHF) and BBC 2
on 625 lines on ultra-high frequency (UHF). A duplicate BBC 1 service with
colour is to be introduced on 625 lines on UHF by 1970. In the course of a year,
the BBC television service broadcasts on a national network for 6,150 hours.
BBC studio productions in London come from 17 main studios. The BBC
also has fully equipped regional studio centres at Manchester, Birmingham,
Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast; these centres contribute programmes
to the national network as well as producing others of only local interest.
In addition a number of small interview studios (used mainly for short
insertions into news bulletins) have been established throughout the country.
Outside broadcasting covers most parts of Britain writh its mobile units.
Self-contained television services are available in Wales and Scotland.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
1955 by a programme transmission from the ITA London station at Croydon.
In 1967 programmes were being transmitted on 405 lines on VHP from 43
stations throughout Britain reaching 97 per cent of the population. By 1970
duplicate ITV programmes with colour will be introduced on 625 lines on
UHF.
Independent television is organised on a regional basis. Programmes are
produced at studio centres in Aberdeen, Belfast, Cardiff, Carlisle, Dover,
Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth,
St. Helier, and Southampton; they are designed for either local or national
broadcasting. The programme companies broadcast for some 3,500 hours a
year in each region.
Both the BBC and the ITV services include news, talks and documentary
programmes and programmes of music, drama, light entertainment, films,
sport and outside broadcasts. Religious broadcasts, broadcasts for schools
and educational programmes for adults are also features. There are pro¬
grammes designed to stimulate thought and widen people’s horizons, such as
interviews with outstanding personalities, investigations into matters of public
interest, and programmes on the arts; and there are programmes of specialised
interest such as children’s and family programmes, programmes for women
and regional programmes. In addition, there are special series of party
political broadcasts under arrangements agreed between the broadcasting
authorities and the leading political parties. The use of a second BBC channel
offers greater opportunities for the provision of programmes for minority
interests or particular needs such as further education including the proposed
‘open university’ (see p. 167). The Corporation estimates that its average
viewing audience for documentary programmes is some million.
The BBC seeks to avoid giving publicity to any individual firm or organised
interest except when it is necessary to provide effective and informative
programmes under the terms of the Charter. It must not broadcast sponsored
programmes or, without the consent of the Postmaster General, broadcast any
matter for payment. Advertisements are broadcast on independent television
subject to the relevant provisions in the Television Act, namely, that there
should be no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all advertise¬
ments should be clearly distinguishable as such and recognisably separate
from the programme, and the amount of time given to advertising should
not be so great as to detract from the value of the programmes as a medium
of information, education and entertainment. The ITA has drawn up a
Code governing standards and practice in advertising, giving guidance about
the types and methods of advertisement that may not be used. Certain
types of advertising are prohibited, notably that of cigarettes (under a Govern¬
ment ruling of 1965), betting, and ‘cures’ for alcoholism. Advertisements
may not be inserted in certain types of programmes including religious
services and broadcasts to schools. The cost of inserting advertisements in
the ITA service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the programme
companies for advertising time.
Audience research is conducted both by the BBC and ITA. The BBC
measures the size of audiences by interviewing a representative sample of
the population each day about its listening and viewing on the previous day.
Panels of representative listeners and viewers regularly give their opinions
on programmes they have seen or heard. Special investigations are also made.

The ITA sponsors audience research by an independent research organisa¬
tion Television Audience Measurement (TAM).
Wire relay systems receive programmes at a central point, and from there
distribute them by wire to listeners and viewers. Wire relay companies are
not allowed to originate programmes of their own; their function is to distribute
programmes put out by authorised broadcasting stations. A specified minimum
of their programme material must be taken from BBC sources. At the begin¬
ning of 1967 there were some 796 wire relay services, of which some 626
provided both sound and television. The number of subscribers at that date
was over 1,350,000, about 1,090,000 of whom were receiving television services.
An experiment in pay television is being undertaken by a company, Pay-TV
Ltd., in two areas of Britain. The service is operated over wire relay systems
as an additional programme; subscribers pay for the programmes they choose
to view. The service is subject to the same code of conduct as applies to
existing television services.
The Postmaster General is advised on the technical aspects of television and
VHP sound broadcasting by the Television Advisory Committee, which
consists of an independent chairman, the Director-General of the BBC, the
Director-General of the ITA, representatives from the radio industry,
independent members, and representatives of interested government
departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the ITA, the Post Office and the radio industry.
Recent developments by the BBC include: the electronic conversion of mono¬
chrome and colour television pictures between the European and the American
systems; and the reproduction of television pictures in slow motion.
The BBC and the ITA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union now has 28 full members among the broadcasting organisations in
Western Europe and 40 associate members (mostly from outside Europe,
including the United States of America and many of the nations of the
Commonwealth). It maintains a technical monitoring station, where frequency
measurements and other observations on broadcasting stations are carried out.
The range of inter-Commonwealth broadcasting co-operation is very
wide. The BBC provides a large amount of technical aid, particularly in staff
training to Commonwealth broadcasting organisations. Members of the BBC’s
staff are also seconded for service overseas. The BBC, the Australian Broad¬
casting Commission, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the New
Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, the Rank Organisation and Reuters have
jointly set up Visnews Ltd., a Commonwealth and international newsfilm
agency which provides a reliable service of international news on film for
subscribers who operate television services, produce cinema newsreels or
acquire newsfilm for any other purposes, including education, anywhere in
the world.
The BBC’s Radio and Television Enterprises undertake the world-wide
sale of BBC sound and television programmes; they also purchase material
for the use of the BBC services. Overseas sales of ITV programmes are
undertaken by the separate programme companies.

Eurovision
Inter-continental
Television
Both the BBC and the independent television companies are associated
with the Centre for Educational Television Overseas (CETO), which assists
the advancement of education in developing countries through television.
The centre received a government grant totalling £70,000 in 1967-68, but
most of its funds come from private sources, including the independent
television companies. The BBC provides free technical and other facilities.
Training in television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the
Thomson Centre, in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable
trust. The Ministry of Overseas Development is spending about £100,000
annually on radio and television training for overseas students in Britain.
The BBC and the ITA also participate in the work of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency
responsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommuni¬
cation services (including sound and television), for the allocation and
registration of all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative
committees, for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study
of technical problems in broadcasting.
The BBC is a regular contributor to the network of European television
(Eurovision). This network now includes 23 organisations in Western Euro¬
pean member countries; the exchange of television programmes between them
is arranged by the EBU, which maintains an International Television
Co-ordination Centre (Eurovision) in Brussels. The range of Eurovision is
steadily increasing as countries expand their networks and facilities, and new
countries participate. Successful programme exchanges have also been made
between Moscow and London by both the BBC and the independent
television companies.
The first inter-continental television relay across the Atlantic by means of
Telstar, the communication satellite, was seen in Britain in 1962; it was
followed by live programme exchanges between Europe and America, and in
1964 between Europe and Japan by Telstar II. In 1965 the Early Bird
synchronous satellite marked a further significant advance in inter-continental
television by the first transatlantic exchange of programmes; simultaneous
two-way live television was achieved for the first time between Europe and
America. Early Bird is stationary relative to the earth over the Atlantic, and
thus permits continuous contact between ground stations on opposite sides
of the North Atlantic. The first exchange of live television between Britain
and Australia took place at the end of 1966 via the Intelsat II satellite while it
was over the Indian Ocean.
18 The Press
Ownership
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to State control or censorship.
The number of newspapers per person sold daily in Britain—some 50
copies for every 100 people1 2—is among the highest in the world. The
circulation figures of individual newspapers are correspondingly high. Ten
of the national papers (five dailies and five Sundays) and one London evening
paper have circulations in the millions. The reasons for this are the concen¬
tration of the population in a relatively small area and the highly developed
system of distribution, which means that the national newspapers are
available almost everywhere on the day of publication.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, about i| million
tons annually, while the rest is made from imported raw materials. The average
size of national morning papers varies between 14 and 32 pages. Prices of
daily newspapers vary from 4d. to 8d. (for the Financial Times). Sunday papers
are considerably larger and prices run up to rod. In addition to their normal
paging some newspapers carry occasional supplements and a few provide
regular weekly colour supplements. The Times issues an entirely separate
Business News section with every edition.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory* 136 daily and Sunday
newspapers and just over 1,200 weekly local papers (dealing mainly with
news of interest to the region where they are sold) are published in Britain.
These figures include certain specialised papers, the circulations of which
are limited not by region, but by interest; for instance, sporting papers,
papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident in
Britain, and religious papers.
Daily national and provincial newspaper ownership is concentrated mainly
in the hands of a comparatively small number of large press groups, most of
which control chains of newspapers in different parts of the country. The
provincial group also own weekly newspapers and weekly newspaper
subsidiaries, but there are still a large number of small enterprises in the
weekly and small daily newspaper field. The six largest newspaper groups
are: International Publishing Corporation Limited; Associated Newspapers
Limited; Beaverbrook Newspapers Limited; the Thomson Organisation
Limited; United Newspapers Publications Limited; and Westminster Press
Provincial Newspapers Limited.
Some newspaper groups have holdings in independent television
contracting companies and extensive interests in periodical publishing which
is being integrated to an increasing extent with newspaper publishing.
The International Publishing Corporation and the Thomson Organisation
Limited also have newspaper interests overseas.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any

political party and not obliged to follow any specific party line. In order to
preserve their character and traditions, certain newspapers and periodicals
(including 2 he Guardian, The Observer and 'The Economist) are governed by
arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees, or operate
it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer of shares be
in the hands of trustees. Others have management arrangements intended
to ensure the authority and independence of the editors.
The trend towards concentration of newspaper ownership, which began in
the early nineteen hundreds and was accentuated after the second world war,
giving rise to some public concern, was studied by two Royal Commissions
on the Press, one of which reported in 1949 and the other in 1962. The first
stage of the latter’s recommendations was carried out by the provision in the
Television Act 1963 which stipulates that, if it appears to the Independent
Television Authority at any time that newspaper shareholdings in television
programme companies have led or are leading to results which are contrary
to the public interest, the Authority may, with the consent of the Postmaster
General, notify the companies that their programmes may cease to be trans¬
mitted. Newspaper take-overs are regulated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Act 1965 which gives the Board of Trade powers to control the transfer of a
newspaper or newspaper assets to a newspaper proprietor whose newspapers
have an average daily circulation amounting, with that of the newspaper to
be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies, after (in some cases) the Board of
Trade has received a report from the Monopolies Commission (see p. 252).
Technological advances in the newspaper industry include the introduction
of web-offset newspaper printing and photo-type setting and developments
in the use of computers and facsimile transmission.
1 en morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout
the British Isles, and there are seven national Sunday papers (see Table 37).
Most papers with big circulations have northern editions published in
Manchester, which, after London, is the largest press centre in England.
The leading Scottish papers {The Scotsman and The Glasgow Herald) have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland. Each of the (two) London evening
papers has affiliations with a national daily, but both draw their readership
very largely from people living in and around London.
The provincial newspapers of England and Wales (nearly 90 morning or
evening dailies and Sundays and some 850 papers appearing once or twice a
week) provide the general and local news expected by readers whose daily
life and interests are known to, and shared by, the newspaper staff. The
provincial morning papers, one or two of which have national reputations,
are increasingly giving full coverage to world news in addition to regional
news coverage, but few pursue any strong political line. The evening papers,
much more numerous than the morning papers, are non-political on the
whole; most are based on intensive sales of sports news within the immediate
conurbation. The total circulation of the provincial morning and evening
papers is about 7^ million. Of the morning papers The Journal (Newcastle),
the Yorkshire Post (Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and the Western
Mail (Cardiff) have circulations of over 100,000 and two provincial Sunday
papers the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Sunday Mercury
(Birmingham) have circulations of over 200,000. Individual circulation
figures of provincial evening papers start at about 25,000; most are in the

50,000-60,000 range, but several reach over the 100,000 mark. Weekly
papers are mainly of local appeal; they are also a valuable medium for local
advertising. Most have circulations in the 8,000-35,000 range.
The London local weeklies (nearly 150) include papers for every district in
Greater London.
Scotland has six morning, seven evening and two Sunday newspapers,
excluding the Scottish editions of the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sunday
Express. The leading morning papers are The Glasgow Herald (circulation
^4>392) and The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh (circulation 73,092).
Others are: the Daily Record and the Noon Record, published in Glasgow;
the Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; and the Press and Journal
of Aberdeen. Evening papers include the Edinburgh Evening News and
Dispatch, Glasgow’s Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express
and the Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette. The Sunday papers
are the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Post.
Weekly newspapers published in Scotland number about 150. The most
widely known are the Weekly Scotsman and the People's Journal.
Northern Ireland has two morning papers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist)
and the Irish Nezvs (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the

Sunday News. There are over 40 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, with
circulations ranging from about 5,000 to over 25,000. The majority are
published by individual companies.
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff, has a
circulation of 104,351, mainly in southern Wales. In north Wales the
Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening
papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South
Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North
Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by the Manchester
Evening News.
The weekly press (some 55 papers) includes the English language papers
(by far the largest category), some of which carry articles in Welsh; three
bilingual papers; and n papers in Welsh, of which five are denominational.
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey), the Guernsey Star with morning and evening editions, a Sunday
paper {Island Sun), and two weeklies, which also circulate in Alderney and Sark.
The Isle of Man Times is issued from Mondays to Wednesdays with a special
weekly edition which is published on Friday: there are four other weeklies.
There are over 4,600 periodical publications in Britain. They include the
trade and technical press (over 2,000 titles); magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies, and humour; and journals specialising in various subjects such as
politics, finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts.
A large part of the periodical press, in particular the business papers
(which include professional and specialised journals as well as those properly
described as ‘trade’ and ‘technical’ and are now one of the leading sections of
Britain’s publishing industry), has a considerable circulation outside the
United Kingdom and are an important export. Some 150 million copies are
distributed annually throughout the world and, apart from earning about
fio million a year, are an important media for selling British goods overseas.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales in Britain are: Woman
(3,219,362); Woman's Own (2,272,856); Woman's Weekly (1,521,900);
Woman's Realm (1,319,207); Weekend (1,206,308); Reveille (1,264,524);
together with the Radio Times (4,361,387) and TV Times (2,736,538).
The leading weekly journals of opinion are The Economist (circulation
80,671), a politically independent publication covering topics from a wider
angle than its title implies; the New Statesman (circulation 90,282), which
is a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist
political tendency; the Spectator (31,085), which covers much the same
subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; and Tribune, which
has a strongly left-wing but anti-communist bias. Pm«c/z (114,675), traditionally
the leading humorous periodical, has in recent years devoted increasing
attention to public affairs. New Society, which covers the sociological aspects
of current affairs, has rapidly established its reputation, as has New Scientist,
which reports on the progress of science and technology in terms which the
non-specialist can understand.
Monthly and quarterly journals, particularly the literary and political
journals and those specialising in international and Commonwealth affairs,
generally speaking appeal to the more serious type of reader.

In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, a farming
weekly, the Welsh Farm News, and several monthly and quarterly journals
in both Welsh and English are produced in Wales.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish
Field, Scotland's Magazine, Scots Magazine and Scotland', and two weeklies
devoted to farming interests, Farming News and Scottish Farmer. Among
literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood's, published in
Edinburgh. Numerous popular magazines are also published in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover
farming, the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd. is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of the
United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand operated on a non-profit-
making basis under the terms of a deed of trust which guarantees the
independence and integrity of the news service and ensures that all profits
are used to develop it. Founded in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1850 and transferred
to London in 1851, Reuters has offices in many countries and maintains
several hundred correspondents throughout the world, supplying a con¬
tinuous report of foreign news to the London newsroom. This is then
distributed to the national newspapers, to the radio and television news services
and, through an extensive private network of communications, to news media
in almost every part of the world.
Press Association Ltd. is a news co-operative supplying the British press,
radio and television, and other publishing media. Since its foundation in
1868 it has been owned collectively by provincial newspapers in the British
Isles outside London. It is also one of the major owners of Reuters (see above).
The Association distributes home news within the British Isles, supplies the
same home news to Reuters and its associated agencies for distribution
abroad and distributes to British newspapers outside London the overseas
news of Reuters and the Associated Press. It also provides wire photo
coverage of the British Isles to the national and provincial press and to
overseas subscribers, and distributes by wire the Associated Press world
photo service to provincial newspapers. All profits are used to develop the
service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel) supplies financial and sporting
news to newspapers, the broadcasting organisations, overseas news agencies
and private subscribers; a comprehensive news service to clubs, hotels,
business houses, and similar companies; and, by means of its statistical card
service, the latest information about more than 5,000 companies whose
shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange, and the principal
European, North American and Australian companies.
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America,
also supplies a general service of overseas news.
A number of other United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and there are agencies in other
cities, specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
New entrants to journalism are trained under the scheme run by the National
Council for the Training of Journalists, which represents the principal press
organisations. The scheme consists of ‘on-the-job’ experience, supplemented
THE PRESS
Press
Institutions

by special courses in relevant subjects. Trainees are apprenticed for three
years after a six-month probationary period, and take a professional
examination at the end of their training. About 600 young reporters and
photographers enter the scheme each year. Jobs as trainee reporters on
newspapers are also found for students who successfully complete experimental
one-year preparatory courses for school-leavers which began in 1967.
The National Council also runs week-long practical courses for young
journalists to supplement experience gained on the job; training courses in
such subjects as science, financial and industrial reporting, and in sub-editing
for senior journalists; intensive courses for graduate entrants—100 graduates,
about ten per cent of the total intake, entered the profession in 1966 and the
number is steadily increasing; and special courses for journalists on periodicals
and for public relations and industrial journalists wanting extended training
in journalist techniques.
A two-year inquiry into the training and education of journalists is being
undertaken by the University of Sussex, with the support of the newspaper
industry and in co-operation with the National Council, to enable a post¬
graduate course in journalism to be designed.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Travelling Fellowship Scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, each year about ten journalists from overseas spend six months
in the United Kingdom: three months in the offices of newspapers or
periodicals and three months acquiring a general idea of life in Britain.
A limited number of travelling scholarships are also awarded to British
journalists to enable them to visit Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation provides scholarships and organises training
courses at the Foundation’s Centre in Cardiff for journalists from all parts of
the world.
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the
employers’ side the most important organisations are the Newspaper
Proprietors Association, whose members are proprietors of the national
daily and Sunday newspapers; the Newspaper Society, which represents
the regional and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily Newspaper
Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which represents
the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern Ireland
Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the employees’ side there are the
Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Association
of Journalists, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907.
All working journalists (including those engaged in radio, television, public
relations and freelance journalism) are eligible for membership of both these
organisations. To facilitate an eventual merger, an interim arrangement has
been made for dual membership without the payment of extra subscriptions.
The aims of the NUJ and the loj are the improvement of the economic status
of journalists, the promotion of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding
of the status of the press and its editorial staffs. Total membership is nearly
23,000 (NUJ about 20,500, loj about 2,350).
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of

editors, to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the
education and training of journalists: the Guild has about 350 members. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation is the federation of the
printing trade unions which include the National Graphical Association, the
Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, and the Scottish Typographical
Association.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 25 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodical reports recording its work
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. Reports, which include statistics of the newspaper and
periodical press and a series of articles examining the structure of the leading
press groups, are published annually.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at liberty
to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers for postal purposes,
there are no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which
apply, in particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television companies; the transfer of
newspaper assets (see p. 460); the right of press representatives to be admitted
to meetings of local authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) divorce
and domestic proceedings in courts of law, (b) advertisement and investment
circulars, which are governed by Acts dealing with fraud, and (c) advertise¬
ments of remedies for certain diseases, which are covered by public health
legislation; agreements between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors
on telegraphic communications, which must comply with telegraphs legis¬
lation; restrictions on certain types of prize competition; and copyrights,
which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the laws on: libel and
defamation; contempt of court—a newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice their
reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence the
result; and seditious libel, incitement to disaffection and revealing official
secrets.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.
19 Sport
Central and
Local
Government
Participation
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such activities as
organised outdoor games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games,
aquatic sports, and such popular pursuits as horse-racing, dog-racing, show
jumping, riding, boxing, rock climbing, motor racing, cycling and rifle
shooting as well as those (for instance, archery, fencing, gliding and ice-skating)
which, although less popular judged by the number of participants and
spectators, all have their own devotees. Those who engage in sport may be
professionals (that is, paid players) or amateurs.1 Professionals keep up the
technical standards of the sports in which they take part and spectators make
a vital contribution by their enthusiasm and their financial support; but the
sporting life of Britain derives its character principally from the amateur
element—people who devote time and energy to organising sport and to
teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage
in sport for pleasure alone.
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion
of sport in Britain but it has assumed responsibility for providing encourage¬
ment, guidance and help; it gives grant-aid to voluntary bodies towards
approved expenditure on playing fields, swimming baths and other facilities
for physical recreation, and to national voluntary organisations in Great
Britain for various purposes, including the holding of world championships
and events of similar importance in Britain. The Government is advised on
matters relating to the development of amateur sport and physical recreation
by the Sports Council, which also fosters co-operation between the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department and
the voluntary organisations concerned. The chairman of the Council is the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Education and Science, who is the minister
with special responsibility for sport. Nine regional sports councils in England,
one council in Scotland and one in Wales, composed of representatives of local
authorities and sporting organisations, have also been set up. In Northern
Ireland the Ministry of Education is advised by the Youth and Sports Council.
The Council works in close co-operation with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, the National Playing Fields Association, the Scottish
equivalents of these bodies, and the British Olympic Association.
Direct Exchequer assistance to voluntary sports organisations in Great
Britain amounted to over ^1-5 million in 1966. This assistance takes the form
of capital grants towards the provision of facilities and, in the case of national
organisations, grants towards the costs of administration and coaching
schemes and participation in international events overseas. Specific grants
are not available to local authorities for expenditure on sports facilities, but
such expenditure is taken into account in determining the aggregate amount
of Exchequer grant to local authorities under the rate support grant system
(see p. 76)
1 Some sports, for example, athletics, Rugby Union football, hockey and rowing, are
entirely amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur
status is becoming less strictly defined.

In Northern Ireland £212,271 in grants was given to public authorities
and voluntary organisations for sports facilities and coaching schemes in
1966.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland require that
all publicly maintained schools shall provide for the physical education
(gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils. Schools
in the national systems (excepting those solely for infants) must have their
own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium—local authorities being encouraged to make these facilities avail¬
able also to public organisations. Facilities for, and instruction in, many
kinds of sport are likewise provided at the independent preparatory and public
schools and at the universities (some of which have departments of physical
education). Under the Public Health Acts and the Physical Training and
Recreation Acts local authorities are empowered to provide playing fields.
They also provide gymnasia, tennis courts, golf courses and swimming baths
on an increasing scale. Sports facilities for employees are provided by industrial
and commercial concerns. An appraisal of major sports facilities throughout
the country is being made by the regional sports councils.
The national voluntary organisations most closely concerned with the general
development of sport are the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the
Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, and the National Playing Fields
Association. The British Olympic Association, whose main functions are
connected with the participation of British teams and competitors in the
Olympic Games, is also interested in all matters likely to benefit sport or
physical recreation in Britain as a whole. In addition, each sport has its own
governing body, with, in most cases, entirely separate autonomous governing
bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR), which is an association
of all national bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland concerned with
the development of post-school physical recreation, provides the Sports
Council with such services as may be agreed in the administration, technical
and research fields. Its funds are partly raised by voluntary contributions but
it also receives grants from the Department of Education and Science and
from the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland. Its General Secretary
is also the Director of the Sports Council.
The CCPR consists of about 300 members. Of these over 200 are members
representing national bodies concerned wholly or in part with the development
of some branch of physical recreation—the governing bodies of games and
sport, the national outdoor activity and dance associations, the youth service
organisations, and many others concerned with education, physical education
and health. The Council’s headquarters are in London and it has nine
regional offices in other parts of England. Its activities in Wales are controlled
by a representative Welsh committee, and in Northern Ireland by a separate
section with its own executive committee.
Broadly, the Council’s function is to promote all forms of physical
recreation. Its activities include the organisation of courses for coaches and
instructors, courses in personal performance, lectures, displays and other
publicity events. In 1966—67 over 2,000 such courses, attended by nearly

47,000 people, were organised. Its staff give advisory, technical and adminis¬
trative help wherever required, but particularly to the headquarters, regional,
county and local branches of the constituent organisations and to local
educational authorities and industrial concerns. Its regional officers have been
appointed as secretaries to the newly formed Regional Sports Councils which
aim to promote co-operation and co-ordination in the provision of sports
facilities within their regions.
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation (SCPR) is the counterpart in
Scotland of the CCPR, and has 140 affiliated organisations, including the
governing bodies of all the Scottish sports; it receives a grant-in-aid from
the Scottish Education Department.
The main aim of the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) is to
stimulate the provision of playing fields and playgrounds, especially for
children, by publicity and technical and financial assistance. Since its
inception in 1925 it has distributed over £1-7 million in the form of grants
for playing field and playground schemes and about £234,000 in the form of
loans. It assists more than 400 schemes a year.
The NPFA council is composed of representatives of the governing bodies
of various sports organisations, of the British Olympic Association and the
CCPR, and of a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth organisations,
physical education associations and local authorities. The national headquarters
in London employs a small full-time staff, including a technical and
research department which gives advice on all aspects of recreational
planning including the provision and layout of indoor and outdoor sports
facilities. Advice is also given on matters relating to children’s playgrounds,
play leadership schemes, and the play and recreational needs of children from
their earliest years. The Association derives its funds mainly from voluntary
contributions but it also receives a small contribution towards administrative
costs from the Department of Education and Science.
The NPFA has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland; there are also
branches in nearly every English and Welsh county; administration is carried
out, in the main, on a voluntary basis—in many cases in association with a
local authority or Rural Community Council.
There are five National Recreation Centres in Britain, outside London—two
in England, one in Wales and two in Scotland—administered by the CCPR
and the SCPR. The centres, all but one of which were established by voluntary
funds, provide a wide range of courses for coaches, instructors and per¬
formers in many games, sports and other physical activities. A programme of
improvements, the capital cost of which will be borne by the Department of
Education and Science, and, for Scotland, by the Scottish Education Depart¬
ment, is being carried out and will continue over the next two or three years.
A sailing centre, likewise to be administered by the CCPR, is to be established,
at Cowes, Isle of Wight, to provide courses on sailing, boat handling, cruising,
navigation, racing, boat maintenance and boat building, for school and youth
groups and for adults.
The Crystal Palace National Recreation Centre in London covers 36 acres;
has a main stadium with seating for 12,000 spectators; a sports hall with
seating for 2,000 spectators; a swimming hall with pools of Olympic dimen¬
sions, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators; an indoor cricket
school; practice rooms suitable for all indoor activities; a hostel for 140
residents; and staff housing. The Centre, managed by the CCPR, is designed

not only to provide training facilities for leaders, coaches and athletes, but also
for international competitions.
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football,
cricket, and hockey, and games such as lawn tennis and golf, in which
individuals or couples match their skill. Judged by the number of participants
and spectators, the most popular of the team games are football and cricket;
the most popular of the individual games is lawn tennis.
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier,
as an organised game it dates from just over a century ago. One type of
football, in which only the feet are used, was adopted at Cambridge in 1848;
the other type, in which the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played
at Rugby School, whence it derives its name, and was adopted by the
Blackheath football club in 1859.
In England the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association
Football (‘soccer’), is the Football Association (FA) formed in 1863. Its chief
function is to promote the interests of the game and to prevent infringement
of the agreed rules; it also arranges for the instruction of promising young
players (some £20,000 is spent annually on coaching); organises various
matches and competitions, including the international matches played by
England, the Amateur Cup competition, the FA Sunday Cup competition,
two national youth competitions, and the competition for its own leading
trophy, the Football Association Challenge Cup; and chooses and manages
English international teams. Over 350 clubs are registered with the FA, more
than 250 as full members and between 120 and 130 as associate members.
There are also some 25,000 clubs affiliated to county (that is, district or
regional) associations. The FA derives its main income from subscriptions
and admission charges to international and cup matches, and ploughs back a
large portion of the money into the game. Scotland, Northern Ireland and
Wales have their own controlling bodies: the Scottish Football Association,
the Irish Football Association and the Football Association of Wales.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or
twice weekly) are controlled by the Football League, which comprises 92
professional clubs in these countries. The funds of the League are derived
largely from contributions paid by member clubs in the form of a levy of
4 per cent of the net gate receipts from league matches, after allowable
expenses have been deducted; from annual payments from the leading
football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists; and from television
films.
In Scotland the Scottish Football League comprises 38 clubs; Northern
Ireland has its own league. Clubs belonging to the English and Scottish
Leagues are organised in divisions, the members of which compete against
one another for the respective league championships. Their positions in
the divisional tables are decided at the end of the season by the number of
points gained for wins or draws. During the season about 30 million people
watch league football matches and gate receipts usually amount to between
£5 million and £6 million.
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the league
matches by filling in what are known as ‘pools’ coupons. The odds against
winning anything in the pools are very great, but the prizes are high and
individual payments of £300,000 are occasionally made. The promoters
of the pools deduct varying amounts from the stakes for commission and
expenses.
SPORT
471
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis
and the Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year
in England; it is always played at Wembley Stadium, near London, which
can accommodate some 100,000 spectators. The Scottish Cup Final is played
at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The matches between England, Scotland, Wales
and Ireland also excite great interest, as do other international matches.
There are many more amateur association football players than there are
professionals (the comparative figures are nearly 1 million amateurs, including
schoolboys and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals),
but with one or two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal
terms, since professional teams are more systematically and intensively
trained. Amateur teams compete against each other for the Football
Association Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby Football (‘rugger’) is played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union, established in 1871. The rules of the game are completely
different from those that govern soccer, and there are 15 players, instead of 11,
in a side. International matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland,
and France are played regularly at the leading rugby football grounds of each
country, including Twickenham, London—the headquarters of the Rugby
Football Union—and there are tours by international teams to and from
New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Other important rugger matches
are the county championship competitions, the annual match between the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Hospitals’ Cup final, and the
Inter-Services tournament.
Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly confined to amateur clubs.
In the north of England Rugby League Football is played. This is a 13-a-side
game played by professionals as well as amateurs. The Rugby Football League
(instituted in 1895) regularly sends touring teams to Australia and New
Zealand and has annual international games, professional and amateur, against
France. The major match of the season—the Rugby League Challenge Cup
Final—has attracted crowds of 95,000 at Wembley Stadium in recent
years.
Cricket is often called the English national game. The exact date of its origin
is not recorded, but it is known that the game was played at Guildford Grammar
School during the sixteenth century, and by the beginning of the eighteenth
century it was popular both in the villages of England and on the larger
country estates. The game has been played more or less as it is played today
since the adoption of a generally accepted set of laws in 1744. About 1760 a
cricket club was formed in the Hampshire village of Hambledon; by 1772
it had made an outstanding name for itself and acquired a membership
representative of patrons of cricket from all over England. In 1787 th.®
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), now the governing body of cricket, was
founded, with its headquarters in London on a site in Dorset Fields rented
by a Yorkshireman called Thomas Lord. In the year 1810-11 the MCC
moved its headquarters to a ground near Regent s Park, keeping the name
Lord's-, four years later Lord's transferred to a third ground, at St. John’s Wood
(in the same neighbourhood) where it has remained ever since. Other clubs
that sprang up all over England during the nineteenth century recognised the
MCC’s authority, and nowadays all cricket is played according to the ‘laws of
cricket’ as laid down by the MCC in consultation with cricketing organisations
in Britain and overseas.
In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all
towns and villages have their cricket teams which play at least one match a

week from May to September; in the London area a large number of pitches
are provided by the local authorities besides many leased or owned by clubs.
The main event of the cricketing season in Britain is the series of ‘Test’
matches,1 played between England and a touring side from overseas. These
matches last 30 hours (spread over five or six days) and arouse great popular
interest, being widely reported in the press and on radio and television.
Individual matches of interest include the university match between Oxford
and Cambridge and there is an annual county championship between 17
‘first-class counties’. (The other counties have a ‘minor counties champion¬
ship’ of their own.) Famous grounds besides Lord's are the Oval, Kennington,
London, headquarters of the Surrey Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Manchester;
Heading ley, Leeds; and Trent Bridge, Nottingham.
In the late nineteenth century more amateurs played cricket than economic
conditions in the twentieth century allow: with first-class matches lasting
three days and each county playing up to 30 matches in a season, the number
of cricketers who could afford to play as true amateurs declined and the
distinction between amateur and professional in the first-class game has
now been abolished. League cricket, which is a feature of the game in the
north of England, is played by teams mainly consisting of amateur Saturday
afternoon players with one or more professionals, many of whom are
distinguished players from other Commonwealth countries. The MCC is
an entirely amateur body, but a distinguished band of retired professional
cricketers of ‘the highest merit’ have been elected to honorary membership.
Lawn Tennis The forerunner of modern lawn tennis (the game known as jeu depaume) was
introduced into England from France in the fifteenth century and a ‘tennis
court’, built by Henry VIII, is still in use at Hampton Court. The modern
game, first played in England in 1873, quickly became very popular; in 1877
the words ‘and lawn tennis’ were added to the title of the All England Croquet
Club at Wimbledon, near London, and in the same year the first champion¬
ships were played. The Lawn Tennis Association, the controlling body of the
game in Britain, was founded in 1888. The governing body of the game in the
world (the International Lawn Tennis Federation, with headquarters in
London and Paris) was founded in 1913.
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during
the present century, particularly since the game has spread to practically
every country in the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’
schools and in very many boys’ schools where the pupils are of secondary
school age. It is also played on private courts, in parks and recreation grounds
and at several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end
of June and beginning of July are the main event of the lawn tennis season
in Britain and, in fact, in the world. These championships, in which men and
women of many nationalities compete, draw large crowds; there is accom¬
modation for over 30,000 spectators in the grounds of the All England Club
—14,000 can be accommodated round the centre court where the finals are
played. Other tournaments which attract a good deal of attention are: the
British Hardcourt Championships, the British Junior Championships, and
the County Championships. There are also competitions for boys’ and girls’
schools on a national basis. The most important international events are the

both in Britain and overseas. The first of these matches was played at Melbourne,
Australia, in 1877, between England and Australia.

Women players from Britain and the United States of America also compete
annually for the Wightman Cup.
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the other
countries of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nineteenth
century. Since then, however, it has gained steadily in popularity and
nowadays there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns and villages—
some owned by local authorities, but the majority owned by golf clubs.
The headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club is St. Andrews,
Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship,
which was first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker
Cup (for amateurs) and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played
between Britain and America; the Amateur Championship; the World
Amateur Team Championship; and the Ladies Championship.
Variants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain
for at least five centuries. Modern hockey, however, dates from the formation
(in 1886) of the Hockey Association, which standardised the rules relating
to men’s hockey. Nowadays there are some 1,760 men’s hockey clubs affiliated
to the Hockey Association and male hockey players include over 28,000 adults
and members of some 400 boys’ schools. Although there are no professional
county teams and no cup ties, a county championship was instituted in 1957.
In addition, regular amateur international matches (inaugurated in 1894) are
played.
In Britain hockey is more commonly played by women than by men. The
controlling bodies are: the All England Women’s Hockey Association
(founded 1895) to which are affiliated some 900 clubs and 2,030 schools,
representing a total membership of about 70,000 adults and 1,015,000
schoolgirls; the Irish Ladies Hockey Union; the Scottish Women’s Hockey
Association; and the Welsh Women’s Hockey Association. The first inter¬
national women’s hockey match took place in 1896. Nowadays such a match
is played annually at Wembley Stadium (in addition to those played in other
parts of the country), where it attracts some 56,000 spectators.
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North
America, is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and
at universities. International matches are played, as well as regional matches
by women’s teams representing the East, West, South, North and Midlands
of England, under the auspices of the All England Women’s Lacrosse
Association.
The men’s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse
Union, is played in ten universities, six teacher-training colleges, and by clubs
and schools, mainly in the London, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and
Nottingham areas. Matches played include county matches, an annual fixture
between the North of England and the South, and international matches
between Australia, America and England.
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the
All England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English county
associations, the netball clubs of the three Women’s Services and sections of
the national youth organisations for girls and women. Inter-county and home
international matches are played regularly and inter-Commonwealth tours
are arranged.

Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British
in India, and brought to England in 1869. The governing body of British
polo is the Hurlingham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth
polo associations and that of South Africa are affiliated. Polo players are a
very small section of the community, for the cost of keeping polo ponies is
high. However, many of the clubs now own trained ponies which are hired
out to members at moderate cost. There are about 375 players handicapped
by the Hurlingham Polo Association, but many less expert players take part
in club games for which they may be locally handicapped.
Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and large numbers of
spectators attend inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap
teams composed of players from several countries.
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century.
Nowadays the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling
Association is concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded
in 1905. The Bowling Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come
under and play to the laws laid down by the IBB, but there are other bowling
associations in England—the English Bowling Federation, the Crown Green
Association and the English Women’s Bowling Association—which are not
under the IBB’s control.
During the summer bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in
winter it is played on indoor greens, which are increasing in number. At one
time regarded as a pastime for the elderly, the game is now played by people
of all ages. Over 2,620 bowling clubs in England are affiliated to the English
Bowling Association alone. International, inter-county matches, and national
championship competitions of singles, pairs, triples and fours are played.
The popularity of mountaineering has greatly increased in recent years. The
number of clubs in the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) and the
Association of Scottish Climbing Clubs, the representative bodies of the sport,
has increased to over 160 in the last six years, mainly by the addition of smaller
town and district clubs and university and college clubs to the older, larger
clubs such as the Alpine Club (founded in 1857, the oldest mountaineering
club in the world), the Climbers’ Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club and
the Fell and Rock Climbing Club. A number of local education authorities,
as well as national bodies such as the YMCA, the Scouts and the Central
Council of Physical Recreation, have established mountaineering training
centres in the hills. Training courses are run jointly by the CCPR and BMC,
the Mountaineering Association, the Youth Elostels Association and other
bodies, and many schools have mountaineering sections. Membership of the
known clubs is about 15,000, but several times this number take part in
climbing and mountaineering.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the
great ranges of the world and in climbing their peaks; for example, the first
ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga
in 1955. In recent years frequent expeditions have gone to far off mountains,
to Greenland, Alaska, the Andes, Patagonia, the Caucasus and the Pamirs,
as well as the Himalayas.
Ski-ing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the winter sports
centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and Glenshee,
where ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction are now available.

Athletics

Country Sports

Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country),
relay racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by
the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to
encourage amateur athletics, to improve the management of amateur athletic
meetings by the establishment of uniform regulations, and to promote annual
championship meetings. The Association, whose membership increased
rapidly, is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers
and managed by representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland,
Southern and Welsh areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur
athletic clubs, schools and youth organisations), of which there are hundreds
throughout England and Wales. The AAA administers a coaching scheme
under which eight full-time national coaches, working mainly in separate
regions, lecture, demonstrate and coach in schools, youth clubs, evening
institutes, training colleges and universities and at special courses organised
by the national associations, by regional associations or by the Central Council
of Physical Recreation. Some of the work of the national coaches is directly
concerned with coaching young athletes but their main duties are to instruct
men who wish to qualify as honorary coaches, nearly 2,000 of whom give
voluntary services in the counties and districts of England and Wales. Scotland
and Northern Ireland have their own amateur athletic associations, with
similar functions; there are also separate women’s AAAs for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United
Kingdom are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board, which is
composed of representatives of the three national associations for men and
of the Women’s Council, and is affiliated to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
Track meetings are held throughout Britain from April to October. The
main events in England and Wales are: the AAA championships for men
and international matches held at the White City, London; area and county
championships; and the universities, Services, business houses and schools
championship meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country running
from October to March, and international, county and area cross-country
championships are held.
Teams representing Britain compete in the Olympic Games (held every
four years), and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly
intervals between the Olympic Games. The last Commonwealth Games (1966)
were held in Jamaica.
The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people in the High¬
lands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the
weight, and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions
take place. Among the better known Highland games are the Braemar
Gathering on Deeside (traditionally attended by the royal family), the
Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the meeting at Aboyne. The Highland
games attract large numbers of spectators from all over the world.
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable
part in the life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their
interests is the British Field Sports Society.
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of
hounds; but it also includes stag hunting, which preceded fox hunting and

Shooting
still goes on, mainly in Devon and Somerset; hunting the hare, either on foot
with beagles or with harriers when the followers are mounted; and otter
hunting along the banks of rivers. Hunting depends not on right but on
permission. Most landowners and farmers allow followers of recognised hunts
to cross their property.
Fox hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for
the landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in
spite of the fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds.
The sport is not without its critics, but a large number of people, including
many townsmen, take a keen interest in it and follow the hunt in cars, on
bicycles or on foot. The fox hunting season proper starts in early November
and lasts until April; it is preceded by cub hunting, that is, the hunting of
young foxes, when young hounds are trained. At the end of the season most
hunts organise steeplechases, known as point-to-points, which are patronised
by large crowds.
There are between 190 and 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales,
13 in Northern Ireland, and 10 in Scotland. The packs range in size from
the large establishments in the ‘shires’, that is, the Midlands of England (for
instance, the Bel voir, the Cottesmore, the Quorn, and the Fernie) where
mounted followers may be two hundred or more, to small kennels in the
west and north, where hunting is sometimes on foot.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members and with
the aid of the farmers, whose support enables fox hunting to continue to
flourish; car-parking fees, at such events as point-to-points, also contribute,
and sometimes the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in charge of the
hunt, bears a proportion of the cost.
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the
early part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of
grouse, partridge, pheasant, snipe and woodcock.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of the United Kingdom. In
the first place, a gun licence or a game licence must be applied for and pur¬
chased annually, and secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on
privately owned land, shot over either by the owner and his friends or by
syndicates which have leased the shooting. However, in some parts of the
more remote countryside, rough shooting may be enjoyed in a less formal
way. Much of the country’s wildfowling is controlled by the Wildfowling
Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through its numerous
clubs.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other birds are ‘preserved’: that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected by law and
allowed to breed in security, often under the care of privately employed
gamekeepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant
seasons open on 12th August, 1st September and 1st October, severally, and
last for between four and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly
in Scotland, northern England and North Wales; partridge and pheasant
shooting in nearly every county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former
mainly over farm land, and the latter in or near wToodland; and wildfowling on
the marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
The Game Research Association, formed by landowners, farmers and others
interested in game conservation and research, collects and collates information
on a national scale and makes a detailed study of factors controlling game
population, including diseases to which game birds are subject, game ecology
and density, survival rates and movements of game in changing environments.

Fishing
Aquatic Sports
Rozcing
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get
an effective shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a
keen scene, are far-sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly
a sport of the Highlands of Scotland. The deer are preserved in privately
owned ‘deer forests’, ranging in size from 9,000 to over 30,000 acres. The
close seasons in Scotland are October to June, inclusive, for stags and
February to October, inclusive, for hinds. In England and Wales, the close
seasons are May to July for stags, and March to October for hinds.
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach
of everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and
line to the experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in
their leisure hours than hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing.
Trout streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland
there are also many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon
fishing may be enjoyed on many rivers in England, North Wales and Northern
Ireland, but the best salmon rivers are to be found in Scotland. In England
and Wales the most widely practised form of fishing is for coarse fish such
as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and bream, and the National
Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 450,000 members in over 3,000 clubs
comprising 116 associations. Match angling—competitive fishing for coarse
fish by weight—is a feature of the many angling clubs affiliated to the NFA,
particularly in the Midlands and north of England. A national angling cham¬
pionship, composed of 112 teams of 12 anglers, is organised annually by the
NFA, and the NFA enters a team in the International Angling Competition.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea
fishing for tuna and shark has gained many adherents during the past 20 years.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all (except for salmon and sea trout
fishing in Scotland) but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and
local inquiries made about any permit or licence required. Most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs; trout and salmon fishermen either rent a
stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel with its own fishing rights, or
pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. The cost of salmon
fishing is often high.
Aquatic sports include rowing, sailing, swimming, canoeing, punting and
water ski-ing. The first three are the most commonly practised in Britain
and are included in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community,
and as a sport it arouses considerable public interest. The two most popular
annual rowing events are the University Boat Race, which originated in 1820
and has been rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836;
and Henley Regatta, founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-
on-Thames in Oxfordshire. The University Boat Race is between eight-oared
crews from Oxford and Cambridge over a course of some 4J miles between
Putney and Mortlake; it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters
gathered on both sides of the river. Considerable interest is also shown in
the Head of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which
more than 300 eights row in procession the largest assembly of racing craft
in the world.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various
kinds of races are rowed over a straight course of 1 mile 550 yards; for

instance, for the Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any
nation, the Silver Goblets for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single
scullers, the Ladies’ Challenge Plate open to crews from schools and colleges
in the United Kingdom and the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup for eights
open to schools from Britain and overseas. Many other riverside resorts
arrange regattas every summer.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Doggett’s Coat
and Badge, founded in 1716 and organised since by the Worshipful Company
of Fishmongers. Originally for professional watermen and limited to six
entrants, the race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be
apprentice watermen); if necessary, it may be rowed in heats. The course
is from London Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing
clubs, including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as
well as men compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur
Rowing Association is the governing body of the sport.
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the
inland waters and round the coasts of Britain, but during the last 15 years
the sport, and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal.
There are about 13,800 dinghies registered with the Royal Yachting
Association, of which the most popular classes are the National
Enterprise and National Firefly; but as by no means all classes attain
national status, there is an even greater number of boats not included in this
register.
Most British yacht racing is administered by the Royal Yachting Associa¬
tion, subject to the rules of the International Yacht Racing Union, founded
in 1907. The main event of the inshore yachting season is the annual regatta
at Cowes in the Isle of Wight, the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron,
founded in 1812. Other events include the Round the Isle of Wight race and
the races arranged during the special yachting weeks (or fortnights) held at
such sailing centres as Poole in Dorset, Bembridge in the Isle of Wight,
Lowestoft in Suffolk, Harwich and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Plymouth
in Devon, Falmouth in Cornwall, and on the Scottish river Clyde.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules
drawn up by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses
are: Cowes to Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente
Maritime, France) and Harwich to the Hook of Holland.
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the
seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.
The existence of indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming
possible, and instruction and coaching is provided in some places by qualified
teachers who hold certificates for elementary or advanced teaching and coach¬
ing awarded by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA). The objects of
the ASA are to promote the teaching and practice of swimming, diving and
water polo and to stimulate public opinion in favour of providing proper
accommodation and facilities for them; and to draw up, publish and enforce
uniform laws for the control and regulation of amateur swimming, diving and
water polo championships and competitions in England.
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean, first and foremost,
horse-racing. Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing,
pony-racing, trotting races, and pigeon flying.

The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the
Jockey Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and
even earlier. The Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee (founded
in 1866) now exercise control over all horse-racing in England and indirectly in
many other countries, and their rules are the basis of universal turf procedui e.
There are two forms of racing: flat racing carried on from late March till
November under the authority of the Jockey Club; and steeplechasing,
conducted under the rules of the National Hunt Committee.
The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies,
run on the Newmarket course, owned by the Jockey Club; the One Thousand
Guineas for fillies only, also run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and
fillies, run at Epsom; the Oaks for fillies only, also run at Epsom; and the
St. Leger for colts and fillies, run at Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding
event in the racing calendar; it takes place annually in late May or early June
and the scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is one of the most colourful and
exciting of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of the flat
racing season is held on the course at Ascot in Berkshire, in mid-June, and
is known as ‘Royal Ascot’, being traditionally attended by the Sovereign.
Steeplechase meetings are held in the period August to June, one of the
most important being the National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham in
March. The best known single steeplechase is the Grand National, run
annually since 1839.
In England and Wales there is racing on 57 racecourses (excluding pomt-
to-point courses), at which there are about 780 days’ racing annually;
Scotland has six racecourses, where racing takes place on some 60 days in the
year. There are approximately 9,000 horses in training in Great Britain, at
an average cost of about £15 a week each.
Horse racecourses must be licensed by the Jockey Club or the National
Hunt Committee. Facilities for cash and credit betting are available on and
off the racecourse, turnover being subject to a Government tax of per cent.
On-course facilities are provided by bookmakers, who must have peisonal
permits, and by totalisators operated by the Horserace Totalisator Board,
which is empowered to deduct from money staked with the totalisator such
percentage as it may determine. The practice is to deduct 20 per cent from
the losing stakes, which includes the betting tax; this provides an average
yield of approximately per cent of the total annual turnover after the
payment of the betting tax. Facilities for off-the-course betting are provided
in licensed betting offices, of which there are some 15,500 throughout Great
Britain. People under 18 years old are forbidden by law to place bets.
A levy from both bookmakers and the Horserace Totalisator Board is
collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which distributes the revenue
for purposes conducive to the improvement of horse breeding and racing, and
for the advancement and encouragement of veterinary science and education.
The Horserace Betting Levy Board is also responsible for the work of the
National Stud at Newmarket, which concentrates on providing stallions for
private breeding.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926,
when the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester.
There are now about 130 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are
situated near large towns, and meetings are held two or three times a week.
The licensing authorities for greyhound racing tracks are the county and
county borough councils. Some 12 million people a year attend greyhound
racing, which is Britain’s second largest spectator sport.

The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club,
founded in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound
racing and keeping strict discipline over the sport. The 56 greyhound race¬
courses which accept the rules of the Club are the largest in the country and
constitute approximately 92 per cent of the total attendance and totalisator
turnover. All are members of the National Greyhound Racing Society which
controls the general policies of greyhound racing, administers the affairs of,
and acts as spokesman for, the sport.
Greyhound racing can be conducted only at a licensed greyhound racecourse
on 104 betting days in a licensed year (1st July-3oth June). There are approxi¬
mately 11,500 greyhounds in training under the National Greyhound Racing
Club Rules, and average cost for their upkeep including training is approxi¬
mately Jz 2s. per week.
Where a totalisator is operated at a greyhound racecourse, up to 6 per cent
of the money invested can be deducted for operational expenses, and 2^ per
cent must be paid to the Government in respect of general betting duty.
Bookmakers are allowed to operate at a greyhound racecourse, but are not
permitted to bet on greyhound racing at totalisator odds unless the consent of
the occupiers of the tracks at which the totalisators are operated is given.
The classic greyhound races are held at various racecourses in London, as
follows: the Gold Collar at Catford; the Greyhound National at the White
City; the Greyhound Derby at the White City; the Scurry Gold Cup at
Clapton; the Laurels at Wimbledon; the St. Leger at Wembley; and the
Cesarewitch at West Ham.
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase rapidly, and many
more people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the
second world war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There
are about 2,000 riding schools in Britain, many of a high standard, and about
50 new schools are opened each year; membership of the British Horse
Society has risen to over 12,000; there are over 250 riding clubs with varied
membership; and the Pony Club (open to young people up to the age of
17 years) now has an overall membership of about 75,000 members. There
are over 1,000 branches of the Pony Club throughout the world, of which
270 are attached to hunts in Britain and the remainder are overseas.
The British Horse Society, as the National Equestrian Federation of Great
Britain, is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including
breeding, training, riding, show jumping and dressage, and is responsible for
preparing equestrian teams for the Olympic Games and all international
events. The Society, which has recently opened one of the world’s most
up-to-date training centres at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, is also the parent
body of the Pony Club and the riding clubs, and organises and provides tests,
lectures, demonstrations, courses and examinations to promote horsemanship
and horsemastership.
Horse trials of all kinds are held throughout Britain during the spring and
summer. The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton Park,
Gloucestershire, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at
Burghley House, Lincolnshire—are among the outstanding equestrian events
of the year. These trials include dressage, cross-country riding, and show
jumping; some 25 one-day trials on similar lines are held annually.
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 1,000 shows. The
main events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at
SPORT
Boxing
Wrestling
and Judo
481
the White City, London, under the auspices of the British Horse Society
towards the end of July)—the outstanding contest being the individual
jumping championship for the King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competi¬
tions are also a feature of the Horse of the Year Show, which takes place in
October at Wembley and is acknowledged to be one of the finest indoor
horse shows in the world. The total membership of the British Show Jumping
Association has risen to over 7,000. The number of horses and ponies
registered is more than 6,000 and over ^140,000 is distributed annually in
prize money.
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international
competitions (whose successes have materially contributed to the increased
popularity of show jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee
of the Association.
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern
form, and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates
from 1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules which
eliminated much of the brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting,
and made the basis of the sport a trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there
are various amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules
of the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur
boxing, including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing
in the three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The Board has strict medical regulations which provide
for the examination of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of
inspectors to ensure that the regulations are observed and that all contests
are ‘vetted’ to safeguard against over-matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests
since the presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late
Lord Lonsdale in 1909. Competitions organised by the ABA are decided at
ten weights: flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight, lightweight, light welter¬
weight, welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, light heavyweight
and heavyweight. In professional boxing there are no light welterweight or
light middleweight classes.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. The style most commonly
used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-as-Catch-Can
or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is still
practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish style wrestling
(in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which all holds
must be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-
Roman styles are used at the Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games
only free style is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur Wrestling
Association, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling
Federation, under the rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional
wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’ or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the
free style used in amateur wrestling. Judo, a Japanese form of wrestling, has
a large following; there are some 24 clubs in the British Judo Association
which has coaching schemes assisted by the Department of Education and
Science, and a further 583 in the Amateur Judo Association.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fencing as a sport, has made considerable progress throughout Britain during
the past 20 years. The Amateur Fencing Association (founded 1902) has some
500 clubs, and many classes are organised and financed by local authorities.
Fencing is also practised in many schools, and among the annual champion¬
ships held under the auspices of the Association are the National Schoolboys’
and Schoolgirls’ Championships, organised on a regional basis and attracting
a large number of entrants.
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more
racing and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other country;
and British drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation
second to none.
British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and
world classic races which are the main features of the sport. They include the
British classic races—the British Grand Prix and the Tourist Trophy for
sports cars. There are also British national race meetings and British national
rallies, as well as several thousand day and night rallies and trials, endurance
tests, hill climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of which
there are over 500 in Great Britain.
The best-known motor racing circuits are those at Silverstone, Northamp¬
tonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch, Kent; Snetterton, Norfolk;
Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park, Cheshire; Aintree, near Liverpool;
and Charterhall, Berwickshire, in Scotland. The controlling body of motor
racing in Britain is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), founded in 1897; the
RAC is represented on the Federation Internationale de 1’Automobile, which
draws up the regulations for international motor racing.
In addition to motor car racing, there are motor cycle races—the most
important contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—and
motor cycle speedway racing, introduced into Britain in 1928, and governed
by the Speedway Control Board. There is also go-kart racing.
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom
is the British Cycling Federation. It controls track and massed start road
racing in Britain, and is concerned with the cycling events in the Olympic
and Commonwealth Games and the annual world championship. Time trials
are organised by the Road Time Trials Council.
Touring by bicycle is also a popular pastime, and both the British Cycling
Federation and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC) cater for this. The CTC
is the oldest touring club in the world and has a membership of some 25,000.
Its representatives in all parts of the United Kingdom give advice and practical
help to touring cyclists; its 50 district associations arrange holiday and week¬
end tours and competitions, rallies and rides of all kinds; and its travel
department gives CTC members every facility, both at home and abroad,
including the provision of itineraries. Other benefits include a touring
magazine, legal aid and third party insurance.
Full-bore (-303) rifle shooting is organised by the National Rifle Association
(NRA), founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting held annually at Bisley Camp,
Surrey, is open to subjects of the Queen, and, for certain competitions, to
all-comers. The meeting which is attended by some 2,500 competitors from
Britain and other Commonwealth countries, including cadets from schools,
lasts for just over a fortnight: the first week consists of team and individual
competitions for members of the armed forces, and there are two days for
SPORT
Indoor Games
483
schools only. The premier award of the meeting is the Queen’s Prize, which
attracts about 1,250 entries. The NRA also organises postal matches for
British and overseas teams, and periodically sends rifle teams to shoot in
overseas countries of the Commonwealth.
Small-bore (-22) rifle shooting—carried out either on indoor ranges of
15 to 25 yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards—is also widely
practised in Britain. Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are affiliated to
county rifle associations and the National Small-bore Rifle Association
(NSRA), which arranges inter-club and inter-county competitions of various
kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA also organises a National Bisley
Meeting (usually attended by about 1,800 competitors), a Scottish meeting
(some 600 competitors), and a pistol shooting competition (some 400 competi¬
tors) at Bisley. International small-bore rifle matches are fired against teams
from overseas countries, and British teams are entered for the world champion¬
ships and the competitions in the Olympic Games.
Indoor games played in Britain include billiards, table tennis, and badminton,
which are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities are
provided in social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and games
such as real tennis (a game which originated in thirteenth-century France),
squash rackets, rackets and fives, which are less national games than games of
the schools, universities and specialised clubs. Annual championships are
held in all these games, the controlling bodies of which are: the Billiards
Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association of England and
the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives Association
and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of netball
which originated in the United States of America, is also played in Britain
primarily by men. Matches in the game are included among the Olympic
events. The controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket Ball Association.

NOTES FOR VISITORS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM
The unit of currency is the pound sterling (£), which is divided into 20 shillings
(s.).1 The shilling is divided into 12 pennies or pence (d.). Prices are sometimes
quoted in guineas, the guinea (an old coin no longer in circulation) being £1 Is.
Coins in common use are: halfpenny, penny, threepenny piece, sixpence,
shilling, two shilling piece (florin) and half-crown (2s. 6d.). Silver and cupro¬
nickel coins (3d., 6d., Is., 2s., 2s. 6d., 5s.) are legal tender for payments up to
£2; nickel-brass threepenny pieces up to 2s.; and bronze (ijrd. and Id.) up to 12d.
Bank of England notes are issued in denominations of 10s., £1, £5, and £10.
Scottish banks issue £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100 notes which are generally
accepted in Scotland and in some other parts of the United Kingdom. Northern
Ireland banks issue £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100 notes.
Minimum postage rates for letters are: 4d. (inland and Commonwealth) and 9d.
(overseas). Details of all postal rates are given in leaflets obtainable at any post
office and are summarised in the books of stamps sold there.
Persons coming to the United Kingdom may bring in notes in any currency,
travellers’ cheques, letters of credit, etc., without limit; and although visitors
leaving the United Kingdom may normally take with them sterling notes to
the value of only £15, there is usually no exchange control objection to their
arranging for any balance remaining to be converted into foreign currency or,
in the case of visitors from the Scheduled Territories, that is, the Sterling Area
(see p. 409), to be made available in their own country. Currency can be ex¬
changed at banks and there are bureaux de change at all the main ports and at
London and Prestwick airports, the main London air terminals and Victoria
Station, London.
Regulations relating to exchange control in the United Kingdom are some¬
what complex and are subject to modification from time to time. Accordingly,
any person who is going to live in the United Kingdom or who desires informa¬
tion affecting his own particular circumstances is advised to consult his own
or a United Kingdom bank; banks in Britain are experienced in all aspects of
exchange control.
In general, persons living outside the Scheduled Territories visiting the
country for a limited period are regarded as non-resident; any sterling account
which they open with a United Kingdom bank will be designated an External
Account and funds in it may be used without formality to make payments
anywhere in the world. Persons intending to reside permanently in the United
Kingdom are subject to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1947, and
will require permission to make payments outside the Scheduled Territories.
The question of when a visitor to the United Kingdom ‘who is not domiciled
there’ is chargeable for income tax as a ‘resident’ is complicated. The main
qualifications are:
1. A visitor is resident in the United Kingdom for any income tax year
(beginning 6th April) in which he is in the United Kingdom for a period or
periods equal, in the whole, to six months.
1 A decision to adopt a decimal currency based on the pound sterling as the major unit
and subdivided into 100 units to be named later was announced by the Government
in March 1966. It is proposed that the changeover should come in February 1971.

2. Even if a visitor does not stay six months in any one year he is regarded
as being resident if he visits the United Kingdom regularly for substantial
periods of time.
3. If a person maintains a place of abode in the United Kingdom available
for his use, he may be regarded as resident for any year in which he pays a visit
of whatever length.
A visitor who is regarded for tax purposes as resident in the United Kingdom,
and who is liable to United Kingdom tax on income arising in another country
and taxed there, may be entitled to a reduction of liability to United Kingdom
income tax.
Information on specific questions relating to income tax may be obtained
from The Secretary, The Board of Inland Revenue, New Wing, Somerset
House, London, W.C.2 (or, for residents in Great Britain, from local offices).
Information about travel to Britain can be obtained in the major cities of the
world from travel agents, airline, shipping line and railway offices, and British
Government offices abroad, or directly from the headquarters of the British
Travel Association (BTA), 64 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.l (telephone:
01-629 9191). The Association has 20 overseas offices in 16 countries. Infor¬
mation available from the Association includes details of places of interest,
lists of exhibitions, fairs, festivals, concerts and special events of interest to
overseas visitors to Britain, with hours of opening, etc.; and advice on motoring
and touring itineraries. The Association publishes an annual guide, Hotels and
Restaurants in Britain, listing accommodation, services and charges, and
booklets giving particulars of youth hostels, holiday camps, and camping
and caravan sites.
For information about the principal events of the day in London, visitors
may use the Teletourist Service (operated by the General Post Office in con¬
junction with the BTA and the BBC). The information can be obtained in four
languages by dialling the following telephone numbers: 01—246 8041 (English),
01-246 8043 (French), 01-246 8045 (German), and 01-246 8047 (Spanish).
If using a call box, the caller should refer to the instructions notice. The weather
forecast for the London area is also given in the French, German, and Spanish
services; in English it can be obtained by calling 01—246 8091. The London
Tourist Board, 170 Piccadilly, W.l (and with information centres at Victoria
Station and the West London Air Terminal), gives publicity to London’s
attractions for the holiday and business visitor.
Demand for hotel space in London is heavy, especially in the summer; the
London Hotels Information Service, 20 Upper Brook Street, London, W.l
(01-629 5414), gives information free of charge to overseas visitors as to where
accommodation is available.
Additional information on travel in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
is obtainable from: the Wales Tourist Board, 7 Park Place, Cardiff; the Scottish
Tourist Board, 2 Rutland Place, West End, Edinburgh, 1; the Northern
Ireland Tourist Board, 10 Royal Avenue, Belfast, and 13 Regent Street,
London, S.W.l.
As a general rule travellers entering the United Kingdom must have a valid
passport and a visa issued by British consular authorities abroad, but visas are
not required for citizens of the following countries: all countries of the British
Commonwealth, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast,
Japan, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Republic of South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, the United States of America, and all countries in
Central and South America. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland do not require
either passport or visa (but, with residents of Commonwealth countries, are
subject to immigration control if seeking employment in Britain: see p. 433).

Nationals of the following countries who wish to visit the United Kingdom
for social or holiday visits of up to three months may use instead of a passport
their national identity card (in the Netherlands a toeristenkaart, obtainable
from town halls) in conjunction with a special Visitor’s Card (obtainable from
travel agents in the tourist’s own country): Belgium, France, Germany (Federal
Republic and West Berlin), Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands,
and Switzerland. A passport must, however, still be used where the purpose of the
visit is other than touristic, or where a stay of longer than three months is intended.
Foreign visitors who are 16 years of age or over must register with the police
three months after their arrival.
The personal baggage of persons entering the United Kingdom is subject to
customs examination. Many articles are liable to customs duty and a number
to purchase tax. Failure to make a complete declaration may result in
penalties; but, although there is no legal entitlement to them, certain concessions
are given to travellers who properly declare their belongings.
Used personal effects, including tools of trade and articles of professional
use, which have been in the ownership and use of a traveller for a considerable
period and are not intended for other persons or for sale, may be admitted free
of duty and purchase tax, as may also used furniture and domestic articles
belonging to persons transferring residence to the United Kingdom. Small
quantities of dutiable goods, including tobacco, wine and spirits, and perfume,
carried by travellers for their personal use are allowed to pass free of duty
within fixed limits.
Inquiries on importing personal and household effects should be addressed
to the Secretary, H.M. Customs and Excise, King’s Beam House, London, E.C.3.
There are purchase tax concessions for overseas visitors shopping in Britain.
Many of the principal stores are able to send goods to an address abroad free
of purchase tax; and under the Personal Export scheme a visitor may have goods
delivered free of tax to the seaport or airport by which he is leaving the country'.
All cats and dogs brought into the United Kingdom have to undergo six
months’ quarantine; and the landing of the animals must be authorised by a
licence issued by the appropriate Agricultural Department for England and
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (see Chapter 12). The department will
provide a list of approved carrying agents and quarantine kennels. An annual
licence (costing 7s. 6d. and obtainable at any post office) is needed for a house¬
hold dog aged 6 months or more.
Imports of live poultry are permitted only from certain countries. All plants
and certain seeds, fruit and vegetables imported into the United Kingdom must
be accompanied by a plant health certificate; certain plants may be imported only
under special licence.
Regulations concerning the temporary import of motor vehicles by visitors to
Britain are best obtained from the national motoring organisations in the visitor’s
country of residence. If a visitor is given a Temporary Importation Permit by
the customs officer at the port of entry, exemption from the need to pay vehicle
excise licence duty will be granted for the same period as stated on the permit
(maximum, 365 days). Insurance against third party risks is compulsory; a
visitor must produce evidence in the form of either an International Motor
Insurance Card (green card) or a certificate of insurance issued by a British insurer.
A visitor holding a valid International Driving Permit or a current domestic
driving licence for his own country is entitled to drive without obtaining a
British driving licence during the currency of his own permit or licence, subject
to a maximum of 12 months. Any person taking up permanent residence must
take a driving test (fee: £1) to secure a British licence which costs 15s. and is
valid for three years.
The rule of the road is to keep LEFT. Road signs are illustrated and explained
in The Highway Code (published by H.M. Stationery Office).

Eligibility for the main social security benefits is dependent on (a) sufficient
National Insurance contributions having been paid under the United Kingdom
schemes or (b) the existence of a reciprocal agreement between the United
Kingdom and the previous country of residence of the claimant (see p. 131).
Information on specific points may be obtained from the Ministry of Social
Security, 10 John Adam Street, London, W.C.2.
To qualify for family allowances, a residence qualification must be fulfilled,
varying in length according to the nationality and previous country of residence
of the applicant.
The services provided under the National Health Service are available to
everyone in Britain without regard to residence, nationality or insurance qualifica¬
tion. Immigration authorities have been instructed, however, to refuse admission
to the country to any person coming solely for the purpose of securing free
treatment under the Health Service.
Persons from countries outside the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic are
admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a particular
employer only if they have a permit issued by the Ministry of Labour (see p. 433).
Since 1st July 1962 Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Irish Republic
have been subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962
(see p. 433), and must obtain an employment voucher issued by the Ministry
of Labour before entering Britain for full-time employment.
Visitors of foreign nationality wishing to set up in any business or profession
in Britain must ask for permission from the Under-Secretary of State, Home
Office, Immigration and Nationality Department, Princeton House, 271 High
Holborn, London, W.C.l.

INDEX
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter rather than
under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. {that is. Accidents, Royal Society for
the Prevention of; Anglers, National Federation of). In cases where the first word is not
separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force, Royal Society), entries will be found
appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only where
they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed under the
relevant subject headings.
