Foreword
Britain 1997 is the 48th in the series of annual
Handbooks prepared by the Central Office of
Information (COI). Drawing on a wide range of
official and other authoritative sources, it
provides a factual and up-to-date overview of
government policy and other recent
developments in Britain.
Handbook is widely recognised as an
established work of reference, not only in
Britain itself, but also overseas, where it is an
important element of the information service
provided by British diplomatic posts. It is sold
by The Stationery Office and its agents
throughout the world.
Features
As always, the text has been fully updated and
revised. There are also more pages than ever
before, with the usual charts, tables and graphs.
This year’s Handbook has an environmental
flavour to it. Britain’s response to the challenge
of‘sustainable development’ is set out in
Chapter 21, and there is an extended
photographic section on Britain and the
Environment. The Earl of Bradford has
provided a lively introduction on tourism and
the environment which forthrightly expresses
his own viewpoint. This does not necessarily
always coincide with the official government
view!
Because of the environmental theme, we
have switched to ‘greener’ paper. The text
paper is 100% recycled and produced under
entirely chlorine-free conditions. The paper for
the photographic sections is 50% recycled and
partly chlorine-free.
Coverage
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in Handbook is accurate at
the time of going to press. The text is generally
based on information available up to September
1996.
As far as possible, Handbook presents
information that applies to Britain as a whole.
However, care should be taken when using
Handbook to note whether the information
given refers to:
• Britain, formally the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
• Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland;
• England and Wales, which are grouped
together for many administrative and other
purposes; or, in some instances,
• England alone.
Acknowledgments
Britain 1997 has been compiled with the full
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all the
people from these organisations who have taken
so much time and care to ensure that
Handbook s high standards of accuracy have
been maintained. Their contributions and
comments have been extremely valuable.

Richard, 7th Earl of Bradford, is a
landowner, restaurateur and writer. He has
a degree in agriculture from Trinity
College, Cambridge and manages his
family estate in Shropshire. His ancestral
seat, Weston Park, is now owned by a
charitable trust; it is a successful enterprise
that hosts special events and offers
accommodation and banqueting facilities
for groups, as well as being open to the
public. Lord Bradford is also President of
the Wrekin Tourism Association, an active
member of the House of Lords, and the
owner of Porters English Restaurant in
Covent Garden, London. What follows is
his personal view.

Visiting Wealth on the Nation
Tourism and the Environment in Britain
What is mainly flat, mostly green and contributes around £22.7 billion to the Exchequer
every year? Answer: Tourist Britain. The major draws are heritage, history, business,
shopping and the countryside—though not necessarily in that order. Yet heritage and
landscape can be literally ‘loved to death’—threatened by the very multitudes that come
to appreciate them.
So how can the conflicting demands of tourism and the environment be reconciled? This
introduction sets out some of the problems and suggests some of the solutions, not forgetting
that our country’s economic future is at stake, for tourism is Britain’s second largest, and
fastest growing, industry.
In fact by the start of the next millennium, tourism will be the world’s largest
industry. Britain—given its relatively small size and lack of consistent weather—has
performed reasonably well, but by comparison with Europe and the rest of the world, our
figures have been gently slipping for some time. This is borne out by the figures in the
Government’s own recent document Tourism: Competing with the Best. For instance,
our share of world tourism declined from 6 per cent in 1985 to only 4.7 per cent ten
years later, and we are third from last in the league table of tourism growth in Europe
between 1980 and 1992.
Our balance of payments performance has been even more dramatic—and extremely
disappointing. A decent surplus of £500 million in 1985 became a huge deficit of £4.5 billion
in 1994. Just consider what financial freedom the Chancellor would enjoy if he had that
missing £5 billion each year to help him solve the balance of payments problem.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A Sound Investment
The fact is that spending money on tourism promotion is not like other forms of government
expenditure. It is an investment that demonstrably pays off.
Tourism promotion puts people into work. The numbers presently employed in
tourism and tourism-related industries are estimated at 1.475 million. Professor Stephen
Wanhill, Professor of Tourism Studies at Cardiff University, has demonstrated that one
new job can be created by an increased spend on tourism of just £28,500.
That missing £5 billion could have created 175,000 jobs in Britain.
Tourism promotion generates revenue.
The World Travel and Tourism Council’s
assessment is that the British travel and
tourism industry will have contributed
£22.7 billion in taxes in 1995.
Most of all, it yields a direct financial
return to the Exchequer. An influential
study by McKinsey, a respected firm of
international consultants, has estimated that
every extra pound spent on tourism
promotion by the Government produces
over four pounds in additional tax
revenue—a staggering pay-off, quickly
generated.
Instead, the total grant has been
restrained in recent years. It was exactly
the same in real terms in 1995 as it was in
1979, which disguises the fact that, since
many of the British Tourist Authority’s
costs are in foreign currencies, there has
actually been a reduction in its resources
created by the fall in the value of the
pound.
In addition, further cost burdens have
been imposed on the tourism industry. In
particular, VAT has been raised from 8 per
cent in 1979 to 17.5 per cent now, and a
new airport tax has been created. The yield
for the first full year of operation is around
£300 million. Surely it would make sense to
put some of that money to good use by
investing it in tourism promotion, instead
of merely allowing our competitive
disadvantage to grow.
It has been suggested that the industry
should pay for its own promotion.
However, of the 224,000 businesses in
the tourism industry, 180,000 are owner-
operated. Therefore, only the largest
Wigan Pier—Reviving the Ruins
In 1981 unemployment in Wigan
was 14 per cent and domestic
tourism in the doldrums. The
derelict industrial buildings at
Wigan Pier—among them cotton
mills and warehouses—stood as a
symbol of urban decay.
However, as far back as 1975 the
owners of the buildings had drawn
up a plan for a commercial and
leisure use for them. But it was not
until the early 1980s that Wigan
Council took up the idea. They had
visited Bradford and seen how
successfully the council there had
marketed the area as a destination
for short-break holidays (see p. xii).
Bringing in a marketing and
tourism consultant, Wigan Council
launched its project in 1982. Wigan
Pier was opened by Her Majesty the
Queen in 1986.
The unique complex of canalside
buildings offers a host of
attractions, among them a heritage
centre, waterbuses and
narrowboats, and exhibition
facilities. Wigan Pier has won
numerous awards, among them a
Council of Europe Award for
Environmental Conservation. It has
created over 300 jobs, and the
careful planning has paid handsome
dividends: every year since its
opening, Wigan Pier has attracted
visitors far in excess of its annual
target.
viii
VISITING WEALTH ON THE NATION
companies would be able to afford this, and the smaller ones would risk going out of
business, to the detriment of employment.
If this suggestion were taken up, we would also be the only major tourist destination in
the world not to fund tourism promotion centrally. Other countries are recognising the need
to invest in promotion. Australia—where incidentally the Minister for Tourism holds
Cabinet rank—is currently spending A$100 million (over £50 million) on worldwide
television advertising, including A$30 million in Asia alone, the fastest growing market. Our
total grant to the BTA and all the statutory bodies was only £92 million in 1995-96.
Therefore, just for fun, imagine what might happen if the Chancellor in his budget were
to raise spending on tourism promotion to £5 billion. Think what room to manoeuvre the
resulting revenue would offer.
Unfortunately, the consequent side effect would be that the country’s infrastructure
would totally collapse under the burden of increased tourist numbers. The Tower of
London would be worn away into sand and Yorkshire Water would probably have to cease
supplies completely!
Maintaining the Fabric
But, joking apart, even with the present volume of incoming visitors, there are very real
problems as a consequence of increasing numbers, and it is obvious in certain areas of
Britain that some constraints are required. Tourism must become environmentally
sustainable and sensitive to the problems that it can create, both for the locality and for
the people who try to live normally in it.
Examples of unsustainable tourism are now legion: the traffic nightmare in London—
sometimes approaching gridlock outside the most popular attractions at the busiest
times—caused mainly by the huge seasonal influx of coaches full of day trippers; the
erosion of the paths in some parts of the Lake District or the Peak District National Park;
and the strain placed on the infrastructure of many historic towns—Canterbury, Oxford,
and York, for instance—by an uncontrolled invasion of tourists, causing inconvenience
and annoyance to native and visitor alike.
Yet the majority of tourists visit Britain for a slice of authentic history and tradition,
and it is impossible to re-create that in any way, when what they want is the genuine
article.
Many major attractions like the Tower of London or St Paul’s Cathedral have finite
maximum numbers that they can accommodate at any given time, firstly to control
damage but secondly to ensure that all the sightseers enjoy a happy rather than an
overcrowded experience. It is interesting to note that, whereas there used to be plenty of
free attractions in London, most have now started charging: the Natural History
Museum in 1987, the Science Museum in 1988, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in
1996. The National Gallery is still free, as are the British Museum and the Tate Gallery,
but these have donation boxes for voluntary contributions towards the upkeep of the
buildings. In 1991 St Paul’s Cathedral started charging again (Queen Victoria had
ordered them to stop in 1851, in honour of the Great Exhibition!), to clear its debts and
fund a planned programme of restoration.
A major problem with ever-greater numbers coming to London is trying to differentiate
between those bringing positive economic benefits and those that merely ‘clog up the
streets’.
IX
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1 his is a necessary (though perhaps, in some respects, regrettable) step, if we are to
encourage an increase in visitors that fall into the higher-spending category. Coaches full of
day-trippers from across the Channel, arriving with their packed lunches and itinerary of
free attractions, could actually end up costing the country more than they bring in. Perhaps
those arriving via the ferry terminals and Eurotunnel should, like airline passengers, be
obliged to pay some sort of tax, so that the country would at least be assured of a
contribution towards the infrastructure costs generated by the ‘cheaper’ traveller.
It is also important, in these circumstances, not to continue expanding the numbers of
visitors to London, but to ensure that they are more evenly distributed throughout the
country. However, if we are going to restrict access effectively but fairly, at the same time we
also need to foster an increase in the amount spent by tourists. Many attractions recognise
that we need to raise the financial take from visitors in environmentally sensitive locations or
simply where the existing facilities are under strain. Limiting numbers while increasing the
amount they spend both maintains funds for upkeep and reduces the rate of deterioration.
Cambridge City Council, for example, has persuaded local accommodation providers to
offer a considerable discount to people who are staying for more than just one night. This
encourages them, instead of coming merely as day-trippers or overnight and contributing
little to the area, to provide a more significant financial yield.
At the same time we must continue to concentrate on one immensely important and
fast-growing sector of the market: the business or incentive traveller. There are two main
reasons why we should target them: not only are they less seasonal-—most valuable for
spreading the load—but also the amount they spend tends to be higher—often
considerably so.
Now that we have added to our range of facilities available for the business
traveller—for example, with the National Exhibition Centre and the International
Convention Centre, both in Birmingham, which seems to be achieving something of a
lead in this field—we are better placed, but we should certainly not be complacent; we
still lag far behind many of our leading competitors.
Branching Out
While it is critical to boost the business travel market, we should try to persuade the ordinary
traveller to consider seeing more of Britain and, in particular, to get out of London, which,
sadly, as far as many people are concerned, is Britain.
It should be obvious and is certainly vital that we look at boosting numbers by attracting
more people to parts of the country that have room to entertain and indulge them.
Immediately we come up against a logistical problem, as all the major gateways into
Britain are in the South East, and where you start your trip has an enormous influence on
where you go. Heathrow and Gatwick are the dominant airports, while the ferry terminals at
Dover and Folkestone occupy a similar standing. What’s more, we now have the effect of
Eurotunnel to contend with as well.
There is a constant call to increase the size of the two main airports, with many
fundamental reasons being cited: the major airlines do not have enough space, there is
demand from customers, the present facilities are becoming overcrowded, we need to retain
their standing as major airports and as transport ‘hubs’ for the rest of Europe, we must avoid
the danger of losing out to Amsterdam or Brussels, and so on.
VISITING WEALTH ON THE NATION
The USA is in a much more fortunate
position: throughout the Eastern seaboard
there are many different, widely spread
airline hubs—Atlanta, Charlotte, Orlando,
JFK, Newark, Baltimore, Dallas, Philadelphia,
Miami, Washington, Boston—which provide a
wider choice and ensure that their tourist
industry relies far less on New York than ours
does on London.
Unfortunately, until we expand the
perfectly viable alternatives, like
Birmingham, Manchester, Prestwick,
Cardiff, and Belfast, to a critical mass that
will enable them to provide a range of
services comparable to those of Heathrow
or Gatwick, there will continue to be a bias
towards London and the South East, and
the strain on resources and infrastructure
will grow.
Green for Go
In encouraging people to travel further
afield, we must not lose sight of the
problems that travel—be it hiking
intrepidly up and down Scottish mountains
or driving round to your local stately home
of a Sunday afternoon—can cause:
overcrowding, air pollution, and
degradation of landscape, buildings and
roads. Many local councils have adopted
strategies to control the level of traffic in
their area: park-and-ride schemes, to
confine cars to a manageable area;
downgrading roads so that they no longer
appear on local tourist maps; placing special
ticket machines in car parks so that users
can, if they wish, make an additional
contribution to the upkeep of the woodland
served by the car park; and last but not least,
integrating their traffic management schemes into partnerships with local public
transport companies so as to offer a service that will tempt motorists out of their cars.
The National Trust is even conducting an 18-month experiment by running a property
without a car park: Prior Park, near Bath. The Trust is funding a Sunday bus service from
the city centre to Prior Park itself, as there was no existing Sunday service. Furthermore,
members of the Trust have voted overwhelmingly to reduce the percentage of visitors
arriving at Trust properties by car from 90 per cent to 60 per cent by the year 2020.
National Trust—Promoting Public
Transport
The National Trust (NT) is a
registered charity founded in 1895 ‘to
preserve places of historic interest or
natural beauty’ for the public. It
owns 240,000 hectares (600,000 acres)
of countryside and 885 km (550 miles)
of coastline, and protects over 200
historic houses, 160 gardens and 25
industrial sites.
In 1995 around 11 million visits
were made to NT properties, and
many more to woods, coastal areas
and other open spaces. No one is
more conscious than the NT of the
threat to the built and the natural
environment from people and
pollution. It therefore promotes
travel to its properties and sites by
public transport. For each one listed
in its handbook, the NT gives details
on how to reach it by public
transport. It also produces Green
Transport News, a bulletin
highlighting new transport links to
NT properties and the reduced entry
fees available to those who can
present a bus or train ticket.
One example is Aberdulais Falls,
in Wales. Those travelling by bus
from Neath, three miles away, are
entitled to discounted entry to see
this spectacular waterfall and the
hydro-electric scheme developed to
harness the waters of the Dulais
river—an all-round environmentally-
friendly outing.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Off the Beaten Track
Despite the concentration on the South East as the point of access to Britain, there are
countless examples of extraordinary regional success. Many people have been impressed by
the achievements of Yorkshire, as it has found and developed many new points of interest;
by exploiting its authors, its television series, particularly Last of the Summer Wine — and
who would have thought that Bradford or Leeds would find so much to engross and allure
the tourist?
(Incidentally, before any possible accusations of parochial self-interest are levelled at me,
I am not choosing Bradford as an excellent example of tourism because of any family
connection. My title, ‘Earl of Bradford’, is taken from the Hundred of South Bradford in
Shropshire, where we still live.)
When Bradford decided to enter the holiday market in 1980, it was widely treated as
something of a joke. What could a Northern industrial town, with declining traditional local
industries, possibly have to offer the visitor?
\et Bradford was actually blessed with a number of natural attractions: Haworth,
home of the Bronte sisters; Saltaire model mill village and other fascinating Victorian
industrial buildings; and particularly its proximity to the spectacularly scenic Yorkshire
Dales.
The city council’s Economic Development Unit initially targeted the travel trade by
launching two themed ‘short-stay’ holidays, which generated—partly because the whole
premise seemed so unlikely!—considerable publicity and sold very well. Bradford had made
its mark.
One gratifying result of this success was that Bradford was chosen as the location for the
new National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in 1983, while nearby Leeds
has recently enticed the new Armoury to its city centre. The area now has over 50 attractions
of international and local interest—there are even signs in Japanese to local landmarks
around Haworth!
Today, the Bradford area draws more than six million visitors a year, worth somewhere
around £120 million to the local economy, all of which has been achieved in a comparatively
short time by an imaginative approach.
Capitalising on the Countryside
Similarly, as President of the Wrekin Tourism Association for the last fifteen years I have
seen firsthand the enormous impact that success in attracting more tourists can have on a
region—mainly achieved through innovative promotion and unselfish co-operation, aided by
a progressive attitude from local government. Tourist expenditure in the area has leapt from
around £3 million in 1980 to £54 million in 1995, and consequently employment has
expanded from 180 to 2,400, and accommodation stock from 400 bed spaces to 3,000. This
has happened because the number of incoming tourists has multiplied almost tenfold over
the period, to a figure of 2,400,000.
Such success has, of course, been greatly assisted by the designation of Ironbridge Gorge
as a world heritage site, but a whole raft of new attractions has risen up because of the
popular demand that has now been generated.
With this growth many other businesses have been created, such as restaurants, leisure
centres, an ice rink, and a bowling alley. So a strong case can be made for the theory that the
development of facilities ostensibly to service the tourist industry has actually greatly

VISITING WEALTH ON THE NATION
Peatlands Park—A Unique*
Habitat
Very little now remains of Europe’s
oldest natural living landscape—
Ireland’s bogland. In Northern
Ireland only 9 per cent of lowland
bog remains intact; in the uplands
and hills the figure is about 14 per
cent.
Overgrazing, drainage to reclaim
the land for agriculture, and new
peat extraction technology have all
taken their toll. Yet these ancient
peatlands have a vital ecological
function to perform: they absorb
carbon dioxide (C02) from the air
and act as a filter to purify rainwater.
Destruction of the bogland would
release C02 into the atmosphere,
contributing to global warming.
Peatlands are also an important
habitat for birds. A large proportion
of Ireland’s curlews live there, as do
rare birds of prey such as hen
harriers and merlin.
Peatlands Park covers 700 acres of
preserved bogland in County
Armagh, Northern Ireland. It not
only protects a threatened
ecosystem, but raises concern for a
landscape that was once taken for
granted. Each year 100,000 people
visit Peatlands Park, in school
parties, family groups and as
individuals, demonstrating that
conservation of a rare environment
can itself be exploited as a tourist
attraction, raising funds to continue
the valuable work—and raising
consciousness.
enhanced the quality of life for residents of
the Wrekin and indeed the whole of
Shropshire.
It is interesting to note that while the
number of hotel bedrooms in the Wrekin
has expanded substantially, there has
equally been an enormous increase in the
quantity of bed-and-breakfast
establishments. These enable people to stay
cheaply, provide important competition in
keeping hotel prices down and give a great
boost to the rural economy.
Bed-and-breakfast establishments
were once the mainstay of seaside
accommodation, providing the British
with their traditional form of holiday. The
experience in general—and the landlady,
in particular—was the butt of many jokes.
Now offering bed-and-breakfast
accommodation has become an important
source of income for many people who
live in the countryside, while providing a
less costly and more informal way of
exploring Britain. Many farmers
appreciate that it can be as important a
‘cash crop’ as wheat or barley, though it
places further demands on them, their
spouses and family members.
It is estimated that over 18,000 farmers
are currently running bed-and-breakfast
accommodation, which brings in an
average income of £6,700 per
establishment. The total earnings from
these enterprises are over £120 million
per year, which in turn leads to invaluable
sales revenue for many local tradesmen
who supply the farms, from the newsagent
to the milkman (unless, of course, the
farm in question happens to be a dairy
farm!).
Conservation through Reoccupation
It is always a great sadness to note the number of historic properties in Britain that have
fallen into such a state of disrepair that they have had to be demolished. The inter-war
period and the twenty years after the war were particularly bad in this respect. Even my own
xiii
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
family had to blow up Tong Castle and pull
down Leaton Knolls Hall in the 1950s: one
was derelict and the other riddled with dry
rot and every other known form of pest.
Fortunately this trend has been virtually
halted. Larger houses are being converted—
most of them sympathetically, as they are
likely to be listed buildings—into individual
dwelling units by enlightened architects such
as Kit Martin.
Meanwhile, many smaller buildings or
structures of historic interest, architectural
merit or amenity value have been in a more
critical position. As the properties were often
unsuitable for full-time occupation and
would have cost a small fortune to restore,
the only option for owners was to raze or
mothball.
Thus it was with great foresight that John
and Christian Smith founded the Landmark
Trust in 1965 to rescue such places. As well
as the benefits of upkeep, the occupation of
these properties by short-stay visitors offers
valuable protection against vandalism.
The National Trust have followed a
similar route with some of their less grand
properties, and now let out a total of 120.
I hanks to these two organisations, the traveller has a unique opportunity to enjoy Britain
from a different viewpoint, while at the same time contributing to valuable conservation
work.
The Landmark Trust—
Generating Funds for
Conservation
One unusual form of accommodation
for holiday-makers is supplied by the
Landmark Trust. This registered
charity specialises in rescuing small
but historically interesting buildings
(everything from barns to manor
houses to Martello towers), many of
them in remote locations. It restores
them, furnishes them in the
appropriate style, and then rents
them out as self-catering holiday
accommodation to people who want
something out of the ordinary. The
income the Trust receives from these
lettings provides for the restoration
and upkeep of the properties.
One of the Trust’s most popular
buildings is the Pineapple, an
eccentric confection in stone dating
from the 18th century, which is
situated near Stirling, in Scotland.
Meeting the Millenium
We must attempt to ensure that we are not left out of the boon to our economy generated by
tourism, by ensuring continued and increased investment in international promotion of the
right kind.
We must look at developing more gateways into Britain and make sure that previously
unexploited areas examine the benefits that they could derive from well-planned tourism,
as we need to encourage people to spread themselves more thinly throughout Britain,
rather than huddling together in the South East. We must always take care that tourism
is to the advantage of the local environment and the local population, as well as to the
Treasury.
We can change our approach, and in doing so, we can draw on the advice and best
practice, both of the organisations mentioned here and of others, such as SustainAbility and
the Campaign for Environmentally Responsible Tourism.
We cannot afford to create a situation in which the patient ends up on the critical list
because our efforts at tourism promotion have achieved such a resounding success—purely

in terms of numbers, without the accompanying, and most necessary, increase in
spending—that our finite resource of‘real history’ suffers irreversible damage at the hands
(or feet) of the trampling hordes.

Britain and
its People
1
Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
and is one of the 15 member states of the
European Union (EU). Its full name is the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the British
Isles. The largest of the islands is Great Britain.
The next largest comprises Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic. Western Scotland is
fringed by the large island chain known as the
Hebrides, and to the north east of the Scottish
mainland are the Orkney and Shetland Islands.
All these, along with the Isle of Wight, Anglesey
and the Isles of Scilly, have administrative ties
with the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the
Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great
Britain and France are largely self-governing,
and are not part of the United Kingdom.
With an area of about 242,000 sq km (93,000
sq miles), Britain is just under 1,000 km (about
600 miles) from the south coast to the extreme
north of Scotland and just under 500 km
(around 300 miles) across at the widest point.
The climate is generally mild and
temperate. Prevailing winds are south-westerly
and the weather from day to day is mainly
influenced by depressions moving eastwards
across the Atlantic. The weather is subject to
frequent changes. In general, there are few
extremes of temperature; it rarely rises above
32°C (90°F) or falls below -10°C (14°F).
Average annual rainfall is more than 1,600
mm (over 60 inches) in the mountainous areas
of the west and north but less than 800 mm (30
inches) over central and eastern parts. Rain is
fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on average, March to June are the driest
months and September to January the wettest.
During May, June and July (the months of
longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern
Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine
is at a minimum, with an average of an hour a
day in northern Scotland and two hours a day
on the south coast of England.
Geographical Facts
• Highest mountain: Ben Nevis, in the
highlands of Scotland, at 1,343 m
(4,406 ft)
• Longest river: the Severn, 354 km (220
miles) long, which rises in central
Wales and flows through Shrewsbury,
Worcester and Gloucester in England
to the Bristol Channel
• Largest lake: Lough Neagh, Northern
Ireland, at 396 sq km (153 sq miles)
• Highest waterfall: Eas a’Chual Aluinn,
from Glas Bheinn, in the highlands of
Scotland, with a drop of 200 m (660 ft)
• Deepest cave: Ogof Ffynnon Ddu,
Wales, at 308 m (1,010 ft) deep
• Most northerly point on the British
mainland: Dunnet Head, north-east
Scotland
• Most southerly point on the British
mainland: Lizard Point, Cornwall
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a Celtic
original. Although in the prehistoric timescale
the Celts were relatively late arrivals in the
3
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British Isles, only with them does Britain
emerge into recorded history. The term
‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to
distinguish the early inhabitants of the British
Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in 55
and 54 bc, contact between Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of ad 43. Roman rule was gradually
extended from south-east England to include
Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of Scotland.
The final Roman withdrawal in 409 followed a
period of increasing disorder during which the
island began to be raided by Angles, Saxons and
Jutes from northern Europe. It is from the
Angles that the name ‘England’ derives. The
raids turned into settlement and a number of
small English kingdoms were established. The
Britons maintained an independent existence in
the areas now known as Wales and Cornwall.
Among these kingdoms more powerful ones
emerged, claiming overlordship over the whole
country, first in the north (Northumbria), then
in the midlands (Mercia) and finally in the south
(Wessex). However, further raids and settlement
by the Vikings from Scandinavia occurred,
although in the 10th century the Wessex dynasty
defeated the invading Danes and established a
wide-ranging authority in England. In 1066
England was invaded by the Normans (see p. 7),
who then settled along with others from France.
Dates of some of the main events in Britain’s
history are given on p. 5. The early histories of
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
are included in Chapters 2 to 5, which also deal
with the main aspects of their social, economic
and political life. Additional material is included
on the political situation in Northern Ireland.
Table 1.1 gives a selection of some of the main
statistics for each of the four lands.
Wildlife
Britain is home to a great variety of wildlife,
with an estimated 30,000 animal species, as
well as marine and microscopic life; about
2,800 species of ‘higher’ plants; and many
thousands of mosses, fungi and algae. The
Government seeks to conserve species and
habitats, and many of its strategies are

Although the Song Thrush (pictured on
the front cover) is a widespread
species, its numbers have more than
halved in Britain over the last 25 years.
Causes include environmetal factors
such as changes in farming methods,
which have affected its food supply
and nesting sites, severe winter
weather and dry soil conditions.
Research is now being undertaken
into appropriate remedial measures,
including the promotion of sensitive

Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries
and remained subject to the English Crown
after the final loss of Normandy to the
French in the 15th century. The Isle of Man
was under the nominal sovereignty of
Norway until 1266, and eventually came
under the direct administration of the British
Crown in 1765. Today the territories have
their own legislative assemblies and systems
of law; the Isle of Man also has its own
system of taxation. The British Government
is responsible for their international relations
and external defence.

England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland regions
in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the south west, in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. The
greatest concentrations of population (see Table 2.1) are in London and the
South East, the West Yorkshire and north-west industrial cities, the Midlands
conurbation around Birmingham, the north-east conurbations on the rivers
Tyne and Tees, and along the Channel coast. England’s population is expected
to rise from 48.5 million in 1993 to 51.9 million in 2016.
Early History
The name ‘England’ is derived from the
Angles, one of the Germanic tribes which
established monarchies in lowland Britain in
the 5th century. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms
were initially fairly small and numerous, but
gradually larger entities emerged. Eventually
Wessex came to dominate, following its
leading role in resisting the Danish invasions
of the 9th century. Athelstan (924-39) used
the title of‘King of all Britain’, and from 954
there was only a single Kingdom of England.
The present Royal Family is descended from
the old royal house of Wessex.
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of Normandy
defeated the English at the Battle of Hastings,
and Normans and others from France came to
settle. French became the language of the
nobility for the next three centuries, and the
legal and social structures were influenced by
those prevailing across the Channel.
Almost all the English Crown’s possessions
in France were lost during the late Middle
Ages. The union of England and Scotland in
took place in 1707, leaving England as the most
populous part of the British nation state.
Government
England has no government minister or
department exclusively responsible for its central
administration, in contrast to Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Instead, there are a
number of government departments, whose
responsibilities in some cases also cover aspects
of affairs in Wales and Scotland (see
Appendices). A network of Government Offices
for the Regions is responsible for the
implementation of several government
programmes (see p. 375) in the English regions.
There are currently 524 English
parliamentary constituencies represented in
the House of Commons. Changes approved
following a 1995 boundary review (see p. 54)
will increase this to 529 after the next general
election. In August 1996 England had 310

“Employees in employment plus self-employed.
Conservative Members of Parliament, 197
Labour, 15 Liberal Democrat and one
independent, as well as the Speaker of the House
of Commons.1 Conservative support tends to be
strongest in suburban and rural areas, and the
Conservatives have a large majority of
parliamentary seats in the southern half of
England and in East Anglia. The Labour Party
derives its main support from urban areas.
Liberal Democrat support in England is
particularly strong in the South West, where the
party holds eight of its 15 English seats.
Local government is mainly administered
through a two-tier system of counties
subdivided into districts. However, there are a
number of single-tier authorities, with more
being introduced as part of the reform of the
structure of local government in England (see
pp. 75-6).
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions known
as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on the other,
parliamentary and European Community (EC)
legislation. In the formulation of common law
since the Norman Conquest, great reliance has
been placed on precedent. Equity law—law
outside the scope of the common law or statute
law—derives from the practice of petitioning the
Lord Chancellor in cases not covered by
common law.
’The Speaker of the House of Commons, who presides
over the debates there (see p. 54), traditionally does not
vote along party lines and so is not counted towards the
strength of the party for which he or she was originally
elected.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church at
the time of the Reformation in the early 16th
century, is the Established Church (that is, the
official religion of England); the Sovereign
must always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops (see p. 468).
The Economy
Considerable changes in the economy of
England have occurred during the 20th century.
In the second half of the century, jobs in service
industries have grown and now account for
three-quarters of employees in employment,
with expansion having been particularly
noticeable in financial and business services.
Services account for three-quarters of gross
domestic product (GDP) in London and the
South East, and over a quarter of employees in
Greater London work in financial services.
London is one of the world’s leading centres of
banking, insurance and other financial services.
Manufacturing, although declining as a
proportion of the employment base, remains
important in a number of areas. In terms of
GDP, it is most significant in the East
Midlands (where manufacturing accounted for
29 per cent of the region’s GDP in 1994), the
North and the West Midlands. East Anglia has
been the fastest-growing English region in
terms of population since the 1960s. It is
expected that it will continue to be the fastest
growing region in the early years of the 21st
century. Once largely agricultural, high-
9
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
technology industry has in recent years
developed in the region.
In agriculture, dairying is most common in
the west of England; sheep and cattle are
reared in the hilly and moorland areas of the
North and South West. Arable farming, pig
and poultry farming and horticulture are
concentrated in the east and south.
Tourism and leisure now form one of
England’s biggest industries, worth £11,650
million in 1994 and contributing 5 per cent of
GDP. About 1.5 million people work in
tourism and leisure.
Transport
The motorway network comprises four
long-distance routes linking London and the
cities of the Midlands, the North and North
West, and the South West; the London orbital
route (M25); and over 30 shorter motorways.
In all, there are about 3,200 km (2,000 miles)
of motorway in England, plus about 14,400 km
(9,000 miles) of other trunk roads.
The railway system has largely been
privatised. Many of the passenger services
have been franchised to the private sector and
Railtrack, the infrastructure company, was
floated on the Stock Exchange in May 1996.
Cultural and Social Affairs
London has a wealth of cultural centres,
including four major art galleries and many
renowned museums, together with theatres,
ballet and opera houses and concert halls. Other
major cities and towns also have a broad range of
cultural interests. Many theatres outside London
are used for touring by the national theatre,
dance and opera companies. There is also a
thriving popular culture in Britain, including
numerous kinds of pop music, theatre styles such
as pantomime and musicals, and performances
by comedians. Safari, wildlife and theme parks
all offer family activities and entertainment. Arts
projects are benefiting from the proceeds of the
National Lottery (see p. 42).

The Environment
Despite the relatively high population density
and degree of urbanisation, there are still many
unspoilt rural and coastal areas. There are
seven National Parks, six forest parks, 36
designated ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’, 22 environmentally sensitive areas,
almost 200 country parks approved by the
Countryside Commission, 800 km (500 miles)
of designated heritage coastline, and about
2,000 historic buildings and some 3,600

About half of the 1.6 million people in Northern Ireland are settled in the
eastern coastal region, the centre of which is the capital, Belfast. Most industry
is situated in this part of the province. Northern Ireland is at its nearest point
only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a 488-km (303-mile) border with the
Irish Republic.
According to the 1991 Census, 50.6 per cent of
the people regarded themselves as Protestants
and 38.4 per cent as Roman Catholics. Most of
the Protestants are descendants of Scots or
English settlers who crossed to north-eastern
Ireland; they are British by culture and
tradition and committed to remaining part of
the United Kingdom. The Roman Catholic
population is mainly Irish by culture and
history, and the majority of them favour a
united Ireland.
History
During the tenth century Ireland was
dominated by the Vikings. In 1169 Henry II of
England launched an invasion of Ireland. He
had been granted its overlordship by the
English Pope Adrian IV, who was anxious to
bring the Irish church into full obedience to
Rome. Although a large part of the country
came under the control of Anglo-Norman
magnates, little direct authority was exercised
from England during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents.
The main focus of resistance was the northern
province of Ulster. After the collapse of this
resistance in 1607 and the flight of its leaders,
Ulster was settled by immigrants from
Scotland and England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further risings in Ireland, which were crushed
by Oliver Cromwell. More fighting took place
after the overthrow of the Roman Catholic
James II in 1688. During the Battle of the
Boyne in Ireland in 1690 the forces of James II,
who was trying to regain the throne, starting in
Ireland, were defeated by those of the
Protestant William of Orange (William III).
Throughout most of the 18th century there
was uneasy peace. In 1782 the Irish Parliament
(dating from medieval times) was given
legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
crown. The Parliament, however, represented
only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, and
Roman Catholics were excluded from it. In
1798 an abortive rebellion took place, led by
Wolfe Tone’s United Irishmen movement.
Three years later Ireland was unified with
Great Britain; under the 1801 Act of Union
the Irish Parliament was abolished and Irish
11
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
members sat in both houses of the
Westminster Parliament in London.
The Irish question was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century and after. In 1886 the Liberal
Government introduced a Home Rule Bill
designed to give a new Irish Parliament
devolved authority over most internal matters
while reserving control over foreign and
defence policy to Britain. This led to a split in
the Liberal Party and the failure of the Bill. In
1893 a second Home Rule Bill was approved
by the House of Commons but rejected by the
House of Lords.
The issue returned to the political agenda in
1910 because Asquith’s Liberal administration
was dependent on support from the pro-Home
Rule Irish Parliamentary Party. The
controversy intensified as unionists and
nationalists in Ireland formed private armies.
In 1914 Home Rule was approved in the
Government of Ireland Act. Implementation,
however, was delayed by the outbreak of the
First World War.
A nationalist rising in Dublin in 1916 was
suppressed and its leaders executed. Two years
later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won a
large majority of the Irish seats in elections to
the Westminster Parliament. Its members
refused to attend the House of Commons and,
instead, formed the Dail Eireann in Dublin. A
nationalist guerrilla force called the Irish
Republican Army began operations against the
British administration in 1919.
The 1920 Government of Ireland
Act provided for the establishment of two
Home Rule parliaments, one in Dublin and
the other in Belfast. The Act was
implemented in 1921 in Northern Ireland,
when six of the nine counties of the province
of Ulster received their own Parliament and
remained represented in, and subject to
the supreme authority of, the British
Parliament.
In the South the guerillas continued to fight
for independence. A truce was agreed in June
1921, followed by negotiations between the
British Government and Sinn Fein. These
were concluded in December 1921 with the
signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty
establishing the Irish Free State, which
became a republic in 1949.
From its creation in 1921, Northern
Ireland’s Parliament had a consistent unionist
majority from which government ministers
were drawn. The nationalist minority resented
this persistent domination and their effective
exclusion from political office and influence.
Although an active and articulate civil rights
movement emerged during the 1960s, reforms
made in response were unable to forestall the
development of serious sectarian rioting. This
led to the introduction in 1969 of British Army
support for the police. These sectarian
divisions were subsequently exploited by
terrorists from both sides, most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA),
which claimed to be protecting the Roman
Catholic minority.
Because of increased terrorism and
inter-communal violence, the British
Government took over responsibility for law
and order in 1972. The Northern Ireland
unionist Government resigned in protest at
this decision and direct rule from London
began.
Government
Under the system of direct rule, the United
Kingdom Parliament approves all laws, and
Northern Ireland’s government departments
are controlled by the Secretary of State—a
Cabinet minister—and his ministerial team.
Seventeen members are elected to the
House of Commons. In the most recent
general election in April 1992 the Ulster
Unionists won 9 seats, the Democratic
Unionists 3, the Ulster Popular Unionists 1
and the nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour Party (SDLP) 4. The Alliance Party,
offering an alternative to Unionists and
Nationalists, did not obtain a seat. Sinn Fein
also fought the election but lost its only seat to
the SDLP. The number of Commons seats in
Northern Ireland will increase to 18 after the
next general election (see p. 54).
Northern Ireland elects three members of
the European Parliament.
Efforts to Achieve Devolved Government
Throughout the period of direct rule,
successive British Governments have
12
NORTHERN IRELAND
favoured a devolved administration widely
acceptable to both unionist and nationalist
political traditions. In 1974 a unionist-
nationalist coalition Executive was formed
but shortly collapsed as a result of a
protest strike by those unionists
opposed to power sharing. In 1982 an
Assembly was elected by proportional
representation but was dissolved four years
later because no agreement could be
reached between the parties on a devolved
administration.
Following another government initiative,
the four main constitutional parties (Ulster
Unionists, Democratic Unionists, Alliance
Party, and Social and Democratic Labour
Party) held a series of talks with the
Government and, where appropriate, the
Irish Government, in 1991 and 1992 to see
whether they could reach an agreement
taking into account the three sets of
relationships relevant to the Northern
Ireland problem—within Northern Ireland
itself; within the island of Ireland; and
between the British and Irish Governments.
The talks ended in November 1992 without
agreement.
Since then, the British Government has
been engaged in a series of bilateral talks with
the Northern Ireland parties in order to
explore the basis on which they might come
together for further dialogue. This work led to
the launch of the negotiations which started in
June 1996. The aim of all these discussions was
to produce a settlement attracting widespread
agreement among the two political traditions in
the North.
Relations with the Irish Republic
The British and Irish Governments have
worked closely together in order to bring peace
to Northern Ireland. The 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement created an Intergovernmental
Conference, in which both governments
discuss issues such as improved cross border
co-operation and security. The Irish
Government can put forward views and
proposals on matters related to Northern
Ireland provided that these are not the
responsibility of a devolved administration in
Belfast.
The Downing Street Declaration
Signed in December 1993 by the two
governments, the Downing Street Declaration
is a statement of fundamental principles which
made clear that the consent of a majority of
people in Northern Ireland would be required
before any constitutional change could come
about. On this basis the British Government
reiterated that it had no selfish strategic or
economic interest in Northern Ireland and
that, were a majority in Northern Ireland to
wish it, the Government would introduce
legislation to bring about a united Ireland. The
Irish Government accepted that it would be
wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland
without the freely given consent of the
majority of people in Northern Ireland.
In August 1994 the IRA announced a
complete cessation of its military operations.
This was followed in October by a similar
cessation by the loyalist paramilitary
organisations. In December 1994 British
officials, under the authority and political
direction of ministers, started separate
exploratory dialogues with Sinn Fein and with
the Progressive Unionist and Ulster
Democratic parties, the loyalist paramilitaries’
political representatives, in order to explore
the basis on which they could be admitted to
the talks process and examine the practical
consequences of an end to violence. In 1995
British ministers joined these dialogues,
stressing the need for the decommissioning of
illegally held weapons before these parties
could take part in all-party negotiations.
Joint Framework Document
In February 1995 the British and Irish
Governments published their ‘Frameworks for
the Future’ document, which contains two sets
of proposals. The first describes a shared
understanding, prepared at the request of the
Northern Ireland parties, between the two
governments on new political arrangements
between Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic and between the two governments
based on agreement and co-operation to the
mutual benefit of all. The other sets out the
British Government’s own understanding of
potentially acceptable elements for new
13
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
institutions in Northern Ireland which would
improve local accountability as part of a
comprehensive settlement. It draws closely on
the work done in the 1992 round table
discussions between the Government and the
Northern Ireland parties and takes account of
subsequent discussions with them.
The aim of‘Frameworks for the Future’ is
to serve as an aid to discussion and negotiation
between the parties. It is not a blueprint and
no solution will be imposed. In the view of the
two governments, it contains the elements of
what an overall settlement might look like.
They believe it deals with the range of issues
which the participants in the negotiations are
likely to wish to consider.
Further Developments
In November 1995 the British and Irish
Governments launched a Twin Track
Initiative, which addressed the issues of
decommissioning illegal arms through the
establishment of an independent International
Body and preparatory discussions with the
parties on ground rules for political
negotiations.
Chaired by former US senator George
Mitchell, the International Body published its
report in January 1996. It concluded that the
paramilitary organisations would not
decommisssion any arms before all-party talks
and set out six principles of democracy and
non-violence to which it said all parties should
adhere. In addition, it set out guidelines on
ways of decommissioning and proposed several
confidence-building measures, including, if it
were broadly acceptable, an elective process
appropriately mandated and within the talks
structure. All of these proposals were endorsed
by the British Government.
The IRA announced the end of its ceasefire
on 9 February 1996 and explosions for which
the IRA claimed responsibility subsequently
took place in London and Manchester. On 28
February, the British and Irish Prime
Ministers set a date for all-party negotiations
to begin—10 June 1996—following intensive
multilateral consultations and an elective
process. The two governments also agreed that
there could be no question of ministerial
meetings with Sinn Fein or of Sinn Fein
taking part in the negotiations until there was
an unequivocal restoration of the IRA
ceasefire.
Following the multilateral consultations
with the Northern Ireland parties in March,
the British Government published on 16 April
draft elections legislation which became law on
29 April 1996. Under this an election took
place on 30 May which produced 110
representatives, 5 from each of the 18
parliamentary constituencies and 2 from
each of the 10 most successful parties across
the Province. The representatives took their
seats in a deliberative forum whose purpose is
to discuss issues relevant to promoting
dialogue and understanding within Northern
Ireland. The Secretary of State invited the
parties represented in the Forum to select
negotiating teams to participate in negotiations
launched by the British and Irish Prime
Ministers on 10 June. In line with the policy
set out in the February 1996 communique,
nominations were not invited from Sinn Fein.
The two governments invited members of
the independent International Body which
examined the decommissioning issue to chair
those aspects of the talks requiring
independent chairmanship. The Secretary of
State will chair those proceedings concerning
internal institutions in Northern Ireland.
Human Rights
Economic and social deprivation persists on
both sides of the Northern Ireland community.
However, on all major social and economic
indicators, Roman Catholics generally
experience higher levels of disadvantage than
Protestants, leading to feelings of
discrimination and alienation which in turn
influence attitudes to political and security
issues. Government guidelines aim to promote
fair treatment by ensuring that policies and
programmes do not discriminate unjustifiably
against, for example, people of different
religious beliefs or political opinion, women,
disabled people, ethnic minorities and people
of different sexual orientation. The
Government also provides grant aid to local
government programmes designed to
encourage mutual understanding and
appreciation of cultural diversity; support is
14
NORTHERN IRELAND
also given to the Cultural Traditions
Programme, which attempts to show that
different cultures do not have to lead to
division. The aim of these initiatives is to
encourage a more pluralistic and tolerant
society with equal esteem for unionist and
nationalist traditions. The Standing Advisory
Commission on Human Rights advises the
Secretary of State on the effectiveness of
anti-discrimination laws and measures.
Direct or indirect discrimination in
employment on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is unlawful. All public
authorities and all those private employers
with more than ten employees are required to
register with the Fair Employment
Commission. There is also compulsory
monitoring of the religious composition of
workforces, continual review of recruitment,
training and promotion procedures and
affirmative action if fair employment is not
provided. Criminal penalties and economic
sanctions exist for defaulting employers. The
Fair Employment Tribunal deals with
individual complaints about discrimination.
An independent Chief Electoral Officer
maintains the accuracy of the electoral
register, while electoral boundaries for
parliamentary constituencies are determined
by impartial statutory procedures conducted
by the Boundary Commission for Northern
Ireland. The Northern Ireland Ombudsman
and Commissioner for Complaints deal with
complaints by the public against government
departments and local authorities. An
independent commission supervises police
investigations into the more serious
complaints against police officers and, at its
discretion, the investigation of other matters
(see p. 91).
Security Policy
In order to protect the public, legislation gives
the authorities exceptional powers to deal with
and prevent terrorist activities. These include
special powers of arrest for those suspected of
certain serious terrorist offences, non-jury
courts to try terrorist offences (see p. 96) and
the banning of terrorist organisations. The
legislation is subject to annual independent
review and to annual approval by Parliament.
The Government hopes that, once a lasting
peace is established, there will be no need for
these exceptional powers and is keeping the
requirement for such powers under continuing
review.
An independent Commissioner observes
and reports on the conditions under which
terrorist suspects are detained by the security
forces in police offices known as holding
centres. The Commissioner submits an annual
report to the Secretary of State which is
published.
Statutory codes of practice apply to the
detention, treatment, questioning and
identification of suspects. A breach of any of
the codes’ provisions by a police officer is a
disciplinary offence.
The Economy
Trends in output and employment tend to
reflect those in Britain. However, seasonally
adjusted unemployment (11.1 per cent in May
1996) is higher because a relatively high birth
rate has led to a greater natural rate of
population increase than in any other region in
Britain.
Some 74 per cent of employees work in
service industries and 18 per cent in
manufacturing. The largest industrial
employer is Short Brothers, owned by the
Canadian company Bombardier, with some
5,100 employees engaged on the manufacture
of aircraft and their components, guided
missiles and related products and services. The
shipbuilder Harland and Wolff employs 1,750
people.
In 1994-95 the value of exports increased
by 21 per cent to £2,600 million. Exports
account for 33 per cent of product sales. The
Irish Republic is the most important market
outside Britain, taking 8 per cent of exports in
1994-95.
Agriculture accounts for 5 per cent of gross
domestic product or 8 per cent if ancillary
industries are included. Some 10 per cent of
the workforce is employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and ancillary industries.
Tourism which is promoted by the
Northern Ireland Tourist Board throughout
the world, sustains about 12,500 jobs. A record
1.5 million people visited Northern Ireland in
15
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1995 and it is hoped to attract 1.8 million in
1997.
Overseas and other companies are important
investors, Northern Ireland attracting 9 per cent
of all new investment jobs in Britain in 1995-96
even though it accounted for only 3 per cent of
the British population. Around 200 externally
owned companies employ almost 46,000 people,
nearly half the manufacturing labour force.
Many overseas companies use the region as a
base for operations in the ever-increasing
European market.
The United States is the most important
single source of international investment for
Britain and in particular for Northern Ireland.
Almost 50 per cent of all inward investment to
Britain originates in the US, while in Northern
Ireland US companies represent a substantial
proportion of the Province’s manufacturing
output.
The Industrial Development Board (IDB)
encourages industrial development and new
international investment. In 1995-96, 6,600
new jobs were created by new and established
companies. In the same year the IDB
successfully negotiated 35 new investments or
expansions by externally owned companies;
these are expected to result in 4,869 new jobs.
The Local Enterprise Development Unit
assists the establishment and growth of small
businesses as well as 45 local enterprise
agencies run by people with business skills and
expertise. The Training and Employment
Agency is responsible for training the
workforce. The Industrial Research and
Technology Unit manages programmes aimed
at increasing the quality and level of
innovation and research.
Considerable public expenditure has been
devoted to improving conditions in urban and
rural areas. Since 1974 there has been a 92 per
cent reduction in housing unfitness levels in
Belfast.
The recently completed cross-harbour road
and rail bridges have transformed Belfast’s
infrastructure at a cost of £89 million. The
telecommunications firm BT has started work
on its new £30 million riverside Laganside
headquarters. Other important Laganside
developments include Belfast City Council’s
new concert hall and conference centre, which is
due to open in January 1997, and a 182-bedroom
Hilton International hotel, a £24 million project
on which construction work began in 1996.
More than 250 economic, social and
environmental projects in the city’s
disadvantaged areas have been supported in a
bid to improve education, training for adults,
and job finding services for unemployed people.
In Londonderry major private and public
sector developments recently completed or
under way include a major city retail centre
and multi-storey car park which provides
employment for 1,200 people; a £6 million
retail and car parking development elsewhere
in the city; and an investment of £11 million in
two new government office blocks providing
accommodation for over 400 civil servants.
Northern Ireland has parity with England,
Scotland and Wales on taxation and services.
The British Government makes a contribution
of over £3,000 million a year to maintain social
services at the level of those in Great Britain,
to meet the cost of security measures and to
compensate for the natural disadvantages of
geography and lack of resources.
In 1986 the British and Irish Governments
established the International Fund for Ireland.
Some three-quarters is spent in Northern
Ireland, the rest going to border areas in the
Republic. Programmes cover business
enterprise, tourism, community relations, urban
development, agriculture and rural
development. Donors include the United States,
the European Union, Canada and New Zealand.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Northern Ireland’s cultural heritage is
preserved and portrayed by the Ulster
Museum in Belfast, the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down and the
Ulster-American Folk Park in Omagh, which
specialises in the history of Irish emigration to
America. The Government recently
announced the merger of these three
museums. There are also several local
museums and heritage centres which are
mainly funded by local district councils.
Local arts festivals are an important feature
of the arts calendar, the highlight being the
Belfast festival, based at Queen’s University.
The Ulster Orchestra has a notable reputation.
Government support for the arts is channelled
16
NORTHERN IRELAND
through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland,
which gives financial help and advice to opera
and drama companies, orchestras and festivals,
arts centres, galleries, theatres, writers and
artistic groups.
Local district councils provide leisure
facilities, including leisure centres and
swimming, pools. The Government finances
the Sports Council for Northern Ireland,
which promotes sport and physical recreation.
Health and personal social services
correspond fairly closely to those in the rest of
Britain.
Although publicly-financed schools must be
open to children from all religions, in practice
Roman Catholic and Protestant children are
mainly educated in separate schools. There are
28 integrated schools for both Protestant and
Roman Catholic children out of a total of 1,237
publicly-financed schools and this process is
being encouraged by the Government (see
p. 445.
Most housing is owner occupied. The
Housing Executive (see p. 389) allocates public
housing to those in greatest need.

Three-quarters of the population of Scotland and most of the industrial towns
are in the central lowlands. The chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital),
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. Just over half of Scotland consists of the
sparsely populated highlands and islands in the north.
Scotland contains large areas of unspoilt and wild landscape, and the
majority of Britain’s highest mountains—nearly 300 peaks over 913 m (3,000 ft).
The Grampians in the central highlands contain Ben Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft),
the highest peak in Britain.
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain,
what is now Scotland was mainly inhabited by
the Piets. Despite a long campaign, Roman
rule was never permanently extended to most
of Scotland. In the sixth century, the Scots
from Ireland settled in what is now Argyll,
giving their name to the present-day Scotland.
Lothian was populated by the Angles, while
Britons moved north to Strathclyde. In the
ninth century parts of Scotland were subject to
raids by the Vikings; a united Scottish
kingdom was established at this time.
The powerful English monarchy threatened
Scottish independence in the Middle Ages,
particularly under Edward I, and war between
the two kingdoms was frequent. There were
also, however, strong links with England;
several Scottish kings held land and titles in
England and there was intermarriage between
the Scottish and English royal families.
Cultural influences on Scotland were also
strong. Despite reverses such as the defeat of
William Wallace’s uprising in 1298, Robert the
Bruce’s victory over Edward II of England at
Bannockburn in 1314 ensured the survival of a
separate kingdom of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded in
1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even so,
England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century, apart
from an enforced period of unification under
Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. The religions of
the two kingdoms had also developed in
different directions, with England retaining an
Episcopalian church (governed by bishops)

and Scotland embracing a Presbyterian system
(see p. 469). In 1707 both countries, realising
the benefits of closer political and economic
union, agreed on a single parliament for Great
Britain. Scotland retained its own system of
law and church settlement.
Government
Special arrangements are made for the conduct
of Scottish affairs within the British system of
government and separate Acts of Parliament
are passed for Scotland where appropriate.
There are 72 Scottish seats in the House of
Commons. In August 1996 there were 49
Labour Members of Parliament, 10
Conservative, 9 Liberal Democrat and 4
Scottish Nationalist.
Scottish administration is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, a member of the Cabinet, working
through The Scottish Office, which has its
headquarters in Edinburgh and an office in
London.
19
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Review of Scottish Government
In 1993 the Government issued a White Paper,
Scotland in the Union: A Partnership for Good,
following a wide-ranging examination of
Scotland’s place in Britain and the role of
Parliament in Scottish affairs. This has led to a
number of changes to improve the
parliamentary arrangements for handling
Scottish business. For example, the range of
business handled by the Scottish Grand
Committee (which consists of all 72 Scottish
MPs) has been widened and the Committee
now meets in Scotland as well as at
Westminster. Other changes include improved
scrutiny of Scottish legislation through two
standing committees, which examine in detail
Bills which are exclusively Scottish; and
greater accountability of Scottish Office
ministers through parliamentary question time
(see p. 61).
Local Government Reform
A major change in the structure of local
government took effect in April 1996. Under
the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act
1994, a single-tier structure of 29 councils
replaced the 62 regional and district councils.
The three islands councils—Orkney, Shetland
and the Western Isles—were largely
unaffected. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and
Aberdeen now all have their own council.
Legal System
The principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system differ in many respects from those
of England and Wales. These differences stem,
in part, from the adoption of elements from
other European legal systems, based on Roman
law, during the 16th century. For example, a
Scottish jury can give a verdict of‘not proven’
as an alternative to ‘not guilty’, when the
accused is acquitted.
Scotland has its own prosecution, prison
and police services.
The Economy
Scotland has experienced the same pressure on
its traditional industries as Wales and the
north of England. However, since 1989
economic growth in Scotland has on average
been greater than in Britain as a whole and it
was less affected by the recession in the early
1990s than were other areas.
Industry
As traditional industries such as coal, steel
and shipbuilding have declined, there has
been growth in high-technology industries,
such as chemicals, electronic engineering,
information technology and lighter forms of
mechanical and instrument engineering.
Scotland has one of the biggest
concentrations of the electronics industry in
Western Europe, with around 200 plants
employing some 46,000 workers. The
industry accounts for around 20 per cent of
manufacturing output in Scotland and is
responsible for a significant proportion of
Europe’s output of personal computers,
computer workstations and automated cash
dispensers (see p. 249).
Some traditional industries, such as
high-quality tweeds and other textiles, and
food and drink products, remain important.
There are 92 whisky distilleries in operation,
mostly in the north-east. Whisky exports,
valued at £2,300 million in 1995, represent
about 15 per cent of Scotland’s manufacturing
exports.
Industrial Development
Government support for enterprise and
training is channelled through Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, which both have general functions
in economic development, training and
environmental improvement in the Scottish
lowlands and the Highlands and Islands
respectively. They contract with 22 Local
Enterprise Companies (led by the private
sector), which arrange the provision of training
and business support.
Government measures have helped to
attract firms to Scotland, and investment by
overseas companies has made a significant
contribution to the growth of modern
technologically based industries. In 1995-96
20
SCOTLAND
Locate in Scotland and The Scottish Office
Education and Industry Department helped to
attract 84 inward investment projects to
Scotland, involving planned investment of
nearly £1,000 million. The projects are
expected to create or safeguard over 12,500
jobs.
Services
A marked expansion has occurred in services,
which now employ over 70 per cent of the
workforce. Financial and business services are
of growing importance, and in June 1995,
279,000 people were employed in the sector.
There are four Scottish-based clearing banks
and they have limited rights to issue their own
banknotes.
The Scottish financial sector ranks
third in Europe in terms of the
volume of equity funds under
management and eleventh in the
world. In a range of services, the
sector has been a pioneer, for
example, in the use of cash
dispensers and electronic home
banking. Scotland is a base for a
large number of financial
institutions, including insurance
companies, unit trusts and
investment trusts. Between 1989 and
1994 the total market value of funds
under management by Scottish fund
managers—including life assurance
offices, specialist fund managers,
banks and stockbrokers—rose by
over 97 per cent to £136,000 million.
Tourism and leisure also make a
significant contribution to the economy,
directly providing over 180,000 jobs. In 1994
expenditure by tourists was valued at £2,005
million; there were 10.25 million tourist
trips, including those originating in
Scotland. A strategic plan for the
development of the tourism industry,
launched by the Government in 1994, is
aiming to spread tourism throughout
Scotland and increase tourism in off-peak
periods.
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
About 76 per cent of the land area of Scotland
is devoted to agriculture. Most of this is rough
grazing for cattle and sheep. Scotland’s cattle
industry has a worldwide reputation, both for
the quality of meat and for pedigree breeds.
Arable farms are highly productive, and the
principal crop is barley, which is used in the
making of whisky.
Scotland accounts for over half of Britain’s
forest area and for just under half of timber
production. Forestry is continuing to expand
and many new woodlands are being created,
including native pine forests.
Fishing remains important, particularly in
the north-east and the islands. Scotland
accounts for nearly three-quarters by weight
and over 60 per cent by value of the fish landed
in Britain by British vessels.
Energy and Water Resources
Offshore oil and gas production have made a
significant contribution to the economy.
Recent trends have been the exploitation of
smaller resources and an increase in
production.
Nuclear and hydro-electric generation
supply a higher proportion of energy than in
any other part of Britain. In 1995-96 the
output from Scottish Nuclear’s two nuclear
power stations was equivalent to around 55 per
cent of electricity sales in Scotland. British
Energy—the holding company of Scottish
Nuclear and Nuclear Electric—is one of the
three largest electricity generators in Great
Britain and was privatised in July 1996 (see
p. 273); its head office is in Edinburgh.
With abundant rainfall, there is an
extensive supply of water from upland sources.
As a result of the changes in local government,
three new public water authorities were set up
in April 1996 to take over responsibility for
water and sewerage services from the regional
and islands councils. *
Transport
Communications, both domestic and
international, have improved in many parts of
Scotland. Electrification of the Edinburgh to
London railway was completed in 1991.
21
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The road construction programme includes
completion of the Central Scotland motorway
network and of the upgrading to motorway
standard of the A74 from Carlisle to Glasgow.
A new bridge linking the Scottish mainland to
the island of Skye was opened in October 1995
and is one of the world’s longest span balanced
cantilever bridges.
The Environment
Scotland’s countryside contains a rich variety
of wildlife, with some species not found
elsewhere in Britain. There are 70 National
Nature Reserves and 1,398 Sites of Special
Scientific Interest. Four regional parks and 40
national scenic areas have been designated,
covering 13 per cent of the land surface. Four
of the 11 forest parks in Great Britain are in
Scotland, and a fifth spans the border between
Scotland and England.
Over 100 wildlife sites of European
importance have been proposed for designation
as Special Areas of Conservation under the
European Community (EC) Habitats Directive.
Under the EC’s Wild Birds Directive, more
than 50 sites have been designated as Special
Protection Areas because of their importance to
rare and migratory birds.
Housing and Urban Regeneration
The tenure pattern is somewhat different from
that in the rest of Britain. Home ownership is
increasing but, at 57 per cent, is still lower than
in other areas of Britain. Some 33 per cent of
housing is rented from the public sector,
compared with 20 per cent for Britain as a
whole. Projects to tackle the problems in inner
city areas and some peripheral housing estates
include a series of partnerships between The
Scottish Office and other groups, such as local
communities and the private sector
(see pp. 380-1 ).
Health
There has been a general improvement in the
health of people in Scotland, but for certain
diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease,
the health record is not as good as elsewhere in
Britain. In 1992 the Government issued a policy
statement with a range of initiatives to improve
health in Scotland and meet the targets for the
year 2000 which had been announced in 1991.
Progress is being made towards meeting some of
these targets, with, for example, falls in mortality
from coronary heart disease.
Education
The concept of universal education was
accepted in Scotland as early as the 16th
century. The Scottish education system has a
number of distinctive features, for example, in
examinations (see p. 452). Four of the 13
universities—St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Edinburgh—were established in the 15th
century. Record numbers of students are now
entering higher education.
The Education (Scotland) Act 1996
contains provisions to strengthen the quality of
pre-school education and to set up a new
Scottish Qualifications Authority (which is
intended to improve the educational pathways
between schools, colleges and preparation for
employment). The Act also aims to improve
the operation of school boards and to extend
parental choice on school places.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin, is
spoken by some 70,000 people, many of whom
live in the islands of the Hebrides. The
Government is encouraging people to learn
more about the Gaelic language and culture.
Government support for Gaelic covers three
main areas: education, Gaelic organisations
and television broadcasting.
Many Scots have achieved eminence
in arts and sciences. A major
programme of events during 1996, the
bicentenary of the death of the poet
Robert Burns, has commemorated
his life and work. The programme
took place both in Scotland and
across the world.
The annual Edinburgh International
Festival is one of the world’s leading cultural
22
SCOTLAND
events. Held in August and September, it
brings about £70 million into the Scottish
economy each year. Edinburgh and the
Mayfest international arts festival in Glasgow
are the two largest arts festivals in Britain.
Scotland possesses a number of major
collections of the fine and applied arts. For
example, Glasgow houses the Burrell
Collection and the new Gallery of Modern Art,
which was opened in 1996. A new Museum of
Scotland is being built in Edinburgh to house
the National Museums’ Scottish collection.
Each spring Edinburgh hosts the International
Science Festival, the world’s biggest science
festival in a single city.
The predominant Church of Scotland is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in
form; it is governed by a hierarchy of church
courts, each of which includes lay people.
The sport of golf originated in Scotland,
and there are over 400 golf courses, including
St Andrews, Gleneagles, Turnberry,
Muirfield, Troon and Prestwick, which are
internationally renowned. A wide range of
outdoor activities, such as mountaineering, hill
walking and fishing, are also pursued. Winter
sports are becoming increasingly popular in
the Cairngorm Mountains, Glencoe and a
number of other areas.

Two-thirds of the population of Wales live in the southern valleys and the
lower-lying coastal areas. The chief urban centres are Cardiff (with a
population of 306,500), Swansea and Newport in the south and Wrexham in
the north. However, much of Wales is hilly or mountainous, with about a
quarter of the land being 300 metres (980 ft) or more above sea level. The
highest mountains are in Snowdonia and the tallest peak is Snowdon
(1,085 m, 3,560 ft).
Wales is a principality; Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, was invested by
the Queen with the title of Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969, when
he was 20. The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule in Britain (see
p. 4), Wales remained a Celtic stronghold,
although often during Norman times within
the English sphere of influence. For much of
its early history, it was divided into a number
of separate principalities, and unity was
achieved only sporadically. In 1267 Llywelyn
ap Gruffudd, who had achieved control over a
large portion of Wales, was recognised as
Prince of Wales by the English. However,
following his death in battle in 1282, Edward I
completed a successful campaign to bring
Wales under English rule. The series of great
castles that he had built in north Wales remain
among Britain’s finest historic monuments (see
p. 373). Edward I’s eldest son—later Edward
II—was born at Caernarfon in 1284 and was
given the title Prince of Wales, which
continues to be borne by the eldest son of the
reigning monarch.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
culminated in the unsuccessful rising led by
Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542
united England and Wales administratively,
politically and legally.
Language
At the time of the 1991 census Welsh
speakers made up 19 per cent of the
population. In much of the rural north and
west, Welsh remains the first language of
most of the population. There is some
evidence that the decline in the number of
Welsh speakers is being halted, with greater
24
WALES
numbers of children and young people able
to speak Welsh, and a revival in the largely
anglicised areas of south-east and north-east
Wales.
The Government has reaffirmed its
commitment to enhancing Welsh culture and
developing greater use of the Welsh language.
Bilingual education in schools is encouraged
(see p. 28), and Welsh is now more widely
used for official purposes and in broadcasting.
There are also many more bilingual
publications and most road signs are
bilingual. Expenditure of £6.2 million
directly in support of the language is planned
in 1996-97.
The Welsh Language Act 1993 establishes
the principle that, in the context of public
business and the administration of justice in
Wales, Welsh and English should be treated on
an equal basis. The Act also put the Welsh
Language Board (formerly an advisory body)
on a statutory basis.
The Welsh Language Board aims to
promote and facilitate the use of the
Welsh language. In autumn 1996 the
Board published its strategy for the
future of the Welsh language. Three
main priorities were identified:
• increasing the number of Welsh
speakers;
• providing more opportunities to
use the language; and
• strengthening Welsh as a
community language.
The Board will seek to achieve these
aims in partnership with the main
interested parties in Wales.
Government
The country elects 38 Members of Parliament
(MPs) to the House of Commons. For the last
60 years the industrial communities have
tended to support the Labour Party in
elections, ensuring a Labour majority of seats.
In September 1996 Wales had 27 Labour MPs,
6 Conservative, 4 Plaid Cymru (Welsh
Nationalist) and 1 Liberal Democrat. Special
arrangements exist for the discussion of Welsh
affairs in the parliamentary Welsh Grand
Committee, whose function is to consider
matters relating exclusively to Wales; Bills are
referred to it for consideration as to whether
they should be given a second reading (see
p. 61).
The Secretary of State for Wales, who is a
member of the Cabinet, has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy,
education, welfare services and the provision
of amenities. The headquarters of the
administration is the Welsh Office in
Cardiff; it also has an office in London.
The legal system is identical to that in
England.
Under the Local Government (Wales) Act
1994, local government has been reorganised.
The former two-tier structure of eight county
councils and 37 district councils has been
abolished and succeeded by 22 unitary
authorities. The authorities took up their new
responsibilities in April 1996.
The Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the basis of the Welsh economy.
The dependence on refined fuels and
coalmining has declined considerably,
although steelmaking remains important.
Wales accounts for over a third of Britain’s
steel output. The most notable features
have been expansion in service industries and
the development of a more diverse range
of manufacturing industries, including
many at the forefront of technology.
Some 915 new plants have been created
since 1980, providing around 62,000 new
jobs.
In the service sector the most marked
growth has been in financial and business
services, and leisure services. Annual
earnings from tourism are estimated at about
£1,500 million and the industry employs
directly or indirectly about 100,000 people.
The Wales Tourist Board seeks to develop
tourism in ways which will yield the
optimum economic benefit for the people of
Wales.

Wales is now an important centre for
consumer electronics, information
technology, automotive components,
chemicals and materials, and food
and drink. Around 35,000 people are
employed in the manufacture of
optical and electrical equipment, and
the sector’s output has risen by 44 per
cent since 1990. Wales is responsible
for around 10 per cent of world
production of optical fibres. Over
20,000 people are employed in the
automotive components sector,
whose annual sales are about ^l-JOG
million.
Although south Wales remains the principal
industrial area, new industries and firms have
been introduced in north-east Wales and light
industry attracted to the towns in the rural
areas of mid- and north Wales.
Inward Investment
Wales has been particularly successful in
attracting investment from overseas companies
and from elsewhere in Britain. Through its
International Division, the Welsh
Development Agency (WDA) seeks to attract
investment into Wales and co-ordinates the
approach for responding to the needs of
investors. Since 1983 it has recorded over
1,500 projects, which promise capital
investment of £8,000 million, the creation of
over 87,000 new jobs and safeguarding over
54,000 existing jobs. Overseas-owned
manufacturing companies employ more than
73,000 people. Among the projects in 1995-96
was a £300 million scheme announced by Ford
to expand its engine plant at Bridgend. LG of
26
WALES
Korea has recently announced a £ 1,700 million
project which will create 6,100 new jobs in two
factories—one producing semiconductors and
the other wide-screen television sets and
components. This is the largest single inward
investment project ever into Europe.
Economic Development
The economic programmes of the Welsh
Office are complemented by the work of the
WDA and the Development Board for Rural
Wales, which have wide powers to promote
economic, industrial and environmental
change. In 1996—97 these bodies plan to
undertake programmes involving expenditure
of £130 million and £20 million respectively.
One of the main areas of activity is providing
accommodation for business, increasingly in
partnership with the private sector. The WDA
is also undertaking the largest land reclamation
programme in Europe.
The south Wales valleys are one of the main
areas to have been affected by the decline in
traditional industries. A second five-year
Programme for the Valleys was launched in
1993, with the objective of improving the
economic, social and environmental conditions
in the area. Under the new programme, the
emphasis has moved away from centralised
initiatives towards stronger partnerships
between the Welsh Office, development
agencies, local councils and the private and
voluntary sectors. The Government has set a
target of matching public sector investment in
the area with private sector investment of
£1,000 million by the year 2000. This is in line
with its intention to maximise private sector
investment in support of urban and rural
regeneration. This private finance initiative is
being extended during 1996 to the rest of
Wales.
A development corporation has been set up
to stimulate the regeneration of the Cardiff
Bay area. A new barrage is being built across
the harbour mouth and should be completed in
1998. It is expected that about 25,000 new jobs
will be created in the Cardiff Bay area, 6,000
new homes built, 1 million sq m of business
space created and over £1,175 million of
private sector investment attracted. A key
infrastructure project is the construction of a
landscaped avenue linking the inner harbour
with the city centre and incorporating a light
rail link. A development contract is expected to
be awarded early in 1997, with the intention of
establishing the link in time for the Rugby
World Cup in 1999 (see p. 28).
In March 1996 the Secretary of State for
Wales issued a White Paper designed to
encourage sustainable economic growth and
community development in rural Wales (see
p. 379).
Agriculture and Forestry
Agriculture occupies about 81 per cent of the
land area. The main activities are sheep and
cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy
farming in the lowlands. About 12 per cent of
Wales is covered by woodland.
Transport
Completion of the M4 motorway in the south
and of the conversion to dual carriageway of
the A55 trunk road across the mainland in the
north, both in 1994, have helped the Welsh
economy. Great importance is attached to
further improvements to these routes.
Motorway links to England and the rest of
Europe were considerably improved with the
opening in June 1996 of the second motorway
crossing of the Severn. The bridge, which cost
£300 million, was built and is operated by a
private sector company, Severn River Crossing
pic. New publicly funded motorway links to
the bridge have also been provided.
Passenger traffic at Cardiff International
Airport has increased from 638,000 in 1990-91
to nearly 1.1 million in 1994—95.
The Environment
Wales has a rich and diverse natural heritage,
and the environment in rural Wales is an
important natural asset. About one-quarter of
Wales is designated as a National Park or Area
of Outstanding Natural Beauty (see p. 368).
As well as three National Parks—Snowdonia,
the Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire
Coast—and five Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty, there are two national trails, 31
27
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
country parks and large stretches of heritage
coast. There are 56 National Nature Reserves
and over 900 Sites of Special Scientific
Interest.
In February 1996 the tanker Sea Empress
ran aground off Milford Haven
(Pembrokeshire), resulting in one of Britain’s
largest oil spills. However, a major clean-up
operation was immediately undertaken to
minimise the damage, an operation which was
scheduled to continue for some time. A
thorough investigation into the cause of the
incident is being conducted, and a committee
has been established to assess the
environmental impact.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature is one of the oldest in Europe.
The Welsh people have strong musical
traditions and Wales is well known for its
choral singing, while the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation. Special
festivals, known as eisteddfodau, encourage
Welsh literature and music. The largest is the
annual Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting
of competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Artists from all over
the world come to the town of Llangollen for
the annual International Musical Eisteddfod.
New galleries and a permanent Evolution of
Wales exhibition were opened at the National
Museum of Wales in Cardiff in 1993. A third
building at the National Library of Wales,
costing some £11 million, was opened by the
Queen in May 1996.
There is no established church, the
Anglican church in Wales having been
disestablished in 1920 following decades of
pressure from adherents of the Methodist and
Baptist churches. Methodism in particular
spread rapidly in Wales in the 18th century,
assuming the nature of a popular movement
among Welsh speakers and finding strong
support later in industrial communities.
An active local press includes a number of
Welsh language publications. The fourth
television channel, Sianel Pedwar Cymru
(S4C), broadcasts most of its programmes in
Welsh during peak viewing hours and is
required to see that a significant proportion of
programmes are in Welsh.
Although the National Curriculum (see
p. 451) applies in both England and Wales,
there are a number of distinct features to
education in Wales. The content of several
subjects is different in order to reflect the
distinctive history, geography and cultural
development of Wales. Welsh is also
taught—as a first or second language—to most
pupils between the ages of 5 and 16. In
addition, subjects are taught in Welsh in about
500 schools, in both the primary and secondary
sectors. Most of these are in the traditionally
Welsh-speaking, largely rural areas, but there
are also some in the anglicised, mainly
industrial areas. There are 14 higher education
institutions, of which eight form the collegiate
University of Wales (founded in 1893), and 26
further education colleges.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. A new national rugby stadium
is to be built in Cardiff and will cost some
£114 million, of which £46 million will be
provided by the Millennium Commission (see
p. 43). It is due to open early in 1999 and will
host the final of the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

Among the main social changes during the second half of the 20th century are
longer life expectancy and a lower birth rate, reflected in a growing proportion
of elderly people; a higher divorce rate; wider educational opportunities;
technological progress and a higher standard of living.
POPULATION
According to mid-1994 estimates, Britain’s
population is 58.4 million, the 17th largest in
the world. Statistics are derived from the
census (taken every ten years), with allowance
made for subsequent births and deaths
(obtained from compulsory registration), and
migration.
The population has been growing slowly
since the early 1980s, thanks to increased
longevity. On mid-1994-based projections, the
population in Britain is forecast to rise to 59.4
million in 2001 and 60.5 million in 2011.
However, the population is likely to start
falling again from about 2025, owing to low
birth rates (see below) and the post-war ‘baby
boom’ generation dying out.
Birth Rates
In 1995 there were 732,000 live births in
Britain, compared with 751,000 in 1994. The
total period fertility rate (an indication of
average family size) remains below 2.1, the
level leading to the long-term replacement of
the population, although it is projected that it
will increase from 1.75 in 1995 to 1.8 for
women born in or after 1980.
Contributory factors to the relatively low
birth rate in recent years (12.6 live births per
1,000 population in 1995) include:
• the trends towards later marriage and
towards postponing having children,
which have led to an increase in the
average age of women giving birth—28.5
years in England and Wales in 1995,
compared with 26.8 in 1981;
• a preference for smaller families than in
the past, which has led to a significant
decline in the proportion of families with
four or more children;1 and
• more widespread and effective
contraception, making it easier to plan
families, and the greater prevalence of
voluntary sterilisation for both men and
women.
'In 1994—95, 20 per cent of households in Great Britain
consisted of a married couple with one or two dependent
children, compared with 5 per cent of households
consisting of a married couple with three or more
dependent children.
29
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There were 178,300 legal abortions in Great
Britain in 1994, down 6.5 per cent on 1991.
Mortality
At birth the expectation of life for a man is
about 73 years and for a woman 79 years,
compared with 49 years for men and 52 years
for women in 1901.
There were 626,000 deaths in 1995, a death
rate of 11.0 per 1,000 population. There has
been a decline in mortality at most ages,
particularly among children. The infant
mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year
old per 1,000 live births) was 6.2 in 1995;
neonatal mortality (deaths of infants under
four weeks old per 1,000 live births) was 4.2;
and maternal mortality is about 0.07 per 1,000
total births. The decline in the mortality rate
reflects better nutrition, rising standards of
living, the advance of medical science, the
increased availability of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working
conditions, education in personal hygiene and
the smaller size of families.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, and
mortality from heart disease in Great Britain
remains high compared with that of other
developed countries. The next largest cause of
death is cancer, which is responsible for nearly
one-quarter of deaths.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. However, there has been a significant
decline in the prevalence of smoking, with 28
per cent of adult males and 26 per cent of
adult females smoking cigarettes in 1994,
compared with 52 and 41 per cent
respectively in 1972.
Between 1990 and 1992 the Government set
out strategies for continuing the overall
improvement in health, emphasising disease
prevention and health promotion (see p. 399).
A number of government priorities, aimed at
supporting the overall goals of improving the
country’s health and providing high-quality
care for those who need it, have been listed.
The Government is also pursuing a
comprehensive strategy against drug misuse in
Britain. Initiatives are aimed at reducing both
the supply of, and demand for, drugs. From
1991 onwards, annual surveys have been
carried out in England to monitor trends in
health.
Marriage and Divorce
Britain has one of the highest marriage and
divorce rates in the European Union. In 1993
there were 332,600 marriages in Britain, of
which 38.7 per cent were remarriages of one or
both parties. Some 25.1 per cent of marriages
were remarriages where one or both parties
had been divorced. Of the male population
aged 16 or over in Great Britain in 1994, 61
per cent were married, 24 per cent single, 7 per
cent cohabiting, 4 per cent widowed, 4 per
cent divorced and 1 per cent separated. Among
women, 54 per cent were married, 18 per cent
single, 13 per cent widowed, 6 per cent
cohabiting, 6 per cent divorced and 2 per cent
separated. The average age for first marriages
in England and Wales is now about 28.2 for
men and 26.2 for women.
In 1995 there were 13.1 divorces for every
1,000 married couples in England and Wales.
The rates for Scotland and Northern Ireland
are lower than that for England and Wales. In
1995 167,748 divorces were granted in Britain.
The average age of people at the time of
divorce in England and Wales is now about
39.6 for men and 37.0 for women.
Under the Family Law, couples
seeking to divorce will have to go
through a period of at least one year
for reflection and consideration. This
would allow time for conciliation, if
that is possible, and so, it is hoped,
keep a larger number of marriages
intact of those that are capable of
being saved.
Another feature, common to many other
Western European countries, has been an
increase in cohabitation, and 21 per cent of
non-married men aged 16—59 in Great Britain
were cohabiting in 1994. Between 1979 and
1994 the proportion of non-married women
aged 18-49 who were cohabiting rose from 11
to 23 per cent. Cohabitation is particularly
30
thf: social framework
high (28 per cent) among divorced women, but
recently the largest increase has been for single
women.
Age and Sex Structure
The most significant changes in the age
structure of the population have been the
growing numbers of elderly people and the
decline in the proportion of young people.
The proportion of young people aged under
15 fell from 24.1 per cent of the population
in 1971 to 9.4 per cent in 1995. During the
period 1971-94 the proportion of elderly
people (those aged 65 and over) increased
from 13.2 to 15.7 per cent, while 18.2 per
cent of the population were over the normal
retirement ages (65 for men and 60 for
women) in 1994, compared with 16.3 per
cent in 1971.
There is a ratio of about 104 females to
every 100 males in the population as a whole.
There are about 3 per cent more male than
female births every year. However, because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, there is
a turning-point, at about 50 years of age,
beyond which the number of women exceeds
the number of men.
Distribution of Population
The population density is about 242
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above the
EU average of about 153 per sq km. Of the
four lands, England is the most densely
populated, with 375 people per sq km.
Scotland is the least densely populated, with
67 people per sq km. Wales and Northern
Ireland have 140 and 122 people per sq km
respectively.
Since the 19th century there has been a
trend, especially in London, for people to
move away from congested urban centres into
the suburbs. Between the 1981 and 1991
censuses, all metropolitan counties (with the
exception of West Yorkshire) experienced
small decreases in population, the largest being
in Merseyside (5 per cent). There has also
been a geographical redistribution of the
population, away from Scotland and the
northern regions of England. The regions with
the highest rates of increase in population
between 1981 and 1991 were East Anglia (10
per cent) and the South West (8 per cent).
Retirement migration is also a feature of
population movement, the main recipient areas
being the south coast of England and East
Anglia.
Migration
From 1989 to 1994 some 1.1 million people left
Britain (excluding the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man) to live abroad. About 1.2 million
came from overseas to live in Britain, so that
net immigration increased the population by
about 94,000. These figures exclude migration
to and from the Irish Republic, and are also
likely to exclude people admitted as visitors
who were subsequently granted an extension of
stay for a year or more.
In 1994 the total inflow of people intending
to stay in Britain for one year or more was
253,000, some 18 per cent more than in 1993.
The outflow of people leaving to live abroad, at
191,000, was 13 per cent lower than in 1993.
Of the 191,000 departing residents in 1994:
• 29 per cent left for EU countries;
• 22 per cent for Australia, Canada, New
Zealand or South Africa;
• 15 per cent for other Commonwealth
countries;
• 13 per cent for the United States;
• 6 per cent for the Middle East; and
• 15 per cent for other countries.
Of the 253,000 new residents in 1994:
• 31 per cent came from EU countries;
• 16 per cent came from Australia, Canada,
New Zealand or South Africa;
• 21 per cent from other Commonwealth
countries;
• 12 per cent from the United States;
• 4 per cent from the Middle East; and
• 16 per cent from other countries.
Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with Britain;
31
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (see p. 123); and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of the
other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in Britain if his or her
mother or father is a British citizen or is settled
in Britain. A child adopted in Britain by a
British citizen is also a British citizen. A child
born abroad to a British citizen born, adopted,
naturalised or registered in Britain is generally
a British citizen by descent. The Act
safeguards the citizenship of a child born
abroad to a British citizen in Crown service,
certain related services, or in service under a
European Union institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in Britain who do
not automatically acquire such citizenship
at birth, or who have been born abroad to
a parent who is a citizen by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in Britain, except for people
from Gibraltar, who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required to
have a sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh
or Scottish Gaelic; they must also intend to
have their main home in Britain or be
employed by the Crown, by an international
organisation of which Britain is a member, or
by a company or association established in
Britain.
Special arrangements covering the status of
British Dependent Territories citizens
connected with Hong Kong when the territory
returns to the People’s Republic of China in
1997 are made by the Hong Kong (British
Nationality) Order 1986. Under this, such
citizens are entitled, before 1997, to acquire a
status known as British National (Overseas)
and to hold a passport in that status. In
addition, the British Nationality (Hong Kong)
Act 1990 made provision for the registration as
British citizens before 30 June 1997 of up to
50,000 people who are able to meet certain
criteria and who are recommended by the
Governor, together with their spouses and
children who are still minors. By May 1996
almost all of these places had been filled.
In 1995, 40,500 people were granted British
citizenship, in addition to about 26,000 people
registered that year under the British
Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990.
Immigration

THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Rules made under it. The Rules set out the
requirements to be met by those who are
subject to immigration control and seek entry
to or leave to remain in Britain. New
Immigration Rules came into effect in 1994.
British citizens and those Commonwealth
citizens who had the right of abode before
January 1983 maintain the right of abode and
are not subject to immigration control.
Under the Immigration Rules nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial entities
must obtain a visa before they can enter
Britain. Other nationals subject to immigration
control require entry clearance when coming
to work or settle in Britain. Visas and other
entry clearances are normally obtained from
the nearest or other specified British
diplomatic post in a person’s home country.
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU member states plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may
work in Britain without restriction. Provided
that they are working or able to support
themselves financially, EEA nationals have a
right to reside in Britain.
Britain has traditionally granted asylum to
those fleeing persecution and respects its
obligations under the United Nations
Convention and Protocol relating to the Status
of Refugees. These provide that refugees
lawfully resident should enjoy treatment as
least as favourable as that accorded to other
foreign nationals. However, in recent years
there has been a significant change in both the
numbers and the motivation of those seeking
asylum in Britain, with many asylum seekers
motivated by economic rather than political
factors. Between 1984 and 1995 the number of
asylum seekers rose from 4,000 to 55,000
(including dependants); of these only 6 per
cent were accepted as being genuine refugees.
In common with other European countries,
Britain has reviewed its procedures in order to
curb abuse of the system while safeguarding
the interests of genuine refugees. However, the
upward trend of asylum applications has risen
sharply during the last two years and further
measures to discourage abuse have now been
enacted by Parliament. The Asylum and
Immigration Act 1996 gives the Government,
among other things, the power to designate
selected countries of origin as not giving rise to
serious risk of persecution. It makes appeals
against return to EU, and certain other, safe
third countries exercisable only after removal
from Britain.
In 1995 9.6 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals (excluding EEA
nationals) were admitted to Britain. About
55,000 people were accepted for settlement.
LANGUAGE
English is the main language spoken in Britain,
and is also one of the most widely used in the
world.2 Recent estimates suggest that 310
million people speak it as their first language,
with a similar number speaking it as a second
language. It is an official language in a large
number of overseas countries, and is widely
used internationally as the main language for
purposes such as air traffic control and
academic gatherings.
Modern English derives primarily from one
of the dialects of Anglo-Saxon. However, it has
been very greatly influenced by other
languages, particularly, following the Norman
conquest, by French. French was the language
of the nobility and the law courts for many
years after 1066. The re-emergence of English
as the universal language of England was
signified by such events as the Statute of
Pleadings in 1362, which laid down that
English was to be used in court. The 14th
century also saw the first major English
literature since Anglo-Saxon days, with the
writing of works such as Piers Plowman by
William Langland and The Canterbury Tales by
Geoffrey Chaucer. However, there remained
great regional variations in the language, and
spellings were not always standardised.
Following the introduction of the printing
press to England by William Caxton in the late
15th century, there was a considerable
flowering of English literature in the 16th and
early 17th centuries. Writers such as William
Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser and
Christopher Marlowe produced work that is
still famous today. Cranmer’s prayerbook and
the Authorised (‘King James’) Version of the

Bible, which have had a profound effect on
literature down to modern times, also date
from this period. About this time, too,
translations of Latin, Italian and other
European works into English vastly expanded
the English language. The work of early
lexicographers, of whom the most famous was
Samuel Johnson (1709-84), led to greater
standardisation in matters such as spelling.
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL
MINORITIES
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in Britain, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.
The Irish have long formed a large section
of the population. Jewish refugees who came to
Britain towards the end of the 19th century
and in the 1930s were followed by other
European refugees after 1945. Substantial
immigration from the Caribbean and the
South Asian sub-continent dates principally
from the 1950s and 1960s, while many people
of Asian descent moved to this country from
eastern Africa. In recent years, the number of
people coming from the South Asian
sub-continent has remained roughly stable, but
there has been a rise in immigration from some
African countries, such as Ghana, Nigeria and
South Africa (see Table 6.1).
The 1991 census included for the first time
a question on ethnic grouping. This found that
94.5 per cent of the population belonged to the
‘White’ group, while just over 3 million people
(5.5 per cent) described themselves as
belonging to another ethnic group (see Table
6.2).
Overall, just under half of the ethnic
minority population were born in Britain. A
higher proportion is under 16 than for the
White group (33 per cent and 19 per cent
respectively), but a much lower proportion is
over pensionable age (3 per cent and about 17
per cent respectively).
Members of ethnic minority groups were
heavily concentrated in industrial and urban
areas, and over half lived in the South East,
especially in London. The highest proportion
was in the London borough of Brent: nearly 45
per cent of the population. Ethnic minority
groups also accounted for over a third of the
population in the London boroughs of
Newham, Tower Hamlets and Hackney.
Outside London the main concentrations were
in Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford, the
West Midlands and the Pennine conurbation.
Regional concentrations varied among the
ethnic groups. About three-fifths (60 per cent)
of people from black ethnic groups lived in
London, compared with about two-fifths (41
per cent) of Indians and just under one fifth
(18 per cent) of Pakistanis, who were
concentrated in other metropolitan areas such
as the West Midlands and West Yorkshire.
According to the Labour Force Survey,
economic activity rates for men of working age
in Great Britain tend to be similar to those for
the White groups. In summer 1995 they were
81.3 per cent for the Black group, 82.6 per cent
for the Indian group, 70.5 per cent for the

greater for women: 67.8 per cent of those from
the Black ethnic group were economically
active, compared with 65 per cent in the
Indian group, 72.8 per cent in the White group
and only 25.4 per cent in the Pakistani/
Bangladeshi group.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has been
made over the last 20 years in tackling racial
disadvantage in Britain.
Many individuals have achieved
distinction in their careers and in public life,
and the proportion of ethnic minority
members occupying professional and
managerial positions is increasing. There are
at present six ethnic minority Members of
Parliament, and the number of ethnic
minority councillors in local government is
growing. There has also been an expansion of
commercial enterprise, and numerous
self-help projects in ethnic minority
communities have been established. Black
competitors have represented Britain in a
range of sporting activities (such as athletics,
cricket and football), and ethnic minority
talents in the arts and in entertainment have
increasingly been recognised.
The principal means of combating
disadvantage is through the economic,
environmental, educational and health
programmes of central government and local
authorities. There are also special allocations,
mainly through Home Office and Department
of the Environment grants, which channel
extra resources into projects of specific benefit
to ethnic minorities. These include, for
example, the provision of specialist teachers
for children needing English language tuition.
Cultural and recreational schemes and the
health and personal social services also take
account of the particular needs of ethnic
minorities.
The Government is promoting equal
opportunities for ethnic minorities through
training programmes, including greater
provision for unemployed people who need
training in English as a second language.
Race Relations Legislation
The Race Relations Act 1976, which applies to
England, Scotland and Wales, strengthened
previous legislation passed in the 1960s. It
makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national
origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, in housing, in
education and in advertising. The 1976 Act
also gave complainants direct access to civil
courts and, for employment complaints, to
industrial tribunals. It is a criminal offence to
incite racial hatred under the provisions of the
Public Order Act 1986.
Legislation against racial discrimination in
employment and in the provision of goods and
services is to be introduced for Northern
Ireland in late 1996.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important educational role and has issued
codes of practice in employment, education,
health care, maternity services and housing. It
also provides advice to the general public about
the Race Relations Act and may help
individuals with their complaints about racial
discrimination. In 1995 the Commission
registered 1,682 applications for assistance and
successfully handled 155 litigation cases. It can
also undertake or fund research.
The Commission supports the work of 88
racial equality councils. These are autonomous
voluntary bodies set up in most areas with a
significant ethnic minority population to
promote equality of opportunity and good
relations at the local level. The Commission
helps pay the salaries of officers employed by
the racial equality councils, most of whom also
receive funds from their local authorities. It
also gives grants to ethnic minority self-help
groups and to other projects run by or for the
benefit of the minority communities.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PATTERN
Marked improvements in the standard of
living have taken place during the 20th
century. According to a United Nations report
on human development published in 1994,
Britain ranked tenth out of 173 countries on a
human development index that combines life
expectancy, education levels and basic
purchasing power.
Britain has also performed well
economically. Growth between 1980 and 1990
was higher than in all other major EU
countries except Spain. Following the
recession of the early 1990s, Britain was one of
the first countries to experience recovery.
Gross domestic product in Britain grew by 2.5
per cent in 1995. Inflation has recently been
around 3 per cent a year, with the underlying
level of inflation the lowest for almost 50 years.
Income and Wealth
Wages and salaries remain the main source of
household income for most people, although
the proportion they contribute of household
income (64 per cent in 1994-95, compared
with 68 per cent in 1971) has been declining.
Sources which have become more important
include private pensions and annuities (6.4 per
cent, up from 2.2 per cent in 1965) as the
number of people who have made such
provision has grown. Disposable income in
1995 was 32 per cent higher than in 1985 after
allowing for inflation.
The proportion of household income that is
paid in income tax and National Insurance
contributions by a two-children family with a
father on average earnings was 21.7 per cent in
1994-95. This figure has not changed
significantly in recent years. The top 20 per cent
of households by income received 44 per cent of
income in 1994—95. Wealth is less evenly
distributed, with the richest 10 per cent of the
population having 48 per cent of marketable
wealth in 1993. The inclusion of‘non-
marketable’ wealth, such as rights in
occupational and state pension schemes, reduces
this share substantially, to 33 per cent. Since the
mid-1970s there has been little change in the
distribution of marketable wealth.
A large proportion of personal wealth—28
per cent in 1994 —is in dwellings, down quite
sharply from the level of immediately
preceding years as house prices have fallen.
The proportion of net wealth held in shares
declined up to 1984, but has since increased.
The Government’s privatisation programme
has contributed to the growth in share
ownership. In 1993 about 10 million people—
22 per cent of the adult population in Great
Britain—owned shares, compared with 7 per
cent in 1979.
Eating and Drinking Habits
The general level of nutrition remains high.
There has been a significant shift in eating
patterns over the last decade, reflecting greater
emphasis on health, frozen and convenience
foods. Changes in household consumption of
selected foods between 1985 and 1995 are
shown in the diagram on p.38. Consumption of
several items, such as packet sugar, eggs, fresh
potatoes and fresh green vegetables, has
declined substantially. Other changes include:
• a long-term decline in consumption of
beef, lamb and pork—this has been partly
offset by a continuing increase in poultry
consumption, which has been at or close
to record levels in recent years;
• an increase in purchases of semi-skimmed
milk, with skimmed milk now constituting
more than half of the total household
consumption of liquid milk;
• a decline in the total consumption of
cooking and spreading fats, with large falls
in butter and lard usage being partly offset
by rapid rises in the consumption of
vegetable and salad oils and reduced-fat
spreads;
• an increase in the consumption of rice and
pasta, which may be partly responsible for
the decline in the consumption of fresh
potatoes;
• a trend away from consumption of some
fresh green vegetables such as cabbages,
peas and beans towards leafy salads and
cauliflowers;
• a large increase in purchases of fruit juice;

Percentage of households with:
• a switch in fish consumption away from
fresh white fish towards fat fish, canned
fish and shellfish.
Average mineral and nutrient intakes are
generally above the daily amounts
recommended by the Department of Health.
There has been a steady fall in the proportion
of energy derived from fat. There is some
evidence that health considerations influence
food consumption, for example, the move
away from whole milk and in the growth in low
fat spread consumption. The Government
encourages the widest availability of
wholesome food, while giving high priority to
consumer safety.
There has been an increase in the number
of meals eaten away from home, for example,
in restaurants or at work, and a growth in the
consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and ‘fast
food’ shops.
There has been little change in alcohol
consumption in recent years. Beer is the most
popular drink among male drinkers, whose
overall consumption is significantly higher
than that of women. Lager is now estimated to
account for over half of all beer sales. The
largest consumers of alcohol are those aged 18
to 24, with consumption generally declining
with age. Consumption of table wine has
grown, although there has been little change in
the consumption of higher strength wines such
as sherry and port.
A high proportion of beer is drunk in public
houses (‘pubs’), traditional social centres for
many people, and in clubs. The Licensing Act
1988 relaxed restrictions on the opening hours
of public houses, but this has not resulted in a
significant increase in alcohol consumption.
There are signs that they are becoming more
popular with families: more meals are being
served and the consumption of non-alcoholic
drinks is increasing. Under the Deregulation
and Contracting Out Act 1994, pubs can now
apply for a children’s certificate. This allows

children under 14 into designated areas if
accompanied by an adult.
Households
The average size of households in Great
Britain has fallen from over four people in
1911 to three in 1961 and 2.4 in 1994. The
fall reflects a greater number of people living
on their own (12 per cent of adults in 1994)
or in one-parent families, the increasing
number of old people (more of whom are
living alone) and the preference for smaller
families.
A large proportion of households—67 per
cent—own their own homes. Owner-
occupation is higher for married couples than
for single, divorced or widowed household
heads. The number of owner-occupied
dwellings rose from over 4 million in 1951 to
16 million at the end of 1995. Four-fifths of
British households live in houses rather than
flats.
Transport and the Environment
An important influence on the planning of
housing and services has been the growth of

THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
car ownership; in 1994-95, 69 per cent of
households had the use of at least one car or
van, including 24 per cent with the use of two
or more. Greater access to motorised transport
and the construction of a network of modern
trunk roads and motorways have resulted in a
considerable increase in personal mobility and
changed leisure patterns. Most detached or
semi-detached houses in new suburban estates
have garages. Many out-of-town shopping
centres, often including large supermarkets
and do-it-yourself stores, have been built with
the motorist in mind.
Cars, taxis and motor cycles accounted for
87 per cent of all passenger transport in Great
Britain in 1994, compared with 57 per cent in
1961. To relieve road congestion, the
Government regards carefully targeted
improvements to the road system as essential.
The Government is also seeking to use the
planning system (see p. 381) to reduce people’s
need to travel without inhibiting their freedom
to do so. A key part of this, especially in urban
areas, will involve the promotion of public
transport and cycling (see pp. 306-7). To help
meet the British target for reducing carbon
dioxide emissions (see p. 359), it is increasing
fuel duty by 5 per cent a year in real terms.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the 20th century.
These changes are due partly to women
obtaining many political and legal rights
previously open only to men. The growth of
part-time and flexible working patterns has
allowed more women to combine raising a
family with paid employment. Women now
make up nearly 46 per cent of the workforce in
employment, with about 800,000 running their
own businesses.
Responsibility for co-ordinating
government policy on women’s issues lies with
a Cabinet Sub-committee for Women’s Issues.
The Women’s National Commission, an
official advisory committee, puts forward the
views of women to the Government and other
public bodies. About 50 of the main national
women’s organisations are represented on the
Commission.
Britain participated fully in the
United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women, held in
Beijing in September 1995. The
Conference adopted a ‘Global
Platform for Action’ on a broad range
of issues, such as the family,
childbearing, inheritance rights, and
women in power. The Government
has announced plans to implement
the Platform in Britain.
‘Fair Play for Women’ was introduced in
England in 1994 as a joint initiative between
the Government and the Equal Opportunities
Commission (see below) and was based on a
scheme in operation in Wales. During 1996 the
initiative was extended to Scotland and
Northern Ireland. It aims to help women
realise their full capabilities, both in the
community and at work.
The Government supports ‘Opportunity
2000’, an employer-led initiative to increase
the participation of women in the workforce.
Membership stands at over 300 employers,
with organisations employing about a quarter
of the workforce being committed to the
campaign. Many member organisations are
reinforcing their equal opportunities policies
and practices, such as by offering job share
arrangements and flexible working hours.
Within the civil service, the proportion of
posts at the top three grades filled by women
rose from 5 per cent in 1984 to 11 per cent at
the end of 1995. In 1991 the Government
launched an initiative to increase the
proportion of public appointments held by
women. The proportion has subsequently
risen from 23 to 30 per cent. In June 1996
there were 63 women MPs, compared with 19
in 1979.
In 1993 the Government introduced the
Out of School Childcare Initiative to offer
parents with children of school age the chance
to participate more fully in the labour market.
Around 52,000 childcare places in Great
Britain have been created. A report published
in January 1996 found that this had had a
positive effect on the labour market, with
significant benefits in particular for lone
39
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
parents. Funding is being provided to create
an additional 18,000 places. In Northern
Ireland a similar initiative was launched in
February 1996, to establish 3,000 childcare
places.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men and women
unlawful, with certain limited exceptions, in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services. Discriminatory job recruitment
advertisements are unlawful. Complaints of
discrimination concerning employment are
dealt with by industrial tribunals; other
complaints are taken before county courts in
England and Wales or the Sheriff Court in
Scotland. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, as
amended in 1984, women in Great Britain are
entitled to equal pay with men when doing
work that is the same or broadly similar, or
work which is rated as equivalent or work
which is of equal value. Parallel legislation on
sex discrimination and equal pay is in
operation in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC), an independent statutory body, has the
duties of working towards the elimination of
sex discrimination and promoting equality of
opportunity. The EOC may advise people of
their rights under the Acts and may give
assistance to help individuals conduct a case. It
is empowered to carry out formal
investigations and issue notices requiring
discriminatory practices to stop. The EOC
runs an ‘Equality Exchange’, with 500
members, which enables employers to
exchange information on good practice.
The Voluntary Sector
There is a long tradition in Britain of voluntary
service to the community. There are hundreds
of thousands of voluntary organisations, ranging
from national bodies to small local groups. One
area of rapid expansion in the last 20 years or so
has been ‘self-help’ groups. Examples include
bodies which provide playgroups for pre-school
children, or help their members to cope with a
particular disability.
Voluntary organisations may be staffed by
professional workers, but most rely on the efforts
of volunteers at some level. It has been estimated
that up to half of all adults take part in some form
of organised voluntary work in the course of a
year. Many volunteers are involved in work
which improves the quality of life in their local
communities or, more widely, give their time to
help organise events or groups in areas as diverse
as social welfare, education, sport, heritage and
the arts. A very large number of volunteers are
involved in activities to protect or improve the
environment, working, for example, for the
National Trust, which has over 2 million
members (see p. 373). The Government greatly
values the voluntary sector’s contribution to
society and, as a result, is keen to encourage
productive partnerships between the statutory
and voluntary sectors. For example, voluntary
organisations are important providers of
government-supported employment and training
services for unemployed people.
'Make a Difference ’ Initiative
The Voluntary and Community Division
within the Department of National Heritage3
co-ordinates government policy towards the
voluntary sector throughout Britain. It also
aims to support a healthy and cost-effective
voluntary sector and to promote volunteering
throughout the community. Its ‘Make a
Difference’ initiative, launched in 1994, brings
together the business, voluntary and public
sectors to promote volunteering. As one aspect
of the initiative, a nationwide telephone
helpline was set up in 1995. This aims to
provide callers throughout Britain with
information on how to get involved with local
voluntary initiatives.
A national strategy on volunteering was
published in 1995 (see ‘Further Reading’). The
Government’s response includes:
• a pledge that by the end of 1997 there will
be volunteering opportunities for all 15- to
25-year-olds who wish to volunteer;
‘in May 1996 responsibility for the voluntary sector was
transferred from the Home Office to the Department of
National Heritage.
40
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
• completing and strengthening the network
of volunteer bureaux to provide a focus
for volunteering in every locality; and
• in partnership with the brewing company
Whitbread, funding a nationwide Make a
Difference Award to recognise
outstanding contributions by voluntary
organisations.
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including:
• contributions from individuals, businesses
and trusts;
• central and local government grants;
• earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
• fees from central and local government for
those services which are provided on a
contractual basis.
In 1994-95 direct grants to voluntary
organisations from government amounted to
£595 million.
Tax changes in recent budgets have helped
the voluntary sector secure more funds from
industry and individuals. The Gift Aid scheme
provides tax relief on single cash donations of
at least £250. By March 1996 charities had
received donations of more than £1,336
million under the scheme and had claimed tax
repayments of £443 million on them. Under
the Payroll Giving scheme, employees can also
make tax-free donations to charity from their
earnings. The scheme provides tax relief on
donations of up to £1,200 a year.
Charities
In England and Wales over 181,000 charities
are registered with the Charity Commission.
Their combined annual turnover is around
£11,500 million. The Commission also gives
advice to trustees of charities on their
administration. Organisations may qualify for
charitable status if they are established for
exclusively charitable purposes such as the
relief of poverty, the advancement of education
or religion, or the promotion of certain other
purposes of public benefit. These may include
good community relations, the prevention of
racial discrimination, the protection of health
and the promotion of equal opportunity. The
Charity Commission also has a statutory
responsibility to ensure that charities make
effective use of their resources.
The Charities Acts 1992 and 1993
strengthened the Commissioners’ power to

example, new measures to protect charities and
donors from bogus fund-raisers came into
force in 1995, while measures aimed at
increasing the accountability of charities came
into force in March 1996.
The National Lottery Charities
Board distributes the portion of the
proceeds of the National Lottery
allocated to charities. By August 1996
the Board had made over 4,700 grants
totalling almost £320 million.
Recipients ranged from large
organisations such as Age Concern
and Barnardo’s to smaller local
organisations such as the Ystrad
Rhondda Boys Club and the Omagh
and District Talking Newspaper.
The Charities Aid Foundation, an
independent body, is one of the main
organisations that aid the flow of funds to
charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Umbrella Organisations
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is one of the main co-ordinating
bodies in England, providing close links between
voluntary organisations, government
departments, local authorities, the European
Commission and the private sector; around 650
national voluntary organisations are members. It
also protects the interests and independence of
voluntary agencies, and provides them with
advice, information and other services. Councils
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
perform similar functions. The National
Association of Councils for Voluntary Service is
another umbrella organisation providing
resources, with over 230 local councils for
voluntary service throughout England. Their
role is to encourage the development of local
voluntary action, mainly in urban areas.
Leisure Trends
About 14 per cent of total household
expenditure went on leisure goods and services
in 1993. The most common leisure activities
are home-based, or social, such as visiting
relatives or friends. Television viewing is by
far the most popular leisure pastime, and
nearly all households have a television set,
almost all of these having a colour set. Average
viewing time is nearly 27 hours a week.
Around 76 per cent of households now have at
least one video recorder, compared with 30 per
cent in 1985.
Listening to radio has been increasing, and
averages over 10 hours a week. Purchases of
compact discs have risen very rapidly, and
since 1992 have exceeded the sales of audio
cassettes. The proportion of households with a
compact disc player has grown considerably,
from 15 per cent in 1989 to 46 per cent in
1994-95.
Other popular pursuits include: reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements,
gardening and going out for a meal, for a
drink or to the cinema. About half of
households have a pet, the most common
being dogs and cats, with roughly 7 million
of each in Britain.
National Lottery
Launched in November 1994, the National
Lottery has made a major impact in Britain
and has grown to become the biggest lottery in
the world. About 90 per cent of adults have
participated and around 30 million regularly
buy tickets. Lottery ticket sales amounted to
nearly £5,000 million in 1995. There is a draw
each week, with an average weekly jackpot
fund of £10 million, while there are also
‘instant’ scratchcards. About £68 million is
spent on the weekly draw, although this has
exceeded £100 million when the jackpot has
not been won and has been carried forward to
the next week. Weekly sales o£ scratchcards are
around £20 million.
Britain’s National Lottery is the only one in
Europe to involve private enterprise in its
operation. Camelot Group pic, a private sector
company, was awarded the contract to run the
Lottery. The Lottery is regulated by the
Director General of the National Lottery, who
heads the Office of the National Lottery
(‘Oflot’).
The Lottery has already raised large

sums—£2,000 million by June 1996—for good
causes, which receive 28 per cent of net
proceeds. This is one of the highest
proportions allocated to good causes by any
national lottery. The remainder is divided
between prizes (50 per cent), tax (12 per cent),
retailers’ commission (5 per cent) and
operating costs and profit (5 per cent).
In the first year of lottery awards, over
5,000 projects benefited from awards totalling
over £1,200 million. The awards are
distributed between five good causes: sport,
charities, the arts, heritage and projects to
mark the millennium. Each receives one-fifth
of the money generated for good causes. The
amount distributed by each awarding body in
1995-96 is shown in Table 6.4.
A very wide range of projects are receiving
funding through lottery awards. Some are
large schemes, notably some of those
supported by the Millennium Commission,
such as £50 million for a new environmental
Earth Centre at Conisbrough (South
Yorkshire), £40 million for the redevelopment
of Portsmouth Harbour and £22 million for a
new botanic garden at Middleton. However,
about 77 per cent of awards are for less than
£100,000. Awards made in the first year
include, for example:
• 55 awards, worth £73 million, to
museums;
• 33 awards, valued at £23 million, for
environmental projects;
• 62 awards, worth £3.5 million, to amateur
dramatics societies; and
• 47 awards, valued at £2.7 million, to
churches.
In all, 247 awards went to youth projects
and 107 to projects to help people with
disabilities, while nearly 2,500 awards were
made to charities working with disadvantaged
people.
In April 1996 the Government announced
changes to the rules on the distribution of
lottery funds. As well as investment in
buildings and equipment, lottery funds can
now be spent on projects to develop people’s
talents and potential. New areas include:
• ‘talent funds’ to provide individual
support to talented athletes and sports
people, and to develop the creative

abilities of individual performers and
young artists;
• greater access to the arts, such as through
supporting touring companies and
subsidised ticket schemes for schools and
community groups; and
• the restoration and renovation of
run-down buildings of historical
significance by local building preservation
trusts.
Holidays
In 1995, 61 per cent of the adult population
took at least one long holiday of four or more
nights away from home. The number of long
holidays taken by British residents was 59
million, of which 33 million were taken in
Britain. The most frequented free attraction
was Blackpool Pleasure Beach (Lancashire),

The most popular holiday destinations are the
West Country, Scotland, the south of England
and Wales.
In 1995 the most popular destinations for
overseas holidays by British residents were:
• Spain (27 per cent);
• France (10 per cent);
• Greece (8 per cent); and
• the United States (7 per cent).
In all, British residents took 26 million long
holidays overseas in 1995, of which 58 per cent
involved ‘package’ arrangements. About 73 per
cent of all holidays abroad are taken in Europe,
although more people are taking holidays
further afield, for example to the United
States. The proportion of adults taking two or
more holidays a year was 27 per cent in 1995.

The system of parliamentary government in Britain is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual evolution over many centuries. The
Monarchy is the oldest institution of government, dating back to at least the
ninth century. Parliament is one of the oldest representative assemblies in
the world. Among the most significant recent developments in government
have been the steps taken to improve management. New management
structures—such as the creation of executive agencies—have been developed;
competition with the private sector has been introduced or extended; and
arrangements for pay are changing. A Civil Service code has been introduced
and measures to increase the openness of central government have been
implemented. The aim of all these changes is to safeguard and improve the
standards of the public services.
The British constitution, unlike that of most
other countries, is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute law,
common law and conventions. (Conventions
are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as
indispensable to the working of government.)
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement, and is
thus adaptable to changing political conditions.
The organs of government overlap but can
be clearly distinguished. Parliament is the
legislature and the supreme authority. The
executive consists of:
• government departments and agencies,
responsible for national administration;
• local authorities, responsible for many
local services; and
• public corporations, responsible for
operating particular nationalised
industries or other bodies, subject to
ministerial control.
The judiciary (see Chapter 8) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. Queen Elizabeth II is herself
directly descended from King Egbert, who

Ministers responsible for national policies;

GOVERNMENT
united England under his rule in 829. The
only interruption in the history of the
Monarchy was the republic, which lasted from
1649 to 1660.
Today the Queen is not only Head of State,
but also an important symbol of national unity.
The Queen’s title in Britain is: ‘Elizabeth the
Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and of Her other Realms and
Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the Monarchy is in
Britain, the Queen is also head of state of a
number of Commonwealth states.1 In each
such state the Queen is represented by a
Governor-General, appointed by her on the
advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government. In each case the form of
the royal title varies. Other Commonwealth
states are republics or have their own
monarchies.
In British dependent territories (see p. 123)
the Queen is usually represented by governors,
who are responsible to the British Government
for the administration of the countries
concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved.
Sons of the Sovereign have precedence over
daughters in succeeding to the throne. When a
'The other Commonwealth states of which the Queen is
head of state are: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia,
Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St Christopher and
Nevis, Saint Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines,
Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.
daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen
Regnant, and has the same powers as a king.
The consort of a king takes her husband’s rank
and style, becoming Queen. The constitution
does not give any special rank or privileges to
the husband of a Queen Regnant.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700, which
formed part of the Revolution Settlement
following the events of 1688 (see p. 5), only
Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia, the
Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of
James I of England and VI of Scotland) are
eligible to succeed. The order of succession
can be altered only by common consent of the
countries of the Commonwealth of which the
Queen is Sovereign.
Accession
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon
as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed
at an Accession Council, to which all members
of the Privy Council (see p. 67) are summoned.
The Lords Spiritual and Temporal (see p. 53),
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and other
leading citizens of the City of London are also
invited.
Coronation
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey in
London, in the presence of representatives of
the Houses of Parliament and of all the great
public organisations in Britain. The Prime
Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations and representatives of
other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is
head of the executive, an integral part of the
legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. As a result of a
long process of evolution, during which the
Monarchy’s absolute power has been
49
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the
advice of her Ministers. Britain is governed by
Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the
Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to Ministers, the
Queen still takes part in some important acts
of government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen also
formally appoints many important office
holders, including government Ministers,
judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, diplomats, bishops and some
other senior clergy of the Church of England.
She is also involved in pardoning people
convicted of crimes; and in conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours.2
An important function is appointing the
Prime Minister (see p. 64). In international
affairs the Queen, as Head of State, has the
power to declare war and make peace, to
recognise foreign states and governments, to
conclude treaties and to annex or cede
territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now
performed by government Ministers, who are
responsible to Parliament and can be
questioned about particular policies.
Parliamentary authority is not required for
the exercise of these prerogative powers,
although Parliament may restrict or abolish
such rights.
The Queen continues to play a role in the
working of government. She holds Privy
Council meetings, gives audiences to her
Ministers and officials in Britain and overseas,
receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must be
consulted on every aspect of national life, and
must show complete impartiality.
2Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on
the advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the
Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian
Order.
Provision has been made to appoint a
regent to perform these royal functions
should the Queen be totally incapacitated.
The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son,
the Prince of Wales, then those, in order of
succession to the throne, aged 18 or over. In
the event of her partial incapacity or absence
abroad, the Queen may delegate certain royal
functions to the Counsellors of State (the
Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in
line of succession, and the Queen Mother).
However, Counsellors of State may not, for
instance, dissolve Parliament (except on the
Queen’s instructions), nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with
the British monarchy, and many traditional
ceremonies continue to take place. Royal
marriages and funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
or head of State visits Britain; investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace
of Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow
honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as the State
opening of Parliament.
Each year the Queen and other members
of the Royal Family visit many parts of
Britain. They are also closely involved in the
work of many charities. For example,the
Prince of Wales is actively involved in The
Prince’s Trust, set up to encourage small
firms and self-employment in inner cities,
while the Princess Royal is President of the
Save the Children Fund. The Queen pays
state visits to foreign governments,
accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh.She
also tours the other countries of the
Commonwealth. Other members of the Royal
Family pay official visits overseas,
occasionally representing the Queen.
Royal Income and Expenditure
Until 1760 the Sovereign had to provide for
payment of all government expenses, including
50
GOVERNMENT
the salaries of officials and the expenses of the
royal palaces and households. These were met
from hereditary revenues, mainly income from
Crown lands, and income from some other
sources granted to the Monarch by Parliament.
The income from these sources eventually
proved inadequate and in 1760 George III
turned over to the Government most of the
hereditary revenue. In return he received an
annual grant (Civil List), from which he
continued to pay royal expenditure of a
personal character, the salaries of government
officials, the costs of royal palaces, and certain
pensions. The latter charges were removed
from the Civil List in 1830.
Present Arrangements
Today the expenditure incurred by the Queen
in carrying out her public duties is financed
from theLlivil List and from government
departments, which meet the cost of, for
example, the Royal Yacht and the aircraft of
No 32 (The Royal) Squadron. All such
expenditure is approved by Parliament. In
1991 Civil List payments were fixed at £7.9
million a year for ten years. About
three-quarters of the Queen’s Civil List
provision is required to meet the cost of staff.
They deal with, among other things, state
papers and correspondence, and the
organisation of state occasions, visits and other
public engagements undertaken by the Queen
in Britain and overseas. The Queen’s private
expenditure as Sovereign is met from the Privy
Purse, which is financed mainly from the
revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster;3 her
expenditure as a private individual is met from
her own personal resources.
Under the Civil List Acts, other members
of the Royal Family also receive annual
parliamentary allowances to enable them to
carry out their public duties. The Prince of
Wales, however, receives no such allowance,
since as Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to the
income of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall.
’The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since
1399, has always been enjoyed by the reigning sovereign. It
is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and is
separately administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster.
Each year the Queen refunds the Government
for all parliamentary allowances paid to
members of the royal family except the Queen
Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid
income tax on all personal income and on that
part of the Privy Purse income which is used
for private purposes. The Queen also pays tax
on any realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. Inheritance tax will
not, however, apply to transfers from one
sovereign to his or her successor, although any
personal bequests other than to the successor
will be subject to inheritance tax. In line with
these changes the Prince of Wales pays income
tax on the income from the Duchy of Cornwall
so far as it is used for private purposes.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of their
own revenue. If extra resources were needed
for an emergency, such as a war, the Sovereign
would seek to persuade his barons, in the
Great Council—a gathering of leading men
which met several times a year—to grant aid.
During the 13th century several English kings
found the private revenues and baronial aids
insufficient to meet the expenses of
government. They therefore summoned not
only the great feudal magnates but also
representatives of counties, cities and towns,
primarily to get their assent to extraordinary
taxation. In this way the Great Council came
to include those who were summoned by name
(those who, broadly speaking, were to form the
House of Lords) and those who were
representatives of communities—the
commons. The two parts, together with the
Sovereign, became known as ‘Parliament’ (the
term originally meant a meeting for parley or
discussion).
Over the course of time the commons began
to realise the strength of their position. By the
middle of the 14th century the formula had
appeared which in substance was the same as
that used nowadays in voting supplies to the
Crown—that is, money to the government—
51
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
namely, ‘by the Commons with the advice of
the Lords Spiritual and Temporal’. In 1407
Henry IV pledged that henceforth all money
grants should be approved by the House of
Commons before being considered by the
Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions, the
Commons gained the right to submit collective
petitions. During the 15th century they gained
the right to participate in giving their
requests—their ‘Bills’—the form of law.
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century led to
Parliament securing its position as the supreme
legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Queen, the House of Lords
and the elected House of Commons—are
constituted on different principles. They meet
together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the State opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Queen to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Queen is given as a matter of course.
Parliament can legislate for Britain as a
whole, or for any part of the country. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
and not part of Britain. They have local
legislatures which make laws on island affairs
(see p. 6).
As there are no legal restraints imposed by a
written constitution, Parliament may legislate
as it pleases, subject to Britain’s obligations as
a member of the European Union. It can make
or change any law, and overturn established
conventions or turn them into law. It can even
prolong its own life beyond the normal period
without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally act
in accordance with precedent. The House of
Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and in this century the House of
Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The European Union
As a member of the European Union, Britain
recognises the various types of Community
legislation and wider policies. It sends 87
elected members to the European Parliament
(see p. 120).
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide, by voting for taxation, the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is
also informed before important international
treaties and agreements are ratified. The
making of treaties is, however, a royal
prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice general elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Parliament is dissolved and
writs for a general election are ordered by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
52
GOVERNMENT
sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—normally beginning and ending in
October or November. There are
‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at
Christmas, Easter and the late Spring Bank
Holiday, and during a long summer break
usually starting in late July. The average
number of‘sitting’ days in a session is about
159 in the House of Commons and about 140
in the House of Lords. At the start of each
session the Queen’s speech to Parliament
outlines the Government’s policies and
proposed legislative programme. Each session
is ended by prorogation. Parliament then
‘stands prorogued’ for about a week until the
new session opens. Prorogation brings to an
end nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The Lords
Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, the Bishops of London, Durham
and Winchester, and the 21 next most senior
diocesan bishops of the Church of England.
The Lords Temporal consist of:
• all hereditary peers of England, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom
(but not peers of Ireland);
• life peers created to assist the House in its
judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or ‘law
lords’);4 and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in
the House provided holders establish their
claim and are aged 21 years or over. However,
anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12
months of succession, disclaim that peerage for
his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their
right to sit in the House but gain the right to
vote and stand as candidates at parliamentary
elections. When a disclaimant dies, the peerage
passes on down the family in the usual way.
4The House of Lords is the final court of appeal for civil
cases in Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other walks
of life or because one of the political parties
wishes to have the recipient in the House of
Lords. The House also provides a place in
Parliament for people who offer useful advice,
but do not wish to be involved in party
politics.
Peers who attend the House (the average
daily attendance is about 360) receive no salary
for their parliamentary work, but can claim for
expenses incurred in attending the House (for
which there are maximum daily rates) and
certain travelling expenses.
In April 1996 there were 1,197 members of
the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 755 hereditary peers
who had succeeded to their titles, 12 hereditary
peers who had had their titles conferred on
them (including the Prince of Wales), and 404
life peers, of whom 24 were ‘law lords’. There
were 82 women peers.
Potential membership is about 1,200, but
this number is reduced by about 70 by a
scheme which allows peers who do not wish to
attend to apply for leave of absence for the
duration of a Parliament. In addition some
hereditary peers do not establish their claim to
succeed and so do not receive a writ of
summons entitling them to sit in the House;
there were 83 such peers in April 1996.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his or her place on the
woolsack5 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
In his absence his place is taken by a deputy.
The first of the deputy speakers is the
Chairman of Committees, who is appointed at
the beginning of each session and normally
chairs Committees of the Whole House and
some domestic committees.
The Clerk of the Parliaments is responsible
The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion
stuffed with wool from several Commonwealth countries;
it is a tradition dating from the medieval period, when
wool was the chief source of the country’s wealth.

He or she is the accounting officer for the cost
of the House, and is in charge of the
administrative staff of the House, known as the
Parliament Office. The Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod, usually known as ‘Black Rod’,
is responsible for security, accommodation and
services in the House of Lords’ part of the
Palace of Westminster.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see below) and
consists of 651 Members of Parliament—MPs.
(See below for future changes.) In
mid-1996 there were 63 women, three Asian
and three black MPs. Of the 651 seats, 524 are
for England, 38 for Wales, 72 for Scotland, and
17 for Northern Ireland.
General elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies or
resigns,6 or is given a peerage, a by-election
takes place. Members are paid an annual salary
(from 1 July 1996 to 31 March 1997) of
£43,000 and an office costs allowance (from
April 1996) of up to £46,364. Other allowances
include travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial
members, subsistence allowances and
allowances for second homes. (For Ministers’
salaries see p. 65.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is
the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over
the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who act as Deputy Speakers. They
are elected by the House on the nomination of
the Government but are drawn from the
Opposition as well as the government party.
They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote

Steward or Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of
the Manor of Northstead.
other than in their official capacity.
Responsibility for the administration of the
House rests with the House of Commons
Commission, a statutory body chaired by the
Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker
on its privileges and procedures. The Clerk’s
departmental responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part of
the building, and is responsible for security.
Other officers serve the House in the
Library, the Department of the Official
Report (Hansard), the Finance and
Administration Department and the
Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes Britain is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. To
ensure that constituency electorates are kept
roughly equal, four permanent Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions, one each for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, keep constituencies under review.
They recommend any adjustment of seats
that may seem necessary in the light of
population movements or other changes.
Reviews are conducted every 8 to 12 years.
Elections are by secret ballot.
Planned Changes
The Commissions’ last general reviews were
approved by Parliament in 1995. As a result of
their recommendations, the number of
parliamentary constituencies—and thus the
number of MPs—will increase from 651 to
659: England will get an extra five seats (from
524 to 529); Wales two (from 38 to 40) and
Northern Ireland one (from 17 to 18). The
number of seats in Scotland remains
unchanged. The new boundaries will come
54
GOVERNMENT
into effect after the dissolution of Parliament7
at the next general election.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and citizens of the
Irish Republic resident in Britain, may vote
provided they are:
• aged 18 or over;
• included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency; and
• not subject to any disqualification.
People not entitled to vote include members
of the House of Lords, foreign nationals, some
patients detained under mental health
legislation, sentenced prisoners and people
convicted within the previous five years of
corrupt or illegal election practices. Members
of the armed forces, Crown servants and staff
of the British Council employed overseas
(together with their wives or husbands if
accompanying them) may be registered for an
address in the constituency where they would
live but for their service. British citizens living
abroad may apply to register as electors for a
period of 20 years after they have left Britain.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors whose
circumstances on polling day are such that
they cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station—for
example, electors away on holiday—may apply
for an absent vote at a particular election.
Electors who are physically incapacitated or
unable to vote in person because of the nature
of their work or because they have moved to a
new area may apply for an indefinite absent
vote. People entitled to an absent vote may
vote by post or by proxy, although postal ballot
papers cannot be sent to addresses outside
Britain.
Voting is not compulsory; 76.9 per cent of a
total electorate of 43.3 million people voted in
7That is, the Parliament elected on 9 April 1992.
the general election in April 1992. The
simple majority system of voting is used.
Candidates are elected if they have more
votes than any of the other candidates
(although not necessarily an absolute
majority over all other candidates).
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, resident in
Britain, may stand for election as MPs
provided they are aged 21 or over and are not
disqualified. Those disqualified include
undischarged bankrupts; people sentenced to
more than one year’s imprisonment; clergy of
the Church of England, Church of Scotland,
Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic
Church; peers; and holders of certain offices
listed in the House of Commons
Disqualification Act 1975.
A candidate’s nomination for election must
be proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors. Candidates do
not have to be backed by a political party. A
candidate must also deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5 per cent or
more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a general election campaign is £4,642 plus
3.9 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 5.2 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. Higher limits have been
set for by-elections in order to reflect the fact
that they are often regarded as tests of national
opinion in the period between general
elections. The maximum sum is £18,572 plus
15.8 pence for each elector in borough seats,
and 20.8 pence for each elector in county seats.
A candidate may post an election
communication to each elector in the
constituency, free of charge. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory limit.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
55
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
constitution. The present system depends
upon the existence of organised political
parties, each of which presents its policies to
the electorate for approval. The parties are not
registered nor formally recognised in law, but
in practice most candidates in elections, and
almost all winning candidates, belong to one of
the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly
two-party system has existed. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, whose origins go
back to the 18th century, or the Labour Party,
which emerged in the last decade of the 19th
century, has held power. A new party—the
Liberal Democrats-—was formed in 1988 when
the Liberal Party, which traced its origins to
the 18th century, merged with the Social
Democratic Party, formed in 1981. Other
parties include two nationalist parties, Plaid
Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the
Scottish National Party (founded in 1934). In
Northern Ireland there are a number of
parties. They include the Ulster Unionist
Party, formed in the early part of this century;
the Democratic Unionist Party, founded in
1971 by a group which broke away from the
Ulster Unionists; and the Social Democratic
and Labour Party, founded in 1970.
Since 1945 eight general elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and six by
the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties. Table 7.1
shows the results of the general election of
April 1992.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a general
election, or which has the support of a majority
of members in the House of Commons, usually
forms the Government. By tradition, the
leader of the majority party is asked by the
Sovereign to form a government. About 100 of
its members in the House of Commons and the
House of Lords receive ministerial
appointments (including appointment to the
Cabinet—see p. 65) on the advice of the Prime
Minister. The largest minority party becomes
the official Opposition, with its own leader and
‘shadow cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition sit
on the front benches of the Commons with
their supporters (the backbenchers) sitting
behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also
apply to the House of Lords; however, a
significant number of Lords do not wish to be
associated with any political party, and sit on
the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths of
the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of

policy and legislation by constructive criticism;
to oppose government proposals it considers
objectionable; to seek amendments to
Government Bills; and to put forward its own
policies in order to improve its chances of
winning the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of government
business are settled, under the direction of the
Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two
Houses, by the Government Chief Whips of
each House in consultation with the
Opposition Chief Whips. The Chief Whips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often
referred to when the question of finding time
for a particular item of business is discussed.
The Leaders of the two Houses are responsible
for enabling the Houses to debate matters
about which they are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is
exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside, it is exercised by the
Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of backbench
members. Party discipline tends to be less
strong in the Lords than in the Commons,
since Lords have less hope of high office and
no need of party support in elections.
The formal title of the Government Chief
Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other
Government Whips, three are officers of the
Royal Household (one of these is Deputy Chief
Whip), five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
Assistant Whips. The Opposition Chief Whips
in both Houses and two of the Opposition
Assistant Whips in the Commons receive
salaries. The Government Whips in the Lords
hold offices in the Royal Household; they also
act as government spokesmen.
Financial Assistance to Parties
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out parliamentary
work at Westminster. It is limited to parties
which had at least two members elected at the
previous general election or one member
elected and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast.
The amount for the period 1 April 1996 to 31
March 1997 is £3,743.33 for every seat won at
the 1992 general election, plus ^7.48 for every
200 votes.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent, partly codified by each House
in its Standing Orders. The system of debate is
similar in both Houses. Every subject starts off
as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member. After
debate, in which each member may speak only
once, the motion may be withdrawn: if it is
not, the Speaker or Chairman ‘puts the
question’ whether to agree with the motion or
not. The question may be decided without
voting, or by a simple majority vote. The main
difference of procedure between the two
Houses is that the Speaker or Chairman in the
Lords has no powers of order; instead such
matters are decided by the general feeling of
the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House and
must guard against the abuse of procedure and
protect minority rights. The Speaker has
discretion on whether to allow a motion to end
discussion so that a matter may be put to the
vote, and has powers to put a stop to .
irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to
save time in other ways. In cases of grave
disorder the Speaker can adjourn or suspend
the sitting. The Speaker may order members
who have broken the rules of behaviour of the
House to leave the Chamber or can initiate
their suspension for a period of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In a
tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits of
the question. Voting procedure in the House
of Lords is broadly similar, although the Lord
Chancellor does not have a casting vote.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-financial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must declare
57
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
it when speaking in the House or in
Committee and must indicate it when giving
notice of a question or motion. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other Members, Ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest. In November 1995 the House agreed
that Members cannot advocate matters in the
House which are related to the source of any
financial interest that they enjoy.
In November 1995 the House of Lords
passed a Resolution to establish a Register of
Lords’ Interests, on lines similar to that for
MPs. The first Register was published in
February 1996 and is open to public
inspection.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
Following recommendations of the Committee
on Standards in Public Life (the Nolan
Committee—see p. 71), the new post of
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
was created in November 1995. The
Commissioner can advise MPs on matters of
standards and conduct a preliminary
investigation into complaints about alleged
breaches of the rules. The Commissioner
reports to the House of Commons Select
Committee on Standards and Privileges.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (transcribed
verbatim in Hansard, the official report) are
published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of
the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a number
of former members of both Houses, are
available to the public through the House of
Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television and
radio, either live or, more usually, in recorded
or edited form. Complete coverage is available
on cable television.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation made by Ministers under
powers given to them by Act (see p. 60). While
the law undergoes constant refinement in the
courts (see p. 83), changes to statute law are
made by Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as local
authorities) or the rights of individuals (such as
certain proposals relating to railways, roads
and harbours) are known as Private Bills, and
are subject to a special form of parliamentary
procedure. Bills which change the general law
and which constitute the more significant part
of the parliamentary legislative process are
Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government Minister or by an
ordinary (‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member.
Most public Bills that become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
Minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
Bills introduced by other members of Parliament
are known as ‘Private Members’ Bills’.
The main Bills which constitute the
Government’s legislative programme are
announced in the Queen’s Speech at the State
opening of Parliament, which usually takes
place in November, and the Bills themselves
are introduced into one or other of the Houses
over the succeeding weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
interested in the subject, and interest and
pressure groups which seek to promote specific
causes. Proposals for legislative changes are
sometimes set out in government ‘White Papers’,
which may be debated in Parliament before a Bill
is introduced. From time to time consultation
papers, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set out
government proposals which are still taking
shape and seek comments from the public.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
matters are almost invariably introduced in the
Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
restricted. The Parliament Acts also provide
58
GOVERNMENT
for a Bill to be passed by the Commons
without consent of the Lords in certain (very
rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the Bill
is considered, without debate, to have been
read for a first time and is printed (although a
substantial number of Private Members’ Bills
are never printed). After an interval, which
may be between one day and several weeks, a
Government Bill will receive its second
reading debate, during which the general
principles of the Bill are discussed. If it obtains
a second reading in the Commons, a Bill will
normally be committed to a standing
committee (see p. 60) for detailed examination
and amendment. In the Lords, the committee
stage usually takes place on the floor of the
House, and this procedure may also be
followed in the Commons if that House so
decides (usually in cases where there is a need
to pass the Bill quickly or where it raises
matters of constitutional importance.) The
Commons may also decide to divide the
committee stage of a Bill between a standing
committee and a committee of the whole
House (which is commonly the case with the
annual Finance Bill).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of the
House, during which further amendments may
be made. In the Commons, this is usually
followed immediately by the third reading
debate, where the Bill is reviewed in its final
form. In the Lords, a Bill may be further
amended at third reading.
After passing its third reading in one
House, a Bill is sent to the other House, where
it passes through all its stages once more and
where it is, more often than not, further
amended. Amendments made by the second
House must be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can go for
Royal Assent.
In the Commons the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’.
There are special procedures for Public
Bills which consolidate existing legislation or
which enact private legislation relating to
Scotland.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen for
Royal Assent, after which it is part of the law
of the land and known as an Act of Parliament.
The Royal Assent has not been refused since
1707. (A list of the main Public Bills receiving
Royal Assent since autumn 1995 is given on
p. 548.)
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most Government Bills introduced and passed
in the Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty, but a Lords Bill which was
unacceptable to the Commons would not
become law. The Lords, on the other hand, do
not generally prevent Bills insisted upon by the
Commons from becoming law, though they
will often amend them and return them for
further consideration by the Commons.
By convention, the Lords pass Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure
without amendment. Under the Parliament
Acts 1911 and 1949, a Bill that deals only with
taxation or expenditure must become law
within one month of being sent to the Lords,
whether or not they agree to it, unless the
Commons directs otherwise. If no agreement is
reached between the two Houses on a
non-financial Commons Bill the Lords can
delay the Bill for a period which, in practice,
amounts to at least 13 months. Following this
the Bill may be submitted to the Queen for
Royal Assent, provided it has been passed a
second time by the Commons. The Parliament
Acts make one important exception: any Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament requires the
full assent of both Houses in the normal way.
The limits to the power of the Lords,
contained in the Parliament Acts, are based on
the belief that nowadays the main legislative
function of the non-elected House is to act as a
chamber of revision, complementing but not
rivalling the elected House.
Private Members ’ Bills
Early in each session backbench members of
the Commons ballot (draw lots) for the
59
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
opportunity to introduce a Bill on one of the
Fridays during the session on which such Bills
have precedence over government business.
The first 20 Members whose names are drawn
win this privilege, but it does not guarantee
that their Bills will pass into law. Members
may also present a Bill on any day without
debate, and on most Tuesdays and
Wednesdays on which the Commons is sitting
there is also an opportunity to seek leave to
present a Bill under the ‘ten minute rule’. This
provides an opportunity for a brief speech by
the Member proposing the Bill (and by one
who opposes it).
Few of these Bills make further progress
or receive any debate, but in most sessions a
few do become law. Recent examples include
the Marriage Act 1994, the Building
Societies (Joint Account Holders) Act 1995
and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act
1996. Private Members’ Bills do not often
call for the expenditure of public money; but
if they do they cannot proceed to committee
stage unless the Government decides to
provide the necessary money. Peers may
introduce Private Members’ Bills in the
House of Lords at any time. A Private
Member’s Bill passed by either House will
not proceed in the other House unless taken
up by a member of that House.
Private and Hybrid Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to Public
Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a
semi-judicial pattern. Hybrid Bills are Public
Bills which may affect private rights. As with
Private Bills, the passage of Hybrid Bills
through Parliament is governed by special
procedures which allow those affected to put
their case.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives Ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation. To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to the
executive might undermine the authority of
Parliament, such powers are normally
delegated only to authorities directly
accountable to Parliament. Moreover, Acts of
Parliament which delegate such powers usually
provide for some measure of direct
parliamentary control over proposed delegated
legislation, by giving Parliament the
opportunity to affirm or annul it. Certain Acts
also require that organisations affected must be
consulted before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. (One specific type of statutory
instrument—known as a deregulation
order—is subject to a different committee
procedure in each House.) In order to save
time on the floor of the House, the Commons
uses standing committees to debate the merits
of instruments; actual decisions are taken by
the House as a whole. The House of Lords has
appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the
appropriateness of the powers to make
secondary legislation in Bills.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a Committee of the Whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or Lord may speak
only once on each motion does not apply in
committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee considers the
Bill clause by clause, and may amend it before
reporting it back to the House. Ordinary
standing committees do not have names but
are referred to simply as Standing Committee
A, B, C, and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
60
GOVERNMENT
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as possible
that in the House as a whole. The standing
committees include two Scottish standing
committees, and the Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Grand Committees.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish members (and may be convened
anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principles
of Scottish Bills referred to it at second and at
third reading stages wherever it makes sense to
do so. It also debates Scottish public
expenditure estimates and any other matters
concerning Scotland. Its business also includes
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements and other debates, including those
on statutory instruments referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, with all 38
Welsh members and up to five others,
considers Bills referred to it at second reading
stage, questions tabled for oral answer,
ministerial statements, and other matters. The
Northern Ireland Grand Committee debates
matters relating specifically to Northern
Ireland. It includes all 17 Northern Ireland
members and up to 25 others.
There are also standing committees to
debate proposed European legislation, and to
scrutinise statutory instruments made by the
Government.
In the Lords, various sorts of committees
on Bills may be used instead of, or as well as, a
Committee of the Whole House. Such
committees include Public Bill Committees,
Special Public Bill Committees, Committees
off the Floor of the House and Scottish Public
Bill Committees.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of enquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases their
recommendations invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the
House. A select committee may be appointed
for a Parliament, or for a session, or for as long
as it takes to complete its task. To help
Parliament with the control of the executive by
examining aspects of public policy,
expenditure and administration, 17
committees, established by the House of
Commons, examine the work of the main
government departments and their associated
public bodies. The Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work
of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
committees are constituted on a basis which is
in approximate proportion to party strength in
the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, Standards
and Privileges, European Legislation, and the
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’—see p. 63). Since 1995 there
has also been a Deregulation Committee,
which examines proposals and draft orders to
be made under the Deregulation and
Contracting Out Act 1994 (see Chapter 14).
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
committees may question Ministers, civil
servants and interested bodies and individuals.
Through hearings and published reports, they
bring before Parliament and the public an
extensive body of fact and informed opinion on
many issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees, on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. Ad hoc committees may also be
set up to consider particular issues (or,
sometimes, a particular Bill), and ‘domestic’
committees—as in the Commons—cover the
internal workings of the House.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills8 and
8A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts
into one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
61
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
delegated legislation (see p. 60). The two
Houses may also agree to set up joint select
committees on other subjects.
Unofficial Party Committees
In addition to the official committees of the
two Houses there are several unofficial party
organisations or committees. The
Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in
the House of Commons. When the
Conservative Party is in office, Ministers
attend its meetings by invitation and not by
right. When the party is in opposition, the
whole membership of the party may attend
meetings. The then leader appoints a
consultative committee, which acts as the
party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Parliamentary Labour Party
comprises all members of the party in both
Houses. When the Labour Party is in office,
a parliamentary committee, half of whose
members are elected and half of whom are
government representatives, acts as a channel
of communication between the Government
and its backbenchers in both Houses. When
the party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the
direction of an elected parliamentary
committee, which acts as the ‘shadow
cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
In addition to the system of scrutiny by
select committees, both Houses offer a
number of opportunities for the examination
of government policy by both the Opposition
and the Government’s own backbenchers. In
the House of Commons, the opportunities
include:
1. Question Time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, Ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s Question
Time is every Tuesday and Thursday
when the House is sitting. Parliamentary
questions are one means of seeking
information about the Government’s
intentions. They are also a way of raising
grievances brought to MPs’ notice by
constituents. MPs may also put questions
to Ministers for written answer; the
questions and answers are published in
Hansard. There are some 50,000 questions
every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the House
to raise constituency cases or matters of
public concern. There is a half-hour
adjournment period at the end of the
business of the day, while immediately
before the adjournment for each recess
three hours are spent discussing issues
raised by private members. In addition, an
MP wishing to discuss a ‘specific and
important matter that should have urgent
consideration’ may, at the end of Question
Time, seek leave to move the adjournment
of the House. On the very few occasions
when leave is obtained, the matter is
debated for three hours in what is known
as an emergency debate, usually on the
following day.
3. Early day motions (EDMs) provide a
further opportunity for backbench MPs to
express their views on particular issues. A
number of EDMs are tabled each sitting
day; they are very rarely debated but can
be useful in gauging the degree of support
for the topic by the number of signatures
of other MPs which the motion attracts.
4. The 20 Opposition days each session,
when the Opposition can choose subjects
for debate. Of these days, 17 are at the
disposal of the Leader of the Opposition
and three at the disposal of the second
largest opposition party.
5. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government
expenditure, chosen by the Liaison
Committee.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the debate
on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of each
session; during debates on motions of censure
for which the Government provides time; and
during debates on the Government’s legislative
and other proposals.
62
GOVERNMENT
House of Lords
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
Question Time, during debates and by means
of questions for written answer.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
public expenditure, are to authorise the raising
of taxes and duties, and the various objects of
expenditure and the sum to be spent on each.
It also has to satisfy itself that the sums
granted are spent only for the purposes which
Parliament intended. No payment out of the
central government’s public funds can be made
and no taxation or loans authorised, except by
Act of Parliament. However, limited interim
payments can be made from the Contingencies
Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the raising
of revenue. The legislation is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement. This includes a review of the
public finances of the previous year, and
proposals for future expenditure (see p. 164).
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out
by House of Commons select committees
(see p. 61).
European Union Affairs
To keep the two Houses informed of EU
developments, and to enable them to scrutinise
and debate Union policies and proposals, there
is a select committee in each House (see p. 61),
and two Commons standing committees
dehate specific European legislative proposals.
Ministers also make regular statements about
EU business.
The Commons’ Ability to Force the Government
to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House of
Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of‘no confidence’. The
Government must also resign if the House
rejects a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has
declared it a ‘matter of confidence’ or if the
House refuses to vote the money required for
the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Ombudsman—officially
known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—investigates complaints from
members of the public (referred through MPs)
alleging that they have suffered injustice
arising from maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a Select Committee of the
House of Commons. The Ombudsman’s
jurisdiction covers central government
departments and agencies and a large number
of non-departmental public bodies. He or she
cannot investigate complaints about
government policy, the content of legislation
or relations with other countries.
In making his investigations, the
Commissioner has access to all departmental
papers, and has powers to summon those
from whom he wishes to take evidence.
When an investigation is completed, he sends
a report with his findings to the MP who
referred the complaint (with a copy report
for the complainant). In reports of justified
cases, the Ombudsman normally
recommends that the department provides
redress (which can include a financial remedy
for the complainant in appropriate cases).
There is no appeal against the Ombudsman’s
decision. He submits an annual report to
Parliament, and also publishes selected cases
three times a year.
In 1995 the Ombudsman received 1,706
new complaints. He completed 245
investigations; of these he found 236 wholly or
partly justified and 9 unjustified.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
monitors the Code of Practice on Access to
Official Information (see p. 71).
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
63
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
collectively to each House and to its staff and
individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally
claims from the Queen ‘their ancient and
undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; first call on the attendance
of its members, who are therefore free from
arrest in civil actions and exempt from serving
on juries, or being compelled to attend court as
witnesses; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the rights of
the House to control its own proceedings (so
that it is able, for instance, to exclude
‘strangers’9 if it wishes); to decide upon legal
disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to
punish for breach of its privileges and for
contempt. Parliament has the right to punish
anybody, inside or outside the House, who
commits a breach of privilege—that is, offends
against the rights of the House.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the House of
Commons.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
Ministers responsible for the conduct of
national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
Ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister. Most
Ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully
represented by Ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of Ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
Minister to another.
yAll those who are not members or officials of either
House.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s unique
position of authority derives from majority
support in the House of Commons and from
the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers.
By modern convention, the Prime Minister
always sits in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet (see p. 65), is responsible for the
allocation of functions among Ministers and
informs the Queen at regular meetings of the
general business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
• Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’;
• senior judges, such as the Lord Chief
Justice;
• Privy Counsellors; and
• Lord-Lieutenants.
They also include certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable
of the Tower, and some university posts; and
appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the BBC (British
Broadcasting Corporation), as well as various
royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
* award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (to people who have
achieved eminence in science or the arts and
are in financial need). The Prime Minister also
selects the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10 Downing
Street (the official residence in London) has a
staff of civil servants who assist the Prime
Minister. The Prime Minister may also
appoint special advisers to the Office to assist
in the formation of policies.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they

GOVERNMENT
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’,
or may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the Lord President of the Council, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without Portfolio,
may have few or no departmental duties. They
are thus available to perform any duties the
Prime Minister may wish to give them. In the
present administration, for example, the Lord
President of the Council is Leader of the
House of Commons and the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster is Minister for the Public
Service.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a Minister with departmental functions
and the head of the judiciary (see p. 111). The
four Law Officers of the Crown are: for
England and Wales, the Attorney General and
the Solicitor General; and for Scotland, the
Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for
Scotland.
Ministers of State and Junior Ministers
Ministers of State usually work with Ministers
in charge of departments. They normally have
specific responsibilities, and are sometimes
given titles which reflect these functions. More
than one may work in a department. A
Minister of State may be given a seat in the
Cabinet and be paid accordingly.
Junior Ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior Minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) share in
parliamentary and departmental duties. They
may also be given responsibility, directly under
the departmental Minister, for specific aspects
of the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
A fundamental review of MPs’ and Ministers’
parliamentary pay and allowances was set up in
February 1996. The Review Body (see Further
Reading) reported in July and Parliament
voted to accept its recommendations. As a
result, until the next Parliament the salaries of
ministers in the House of Commons range
from £66,623 a year for junior Ministers to
£86,991 for Cabinet Ministers. In the House
of Lords salaries range from £43,632 for junior
Ministers to £58,876 for Cabinet Ministers.
The Prime Minister receives £101,557 and the
Lord Chancellor £133,406.
Ministers in the Commons, including the
Prime Minister, receive a full parliamentary
salary of £43,000 a year (which is included in
the above figures) in recognition of their
constituency responsibilities and can claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs.
The Leader of the Opposition in the
Commons is entitled to a salary of £83,332
(including the full parliamentary salary);10 two
Opposition whips in the Commons and the
Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive salaries.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
Ministers (the number can vary) chosen by the
Prime Minister and may include departmental
and non-departmental Ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are to initiate
and decide on policy, the supreme control of
government and the co-ordination of
government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may be
made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
"’Since 1995 the Leader of the Opposition has declined
the pay increases awarded; he draws instead a salary of
£67,456.
65
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours
each week during parliamentary sittings, and
less often when Parliament is not sitting. To
keep its workload within manageable limits, a
great deal of work is carried on through the
committee system. This involves referring
issues either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee of the Ministers
directly concerned. The committee then
considers the matter in detail and either
disposes of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet
with recommendations for action.
There are standing committees dealing with
defence and overseas policy, economic and
domestic policy, and legislation. The
membership and terms of reference of all
ministerial Cabinet committees are published
by the Cabinet Office. Where appropriate, the
Secretary of the Cabinet and other senior
officials of the Cabinet Office attend meetings
of the Cabinet and its committees.
Diaries published by several former
Ministers have given the public insight into
Cabinet procedures in recent times.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office is headed by the Secretary
of the Cabinet (a civil servant who is also Head
of the Home Civil Service) under the direction
of the Prime Minister. It comprises the
Cabinet Secretariat and the Office of Public
Service (OPS).
The Cabinet Secretariat serves Ministers
collectively in the conduct of Cabinet business,
and in the co-ordination of policy at the
highest level.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
is in charge of the OPS and is a member of the
Cabinet. The OPS is responsible for:
• raising the standard of public services
across the public sector through the
Citizen’s Charter (see p. 69);
• promoting the Government’s policies on
competitiveness and deregulation;
• promoting openness in government; and
• improving the effectiveness and efficiency
of central government, through, among
other things, the establishment of
executive agencies and the market testing
programme (see p. 73).
The Historical and Records Section is
responsible for Official Histories and
managing Cabinet Office records.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions which Ministers share, and to
Ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that the Cabinet acts unanimously even
when Cabinet Ministers do not all agree on a
subject. The policy of departmental Ministers
must be consistent with the policy of the
Government as a whole. Once the
Government’s policy on a matter has been
decided, each Minister is expected to support
it or resign. On rare occasions, Ministers have
been allowed free votes in Parliament on
government policies involving important issues
of principle. In February 1994, for example,
free votes were allowed on lowering the age of
consent to homosexual sex from 21 to 18.
The individual responsibility of Ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they are answerable to Parliament for all their
departments’ activities. They bear the
consequences of any failure in administration,
any injustice to an individual or any aspect of
policy which may be criticised in Parliament,
whether personally responsible or not. Since
most Ministers are members of the House of
Commons, they must answer questions and
defend themselves against criticism in person.
Departmental Ministers in the Hous6 of Lords
are represented in the Commons by someone
qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a
junior Minister.
Departmental Ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
on important political matters they usually
consult their colleagues collectively, either
through the Cabinet or through a Cabinet
committee. A decision by a departmental
Minister binds the Government as a whole.
On assuming office Ministers must resign
directorships in private and public companies,
and must ensure that there is no conflict
between their public duties and private
interests.
66
GOVERNMENT
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the King’s Court,
which assisted the Norman monarchs in
running the government. As the system of
Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, however, much of the role of the
Privy Council was assumed by the Cabinet,
although the Council retained certain
executive functions. Some government
departments originated as committees of the
Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen on the approval
of Orders in Council, including those made
under prerogative powers, such as Orders
approving the grant of royal charters of
incorporation and those made under statutory
powers. Responsibility for each Order,
however, rests with the Minister answerable
for the policy concerned, regardless of whether
he or she is present at the meeting where
approval is given.
The Privy Council also advises the
Sovereign on the issue of royal proclamations,
such as those summoning or dissolving
Parliament. The Council’s own statutory
responsibilities, which are independent of the
powers of the Sovereign in Council, include
supervising the registration authorities of the
medical and allied professions.
Membership of the Council, with the style
of‘Right Honourable’, is retained for life,
except for very occasional removals. It is
accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister (or
occasionally, Prime Ministers of
Commonwealth countries) to people eminent
in public life—mainly politicians and
judges—in Britain and the independent
monarchies of the Commonwealth. Cabinet
Ministers must be Privy Counsellors and, if
not already members, are admitted to
membership before taking their oath of office
at a meeting of the Council. There are about
450 Privy Counsellors. A full Council is
summoned only on the accession of a new
Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces
his or her intention to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees. These include prerogative
committees, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, and with applications for charters
of incorporation. Committees may also be
provided for by statute, such as those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the
Scottish universities. Membership of such
committees is confined to members of the
current administration. The only exceptions
are the members of the Judicial Committee
and the members of any committee for which
specific provision authorises a wider
membership.
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the Lord President
of the Council, a Cabinet Minister.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is primarily the final court of appeal
for British dependent territories and those
independent Commonwealth countries which
have retained this avenue of appeal after
independence. The Committee also hears
appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, and from the disciplinary and health
committees of the medical and allied
professions. It has a limited jurisdiction to hear
certain ecclesiastical appeals. In 1995 the
Judicial Committee heard 69 appeals and 69
petitions for special leave to appeal.
The members of the Judicial Committee
include the Lord Chancellor, the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, other Privy Counsellors
who hold or have held high judicial office and
certain judges from the Commonwealth.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies,
staffed by politically impartial civil servants,
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy when Parliament has
passed the necessary legislation, and for
advising Ministers. They often work alongside
local authorities, statutory boards, and
government-sponsored organisations operating
under various degrees of government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
67
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
Britain as a whole. Other departments, such as
the Department of Social Security, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the
Department of the Environment, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England.
The ten Government Offices for the
Regions are responsible for administering the
main regional programmes of the Departments
of Environment, Trade and Industry,
Education and Employment, and Transport, as
well as programmes from the Home Office;
they also administer the Single Regeneration
Budget (see p. 375).
Some departments which have direct
contact with the public throughout the country
(for example, the Department of Social
Security) also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by .
Ministers. In some departments the head is a
permanent official, and Ministers with other
duties are responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, Ministers in the Treasury are
responsible for HM Customs and Excise, the
Inland Revenue, the National Investment and
Loans Office and a number of other
departments, as well as executive agencies such
as the Royal Mint. Departments generally
receive their funds directly out of money
provided by Parliament and are staffed by
members of the Civil Service.
The functions of the main government
departments and agencies are set out on
pp. 540-7.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
Non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs)
have a role in the process of national
government but are not government
departments nor parts of a department. There
are three kinds: executive bodies, advisory
bodies and tribunals. Tribunals are a
specialised group of bodies whose functions
are essentially judicial (see p. 111).
The function of NDPBs is regularly
reviewed in a continuous programme. Once
they are no longer needed in their existing
form, the bodies are abolished, merged or
privatised. The number of NDPBs decreased
from 2,167 in 1979 to 1,227 in 1995, a
reduction of 43 per cent. During the same
period the number of staff they employed
decreased from 217,000 to 109,200—a
reduction of 50 per cent. See p. 71 for
government plans to increase the public
accountability of NDPBs.
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies normally employ their
own staff and have their own budget. They
are public organisations whose duties
include executive, administrative, regulatory
or commercial functions. They normally
operate within broad policy guidelines set
by departmental Ministers but are in
varying degrees independent of government
in carrying out their day-to-day
responsibilities. Examples include the
Commission for Racial Equality, the Police
Complaints Authority, and the Public Health
Laboratory Service.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted by
advisory councils or committees which carry
out research and collect information, mainly to
give Ministers access to informed opinion
before they come to a decision involving a
legislative or executive act. In some cases a
Minister must consult a standing committee,
but advisory bodies are usually appointed at
the discretion of the Minister. Examples
include the British Overseas Trade Board and
the Farm Animal Welfare Council.
The membership of advisory councils and
committees varies according to the nature of
the work involved, but normally includes
representatives of the relevant interests and
professions.
In addition to standing advisory bodies,
there are committees set up by government to
examine specific matters and make
recommendations. For example, the
Committee on Standards in Public Life (the
Nolan Committee—see p. 71) was set up in
1994, reporting directly to the Prime Minister.
68
GOVERNMENT
For certain important inquiries, Royal
Commissions, whose members are chosen for
their wide experience, may be appointed.
Royal Commissions examine evidence from
government departments, interested
organisations and individuals, and submit
recommendations; some prepare regular
reports. Examples include the standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution, set
up in 1970, and the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice, which issued its report in
1993. Inquiries may also be undertaken by
departmental committees.
Government Information Services
Each of the main government departments has
its own information division, public relations
branch or news department. These are
normally staffed by professional information
officers responsible for communicating their
department’s activities to the news media and
the public (sometimes using publicity services
provided by the Central Office of
Information—see p. 545). They also advise
their departments on the public’s reaction.
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office have
direct contact with the parliamentary press
through regular meetings with the Lobby
correspondents. The Lobby correspondents
are a group of political correspondents with the
special privilege of access to the Lobby of the
House of Commons, where they can talk
privately to government Ministers and other
members of the House. The Prime Minister’s
Press Office is the accepted channel through
which information about parliamentary
business is passed to the media.
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Affairs
Scotland
Scotland has its own system of law and wide
administrative autonomy. The Secretary of
State for Scotland, a Cabinet Minister, has
responsibility in Scotland (with some
exceptions) for a wide range of policy matters
(see p. 546).
The distinctive conditions and needs of
Scotland and its people are also reflected in
separate Scottish legislation on many domestic
matters. Special provisions applying to
Scotland alone are also inserted in Acts which
otherwise apply to Britain generally.
British government departments with
significant Scottish responsibilities have offices
in Scotland and work closely with The
Scottish Office.
Wales
Since 1964 there has been a separate Secretary
of State for Wales, who is a member of the
Cabinet and is responsible for many aspects of
Welsh affairs. (For further details see p. 547.)
Northern Ireland
Since the British Government’s assumption of
direct responsibility for Northern Ireland in
1972 (see p. 12), the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet,
has been in charge of the Northern Ireland
Office. He is assisted by two Ministers of State
and two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of
State. The Secretary of State has overall
responsibility for the government of Northern
Ireland. He is directly responsible for political
and constitutional matters, security policy and
broad economic questions and other major
policy issues, while responsibility for the
Departments of Agriculture, Economic
Development, Education, Environment,
Finance and Personnel, and Health and Social
Services is shared among the other Ministers.
Improving Public Services
The Citizen’s Charter
The Citizen’s Charter was launched by the
Prime Minister in 1991 as a ten-year
programme to raise the standard of public
services and make them more responsive to the
needs and wishes of their users. It is closely
linked to other reforms, including the Next
69
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Steps programme, efficiency measures and the
Government’s contracting out and market
testing programmes (see p. 73).
The Charter applies to all public services,
at both national and local levels, and to the
privatised utilities. Most major public
services have now published separate
charters (by mid-1996 over 40 had been
issued). In many cases separate charters have
been published for services in Northern
Ireland, Scotland and Wales. (Details of
many of the charters can be found in the
relevant chapters.)
The Principles of Public Service
The Charter sets out a number of key
principles which users of public services are
entitled to expect.
They include requirements for published
standards of services and results achieved;
comprehensive information on services;
consultation with users of services; courteous
and helpful service from public servants;
effective redress if things go wrong, including
well publicised and easy to use complaints
procedures; and independent inspectorates and
auditing.
Implementing the Charter
A Cabinet Minister, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, is responsible for the
Charter programme. The Chancellor of
the Duchy is supported by the Citizen’s
Charter Unit within the OPS (see p. 66).
The Prime Minister also receives advice on
the Charter from an Advisory Panel drawn
from business, consumer affairs and
education. The Panel works with the
Citizen’s Charter Unit and officials in all the
departments to implement and develop the
Citizen’s Charter programme. The Pfime
Minister holds regular seminars with
Advisory Panel members and Cabinet
Ministers to report on progress and plan
further action.
Executive agencies (see p. 73) are expected
to comply fully with the principles of the
Citizen’s Charter, and the pay of agency chief
executives is normally directly related to their
agency’s performance. Performance-related
pay is being introduced throughout the public
service.
Projects to ensure that public service
managers understand the benefits of the
Charter programme and that users are aware of
the standards of service they can expect to
receive include:
Charter Mark Awards The Charter Mark
Scheme was introduced in 1992 to reward
excellence in delivering public services.
Applicants have to demonstrate that they
have achieved measurable improvements in
the quality of services over the previous two
years, and that their customers are satisfied
with their services. Winners are judged by
the Prime Minister’s Citizen’s Charter
Advisory Panel.
In 1995 a record number of 740 applications
were received and 224 awards were made.
Winners came from all parts of the public
sector throughout Britain. They included: St
James’s University Hospital Liver Unit
(Leeds), Employment Service (Inverness),
Merthyr Tydfil Libraries, the UK Passport
Agency (London) and Northern Ireland
Housing Executive (Lisburn).
Charter Quality Networks The Charter Unit
has helped to set up a number of networks of
groups of managers of public services to meet
locally to exchange ideas on customer service
and quality issues and share best practice.
There are 24 Quality Networks around
Britain, with over 1,000 members. The
networks aim to help break down boundaries
between public service organisations and
encourage problem-sharing and solving.
Charter Quality Seminars and Workshops
The Charter Unit runs and arranges a number
of seminars and workshops to allow local
public services managers and consumer groups
to share experiences in delivering a high-
quality service to their customers. Seminars
have been held for local authorities; secondary,
further and higher education; those involved in
community care; services to road users;
services in rural areas; and effective complaints
handling.
70
GOVERNMENT
Open Government
In line with Citizen’s Charter principles of
increased openness and accountability of
public administration, the Government
introduced the Code of Practice on Access to
Official Information in 1994. Under the Code,
government departments and bodies within
the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary
Ombudsman (see p. 63) are required to:
• publish facts and analysis with major
policy decisions;
• open up internal guidelines about
departments’ dealings with the public;
• give reasons for administrative decisions
to those affected;
• provide information about public services,
including their cost, targets, performance,
complaints and redress; and
• provide information in response to specific
requests on policies, actions and decisions.
As examples of information which
departments and public bodies volunteered to
the public in 1995, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food made 124
internal guidance documents available through
the Helpline Desk in its main library; and
reports by the Social Services Inspectorate of
inspections of voluntary children’s homes were
made public for the first time.
The Code allows independent review when
applicants feel that the Code has not been
properly applied. Complainants may be
referred to the Parliamentary Ombudsman
through an MP. Reports are made to
Parliament by the Ombudsman if information
has been improperly withheld. A similar Code
of Practice on Openness in the National Health
Service came into force in June 1995.
The Government is also to propose
legislation to provide rights of access to health
and safety information and personal records.
These rights would add to a number of
existing rights of access in specific areas such
as environmental information.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
The Committee on Standards in Public Life
(the Nolan Committee), set up in 1994, issued
its first report in May 1995. It recommended,
among other things, an independent element
in the scrutiny of the conduct of MPs, in the
acceptance of appointments by Ministers when
they leave office, and of how Ministers make
appointments to public bodies. The
Government accepted the broad thrust of its
recommendations. As a result:
• The first independent Commissioner for
Public Appointments was appointed in
November 1995. The Commissioner
provides advice and guidance to
departments and monitors, regulates and
audits their procedures for making
appointments to executive
non-departmental public bodies and NHS
bodies, ensuring that appointments are
governed by the overriding principle of
appointment on merit. The Commissioner
published a code of practice in April 1996,
and will publish an annual report
containing the results of the monitoring of
all departments’ appointments \
procedures.
• In March 1996 the Government published
the proposed text of the revised rules on
the acceptance of appointments outside
government by former civil servants; this
brings special advisers within the system
and enables the Prime Minister’s
Advisory Committee on Business
Appointments to announce the reasons for
its decisions and to advise a civil servant
or Minister that the acceptance of a
particular appointment is inappropriate.
• In March 1996 the Government also
published a consultation paper which
proposes action to improve the
accountability of public bodies. Spending
Public Money: Governance and Audit Issues
includes a clear set of principles for the
audit of public money, including how well
it is spent. It also provides a framework
for accountability.
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
71
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
activities as they affect the community.
These range from policy formulation to
carrying out the day-to-day duties of public
administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
For all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. In most circumstances
the executive powers of the Crown are
exercised by, and on the advice of, Her
Majesty’s Ministers, who are in turn
answerable to Parliament. The Civil Service as
such has no constitutional personality or
responsibility separate from that of the
Government of the day. The duty of the
individual civil servant is first and foremost to
the Minister of the Crown who is in charge of
the Department in which he or she is serving.
A change of Minister, for whatever reason,
does not involve a change of staff. Ministers
sometimes appoint special advisers from
outside the Civil Service. The advisers are
normally paid from public funds, but their
appointments come to an end when the
Government’s term of office finishes, or when
the Minister concerned leaves the Government
or moves to another appointment.
A new Civil Service code came into force in
January 1996, following publication in 1994 of
The Civil Service: Continuity and Change, a
White Paper on the role and future of the Civil
Service. The Code provides a statement of the
constitutional framework within which all civil
servants work and the values they are expected
to uphold. The Code includes an independent
line of appeal to the Civil Service
Commissioners (see p. 74) on alleged breaches
of the Code.
The number of civil servants fell from
732,000 in April 1979 to 499,900 in January
1996, its lowest since 1939. This reflects the
Government’s policy of controlling the cost of
the Civil Service and of improving its
efficiency.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in the provision of public services. These
include paying sickness benefits and pensions,
collecting taxes and contributions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, and
providing services to industry and agriculture.
A quarter are employed in the Ministry of
Defence. The rest are divided between central
administrative and policy duties; support
services; and largely financially self-supporting
services, for instance, those provided by
National Savings and the Royal Mint.
Four-fifths of civil servants work outside
London.
The total also includes members of the
Senior Civil Service—around 3,000 of the
most senior managers and policy advisers.
They are responsible for serving the collective
interest of government with a focus and loyalty
wider than their own departments and
agencies.
Equality of Opportunity
The Government is committed to achieving
equality of opportunity for all its staff. In
support of this commitment, the Civil Service,
which recruits and promotes on the basis of
merit, is actively pursuing policies to develop
career opportunities for women, ethnic
minorities and people with disabilities. In
April 1995:
• women represented 51.3 per cent of all
non-industrial civil servants, and since
1987 the proportion of women in the top
three grades of the service has more than
doubled to almost 9 per cent;
• representation of ethnic minority staff
among non-industrial civil servants had
increased from 4.2 per cent in 1989 to 5.4
per cent, compared with 4.9 per cent, for
the overall ethnic minority representation
in the working population; and
• 2.8 per cent of disabled people were
employed in the non-industrial home
Civil Service, of whom 1.6 per cent were
registered disabled, which is just above
the proportion of registered disabled
people in the workforce as a whole and
twice the proportion employed in the
private sector.
Progress is monitored and reported on
regularly by the Cabinet Office (OPS).
Management Reforms
Civil Service reforms are being implemented
to ensure improved management
72
GOVERNMENT
performance, in particular through the
increased accountability of individual
managers, based on clear objectives and
responsibilities. These reforms include
performance-related pay schemes and other
incentives.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps
Programme
The Next Steps Programme, launched in
1988, aims to deliver government services
more efficiently and effectively within
available resources for the benefit of taxpayers,
customers and staff. This has involved setting
up, as far as is practicable, separate units or
agencies to perform the executive functions of
government. Agencies remain part of the Civil
Service but under the terms of individual
framework documents they enjoy greater
delegation of financial, pay and personnel
matters. Agencies are headed by chief
executives who are accountable to Ministers
but who are personally responsible for
day-to-day operations.
No agency can be established until the
‘prior options’ of abolition, privatisation and
contracting out have been considered and
ruled out. These ‘prior options’ are
reconsidered when agencies are reviewed,
normally after five years of operation.
At the end of 1995, 109 agencies were in
existence, together with 23 Executive Units of
Customs and Excise and 27 Executive Offices
of the Inland Revenue. At that time over
366,000 civil servants—67 per cent of the
total—worked in organisations run on Next
Steps lines. At the same time a further 57
agency candidates—employing nearly 58,000
staff—had been identified as suitable for
agency status.
In 1994-95, agencies met 83 per cent of
their key performance targets—a small
improvement on the previous year.
Efficiency Measures
In 1992 the Government increased its drive to
secure the best value for money in the
provision of public services through expanding
competition and encouraging private sector
involvement. Up to 1992, £20-25 million
worth of activities had been opened up to
external competition. By March 1995 over
£2,600 million of activities, covering 69,000
posts, had been reviewed; and in 1995-96 alone
over £1,000 million of activities were reviewed.
Central Management and Structure
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Cabinet Office (OPS) and the
Treasury.
The OPS, which is under the control of the
Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil
Service, oversees organisation, senior civil
service pay, pensions and allowances,
recruitment, retirement and redundancy
policy, personnel management and statistics,
and the overall efficiency of the Service.
The function of official Head of the Home
Civil Service is combined with that of
Secretary of the Cabinet.
At the senior levels, where management
forms a major part of most jobs, there are
common grades throughout the Civil Service.
These unified grades 1 to 7 are known as the
Open Structure and cover grades from
Permanent Secretary level to Principal level.
Within these grades each post is filled by the
person considered to be best qualified,
regardless of the occupational group to which
he or she previously belonged.
Below this the structure of the non¬
industrial Civil Service is based on a system of
occupational groups. These groups assist the
recruitment and matching of skills to posts and
offer career paths in which specialist skills can
be developed. Departments and agencies are
being encouraged to develop their own pay and
grading arrangements. They are expected to
produce value-for-money benefits which are
greater than those available through centrally
controlled negotiation. Since April 1996 all
departments and agencies have been
responsible for implementing their own
systems of pay and grading of staff below
senior levels.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 6,000 people, provides the staff for the
73
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (see p. 117)
and for British diplomatic missions abroad.
The Diplomatic Service has its own grade
structure, linked to that of the Home Civil
Service. Terms and conditions of service are
comparable, but take into account the special
demands of the Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. Home civil
servants, members of the armed forces and
individuals from the private sector may also
serve in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
and at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Civil Service Recruitment
Recruitment is based on the principle of
selection on merit by fair and open
competition. Independent Civil Service
Commissioners are responsible for approving
the selection of people for appointment to the
Senior Civil Service. Recruitment of all other
staff is the responsibility of departments and
executive agencies. Departments and agencies
can choose whether to undertake this
recruitment work themselves, to employ a
private sector recruitment agency or to use the
Government’s Recruitment and Assessment
Services Agency to recruit on their behalf.
People from outside the Civil Service may
be recruited directly to all levels, particularly
to posts requiring skills and experience more
readily found in the private sector. The
exchange of staff between the Civil Service and
industry is also encouraged.
Since May 1995 departments and agencies
have been required to publish information
about their recruitment systems.
Training
Government departments and agencies
provide training and development to meet
their business needs, to improve performance,
and to help staff respond effectively to
changing demands. Most training and
development takes place within departments
and agencies. In addition, the Civil Service
College provides management and professional
training, mainly for those who occupy, or hope
to occupy, relatively senior positions.
Considerable use is made of other providers in
the private and public sectors.
Civil servants aged under 18 may continue
their general education by attending courses,
usually for one day a week (‘day release’
schemes). All staff may be entitled to financial
support to continue their education, mainly in
their own time. There are also opportunities
for civil servants to undertake research and
study in areas of interest to them and to their
department or agency.
Promotion
Departments are responsible for promotion up
to and including Grade 4. In some cases
centrally arranged postings are supplemented
or replaced by schemes of job advertising. For
about 150 of the most senior posts in the Civil
Service, appointments and transfers are
approved by the Prime Minister, who is
advised by the Head of the Home Civil
Service.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform loyally
the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its political
persuasion. It is essential that Ministers and
the public should have confidence that the
personal views of civil servants do not
influence the performance of their official
duties, given the role of the Civil Service in
serving successive governments formed by
different parties. The aim of the rules which
govern political activities by civil servants is to
allow them, subject to these fundamental
principles, the greatest possible freedom to
participate in public affairs consistent with
their rights and duties as citizens. The rules
are therefore concerned with activities liable to
give public expression to political views rather
than with privately held beliefs and opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three
groups for the purposes of deciding the extent
to which individuals may take part in political
activities:
• those in the ‘politically free’ group,
consisting of industrial staff and
non-office grades, are free to engage in
any political activity outside official time,
including adoption as a prospective
candidate for the British or the European
74
GOVERNMENT
Parliament (although they would have to
resign from the Service before giving their
consent to nomination).
• those in the ‘politically restricted’ group,
which comprises staff in Grade 7 and
above as well as Administration Trainees
and Higher Executive Officers (D), may
not take part in national political activities
but may apply for permission to take part
in local political activities; and
• the ‘intermediate’ group, which comprises
all other civil servants, may apply for
permission to take part in national or local
political activity, apart from candidature
for the British or the European
Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to
the maximum extent consistent with the Civil
Service’s reputation for political impartiality
and the avoidance of any conflict with official
duties. A code of discretion requires
moderation and the avoidance of
embarrassment to Ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on
the private activities of civil servants,
provided that these do not bring discredit on
the Civil Service, and that there is no
possibility of conflict with official duties. For
instance, a civil servant must comply with
any departmental instruction on the need to
seek authority before taking part in any
outside activity which involves official
experience.
Security
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security. As a general rule the
privately-held political views of civil servants
are not a matter of official concern. However,
no one who is, or has been involved in, or
associated with, activities threatening national
security may be employed on work which is
vital to the security of the State. Certain posts
are not open to people who fall into this
category, or to anyone whose reliability may be
in doubt for any other reason.
The Security Commission may investigate
breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure if
asked to do so by the Prime Minister after
consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition.
Local Government
Although the origins of local government in
England can be traced back to Saxon times, the
first comprehensive system of local councils
was established in the late 19th century. Major
reforms to the structure of local government
are now being implemented.
Local Government Reform
A major reform of local government took place
in 1974 in England and Wales and in 1975 in
Scotland. This created two main tiers of local
authority throughout England and Wales:
counties and the smaller districts. Local
government in London had been reorganised
along the same lines in 1965. In Scotland
functions were allocated to regions and
districts on the mainland; single-tier
authorities were introduced for the three
Islands areas. In Northern Ireland changes
were made in 1973 which replaced the two-tier
county council and urban/rural council system
with a single-tier district council system.
The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England.
Most of their functions were transferred to the
London boroughs and metropolitan district
councils respectively in 1986 (see below).
Local Government Commission
The Local Government Commission was
established in 1992 to review the structure,
boundaries and electoral arrangements of local
government in England and to undertake
periodic electoral reviews. So far most of its
work has been to review the structure of local
government in non-metropolitan England.
The reviews considered whether the two-tier
structure should be replaced by single-tier
(‘unitary’) authorities in each area; for the most
part the Commission recommended the
retention of two-tier government, but
suggested unitary authorities for some areas,
especially the larger cities. The first changes,
75
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on the Isle of Wight, were implemented in
April 1995. In April 1996 13 more unitary
councils were established, and others will be
set up in April 1997 or later years.
The Commission is now concentrating on
reviews of local authority electoral
arrangements, although it may also look at the
boundaries of metropolitan areas where there
is sufficient demand.
Scotland and Wales
In Scotland 29 new unitary councils replaced
the previous system of nine regional and 53
district councils in April 1996 under the Local
Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. The
three Islands councils have remained in being.
In Wales, under the Local Government
(Wales) Act 1994, 22 unitary authorities
replaced the previous eight county councils
and 37 district councils, again in April 1996.
The first elections for the new councils took
place in 1995, with the new authorities acting
in ‘shadow’ form until April 1996 to make
preparations for their assumption of power.
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities derive their power from
legislation. Although local authorities are
responsible for administering certain services,
Ministers have powers in some areas to secure
a degree of uniformity in standards to
safeguard public health or to protect the rights
of individual citizens.
Relations with Central Government
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment. However,
other departments such as the Department for
Education and Employment and the Home
Office are also concerned with various local
government functions. In the rest of Britain
the local authorities deal with the Scottish or
Welsh Offices or the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland, as
appropriate.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Before the recent reforms, England outside
Greater London was divided into counties,
sub-divided into districts. All the districts and
the non-metropolitan counties had locally
elected councils with separate functions.
County councils provided large-scale services
such as education and social services, while
district councils were responsible for the more
local ones (see p. 78). These arrangements are
broadly continuing in areas where two-tier
local government will remain. The new unitary
authorities, where they are being created, bring
all of these local authority functions together.
Greater London is divided into 32
boroughs and the City of London, each of
which has a council responsible for local
government in its area. In the six metropolitan
counties there are 36 district councils; there are
no county councils. A number of services,
however, require a statutory authority over
areas wider than the individual boroughs and
districts. These are:
• waste disposal (in certain areas);
• the fire services, including civil defence;
and
• (outside London) public transport.
These are run by joint authorities
composed of elected councillors nominated by
the borough or district councils. Local councils
also provide many of the members of the
police authorities (see p. 89).
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 8,000 parish councils
or meetings provide and manage local facilities
such as allotments and village halls, and act as
agents for other district council functions.
They also provide a forum for discussion of
local issues. In Wales about 730 community
councils have similar functions, and provision
is made for local community councils in
Scotland.
The boundaries and electoral arrangements
of local authorities in England are kept under
review by the Local Government Commission
(see p. 75), and in Wales and Scotland by the
Local Government Boundary Commissions.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are
responsible for local environmental and certain
other services. Statutory bodies, such as the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive and area
boards, are responsible to central government
76
GOVERNMENT
departments for administering other major
services.
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
Councillors are paid a basic allowance but
may also be entitled to additional allowances
and expenses for attending meetings or
taking on special responsibilities. Parish and
community councillors cannot claim
allowances for duties undertaken within their
own council areas. In Scotland community
councillors are not eligible for any form of
allowance.
In England and Wales each council elects
its presiding officer annually. Some districts
have the ceremonial title of borough, or city,
both granted by royal authority. In boroughs
and cities the presiding officer is normally
known as the Mayor. In the City of London
and certain other large cities, he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor. In Wales the
presiding officer of the new authorities is
called chairman in the case of counties and
mayor in the case of county boroughs.In
Scotland the presiding officer of the district
council of each of the four cities—Aberdeen,
Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow—is called
the Lord Provost. In other councils he or she is
known as a convenor or provost. District
councils in Northern Ireland are presided over
by a chairman. There are, however, a number
of boroughs and cities where the presiding
officer is the Mayor and in Belfast he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor.
Most councillors are elected for four years.
All county councils in England, London
borough councils, and about two-thirds of
non-metropolitan district councils are elected
in their entirety every four years. In the
remaining districts (including all metropolitan
districts) one-third of the councillors are
elected in each of the three years when county
council elections are not held. Where new
unitary authorities are being set up in England,
Parliamentary Orders make the necessary
provisions regarding elections. In Scotland
local elections will now be held every three
years, with the next elections due in 1999.
Each election covers the whole council. In
Wales elections for the full councils will
continue to be held every fourth year, again
with the next due in 1999.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in Britain provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• a citizen of Britain or of another
Commonwealth country, or of the Irish
Republic, or (from 1996) a citizen of the
European Union;
• not legally disqualified; and
• on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must be
resident in the council area on the qualifying
date. In Northern Ireland there are slightly
different requirements.
Candidates
Most candidates at local government elections
stand as representatives of a national political
party, although some stand as independents.
Candidates must be British citizens, other
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the
European Union, and aged 21 or over. In
addition, they must also either:
• be registered as local electors in the area of
the relevant local authority; or
• have occupied (as owner or tenant) land or
premises in that area during the whole of
the preceding 12 months; or
• have had their main place of work in the
area throughout this 12-month period.
No one may be elected to a council of which
he or she is an employee, and there are some
other disqualifications. All candidates for
district council elections in Northern Ireland
are required to make a declaration against
terrorism.
Electoral Divisions and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland are
divided into wards, returning one councillor or
77
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
more. In Scotland the electoral areas in the
new councils are called wards and in Wales
they are called electoral divisions; each returns
one or more councillors. Parishes (in England)
and communities (in Wales) may be divided
into wards. Wards return at least one
councillor.
The procedure for local government voting
in Great Britain is broadly similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
local government elections are held by
proportional representation, and electoral
wards are grouped into district electoral areas.
Council Functions and Services
At present in England county councils are
responsible for strategic planning, transport
planning, highways, traffic regulation,
education,1 11 consumer protection, refuse
disposal, the fire service, libraries and the
personal social services. District councils are
responsible for services such as environmental
health, housing, decisions on most local
planning applications, and refuse collection.
Both tiers of local authority have powers to
provide facilities such as museums, art
galleries and parks; arrangements depend on
local agreement. Where unitary authorities are
created in non-metropolitan areas, they are
generally responsible for both county and
district level functions.
In the metropolitan counties the district
councils are responsible for all services apart
from the police, the fire service and public
transport and, in some areas, waste disposal
(see p. 76). In Greater London the boroughs
and the Corporation of the City of London
have similar functions, but London’s
metropolitan police force is responsible to the
Home Secretary. Responsibility for public
transport lies with London Transport (see
p. 308).
Wales and Scotland now have unitary local
authorities, responsible for a range of local
government services. In Wales fire services are
provided by three combined fire authorities. In
Northern Ireland local environmental and
1 ’Schools may, however, ’opt out’ of local education
authority control by obtaining grant-maintained
status—see p. 444.
certain other services, such as leisure and the
arts, are administered by the district councils.
Responsibility for planning, roads, water
supply and sewerage services is exercised in
each district through a divisional office of the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. Area boards, responsible to central
departments, administer education, public
libraries and the health and personal social
services locally. The Northern Ireland
Housing Executive, responsible to the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland, administers housing.
Changes in Local Government
There have been numerous changes in recent
years in the way that local authorities approach
their responsibilities. Many of these can be
encapsulated under the term ‘the enabling
authority’. It is used to describe the general
shift away from local authorities providing
services directly and towards them arranging
for services to be provided, or carrying out
functions in partnership with other bodies. For
example, councils often have nomination rights
to housing association properties (see p. 389),
so that they are acting not as provider but as
‘gatekeeper’. Likewise, under the community
care reforms, councils with social services
responsibilities draw up care plans for those
who need them (see p. 421), but the care is
often provided by the private or voluntary
sectors funded by the council, rather than
directly by the local authority itself.
The Government introduced legislation in
the 1980s to encourage local authorities to
obtain better value for money in the services
they provide. As a result, many services
traditionally provided by the council’s own
staff, such as refuse collection and leisure
management, must now be put out to
competition with private firms. The process is
known as compulsory competitive tendering
(CCT). In-house teams may also bid for the
work. The Government estimates that CCT
has resulted in a cost saving of 7 per cent since
its introduction. It has now been extended to
local authorities’ provision of a range of
professional functions, such as legal and
personnel services. The metropolitan districts
and London boroughs already have some of
78
GOVERNMENT
these new arrangements in place and these will
be extended to the remaining authorities over
the next few years.
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom
to make arrangements for carrying out their
duties. Some decisions are made by the full
council; many other matters are delegated to
committees composed of members of the
council. A council may delegate most
functions to a committee or officer, although
certain powers are legally reserved to the
council as a whole. Parish and community
councils in England and Wales are often able
to do their work in full session, although they
appoint committees from time to time as
necessary.
In England and Wales committees
generally have to reflect the political
composition of the council (although the
legislation governing this specifically
excludes parish or community councils). In
practice, this is often also the case in
Scotland, although it is not enforced by
legislation. People who are not members of
the council may be co-opted onto
decision-making committees and can speak
and take part in debates; they cannot
normally vote. Legislation also prevents
senior officers and others in politically
sensitive posts from being members of
another local authority or undertaking public
political activity. Some of these provisions
have not been introduced in Northern
Ireland.
The Government is looking at ways of
improving the internal management of local
authorities.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted
to council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have access to agendas, reports
and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and
withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances.
Employees
About 1.4 million people12 are employed by
local authorities in England. These include
administrative, professional and technical staff,
teachers, firefighters, and manual workers, but
exclude those in law and order services.
Education is the largest service, employing
almost 45 per cent of all local government
workers. Councils are individually responsible,
within certain national legislative
requirements, for deciding the structure of
their workforces.
Senior staff appointments are usually made
by the elected councillors. More junior
appointments are made by heads of
departments. Pay and conditions of service are
usually a matter for each council, although
there are scales recommended by national
negotiating machinery between authorities and
trade unions, and most authorities follow
these.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25 per cent of public spending. The
Government has sought to influence local
government spending as part of a general
policy of controlling the growth of public
expenditure. Since 1984 the Government has
had powers to limit or ‘cap’ local authority
budgets (local authority taxation in Scotland)
by setting a maximum amount for local
authorities which have, in its view, set budgets
which are excessive.
In 1995-96 expenditure by local authorities
in Britain was about £74,800 million. Current
expenditure amounted to £64,000 million;
capital expenditure, net of capital receipts, was
£6,700 million; and debt interest £4,100
million. Local government capital expenditure
is financed primarily by borrowing within
limits set by central government and from
capital receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the council tax, which meets
about 20 per cent of their revenue expenditure.
Their revenue spending is, however, financed
I2Whole-time equivalents.
79
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
primarily by grants from central government
and by the redistribution of revenue from the
national non-domestic rate, a property tax
levied on businesses and other non-domestic
properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate and business rates.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be
audited by independent auditors appointed
by the Audit Commission in England and
Wales, or in Scotland by the Accounts
Commission for Scotland. In Northern
Ireland this role is exercised by the chief
local government auditor, who is appointed
by the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to resolve
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public will often ask their own
councillor for assistance in this. Local
authorities must also appoint a monitoring
officer, whose duties include ensuring that the
local authority acts lawfully in the conduct of
its business.
Allegations of local government
maladministration leading to injustice may be
investigated by statutory independent
Commissioners for Local Administration,
often known as ‘local government
ombudsmen’. There are three of these in
England, and one each in Wales and Scotland.
A report is issued on each complaint fully
investigated and, if injustice caused by
maladministration is found, the local
ombudsman normally proposes a remedy.
The council must consider the report and
reply to it.
An independent review of the local
government ombudsman service in England
began in 1995.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence Parliament and
Government in the way decisions are made
and carried out, to the benefit of their
members and the causes they support. There is
a huge range of groups, covering politics,
business, employment, consumer affairs,
ethnic minorities, aid to developing countries,
foreign relations,-education, culture, defence,
religion, sport, transport, social welfare, animal
welfare and the environment. Some have over
a million members, others only a few dozen.
Some exert pressure on a number of different
issues; others are concerned with a single issue.
Some have come to play a recognised role in
the way Britain is governed; others seek
influence through radical protest.
While political parties seek to win political
power, pressure groups aim to influence those
who are in power, rather than to exercise the
responsibility of government and to legislate.
Pressure Groups and Policy
Pressure groups operating at a national level
have a number of methods for influencing the
way Britain is governed. Action by them may
highlight a particular problem, which is then
acknowledged by the Government. Groups
whose scale of membership indicates that they
are broadly representative in their field may
then be consulted by a government
department, or take part in Whitehall working
groups or advisory councils. If the
Government considers that legislation is
necessary, then proposals are drafted, which
are circulated to interested groups for their
comments. Legislation is then put before
Parliament, and at various times during the
passage of a Bill—especially at the committee
stage—pressure groups have opportunities to
influence its content. If the Act includes
delegated legislation (see p. 60), pressure
groups may be consulted and have the
opportunity to provide information and
express their views.
Pressure Groups and Government
The principle of consultation to gain the
consent and co-operation of as wide a range of
80
GOVERNMENT
organisations as possible, and ensure the
smooth working of laws and regulations, plays
an important part in the relationship between
government departments and interested
groups.
In some instances a department is under
legal obligation to consult interested groups.
The Government has a duty to consult
organised interests, providing the pressure
groups involved have a broad enough
membership for them to represent a majority
view, and provided that they observe
confidentiality about their discussions with the
department. Members of pressure groups have
direct expertise, and an awareness of what is
practicable, and can give advice and
information to civil servants engaged in
preparing policy or legislation. In return, the
pressure groups have the opportunity to
express their opinions directly to the
Government. The contacts between civil
servants and pressure group representatives
may be relatively informal—by letter or
telephone—or more formal, through
involvement in working parties or by giving
evidence to committees of inquiry.
Administration by Pressure Groups
As well as providing information and opinions,
pressure groups can also be involved in
administering government policy. The
Government also makes grants to pressure
groups which, as well as speaking on behalf of
their members or for an issue, also provide a
service. Relate: National Marriage Guidance
has received grants for the advice centres it
runs, and government departments make
grants to a number of pressure groups for
research relating to public policy.
Pressure Groups and Parliament
Lobbying—the practice of approaching MPs
or Lords, persuading them to act on behalf of a
cause, and enabling them to do so by providing
advice and information—is a form of pressure
group activity which has substantially
increased in recent years.
A common pressure group tactic is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP
about an issue—for example, the Sunday
trading laws, or the plight of political prisoners
in particular countries—in order to raise
awareness and persuade the MP to support the
cause.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may exert influence include:
• suggesting to MPs or Lords subjects for
Private Members’ Bills (see p. 59); many
pressure groups have ready-drafted
legislation waiting to be sponsored;
• approaching MPs or Lords to ask
parliamentary questions as a means of
gaining information from the Government
and of drawing public attention to an
issue;
• suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 62); and
• orchestrating public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action. If the petition is to be
presented in Parliament, it must be
worded according to Commons or Lords
rules, and be presented by an MP or Lord
in his or her own House.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs and
Lords sympathetic to their cause, and to brief
them when issues affecting the group are
raised in Parliament.
There are also public relations and political
consultancy firms specialising in lobbying
Parliament and Government. Such firms are
employed by pressure groups—as well as by
British and overseas companies and
organisations—to monitor parliamentary
business, and to promote their clients’ interests
where they are affected by legislation and
debate.

Major reforms of criminal procedure have been introduced under the Criminal
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. The Act creates a statutory scheme for
the disclosure of material by the prosecution and defence in criminal cases in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland and introduces a number of measures to
improve the effectiveness of pre-trial procedures. Other developments during
the last year include the setting up of the national Crime Prevention Agency;
proposals for tougher sentencing for repeat offenders and an end to automatic
early release and parole from prison; and a review of rules and procedures of the
civil courts in England and Wales.
England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland all have their own legal systems, with
considerable differences in law, organisation
and practice. All three have separate
prosecution, prison and police services. Crime
prevention policy and non-custodial treatment
for offenders are similar throughout Britain.
There are different civil court and civil law
systems in England and Wales and in
Scotland; Northern Ireland’s system is in
many ways similar to the English and Welsh
model. •
Common Law and Statute Law
One of the main sources of law in England and
Wales and in Northern Ireland is common law,
which has evolved over centuries from judges’
decisions. It forms the basis of the law except
when superseded by legislation. In Scotland,
too, the doctrine of legal precedent has been
more strictly applied since the end of the 18th
century.
Much of the law, particularly that relating
to criminal justice, is statute law passed by
Parliament. If a court reaches a decision which
is contrary to the intentions of Parliament,
then Parliament must either accept the
decision or pass amending legislation. Some
Acts create new law, while others are passed to
draw together existing law on a given topic.
Parliament can repeal a statute and replace it
with another.
European Community Law
European Community law, which applies to
Britain by virtue of its membership of the
European Union, derives from the European
Community treaties and the legislation
adopted under them. EC legislation has been
adopted in most of the fields covered by the
83
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Community treaties, including economic and
social matters, agriculture and the
environment. Where EC law is applicable, it
takes precedence over domestic law. It is
normally applied by the domestic courts, but
the most authoritative rulings are given by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (see
p. 120).
Certain changes to United Kingdom law
have been made to bring it into line with
rulings of the European Court of Human
Rights (see p. 135).
Branches of the Larv
There are two main branches of the
law—criminal and civil. Criminal law is
concerned with acts punishable by the State.
Civil law covers:
• dealings or disputes between individuals
about their rights, duties and obligations;
and
• dealings or disputes between individuals
and companies, and between one company
and another.
Criminal Justice
Crime Statistics
Differences in the legal systems, police
recording practices and statistical
classifications make it impracticable to
analyse in detail trends in crime for Britain as
a whole. However, as elsewhere in the
industrialised world, there has been a
substantial rise in crime in Britain since the
1950s. Annual official statistics cover crime
recorded by the police and can be affected by
changes in the amount of crime that goes
unreported.
Recorded crime in England and Wales (see
Table 8.1) has been falling since 1993; in 1995
it was down by 491,500 offences on 1992
levels—the largest ever continuous fall in the
number of annually recorded crimes. On only
two other occasions this century have there
been continuous annual falls: 1912-15 and
1951-54.
The Scottish police recorded 502,802
crimes in 1995 (the fourth successive year in
which a decrease has occurred); of these,
195,188 were cleared up. In Northern Ireland,
of the 68,808 recorded crimes in 1995, 24,838
were cleared up.
Crime tends to be concentrated in large
cities and urban areas, although rural crime
has increased in recent years. About 93 per
cent of offences recorded by the police in
England and Wales are directed against
property but only 6 per cent involve violence.
Rising affluence has provided more
opportunities for casual property crime; for
example, car crime accounts for about 26 per
cent of all recorded crimes (and is currently
the focus for much of the Government’s
crime prevention activity). The demand for,
and supply of, illegal drugs has also been an
increasing factor in the incidence of crime in
recent years.

Home Office support to police crime
prevention work is provided by the Crime
Prevention Centre, which is part of the Agency
and which offers training and advice and
promotes best practice. About 800 specialist
crime prevention officers are employed in
police forces across England and Wales, and
crime prevention activities are being
increasingly integrated into operational
policing.
About 1,300 local crime prevention panels
(including over 1,000 school-based youth
panels) assist the police in preventing crime
through publicity, marking goods and
equipment, and fund-raising to buy security
devices.
The work of the Crime Prevention
Agency is overseen by the Crime Prevention
Agency Board, which brings together the key
bodies involved in promoting crime
prevention: the Home Office, the Association
of Chief Police Officers, Crime Concern (an
Source: Protecting the Public White Paper, Cm 3190
Regular crime surveys are undertaken in
England and Wales and in Scotland. These
indicate that many crimes go unrecorded by
the police, mainly because not all victims
report what has happened to them. The
surveys confirm that most crimes are against
property, in the form of theft and vandalism.
Most crime is committed by young males, is
opportunist and is not planned by hardened
professional criminals, although these do exist.
There are about eight times as many male
offenders as female.
Crime Prevention
In November 1995 the Government
announced the creation of the Crime
Prevention Agency. The aims of the Agency
are to initiate and develop ideas to help
prevent crime and reduce the fear of crime by
following up new research, identifying good
practice, and ensuring that guidance and
advice are available.
85
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
independent organisation which encourages
local initiatives and business participation in
crime prevention), local authorities, police
authorities and business.
There is a Crime Prevention Council in
Scotland and a Crime Prevention Panel in
Northern Ireland.
Initiatives
The Partners Against Crime campaign,
which began in 1994, promotes co-operation
between the public and the police. It is based
on:
• Neighbourhood Watch schemes, of
which there are 143,000 in England and
Wales, covering some 6 million
households (and also 3,600 schemes in
Scotland); and
• Street Watch, in which local people, in
agreement with the police, work out
specific routes and regularly walk the
chosen area.
Closed-circuit television (CCTV)
surveillance systems have proved very effective
in preventing and detecting crime, and in
deterring criminals, in high streets, shopping
centres, schools, industrial estates and other
areas. The Government has encouraged the
setting up of CCTV schemes across the
country, and in October 1995 announced plans
for financing a further 10,000 CCTV cameras
over three years.
The Safer Cities Programme tackles crime
and the fear of crime through joint crime
prevention action by local government,
private businesses, the police and voluntary
agencies in England and Wales. The
programme has supported nearly 4,500
schemes, with government funding of over
£26 million. There is a parallel Safer Cities
programme in Scotland, and similar projects
are being funded by the Government in
Northern Ireland.
Helping the Victim
The Government has emphasised the
importance of victims’ interests within the
criminal justice system.
There are some 365 victim support
schemes—with over 12,000 volunteer visitors
throughout England and Wales—providing
practical help and emotional support to victims
of crime. The schemes are co-ordinated by a
national organisation, Victim Support, which
receives a government grant (£11.7 million in
1996-97). Similar schemes operate in Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales the Crown Court
Witness Service provides a full range of
support services for victims and other
witnesses in all 77 Crown Court centres.
A new offence of witness intimidation was
introduced by the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994 to protect victims
who are also witnesses. The Criminal
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996
modified the system of committal
proceedings (see p. 95), so that victims will
no longer have to give evidence and be
cross-examined twice over.
A new Victim’s Charter, published in June
1996, is designed to improve further the
standards of service and treatment that victims
receive from criminal justice agencies. It sets
out 27 standards of service that victims can
expect, and explains which agency is
responsible for providing the service and how
victims can complain if they do not get the
level of service promised.
A scheme giving victims the opportunity
formally to explain the effect of what happened
to them, so that it may be taken into account
by the criminal justice agencies before they
decide how to deal with an alleged offender, is
being introduced on a pilot basis in six police
areas from autumn 1996.
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland, including foreign
nationals, may be eligible for compensation from
public funds; in 1995-96 £183 million was paid
out under the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Scheme. In Northern Ireland there are separate
statutory arrangements for compensation for
criminal injuries, and for malicious damage to
property, including any resulting loss of profits.
Tackling Drug Misuse
The Government’s comprehensive strategy for
tackling drug misuse involves:
86
JUSTICE AND THE EAW
• international co-operation against
production and trafficking (see p. 136);
• law enforcement by police and customs, and
maintenance of tight domestic controls and
effective deterrents (see below); and
• preventive education, publicity, and
community action, and the treatment and
rehabilitation of offenders (see pp. 411—3).
Recent Developments
The White Paper Tackling Drugs Together,
published in May 1995, contained a new drugs
strategy for England for 1995-98. This maintains
the emphasis on law enforcement and reducing
supply but recognises a need for stronger action
on reducing demand for illegal drugs. The
strategy seeks to involve the voluntary and
private sectors, local authorities, schools, parents,
health professionals and criminal justice agencies
in a comprehensive programme to reduce
supply, demand and misuse of illegal drugs. It
aims to take action by vigorous law enforcement,
accessible treatment and a new emphasis on
education and prevention to:
• increase the safety of communities from
drug-related crime;
• reduce the acceptability and availability of
drugs to young people; and
• reduce the health risks and other damage
related to drug misuse.
The Government recognises that these aims
are best achieved through a co-ordinated
multi-agency approach at both national and
local level. One hundred and five Drug Action
Teams have been set up across England to
implement the strategy locally. The teams
consist of senior representatives from the key
statutory agencies: the police, probation and
prison services, and health and local
authorities. They have drawn up action plans
for the next two years which focus on local
priorities and specific local objectives.
In Scotland the report of the Ministerial
Drugs Task Force, Drugs in Scotland: Meeting
the Challenge, setting out a comprehensive
strategy for action, was published in 1994. Its
recommendations are being implemented, and,
as in England, Drug Action Teams are
developing plans for their areas. A Northern
Ireland policy statement was issued in 1995
and discussions have taken place on
establishing a local co-ordination network. In
Wales a strategy was published in May 1996.
In 1995-96 the European Drug Liaison
Officer network of the National Criminal
Intelligence Service (NCIS—see p. 89)
contributed to the seizure of drugs with a street
value of more than £243 million, an increase of
12.5 per cent over the previous year.
Strengthening the Law
In addition to wide-ranging legislation such as
the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 and the Criminal Procedure (Scotland)
Act 1995, giving the police and the courts
greater powers to catch, convict and punish
criminals, other important measures to
strengthen the criminal justice system have
been taken in recent years.
Courts in England and Wales have powers
to order the confiscation of profits made by
drug traffickers and other criminals. (Similar
provisions are in place in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.) These were first introduced
in 1986, in relation to the proceeds of drug
trafficking, and have since been considerably
strengthened. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1995
brought the law on criminal proceeds into line
with that on drug trafficking. In particular, the
Act provided new powers for the courts to
confiscate the proceeds of persistent offending.
Such offenders can now be required to account
for the lawful origin of all their property. If
they cannot do so, the property is liable to
confiscation. The legislation also closed the
loophole which enabled some criminals to
avoid payment by serving a term of
imprisonment in default. The amount owing
under a confiscation order is now liable to
confiscation even when the offender has served
a default term for. failing to pay the order.
New powers to clamp down on money
launderers1 came into force in 1994, with
'Money laundering is the process by which illegally
obtained money or other property—from drugs or arms
trafficking, terrorist activities or other serious crimes—is
given the appearance of having originated from a
legitimate source.
87
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
heavy penalties for those who launder money
gained from any sort of serious crime.
There are strict legislative controls on
firearms. The police license the possession of
firearms and have powers to regulate their
safekeeping and movement. The private
ownership of certain highly dangerous types of
weapon, such as machine guns, high-powered
self-loading rifles and burst-fire weapons, is
banned.
It is illegal to manufacture, sell or import
certain weapons such as knuckledusters or to
carry a knife in a public place without good
reason. Penalties for offences relating to the
carrying of knives are being raised.
Measures to Combat Terrorism
Most of the powers which the police use to
combat terrorism and the offences with which
terrorists might be charged are contained in
the general criminal law. However, the
Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary
Provisions) Act 1989 in Great Britain, and
legislation relating specifically to Northern
Ireland (see below), do confer some
exceptional powers, and create additional
offences, in order to combat terrorism.
The special counter-terrorist legislation
gives the Secretary of State the power:
• to proscribe any organisation which
appears to be concerned with terrorism in
Northern Ireland; and
• to exclude from all or part of Britain
people who are believed to be, or to
have been, involved in terrorism
connected with the affairs of Northern
Ireland.
The police also have wider powers of
arrest and greater powers of detention under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act than under
the general criminal law when dealing with
suspected terrorists. They can arrest and
detain someone for up to 48 hours (and
for a further five days if a Secretary of
State approves) on reasonable suspicion
of involvement in terrorism. They also have
powers to conduct security checks at
ports, and special investigative powers for
offences relating to the financing of
terrorism.
Under the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994, the police have powers to
stop and search for articles which may be
used for terrorist purposes, and a new
offence of possession of such articles has
been created.
Extended police powers to stop and search
pedestrians, to search non-residential
premises and unaccompanied goods at ports,
to impose cordons, and to restrict parking
and remove vehicles were introduced under
the Prevention of Terrorism (Additional
Powers) Act 1996.
Northern Ireland
Powers similar to those now provided in
England and Wales under the Prevention of
Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act 1996 have
existed for a number of years in Northern
Ireland under successive Northern Ireland
(Emergency Provisions) Acts, which have a
fixed lifespan. The provisions of the last such
Act, which lapsed in August 1996, were largely
renewed in successor legislation, namely the
Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act
1996.
Despite the ceasefires declared by the
paramilitary groupings in Northern Ireland
in 1994, the Government did not think it
would be prudent to remove emergency
legislation from the statute book while illegal
weaponry and explosives were still at large.
The Provisional Irish Republican Army
(PIRA) ended its ceasefire and returned to
violence in mainland Britain in February
1996 (see p. 14).
THE POLICE SERVICE
The Home Secretary and the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Secretaries, together with
police authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for the provision of an effective
and efficient police service in Britain.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces in Britain, mainly
organised on a local basis: 43 in England and
Wales, eight in Scotland and one—the Royal
88
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Ulster Constabulary (RUC)—in Northern
Ireland. The Metropolitan Police Service and
the City of London force are responsible for
policing London. The police service is
financed by central and local government.
At the end of 1995 police strength in
England and Wales was about 127,000, of
which the Metropolitan Police numbered
27,300. The establishment of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) was around 8,500. Police
strength in Scotland was about 14,500. With
the exception of the RUC, each force has
volunteer special constables who perform
police duties in their spare time, without pay,
acting in support of regular officers. The
Government is aiming to recruit a further
10,000 special constables by the end of 1996, so
increasing the overall number by 50 per cent.
In Northern Ireland there is a 5,000-strong
reserve force.
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by local police authorities, which appoint
the chief constables and provide buildings and
equipment. The Home Secretary is responsible
for London’s Metropolitan Police Service. In
Scotland the new unitary councils act as police
authorities. In Northern Ireland the Police
Authority for Northern Ireland is appointed by
the Secretary of State.
Provincial forces are headed by chief
constables, who are responsible for the
direction and control of their police forces and
for the appointment, promotion and discipline
of all ranks below assistant chief constable. On
matters of efficiency they are generally
answerable to their police authorities, to whom
they must submit an annual report (with a
copy to the Secretary of State). In the
Metropolitan Police area the commissioner of
police and his or her deputies are appointed on
the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Police forces are inspected by independent
inspectors of constabulary, whose reports to
central government are published.
Police officers are not allowed to join a
trade union or to go on strike. All ranks,
however, have their own staff associations.
Recent Reforms
In England and Wales the Police and
Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994 has changed the
relationship between central government,
police authorities and chief constables—
improving the management of the police,
reducing cumbersome central controls, and
devolving more power and decision-making to
the local level.
Under this legislation, new free-standing
police authorities were set up in 1995 in each
of the 41 police areas outside London. They
were given greater responsibility for securing
effective police performance and were made
more accountable to the public. Appointments
to police authorities now include independent
members as well as local councillors and
magistrates. The standard size of a police
authority is set at 17 members: nine locally
elected councillors, three magistrates and five
independent members. The Home Secretary
can increase the size of a police authority
beyond 17 if local circumstances make it
desirable. A 12-member Metropolitan Police
Committee assists the Home Secretary, who
acts as police authority for the Metropolitan
Police. Police authorities, in consultation with
the chief constables and local community, set
local policing objectives, while the
Government sets priority objectives for the
police as a whole.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
has issued a White Paper proposing reforms to
improve accountability and efficiency in the
police service. Some of the proposals mirror
changes made in England and Wales.
Police authorities in Scotland continue to
be composed of elected councillors.
Co-ordination of Police Operations
Certain police services are provided centrally
either by the Government or through
co-operation between forces. In England and
Wales these include criminal intelligence,
telecommunications, and research and
development. In Scotland the main common
services are centralised police training, the
Scottish Crime Squad and the Scottish
Criminal Record Office.
The National Criminal Intelligence Service,
with a headquarters in London and five
regional offices, co-ordinates and provides
information to the police and HM Customs
about major criminals and organised crime,
89
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including drug trafficking. The Service also
liaises with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL), which promotes
international co-operation between police
forces.
Britain has taken the lead in developing,
with other European Union countries, a
European police organisation (EUROPOL)
designed to provide Union-wide intelligence
about serious crime (see p. 136).
All British police forces have fraud squads
responsible for investigating financial and
commercial fraud.
Six regional crime squads in England and
Wales deal with serious crime which goes
beyond individual force, regional or national
boundaries.
The Government is taking steps to increase
the capability of Britain’s law enforcement
agencies to gather and use intelligence when
fighting organised crime. Legislation passed in
1996 enables the Security Service to support
the law enforcement agencies in the prevention
and detection of serious crime (extending its
functions beyond the protection of national
security and the safeguarding of Britain’s
economic well-being against threats from
abroad). The Government also intends to:
• develop the National Criminal
Intelligence Service’s leading role in
collecting and sharing intelligence to assist
investigations, including a pivotal role in
international co-operation;
• set up a unified Crime Squad for England
and Wales to conduct investigations of
organised criminals and support police
forces in cases of serious crime; and
• establish a new statutory system for the
authorisation of intrusive police
surveillance operations by Chief Police
Officers.
Information Technology
The Police National Computer provides all
police forces in Britain with rapid
24-hour-a-day access to essential information.
Phoenix—the Criminal Justice Record
Service—went live on the Police National
Computer in 1995, and gives the police direct
on-screen access to national records of arrests,
cautions, bail decisions and convictions. This
will gradually replace the manual
record-keeping service currently maintained
on microfiche by the National Identification
Service (NIS). Phoenix will eventually provide
information direct to other agencies such as the
courts, the Prison Service and the Crown
Prosecution Service.
Scottish criminal records are held on
computer at the Scottish Criminal Record
Office, which has an automatic national
fingerprint record system; the initial
implementation of a similar national system in
England and Wales (NAFIS) is planned for
1997-98.
The National Strategy for Police
Information Systems, launched in 1994, aims
to increase police effectiveness in England and
Wales by developing common information
technology applications, and a common
technical infrastructure to deliver them. A new
Police Information Technology Organisation
(PITO) was officially launched in July 1996. It
is responsible for specifying and procuring the
delivery of national information technology
systems (such as the Police National
Computer) for the police service, and for
promoting the National Strategy for Police
Information Systems at force level. PITO will
also be responsible for communications
services, including the Police National
Network (which provides telecommunications
services to forces throughout Britain) and the
next generation of police radio systems.
Firearms
Police officers in Great Britain do not normally
carry firearms. About five per cent of officers
are allowed to be issued with firearms, on the
authority of a senior officer, where there is a
special need. Most forces operate armed
response vehicles which can be deployed
quickly to contain firearms incidents.
In Northern Ireland police officers are
issued with firearms for their personal
protection.
Forensic Science Service
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) provides
scientific support in the investigation of crime.
90
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Its customers include the police, the Crown
Prosecution Service, coroners and defence
solicitors.
In April 1996 the FSS merged with the
Metropolitan Police Forensic Science
Laboratory to form a single agency serving
all police forces in England and Wales
through six regional laboratories. The FSS
holds and operates the national DNA
database (see p. 93).
In Scotland forensic science services are
provided by forces’ own laboratories. Northern
Ireland has its own forensic science laboratory.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be prosecuted if suspected
of a criminal offence. Officers are also subject
to a disciplinary code designed to deal with
abuse of police powers and maintain public
confidence in police impartiality. If found
guilty of breaching the code, an officer can be
dismissed from the force.
Revised disciplinary procedures for the
police, similar to those in operation elsewhere
in the public service, are being introduced.
These provide for a more flexible system with
greater line management involvement, the
introduction of procedures for dealing with
unsatisfactory performance and changes in the
appeals procedures, which no longer involve
the Secretary of State.
Members of the public have the right to
make complaints against police officers if they
feel that they have been treated unfairly or
improperly. In England and Wales such
complaints are investigated by the independent
Police Complaints Authority. In Scotland
complaints against police officers involving
allegations of criminal conduct are referred to
the procurator fiscal for investigation. The
Scottish Inspectorate of Constabulary
considers representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have
handled their complaints.
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is required
to supervise the investigation of complaints
regarding death or serious injury and has the
power to supervise that of any other complaint.
In certain circumstances, the Secretary of State
may direct the Commission to supervise the
investigation of matters that are not the subject
of a formal complaint. The Northern Ireland
system is currently under review.
Community Relations
Police/community liaison consultative groups
operate in every police authority; they consist
of representatives from the police, local
councillors and community groups.
Particular efforts are made to develop
relations with young people through greater
contact with schools. School governing bodies
and head teachers have to describe in their
annual reports the steps taken to strengthen
their schools’ links with the community,
including the police.
Central guidance recommends that all
police officers should receive thorough
training in community and race relations
issues. Home Office and police service
initiatives are designed to tackle racially
motivated crime and to ensure that the issue is
treated as a police priority. Forces’ responses
to racial incidents are monitored by the
Inspectorate of Constabulary. Discriminatory
behaviour by police officers, either to other
officers or to members of the public, is an
offence under the Police Discipline Code.
All police forces recognise the need to
recruit women and members of the ethnic
minorities in order to ensure that the police
represent the community.
Police Powers in England and Wales
The powers of a police officer to stop and
search, arrest and place a person under
detention are contained in the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The legislation
and its accompanying codes of practice set out
police powers and procedures in the
investigation of crime, and safeguards for
members of the public. An officer is liable to
disciplinary proceedings if he or she fails to
comply with any provision of the codes, and
evidence obtained in breach of the codes may
be ruled inadmissible in court. The codes must
be readily available in all police stations for
consultation by police officers, detained people
and members of the public. (For information
on police powers relating to the prevention of
terrorism, see p. 88).
91
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Stop and Search
A police officer has the power to stop and
search people and vehicles if there are
reasonable grounds for suspecting that he or
she will find stolen goods, offensive weapons
or implements that could be used for theft,
burglary and other offences. The officer must
make a record of the grounds for the search
and of anything found. The person stopped is
entitled to a copy of the search record. Under
the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 a senior police officer (superintendent or
above) who reasonably believes that serious
incidents of violence may take place can
authorise uniformed officers to stop and search
people and vehicles for offensive weapons or
dangerous implements. The authorisation
must specify the timescale and area in which
the powers are to be exercised.
Arrest
The police have various powers to arrest people
suspected of having committed an offence. They
may arrest on a warrant issued by a court, but
can arrest without warrant for arrestable offences
and serious arrestable offences.
An arrestable offence is an offence for which
the sentence is fixed by law or for which the term
of imprisonment is five years or more. Serious
arrestable offences, such as murder, rape and
manslaughter, fall within this category, but the
seriousness of the offence allows the police
greater opportunity to detain and interview
suspects (see below). There is also a general
power of arrest for all other offences if:
• it is impracticable or inappropriate to
proceed by way of summons to appear in
court; or
• a police officer has reasonable grounds for
believing that arrest is necessary to
prevent the person concerned from
causing injury to any other person or
damage to property.
Detention, Treatment and Questioning
If a person is suspected of involvement in an
offence, he or she must be cautioned before the
police ask any questions about the offence. The
caution informs suspects that they do not have to
say anything, but anything that they do say may
be given in evidence in court. The caution also
tells suspects that it may be harmful to their
defence if they fail to mention something during
questioning which they later rely on in court. A
caution will also be given in similar terms when a
suspect is charged. The caution reflects the
requirements of the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994, which allows a court to draw
inferences from a defendant’s failure to mention
facts when questioned or charged.
Questions relating to an offence may not
normally be put to people after they have been
charged with that offence or informed that
they may be prosecuted for it.
The length of time a suspect is held in police
custody before charge is strictly regulated. For
arrestable offences this may not exceed 24 hours.
A person suspected of committing a serious
arrestable offence can be detained for up to 96
hours without charge but beyond 36 hours only
if a warrant is obtained from a magistrates’ court.
Reviews must be made of a person’s detention at
regular intervals—six hours after initial
detention and thereafter every nine hours as a
maximum—to check whether the criteria for
detention are still satisfied. If they are not, the
person must be released.
The tape recording of interviews with
suspected offenders at police stations must be
used when the police are investigating
indictable offences and in certain other cases.
The police are not precluded from taping
interviews for other types of offences. The
taping of interviews is regulated by a code of
practice approved by Parliament, and suspects
are entitled to a copy of the tape if they are
charged or informed that they will be
prosecuted.
A person who thinks that the grounds for
detention are unlawful may apply to the High
Court for a writ of habeas corpus against the
person who detained him or her, requiring that
person to appear before the court to justify the
detention. Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others.
Recognising that the use of DNA analysis
has become a powerful tool in the investigation
of crime, the Government has extended police
powers to take body samples from suspects.
The police may take non-intimate samples
92
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
without consent from anyone who is detained
or convicted for a recordable offence, and use
the samples to search against existing records
of convicted offenders or unsolved crimes. A
national DNA database, the first of its kind in
the world, was introduced in 1995.
Charging
Once there is sufficient evidence, the police
have to decide whether a detained person
should be charged with an offence. They may
issue a formal caution (see p. 102), which will
be recorded and may be taken into account if
the person reoffends.
If charged, a person may be kept in custody
if there is a risk that he or she might fail to
appear in court or might interfere with the
administration of justice. When no such
considerations apply, the person must be
released on or without bail. When someone is
detained after charge, they must be brought
before a magistrates’ court as soon as
practicable. This is usually no later than the
next working day.
Police Powers in Scotland
The police in Scotland can arrest a person
without a warrant if he or she is seen committing
a crime or is reasonably suspected of an offence
against laws controlling the use of drugs. In
other cases the police may seek a warrant to
arrest a person suspected of a crime by applying
to a Justice of the Peace (see p. 95).
As in England and Wales, Scottish police
have powers to enter a building without a
warrant from a court if they are in close
pursuit of a person who has committed or
attempted to commit a serious crime. A court
can grant the police a search warrant giving
them the power to search premises for stated
items in connection with a crime. The police
have statutory powers to search anyone if they
have reasonable grounds to suspect him or her
of carrying an offensive weapon.
There are powers to detain for questioning
anyone the police suspect of committing an
offence punishable by imprisonment. The
suspect may not be detained for more than six
hours. After this period the person must be
either formally arrested and charged or
released. If held in a police station, the suspect
has a right to have a solicitor and one other
person informed about his or her whereabouts.
Once a person has been charged with a
criminal offence, only voluntary statements
will normally be allowed in evidence at the
trial. The court will reject statements unless
satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
Tape recording of interviews with suspects is
common practice. Anyone arrested must be
brought before a court on the first working day
after arrest. In less serious cases, the police
may release a person who gives a written
undertaking to attend court at a later date.
Where the charges involve serious crime,
the accused is brought before the sheriff in
private, either to be committed for a period not
exceeding eight days to allow further enquiries
to be made or to be committed for trial.
The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995
extends the range of samples which the police
may take without warrant for DNA analysis.
Police Powers in Northern Ireland
The law in Northern Ireland relating to the
powers of the police in the investigation of
crime and to evidence in criminal proceedings
is very similar to that in force in England and
Wales.
Under emergency legislation designed to
combat terrorism (see p. 88), people detained
on suspicion of terrorist offences are kept at
special holding centres, and may be held for up
to 48 hours. Further extensions of up to five
days require the consent of the Secretary of
State.
Awaiting Trial
England and Wales
Most accused people are not remanded in
custody to await trial except where strictly
necessary. In England and Wales the court
decides whether a defendant should be
released on bail. Unconditional bail may be
withheld only if the court believes that the
accused would abscond, commit an offence,
interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct
the course of justice.
A court may also impose conditions before
93
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
granting bail. If bail is refused, the defendant
may apply to a High Court judge or to the
Crown Court for bail. In certain circumstances
the prosecution may appeal to a Crown Court
judge against the granting of bail by
magistrates. An application can also be made to
the Crown Court for conditions imposed by a
magistrates’ court to be altered. In some cases
a court may grant bail to a defendant on
condition that he or she lives in an approved
bail or probation/bail hostel.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 gives the police powers of immediate
arrest for breach of police bail and removes the
presumption in favour of bail for people
alleged to have offended while on bail. It also
removes the right to bail for someone charged
with murder, manslaughter or rape if
previously convicted of the same offence.
Scotland
When arrested, an accused person in Scotland
may be released by the police to await
summons, on an undertaking to appear at
court at a specified time, or be held in custody
to appear at court on the next working day.
Following that appearance, the accused may be
remanded in custody until trial or released by
the. court on bail. If released on bail, the
accused must undertake to appear at trial when
required, not to commit an offence while on
bail, and not to interfere with witnesses or
obstruct the course of justice. The court may
also impose additional conditions on the
accused as appropriate (for example, to keep
away from certain people or locations).
There is a right of appeal to the High Court
by an accused person against the refusal of bail,
or by the prosecutor against the granting of bail,
or by either against the conditions imposed.
The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act
1995 gives the courts increased powers to
sentence a person who commits an offence
while on bail. A prison sentence may be
increased by up to six months; a fine by up to
£1,000. Bail will not be granted where an
accused person is charged with murder,
attempted murder, culpable homicide, rape or
attempted rape and has a previous conviction
for such a crime (in the case of culpable
homicide involving a prison sentence).
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland bail may be granted by a
resident magistrate except in cases dealt with
under emergency provisions, where the
decision is made by a judge of the High Court.
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution
England and Wales
Once the police have instituted criminal
proceedings against a person, the independent
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) takes
control of the case, reviews the evidence and
decides whether the case should be continued.
The CPS is headed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions, who is accountable to Parliament
through the Attorney General. It is divided into
13 geographical areas, each headed by a Chief
Crown Prosecutor, and below these there are 99
branches. A 14th area (Central Casework)
operates from London and York. Each branch
has a number of teams, responsible for casework
from particular police divisions and feeding into
particular courts. Central Casework deals with
some especially sensitive cases, including
terrorist offences and breaches of the Official
Secrets Act.
A prosecution will proceed only if the
prosecutor is satisfied that there is, on the
evidence, a realistic prospect of conviction, and
if so, that it is in the public interest for the
prosecution to proceed.
Scotland
The Lord Advocate is responsible for
prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary,
sheriff courts and district courts. Private
prosecutions are extremely rare. The High
Court of Justiciary will only grant the right to
prosecute to a private person in very exceptional
cases. The Lord Advocate is advised by the
Crown Agent, who is head of the Procurator
Fiscal Service and is assisted in the Crown
Office by a staff of legally qualified civil servants.
Prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary
are prepared by procurators fiscal and Crown
Office officials. They are conducted by the
Lord Advocate, the Solicitor General for
94
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Scotland (the Lord Advocate’s ministerial
deputy) and advocate deputes, collectively
known as Crown Counsel.
Crimes tried before the sheriff and district
courts are prepared and prosecuted by
procurators fiscal. The police and other law
enforcement agencies investigate crimes and
offences and report to the fiscal, who decides
whether to prosecute, subject to the directions
of Crown Counsel.
When dealing with minor crime, the fiscal
can use alternatives to prosecution, such as
formal warnings or diversion to social work.
The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995
extends the range of minor offences to which
fiscal fines may apply.
Northern Ireland
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, appointed by the Attorney
General, prosecutes all offences tried on
indictment and may do so in other (summary)
cases. Most summary offences are prosecuted
by the police.
Prosecutions for Fraud
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutes the most
serious and complex cases of fraud in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Investigations are
conducted by teams of lawyers, accountants,
police officers and other specialists. In Scotland
the Crown Office Fraud Unit, which is part of
the public prosecution service, directs the
investigation and preparation for prosecution of
serious and complex fraud cases.
Courts
England and Wales
Very serious offences such as murder,
manslaughter, rape and robbery can only be
tried on indictment in the Crown Court, where
all contested trials are presided over by a judge
sitting with a jury. Summary offences—the
less serious offences and the vast majority of
criminal cases—are tried by unpaid lay
magistrates (see below) or, in a few areas, by a
single paid stipendiary magistrate; both sit
without a jury.
Offences in a third category—such as theft,
the less serious cases of burglary and some
assaults—are known as ‘either-way’ offences.
They can be tried either by magistrates or by
jury in the Crown Court. If magistrates are
content to deal with the case, the accused has
the right to choose trial by magistrates or trial
by jury in the Crown Court.
All those charged with offences triable in
the Crown Court must first appear before a
magistrates’ court, which decides whether to
commit them to the Court for trial.
Modifications to the existing committal
procedures are due to be implemented in 1997.
Under the modified system a magistrates’
court will consider only documentary evidence
and exhibits tendered by the prosecution,
together with representations by both parties,
when determining whether there is a case to
answer. No witnesses are called to give
evidence or be cross-examined. Existing
procedures for transferring cases of serious or
complex fraud or cases involving child
evidence are not affected by the legislation.
The Government has been concerned that
too many cases that could properly be tried in
magistrates’ courts go instead to the Crown
Court. This causes delay in hearing cases,
increased stress on victims and witnesses, and
unnecessary additional expense for the
criminal justice agencies. Under the Criminal
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 a
defendant will be invited to indicate his or her
plea before the magistrates decide whether
they should hear the case or whether it should
be heard in the Crown Court.
A magistrates’ court, which is open to the
public and the media, usually consists of three
lay magistrates—known as Justices of the
Peace—who are advised by a legally qualified
clerk or a qualified assistant. There are about
30,000 lay magistrates serving some 400 courts.
The few full-time, legally qualified stipendiary
magistrates may sit alone and usually preside in
courts where the workload is heavy.
Most cases involving people under 18 are
heard in youth courts. These are specialist
magistrates’ courts which either sit apart from
other courts or are held at a different time.
Restrictions are placed on access by ordinary
members of the public. Media reports must not
identify a young person concerned in the
proceedings, whether as defendant, victim or
witness.
95
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICI AL HANDBOOK
Where a young person under 18 is charged
jointly with someone aged 18 or over, the case
may be heard in an ordinary magistrates’ court
or the Crown Court. If the young person is
found guilty, the court may transfer the case to
a youth court for sentence.
An independent inspectorate monitors the
administration of magistrates’ courts in order
to improve performance and spread good
practice. It does not comment on the judicial
decisions of magistrates or their clerks in
particular cases.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues
and is presided over by High Court judges,
full-time circuit judges and part-time
recorders. The kind of judge chosen to preside
over a case depends on its complexity and
seriousness. Crown Court organisation is based
on six regional areas called circuits.
Charter for Court Users
A Courts Charter, setting out the standards of
service in the High Court, Crown Court and
county courts in England and Wales, came into
operation in 1993. A new Charter for Court
Users was launched in 1995, which increased
the number of standards from 65 to 79 and
tightened some of the existing ones. The new
standards cover areas such as witness and juror
care, and correspondence and complaints
handling. The Charter does not cover the
judiciary. Magistrates’ courts are also developing
their own charters, based on similar principles to
the Courts Charter for the higher courts.
Scotland
The High Court of Justiciary tries the most
serious crimes and has exclusive jurisdiction in
cases involving murder, treason and rape. The
sheriff court is concerned with relatively less
serious offences and the district court with
minor offences.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard under
solemn or summary procedure. In solemn
procedure, an accused person’s trial takes place
before a judge sitting with a jury of 15 people.
As in England and Wales, details of the alleged
offence are set out in a document called an
indictment. In summary procedure the judge
sits without a jury.
All cases in the High Court and the more
serious ones in sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Summary procedure is used in
the less serious cases in the sheriff courts, and
in all cases in the district courts. District court
judges are lay Justices of the Peace. In Glasgow
there are also stipendiary magistrates, who are
full-time lawyers with the same powers as a
sheriff in summary procedure.
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence are normally dealt with by children’s
hearings (see p. 26).
The levels of service which citizens are
entitled to expect from the main criminal
justice agencies are set out in the Justice
Charter for Scotland.
Northern Ireland
Cases involving minor summary offences are
heard by magistrates’ courts presided over by a
full-time, legally qualified resident magistrate.
Young offenders under 17 are dealt with by a
juvenile court consisting of the resident
magistrate and two specially qualified lay
members, at least one of whom must be a
woman.
The Crown Court deals with criminal trials
on indictment. It is served by High Court and
county court judges. Contested cases are heard
by a judge and jury, although people charged
with terrorist-type offences are tried by a judge
sitting alone because of the possibility of jurors
being intimidated by terrorist organisations.
In non-jury Crown Court trials the onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt and defendants have
the right to be represented by a lawyer of their
choice. The judge must set out in a written
statement the reasons for convicting and there
is an automatic right of appeal against
conviction and sentence on points of fact as
well as of law.
Criminal trials in Britain have two parties: the
prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved by the prosecution.
An accused person has the right to employ a
legal adviser and may be granted legal aid from
Trial
96
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
public funds (see p. 113). If remanded in
custody, he or she may be visited by a legal
adviser to ensure a properly prepared defence.
Pre-Trial Preparation
The Criminal Procedure and Investigations
Act 1996 (mainly applicable in England and
Wales but also to some extent in Northern
Ireland) provides for reform of the law on
prosecution and defence disclosure of
evidence, and other measures to improve
pre-trial procedures. At present the
prosecution in Crown Court cases must
disclose to the defence any material that may
possibly be relevant to an issue in the case,
unless the material is sensitive and a court
rules that it may be withheld. In contrast, the
accused generally need not disclose anything
about his or her defence before the trial. Under
the new legislation clear limits will be placed
on what the police and prosecution disclose to
the defence, and sensitive material will be
protected more effectively. The defence will
also be required to disclose before the trial the
general nature of its case, and the matters on
which it takes issue with the prosecution, with
its reasons. Defence disclosure will be
mandatory in the Crown Court, but voluntary
in the magistrates’ court. This part of the Act
applies to Northern Ireland.
The legislation will also:
• create a statutory scheme for pre-trial
hearings in the Crown Court in England
and Wales, with the aim of ensuring that
potentially difficult cases come to court as
thoroughly prepared and as well presented
as they can be; and
• give judges a new power to make a
binding ruling on the admissibility of
evidence or other point of law in any case
before the start of a trial.
Other measures to improve pre-trial
preparation in the Crown Court in England
and Wales include a new scheme of plea and
directions hearings. These short hearings
provide an opportunity for judges to ensure
that cases are properly prepared and that cases
which are likely to be uncontested are dealt
with quickly.
In Scotland, the prosecution in solemn
cases must give the defence advance notice of
the witnesses it intends to call and of the
documents and other items on which it will
rely. In summary cases this is usually done as a
matter of practice, although there is no
obligation on the Crown to do so. The
Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995
strengthens the procedures for judicial
examination of the accused person before trial,
introducing an enhanced system of
intermediate diets (sittings of the sheriff and
district courts in advance of the trial) to
establish the state of readiness of both the
defence and the prosecution. Mandatory
intermediate diets in summary cases have been
in force in most Scottish courts since April
1996.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court and rules of evidence, which are
concerned with the proof of facts, are
rigorously applied. If evidence is improperly
admitted, or excluded, a conviction can be
quashed on appeal. In Scotland hearsay
evidence may be admitted in particular
circumstances.
During the trial the defendant has the right
to hear and cross-examine prosecution
witnesses. He or she can call his or her own
witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to do so.
The defendant can also address the court in
person or through a lawyer, the defence having
the right to the last speech before the judge
sums up.
The defendant cannot be questioned
without consenting to be sworn as a witness in
his or her own defence, although a court in
England and Wales may draw inferences from a
refusal to give evidence (see p. 92). Similar
provision exists in Northern Ireland. When a
defendant does testify, he or she may be
cross-examined about character or other conduct
only in exceptional circumstances. Generally the
prosecution may not introduce such evidence.
In Scotland, the Criminal Procedure
(Scotland) Act 1995 removes the prohibition
on the prosecutor to comment on an accused
person’s failure to give evidence. Cross-
examination about the character or other
97
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
conduct of the accused may be made in certain
circumstances.
Child Witnesses
Legislation in 1988 abolished the presumption
in England and Wales that children were
incompetent as witnesses. It also introduced
the system which allows children to give their
evidence at court by means of a closed-circuit
television link. Building on that, the Criminal
Justice Act 1991 extended the closed-circuit
television provisions, forbade the cross-
examination of a child directly by the
accused, and provided for a video-recorded
interview with a child victim or witness to be
admissible in court as his or her main
evidence. The Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 further clarifies the law on
child evidence in England and Wales, by
requiring judges to admit the evidence of a
child unless he or she is incapable of giving
intelligible testimony. It is for the jury to
decide what weight should be placed on a
child’s evidence. The provisions in the 1991
and 1994 Acts were replicated for Northern
Ireland in legislation passed in 1995.
In Scotland live television links installed in
a number of criminal courts enable children to
give their evidence without entering the
courtroom. A child’s evidence may also be
given from behind a screen in the courtroom.
There is also provision for a child to give
video-recorded evidence before or during the
trial. The child who has given evidence in this
manner is not subject to cross-examination on
that evidence in court.
Fraud Proceedings
In complex fraud cases the judge may order a
preparatory Crown Court hearing to be held.
This takes place in open court but is subject
to restrictions on press reporting. This
provides an opportunity for the judge to
determine questions on admissibility of
evidence and any other questions of law
relating to the case. The judge also has the
power to order the prosecution and the
defence to provide each other with certain
statements and to prepare the case in such a
way that it is easier to understand. Appeals
may be made to the Court of Appeal
regarding certain decisions of the judge in
the preparatory hearings.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the evidence for the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, the latter
resulting in acquittal. If the jury cannot reach a
unanimous decision the judge may allow a
majority verdict provided that, in the normal
jury of 12 people, there are no more than two
dissenters.
In Scotland the jury’s verdict may be ‘guilty’,
‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the accused is
acquitted if either of the last two verdicts is
given. The jury consists of 15 people and a
verdict of‘guilty’ can be reached only if at least
eight members are in favour. As a general rule
no one may be convicted without corroborated
evidence from at least two sources.
If the jury acquits the defendant, the
prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence (although the provisions of the
Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act
1996 will enable a retrial in England, Wales or
Northern Ireland of a case which resulted in an
acquittal if the acquittal had been tainted by a
conviction for interference with, or
intimidation of, jurors or witnesses).
A jury is independent of the judiciary. Any
attempt to interfere with a jury is a criminal
offence. Potential jurors are put on a panel
before the start of the trial. In England and
Wales the prosecution and the defence may
challenge individual jurors on the panel, giving
reasons for doing so. In Northern Ireland each
defendant has the right to challenge up to 12
potential jurors without giving a reason. In
Scotland, new legislation provides for improved
procedures for the selection of juries, including
the abolition of peremptory challenge.
People between the ages of 18 and 70 (65 in
Scotland) whose names appear on the electoral
register are, with certain exceptions, liable for
jury service and their names are chosen at
random. Ineligible people include judges and
98
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
people who have within the previous ten years
been members of the legal profession or the
police, prison or probation services. People
convicted of certain offences within the previous
ten years cannot serve on a jury. Anyone who
has received a prison sentence of five years or
more is disqualified for life. People on bail are
also ineligible to sit on juries.
Sentencing
If a person is convicted, the magistrate or
judge (or their Scottish equivalent) decides on
the most appropriate sentence, taking into
account the facts of the offence, the
circumstances of the offender, any previous
convictions or sentences and any statutory
limits on sentencing. The defence lawyer may
make a speech in mitigation.
Courts in England and Wales must obtain a
‘pre-sentence’ report from the probation
service on offenders under the age of 18 in
cases involving an offence triable either way
before passing a custodial or more complex
community sentence. In most other
circumstances, such reports are discretionary.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 provides for sentence discounts for those
pleading guilty at an early stage in the court
process in England and Wales.
Protecting the Public, a White Paper
issued in April 1996, contains new
sentencing proposals under which:
• offenders sentenced to custody
would serve the full term ordered
by the court, abolishing
automatic early release and
parole (see p. 104);
• automatic life sentences would be
imposed on offenders convicted
for a second time of a serious
sexual or violent offence; and
• mandatory minimum prison
sentences would be imposed on
drug dealers and burglars for
repeat offences.
In Scottish cases a court must obtain a social
enquiry report before imposing a custodial
sentence if the accused is under 21 or has not
previously served a custodial sentence. A report
is also required before making a probation or
community service order (see p. 102), or in cases
involving people subject to supervision.
The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act
1995 makes provision for the High Court to
issue guidelines on sentencing to the lower
courts, encouraging consistency in sentencing
in similar cases. The legislation also enables
courts to take into account, when deciding the
appropriate sentence, the fact that an accused
person pleaded guilty, and the timing and
circumstances in which the plea was made.
Appeals
England and Wales
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the Crown Court against the
sentence if he or she has pleaded guilty. An
appeal may be made against both conviction
and sentence, or sentence alone, if a ‘not
guilty’ plea has been made. The High Court
hears appeals on points of law and
procedure—by either prosecution or
defence—in cases originally dealt with by
magistrates. If convicted by the Crown Court,
a defendant may seek leave to appeal to the
Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) against
both the conviction and the sentence imposed.
The House of Lords is the final appeal court,
but will only consider cases that involve a point
of law of general public importance and where
leave to appeal is granted.
The Attorney General (see p. Ill) may seek
a ruling of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law which has been material in a case where a
person is tried on indictment. The Court has
.power to refer the point to the House of Lords
if necessary. The ruling will constitute a
binding precedent, but an acquittal in the
original case is not affected.
The Attorney General can apply for leave
to refer to the Court of Appeal a sentence
which, in his or her view, appears unduly
lenient. This power covers offences triable on
indictment and certain offences triable either
way (where sentence has been passed in the
Crown Court). Such triable ‘either-way’
offences are indecent assault, making threats to
99
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
kill, and cruelty to, or neglect of, a child. The
Attorney General’s power also covers certain
types of serious or complex fraud. The Court
of Appeal may, if it decides to quash the
original sentence, impose in its place any
sentence which the original sentencing court
had the power to impose.
The Criminal Appeal Act 1995 provides
for the creation of a Criminal Cases Review
Commission to operate in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. This body,
independent of both Government and the
courts, will examine possible miscarriages of
justice in cases tried on indictment or
summarily and decide whether to refer them
to the courts on the grounds of sentence and
conviction. It will direct and supervise
investigations undertaken on its behalf and
approve the appointment of investigating
officers. Referral of a case will require some
new argument or evidence not previously
raised at the trial or on appeal.
The final decision on any case referred rests
with the respective Courts of Appeal in
England and Wales and Northern Ireland (if
the case was tried originally on indictment) or
with the Crown Court following a referral in a
summary case. The power of the Home
Secretary (and the Secretary of State in
Northern Ireland) to investigate and refer
possible miscarriages of justice to the Court of
Appeal is being relinquished.
The legislation also clarifies the grounds for
allowing and dismissing an appeal: the Court
of Appeal will allow any appeal where it
considers the conviction unsafe and will
dismiss it in any other case.
Scotland
All appeal cases are dealt with by the High
Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, a convicted person may
appeal against conviction, or sentence, or both.
The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets
aside a conviction. There is no further appeal
to the House of Lords. In summary
proceedings the prosecutor may appeal on a
point of law against acquittal or sentence. The
Lord Advocate may seek the opinion of the
High Court on a point of law in a case where a
person tried on indictment is acquitted. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected.
The Crown has a right of appeal against
lenient sentences in both solemn and summary
procedure.
The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act
1995 introduces a requirement for leave to
appeal. This involves a single judge assessing
whether there are arguable grounds for an
appeal. The legislation also reduces the
number of High Court judges required to
consider appeals against sentence only from
three to two.
A person convicted on indictment may
petition the Secretary of State to refer the case
to the High Court on the ground that a
miscarriage of justice has occurred. If the case
is referred, then it will be dealt with as though
it were a normal appeal.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, appeals from magistrates’
courts against conviction or sentence are heard
by the county court. An appeal on a point of
law alone can be heard by the Northern Ireland
Court of Appeal, which also hears appeals
from the Crown Court against conviction
and/or sentence. Procedures for a further
appeal to the House of Lords are similar to
those in England and Wales.
A person convicted of a terrorist offence in
a non-jury court has an automatic right of
appeal against conviction and/or sentence.
The new Criminal Cases Review
Commission (see above) will operate in
Northern Ireland as well as in England and
Wales.
Coroners’ Courts
In England and Wales the coroner must hold
an inquest if the deceased died a violent or
unnatural death, a sudden death where the
cause is unknown, or in prison or in other
specified circumstances. In Northern Ireland
in such circumstances the coroner investigates
the matter to decide whether an inquest is
necessary. The coroner’s court establishes
how, when and where the deceased died. A
coroner may sit alone or, in certain
circumstances, with a jury.
In Scotland the local procurator fiscal
100
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings
to the Crown Office. When appropriate a fatal
accident inquiry may be held before the
sheriff; this is mandatory in cases of death
resulting from industrial accidents and of
deaths in custody.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The Government believes that prison is the
right response to the most serious, dangerous
and persistent offenders. It also considers that
there should be effective and demanding
punishment within the community to deal
with offenders for whom a prison sentence is
not appropriate. Fines continue to represent an
appropriate penalty for other less serious
offences.
Legislation sets the maximum penalties for
offences, the sentence being a matter for the
courts subject to these maximums (but see
p. 99 for Government proposals on mandatory
sentences for persistent offenders). The Court
of Appeal issues guidance on sentencing to the
lower courts when points of principle have
arisen on individual appeal cases.
In Scotland, where many offences are not
created by statute, the penalty for offences at
common law ranges from absolute discharge to
life imprisonment.
Non-custodial Treatment
Non-custodial sentences include:
• fines;
• compensation orders;
• probation orders;
• supervision orders;
• community service orders;
• a combination order, which includes
elements of probation and community
service; and
• a supervised attendance order (Scotland
only).
Fines
About 80 per cent of offenders are punished
with a fine. There is no limit to the fine
which the Crown Court (and High Court of
Justiciary and the sheriff court in Scotland
under solemn procedure) may impose on
indictment. The maximum fine that can be
imposed by a magistrates’ court in England
and Wales (and a sheriff court in Scotland
under summary procedure) is £5,000. When
fixing the amount of a fine, courts are
required to reflect the seriousness of the
offence and to take into account the financial
circumstances of the offender.
Probation
The locally organised probation service in
England and Wales supervises offenders in the
community under direct court orders and after
release from custody. It also provides offenders
in custody with help and advice.
A court probation order requires the
offender to maintain regular contact with the
probation officer, who is expected to supervise
the offender and to confront him or her with
the consequences of his or her offence. Special
conditions attached to the order may require
the offender to attend a day centre for up to 60
days. Probation is intended as a punishment,
although the time spent by offenders under
supervision in the community offers an
opportunity for constructive work to reduce
the likelihood of reoffending.
A probation order can last from six months
to three years; if the offender fails to comply
with any of the requirements of the order, he
or she can be brought before the court again. A
probation order can be combined with a
community service order.
In England and Wales the probation service
also administers supervision orders, and the
community service scheme, and supervises
those released from prison on parole.
The statutory Probation Inspectorate
monitors the work of the voluntary and private
sectors with the probation service, in addition
to its inspection and advisory duties.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation
and community service, and offenders who are
subject to supervision when released from
custody.
In Northern Ireland the service is
administered by the government-funded
101
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Community Service
In England and Wales offenders aged 16 or
over convicted of imprisonable offences may,
with their consent, be given community
service orders. The court may order between
40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service to be
completed within 12 months. Examples of
work done include decorating the houses of
elderly or disabled people and building
adventure playgrounds. In Scotland the
minimum number of hours for which a
community service order can be made has
been increased from 40 to 80 and the
maximum, in higher courts, from 240
to 300.
In England and Wales the court may make
an order combining community service and
probation. In Scotland a probation order may
include a condition of unpaid work.
Curfew Order
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 provides for the use of curfew orders with
electronic monitoring in selected areas in
England and Wales. Courts in the trial areas
can require offenders to remain at home for
periods of between two and 12 hours a day.
The order can be combined with probation or
community service. A decision on whether to
extend the order to courts throughout England
and Wales will be taken in the light of
extended trials.
Supervised Attendance Order
In Scotland supervised attendance order
schemes have been piloted in a number of
areas. They provide an alternative to
imprisonment for fine default, and incorporate
aspects of work and training. Their use is
being extended to form an alternative in the
first instance to fines for young offenders.
Compensation
The courts may order an offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence. In England
and Wales courts must give reasons for not
awarding compensation to a victim.
Compensation takes precedence over
fines.
Other Measures
A court in England and Wales may discharge a
person either absolutely or conditionally if it
believes that it is not necessary to inflict
punishment. If conditionally discharged, the
offender remains liable to punishment for the
offence if convicted of another offence within a
period specified by the court (not more than
three years).
Courts may also require an offender to keep
the peace and/or be of good behaviour. If this
requirement is not complied with, the offender
is liable to forfeit a sum of money. Similar
powers are available to courts in Northern
Ireland.
Courts have the power to defer sentence, so
as to enable the court, in subsequent dealings
with the offender, to have regard to his or her
conduct or any changes in circumstances.
The police have discretion whether to
charge an offender or formally to caution him
or her. Cautioning is a form of warning and no
court action is taken. New guidelines designed
to stop the use of cautions for serious offences
and to cut the number of repeated cautions
were published by the Government in 1994.
Cautioning is not available in Scotland.
Custody
England and Wales
A custodial sentence is the most severe penalty
available to the courts. It is imposed where the
offence is so serious that only such a sentence
would be appropriate, or where there is a need
to protect the public from a sexual or violent
offender. A court must explain to the offender
why it is passing a custodial sentence. The
length of the sentence must reflect the
seriousness of the offence.
A magistrates’ court cannot impose a term
of more than six months’ imprisonment for an
individual offence tried summarily. It can
impose consecutive sentences for ‘either-way’
offences, subject to an overall maximum of 12
102
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
months’ imprisonment. If an offence carries a
higher maximum penalty, the court may
commit the offender for sentence at the Crown
Court. The Crown Court may impose a
custodial sentence for any term up to life,
depending on the seriousness of the offence
and the maximum penalty available.
If a court decides that an offence is
sufficiently serious to justify an immediate
custodial sentence of not more than two years,
the sentence may be suspended for a period of at
least one year and not more than two years if
exceptional circumstances justify the suspension.
If the offender commits another imprisonable
offence during the period of suspension, the
court may order the suspended sentence to be
served in addition to any punishment imposed
for the second offence. When passing a
suspended sentence, the court must consider
whether it would also be appropriate to impose a
fine or make a compensation order. The court
may also order the offender to be supervised by a
probation officer if the suspended sentence is for
more than six months.
There is a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment for murder throughout Britain.
Life imprisonment is the maximum penalty for
a number of serious offences such as robbery,
rape, arson and manslaughter.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the position is generally
the same as for England and Wales. A
magistrates’ court, however, cannot commit an
offender for sentencing at the Crown Court if
it has tried the case.
Scotland
In Scottish trials on indictment the High
Court of Justiciary may impose a sentence of
imprisonment for any term up to life, and the
sheriff court any term up to three years. The
sheriff court may send any person to the High
Court for sentence if the court considers its
powers are insufficient. In summary cases the
sheriff or stipendiary magistrate may normally
impose up to three months’ imprisonment or
six months’ for some repeated offences. The
district court can impose a maximum term of
imprisonment of 60 days.
Prisons
The Prison Service in England and Wales, the
Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
agencies (see p. 73). Government ministers
remain accountable for policy but the Chief
Executives are responsible for the delivery of
services.
Prisoners are housed in accommodation
ranging from open prisons to high security
establishments. In England, Wales and
Scotland sentenced prisoners are classified into
different risk-level groups for security
purposes. Women prisoners are held in
separate prisons or in separate accommodation
in mixed prisons. There are no open prisons in
Northern Ireland, where the majority of
offenders are serving sentences for terrorist
offences. People awaiting trial in custody have
certain rights and privileges not granted to
convicted prisoners. Where possible, they are
separated from prisoners who have been
convicted and sentenced.
There are 134 prison establishments in
England and Wales and 22 in Scotland. Thirty
eight establishments in England and Wales
hold young offenders (22 of which are
dedicated to young offenders only) and five
cater for them in Scotland. Northern Ireland
has four prisons and one young offenders’
centre. Four of these establishments have been
built since 1972.
Although many prisons were built in the
19th century, a major refurbishment and
prison-building programme in England and
Wales over recent years has led to
improvements in prison conditions. All
prisoners in England and Wales now have
access to sanitation 24 hours a day, as do an
increasing proportion (currently two-thirds) in
Scotland.
The average prison population in 1995 was
51,000 in England and Wales, 5,626 in
Scotland and 1,762 in Northern Ireland.
Private Sector Involvement
Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the
Home Secretary has the power to contract out
the management of prisons in England and
Wales to the private sector, as well as escort
103
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and guarding functions. All escort services will
be provided by the private sector by 1997,
leaving police and prison officers free to
concentrate on their own core duties.
Four prisons (which remain part of the
Prison Service) are now managed by private
contractors: The Wolds in Humberside, which
opened in 1992; Blakenhurst prison in
Worcestershire, which opened in 1993; and
Doncaster prison and Buckley Hall prison in
Rochdale, which opened in 1994. The first
three prisons to be designed, constructed,
managed and financed under the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI—see p. 162) are
expected to be in full operation in 1998-99 in
Merseyside, Nottinghamshire and South
Wales.
The Prison Service is also continuing to
contract out services both nationally and
locally, including education services in prison
and catering.
In Scotland education services in prisons
are contracted out, and a new prison near
Kilmarnock is to be built and managed under
the PFI.
Early Release of Prisoners
The remission and parole systems in England
and Wales were reformed by the Criminal
Justice Act 1991, with revised arrangements
for the early release of prisoners and for their
supervision and liabilities after release. The
Parole Board continues to advise the Home
Secretary on the early release or recall of
long-term prisoners.
At present prisoners sentenced to less
than four years are released once they have
served half of their sentence. Long-term
prisoners (those sentenced to four years or
more) become eligible to be considered for
early release once they have served half of
their sentence; if not found suitable for
parole they are released automatically at the
two-thirds point. The Parole Board has the
final decision on the early release of prisoners
sentenced to four years or more, but less than
seven years, after 1 October 1992 (when the
1991 Act came into effect). In other cases the
Board makes a recommendation to the Home
Secretary about a prisoner’s suitability for
parole. All prisoners sentenced to a year or
more are released on licence to be supervised
until the three-quarters point of the
sentence. If ordered by the sentencing court,
sex offenders may be supervised to the end of
the sentence. If convicted of another offence
punishable with imprisonment and
committed before the end of the original
sentence, a released prisoner may be required
by the court to serve all or part of the original
sentence outstanding at the time the fresh
offence was committed.
In Scotland similar arrangements apply
except that the Parole Board has the power to
release prisoners from halfway through their
sentence if they are serving between four and
ten years. Those serving ten years or more may
only be released with the consent of the
Secretary of State. All prisoners sentenced to
four years or more are supervised from release
until the end of their sentence.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a
sentence of more than five days are eligible for
remission of half their sentence. Remission for
those convicted of terrorist offences and
serving sentences of five years or more is
one-third. However, under legislation in force
since November 1995, prisoners have been
eligible for release at the halfway point in their
sentence but remain under licence (until the
two-thirds point) and may be subject to recall
during that period. If convicted of another
terrorist offence before the expiry of the
original sentence the prisoner must complete
that sentence before serving any term for the
second offence.
In Protecting the Public (see p. 99), the
Government proposed major changes to the
arrangements for the early release of prisoners
in England and Wales. Offenders sentenced to
custody would serve the full term ordered by
the court, and automatic early release and
parole would be abolished. Instead, offenders
who co-operated with the prison regime and
behaved well would be able to earn up to 20
per cent off their sentence. On release,
offenders sentenced to 12 months or more
would be supervised by the probation service
for a period equivalent to 15 per cent of their
original prison sentence.
Similar changes have been proposed in
Scotland.
104
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Life Sentence Prisoners
People serving life sentences for the murder of
police or prison officers, terrorist murders,
murder by firearms in the course of robbery
and the sexual or sadistic murder of children
are normally detained for at least 20 years.
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may only
be authorised by the Home Secretary on the
recommendation of the Parole Board and after
consultation with the judiciary. A similar
policy applies in Scotland.
The Home Secretary is required to release
prisoners serving life sentences for offences
other than murder after an initial period set by
the trial judge if so directed by the Parole
Board. The Board has to be satisfied that the
protection of the public does not require their
further confinement. These provisions
conform with the requirements of the
European Convention on Human Rights.
Similar procedures apply in Scotland.
On release, life sentence prisoners remain
on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall if their behaviour suggests that
they might again be a danger to the public.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
reviews life sentence cases on the
recommendation of an internal review body.
Repatriation
Sentenced prisoners who are nationals of
countries which have ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on the Transfer of
Sentenced Persons, or similar international
arrangements, may apply to be returned to
their own country to serve the rest of their
sentence there.
Independent Oversight of the Prison System
Every prison establishment and young
offender institution in England and Wales has
a board of visitors (a visiting committee in
Scotland). They are volunteers drawn from the
local community and appointed by the
Secretary of State. Board members, who are
independent of the prison and the Prison
Service, visit the prison frequently, hear any
complaints by prisoners and report as
necessary to the Secretary of State.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report to
the respective Secretaries of State on the
treatment of prisoners and prison conditions.
Each establishment is visited about every three
years. The Inspectorates submit annual reports
to Parliament.
In England and Wales prisoners who fail to
get satisfaction from the Prison Service’s
internal request and complaints system may
complain to the Prisons Ombudsman. The
Ombudsman is independent of the Prison
Service and investigates complaints from
individual prisoners concerning decisions
relating to them which have been taken by
Prison Service staff, or other people working
in prisons.
In Scotland, prisoners who exhaust the
internal grievance procedure may make
application to the Scottish Prisons Complaints
Commission, which is independent of the
Scottish Prison Service.
Prison Industries
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will assist them when
released and to secure a return which will
reduce the cost of the prison system. The main
industries are clothing and textile
manufacture, engineering, woodwork,
laundering, farming and horticulture. A few
prisoners are employed outside prison, some in
community service projects.
Prison Education
Full-time education of 15 hours a week is
compulsory for young offenders below school
leaving age. For older offenders it is voluntary.
Many prisoners study for public examinations,
including those of the Open University.
Competitive tendering for the provision of
education services in prisons in England,
Wales and Scotland has taken place and
contracts have been awarded, many to further
and higher education establishments. There
are also some facilities available for prisoners to
gain vocational qualifications.
Physical education is voluntary for adult
offenders but compulsory for young offenders.
Practically all prisons have physical education
facilities, some of which are purpose-built.
105
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Opportunities are given for inmates to obtain
sporting proficiency awards. Inmates also
compete against teams in the local community.
Health Care
The Health Care Service for Prisoners in
England and Wales is responsible for the
physical and mental health of all those in
custody. A Health Advisory Committee
provides independent medical advice to
government ministers, the Prison Service Chief
Executive and the Director of Health Care.
A greater emphasis is being placed on
‘buying in’ health care services either from the
National Health Service (NHS—see p. 397) or
from the independent sector.
The Prison Service is committed to
transferring mentally disordered offenders to
the care and treatment of the NHS and social
services where possible. The most dangerous
offenders in this category are confined in the
special hospitals of Ashworth, Rampton and
Broadmoor.
In Scotland general medical services are
provided mainly by visiting general
practitioners (GPs). Psychiatric and
psychological services are bought in from local
health boards responsible for the NHS.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners may write and receive letters and be
visited by relatives and friends, and those in all
establishments in England, Wales and
Scotland may make telephone calls. Privileges
include a personal radio; books, periodicals and
newspapers; watching television; and the
opportunity to buy goods from the prison shop
with money earned in prison. Depending on
the facilities available, prisoners may be
granted the further privileges of dining and
recreation with other inmates.
To maintain discipline, control and order
the Prison Service in England and Wales is:
• developing incentive-based regimes, so
that prisoners must earn privileges
through responsible behaviour and will
lose them for misbehaviour;
• providing special units with facilities for
dealing with violent or disruptive
prisoners; and
• implementing a comprehensive strategy
on drug misuse, including mandatory
drug testing.
Offences against prison discipline are dealt
with by prison governors who act as
adjudicators.
Religion
Anglican, Church of Scotland, Roman
Catholic and Methodist chaplains provide
opportunities for worship and spiritual
counselling, supported by visiting ministers of
other denominations and faiths as required.
Preparation for Release
The Prison Services in England and Wales and
in Scotland have a duty to prepare prisoners
for release. Planning for safe release starts at
the beginning of an offender’s sentence and
ties in with all the training, education and
work experience provided. It is designed to
help prisoners reintegrate into society and cope
with life without reoffending. Risk assessment
and confronting offending behaviour are
essential elements of this process. Sentence
planning is being extended progressively to all
prisoners serving substantial sentences, in
conjunction with extended arrangements for
aftercare.
Prisoners may be released on temporary
licence for short periods but, under a new
system introduced in England and Wales in
April 1995, they are subject to a rigorous risk
assessment and are released only for precisely
defined and specific activities which cannot be
provided in Prison Service establishments.
Similar arrangements are in place in Scotland.
The Pre-Release Employment Scheme in
England and Wales and the Training for
Freedom Scheme in Scotland enable selected
long-term prisoners to spend some time before
release in certain hostels attached to prisons in
order to help them readapt to society.
Hostellers work in paid employment in the
community and return to the hostel each
evening. Periods of temporary release on
resettlement licence enable hostellers to renew
ties with their families.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving fixed
sentences may have short periods of
106
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
pre-release home leave. Prisoners who have
served 11 years or more are also eligible for
leave at Christmas and a seven-day allowance
to be taken during the year. Life sentence
prisoners are given a nine-month pre-release
programme which includes employment
outside the prison.
Aftercare
Professional support is given to offenders after
release. All young offenders and all adult
offenders in England and Wales sentenced to
12 months’ imprisonment and over are
supervised on release by the probation
service—or, in the case of certain young
offenders, by local authority social services
departments. In Scotland this support is
provided by local authority social work
services, although not all adult offenders are
subject to supervision on release. Offenders
sentenced to less than 12 months are not
subject to statutory supervision on release, but
probation service supervision is available on a
voluntary basis if the offender requests it.
Young Offenders
England and Wales
Criminal proceedings cannot be brought
against children below the age of 10. Offenders
between the ages of 10 and 18 fall within the
jurisdiction of youth courts. Sixteen- and
17-year-olds may be given the same probation,
curfew and community service orders as older
offenders; also available to the court are the
same supervision orders or attendance centre
orders as are given to younger offenders.
Under a supervision order—which may
remain in force for not more than three
years—a child (10-13 years old) or young
person (14—17 years old) normally lives at
home under the supervision of a social worker
or a probation officer. The order may require
the offender to live in local authority
accommodation and/or participate in specified
activities at specified times.
Anyone under 21 years of age found guilty
of an offence for which an adult may be
imprisoned can be ordered to go to an
attendance centre, as can an offender who
refuses to comply with another order (for
example, default in paying a fine or breach of a
probation order). The maximum number of
hours of attendance is 36 (or 24 if the offender
is aged under 16) spread over a period; the
minimum is 12 hours. The order aims to
encourage offenders to make more constructive
use of their leisure time.
Crown Court powers to order long periods
of detention for young offenders who commit
serious crimes are extended under the
provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 to include 10- to 13 -year-olds.
The courts may detain 10- to 13-year-olds
convicted of an offence for which an adult can
be jailed for 14 years or more (including rape,
arson, domestic burglary and robbery).
Previously they could be given long terms of
detention only if they had been convicted of
murder or manslaughter. Courts may also
detain any 10- to 15-year-old convicted of
indecent assault on a woman, where previously
only 16- and 17-year-olds could be detained
for this offence. Any offender aged 14 or over
who is convicted of causing death by
dangerous or drunken driving may also be
detained. Detention may be in a local authority
secure residential unit, a centre managed by
the Youth Treatment Service or a young
offender institution.
The basic custodial sentence for those aged
15 to 21 is detention in a young offender
institution. Alternatives include fines and
compensation, attendance centre orders and
community service orders.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 extends the powers given to the courts in
the area of parental responsibility. Under the
legislation courts can order parents to ensure
their children comply with community
sentences. In every case in which an offender
aged between 10 and 15 years receives a
community sentence, the court is under a duty
to consider such an order. Courts have a
power, as opposed to a duty, in the case of 16-
and 17-year-olds. Courts will also be
empowered to impose a secure training order
on persistent offenders aged between 12 and
14. The order means a period of detention in a
secure training centre followed by a period of
supervision; it will be available for young
offenders who have committed three or more
107
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
imprisonable offences and who have failed to
respond to punishment in the community.
(The order will be implemented once the new
secure training centres are available.) A further
provision doubles the maximum sentence for
15- to 17-year-olds in a young offender
institution from one to two years.
In September 1995 the Government
announced plans for a tough, disciplined and
demanding new regime for young offenders,
involving an intensive daily schedule of
training, education, work and other physical
activity, and designed to break the cycle of
reoffending. The initiative is being introduced
on a pilot basis in two young offender
institutions from mid-1996.
Scotland
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged eight years or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are
necessary before anyone under 16 years of age
is prosecuted.
Most children under 16 who have
committed an offence or are considered to be
in need of care and protection may be brought
before a children’s panel. The panel, consisting
of three lay people, determines in an informal
setting whether compulsory measures of care
are required and, if so, the form they should
take. An official known as the reporter decides
whether a child should come before a hearing.
If the grounds for referral are not accepted by
the child or parent, the case goes to the sheriff
for proof. If he or she finds the grounds
established, the sheriff remits the case to the
reporter to arrange a hearing. The sheriff also
decides appeals against a hearing’s decision.
Young people aged between 16 and 21 serve
custodial sentences in a young offender
institution. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Northern Ireland
Those aged between 10 and 16 who are
charged with a criminal offence are normally
brought before a juvenile court. If found guilty
of an offence punishable in the case of an adult
by imprisonment, the court may order the
offender to be placed in care, under
supervision or on probation. The offender may
also be required to attend a day attendance
centre, be sent to a training school or
committed to residence in a remand home.
Non-custodial options are the same as in
England and Wales.
Offenders aged between 16 and 24 who
receive custodial sentences of less than four
years detention serve them in a young
offenders’ centre.
Civil Justice
The Civil Law
The civil law of Englalnd, Wales and Northern
Ireland covers business related to the family,
property, contracts, and torts (non-contractual
wrongful acts suffered by one person at the
hands of another). It also includes
constitutional, administrative, industrial,
maritime and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil
law has its own, broadly similar, branches.
CIVIL COURTS
England and Wales
Civil cases are heard in county courts and the
High Court. Magistrates’ courts have a
concurrent jurisdiction with county courts and
the High Court in cases relating to children.
The jurisdiction of the 250 county courts
covers:
• actions founded upon contract and tort;
• trust and mortgage cases;
• actions for the recovery of land;
• cases involving disputes between
landlords and tenants;
• complaints about race and sex
discrimination;
• admiralty cases (maritime questions and
offences) and patent cases; and
• divorce cases and other family matters.
Specialised work is concentrated in certain
designated courts. In some types of case, for
108
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
example admiralty cases, a county court is
restricted to an upper financial limit.
For small claims (up to the value of
£3,000), there are special arbitration facilities
and simplified procedures. Special care
centres and family hearing centres deal
with contested family matters involving
children.
The High Court, which is divided into
three divisions, deals with the more
complicated civil cases. Its jurisdiction
covers mainly civil and some criminal cases;
it also deals with appeals from tribunals (see
p. Ill) and from magistrates’ courts in both
civil and criminal matters. The three
divisions are:
• the Family Division, which is concerned
with family law, including adoption and
divorce;
• the Chancery Division, which deals with
corporate and personal insolvency;
disputes in the running of companies,
between landlords and tenants and in
intellectual property matters; and the
interpretation of trusts and contested
wills; and
• the Queen’s Bench Division, which has a
wide and varied jurisdiction, including
contract and tort cases. It also deals with
applications for judicial review. Maritime
law and commercial law are the
responsibility of the Division’s admiralty
and commercial courts.
In the event of overlapping jurisdiction
between the High Court and the county
courts, cases of exceptional importance,
complexity or financial substance are
reserved or transferred for trial in the High
Court.
Appeals
Appeals in family cases which have been
heard by magistrates’ courts go to the Family
Division of the High Court. Appeals from
the High Court and county courts are heard
in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), and
may go on to the House of Lords (the final
national court of appeal in civil and criminal
cases).
The Law Lords deal with cases submitted
to the House of Lords. They are professional
judges who have been given life peerages (see
p. 53). A group of five judges usually deals
with cases. The Lord Chancellor is President
of the House in its judicial capacity.
Scotland
The civil courts in Scotland are the Court of
Session and the sheriff court, which have the
same jurisdiction over most civil litigation.
However, cases with a value of less than £1,500
are dealt with only by the sheriff court. Appeals
from the sheriff court may be made to the sheriff
principal or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh,
and in general has jurisdiction to deal with all
kinds of action. It is divided into the Outer
House (a court of first instance) and the Inner
House (mainly an appeal court). Appeals to the
Inner House may be made from the Outer
House and from the sheriff court. From the
Inner House an appeal may go to the House of
Lords.
The Scottish Land Court deals exclusively
with matters concerning agriculture. Its
chairman has the status and tenure of a judge
of the Court of Session and its other members
are lay specialists.
Northern Ireland
Civil cases up to a limited and specified
monetary value are dealt with in county courts.
The magistrates’ court in Northern Ireland
also deals with certain limited classes of civil
case. The superior civil law court is the High
Court of Justice, from which an appeal may be
made to the Court of Appeal. The House of
Lords is the final civil appeal court. Appeals
from county courts are dealt with by the High
Court or the Court of Appeal.
Civil Proceedings
England and Wales
Civil proceedings are started by the aggrieved
person. Actions in the High Court are usually
begun by a writ served on the defendant by the
plaintiff, stating the nature of the claim. Before
109
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the case is tried, documents (pleadings) setting
out the scope of the dispute are filed with the
court; the pleadings are also served on the
parties to the case. County court proceedings
are initiated by a summons, usually served on
the defendant by the court. Child care cases
are initiated by an application in the
magistrates’ courts.
The High Court and the county courts can
order pre-trial exchange of witness statements,
and may impose penalties in costs on parties
who unreasonably refuse to admit facts or to
disclose documents before trial.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can
usually be abandoned or ended by settlement
between the parties at any time. Actions
brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in defamation, false imprisonment
or malicious prosecution cases or where fraud
is alleged, when either party may apply for trial
by jury. The jury decides questions of fact and
determines the damages to be paid to the
injured party; majority verdicts may be
accepted. The Court of Appeal can increase or
reduce damages awarded by a jury if it
considers them inadequate or excessive.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in
open court, but a procedure for most
undefended cases dispenses with the need to
give evidence in court and permits written
evidence to be considered by the county court
district judge.
In civil cases heard by a magistrates’ court,
the court issues a summons to the defendant
setting out details of the complaint and the
date on which it will be heard. Parties and
witnesses give their evidence at the court
hearing. Family proceedings are normally
heard by not more than three lay justices,
including both men and women. Members of
the public are not allowed to be present. The
court may make orders concerning residence,
contact and supervision of children, and in
some cases maintenance payments for spouses
and children.
Most judgments are for sums of money and
may be enforced, in cases of non-payment, by
seizure of the debtor’s goods or by a court
order requiring an employer to make periodic
payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s earnings. Other court remedies may
include an injunction restraining someone
from performing an unlawful act. Refusal to
obey a court order may result in a fine or
imprisonment for contempt of court.
Normally the court orders the costs of an
action to be paid by the party losing it, but, in
the case of family law maintenance
proceedings, a magistrates’ court can order
either party to pay the whole or part of the
other’s costs.
Reform Proposals
The final report of a two-year inquiry into
access to civil justice in England and Wales
(the Woolf Report—see Further Reading) was
published in July 1996. The report proposes a
new system of case management where the
courts would take greater responsibility for the
progress of litigation. Its recommendations
include, among other things, detailed
proposals for:
• a new fast track procedure, with fixed
legal costs, for all personal injury cases up
to £10,000 and other cases between
£3,000 and £10,000;
• the use of pre-action protocols to
encourage a more co-operative approach
to the resolution of disputes and promote
fair settlements, avoiding litigation
wherever possible; and
• increased access to justice in several
special areas of litigation, including
medical negligence, housing, multi-party
actions and judicial review.
The report is accompanied by a draft of
new Civil Proceedings Rules, which would
harmonise and simplify procedures for all
High Court and county court cases and replace
the two separate rule books for the Supreme
Court and the county courts.
Scotland
Proceedings in the Court of Session or
ordinary actions in the sheriff court are
initiated by serving the defender with a
summons or, in sheriff court cases, an initial
writ. A defender who intends to contest the
action must inform the court; if he or she
fails to do so, the court normally grants a
110
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer.
Where a case is contested, both parties must
prepare written pleadings. Time is allowed
for either party to adjust their pleadings in
the light of what the other has said. At the
end of this period a hearing will normally be
arranged.
In cases involving sums between £750 and
£ 1,500 in the sheriff court, a statement of
claim is incorporated in the initial writ. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions to
be settled without the parties having to appear
in court. Normally they, or their
representatives, need appear only when an
action is defended.
Tribunals
Tribunals exercise judicial functions separate
from the courts and are intended to be more
accessible, less formal and less expensive. They
are normally set up under statutory powers,
which also govern their constitution, functions
and procedure. Tribunals often consist of lay
people, but they are generally chaired by a
legally qualified person.
Some tribunals settle disputes between
private citizens. Industrial tribunals, for
example, have a major role in employment
disputes. Others, such as those concerned with
social security, resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further
group, including tax tribunals, decide disputed
claims by public authorities against private
citizens. Tribunals usually consist of an
uneven number of people so that a majority
decision can be reached.
In the case of some tribunals a two-tier
system operates, with an initial right of appeal
to a lower tribunal and a further right of
appeal, usually on a point of law, to a higher
one, and in some cases to the Court of Appeal.
Appeals from single-tier tribunals can usually
be made only on a point of law to the High
Court in England and Wales, to the Court of
Session in Scotland, and to the Court of
Appeal in Northern Ireland.
The independent Council on Tribunals
exercises general supervision over many
tribunals. A Scottish Committee of the
Council exercises the same function in
Scotland.
Administration of the Law
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
England and Wales
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and a senior Cabinet Minister. His
administrative responsibility for the Supreme
Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, High
Court and Crown Court) and the county
courts in England and Wales is exercised
through the Court Service. He also has
ministerial responsibility for the locally
administered magistrates’ courts. He advises
the Crown on the appointment of most
members of the higher judiciary, and he
appoints most magistrates. He is also
responsible for promoting general reforms of
the civil law and for the legal aid schemes.
The Home Secretary has overall
responsibility for criminal law, the police service,
the prison system, the probation and after-care
service, and for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers and represent the Crown in
appropriate domestic and international cases.
They are elected members of the House of
Commons and hold ministerial posts. The
Attorney General is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland. As well as exercising various
civil law functions, the Attorney General has
final responsibility for enforcing the criminal
law. The Solicitor General is the Attorney’s
deputy. As head of the Crown Prosecution
Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions is
subject to superintendence by the Attorney
General, as are the Director of the Serious
Fraud Office and the Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Scotland
The Secretary of State for Scotland is
responsible for Scottish criminal law, crime
prevention, the police, the penal system and
legal aid. He or she is advised on parole
matters by the Parole Board for Scotland, and
is also responsible for substantive civil law.
The Secretary of State recommends the
appointment of all judges other than the most
111
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
senior ones, appoints the staff of the High
Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session,
and is responsible for the administration and
staffing of the sheriff courts.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland, both government
ministers, are the chief legal advisers to the
Government on Scottish questions and the
principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of prosecutions and other litigation in
Scotland. The Lord Advocate has ministerial
responsibility for the law of evidence (civil and
criminal) and for jurisdiction and procedures
of the civil courts in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
Court administration is the responsibility of the
Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland
Office, under the Secretary of State, deals with
policy and legislation concerning criminal law,
the police and the penal system. The Lord
Chancellor has general responsibility for legal
aid, advice and assistance.
JUDGES AND LAWYERS
Judges are not subject to ministerial direction
or control. They are normally appointed from
practising barristers (advocates in Scotland), or
solicitors (see below). Lay magistrates in
England and Wales and Scottish district court
justices are trained in order to give them
sufficient knowledge of the law, including the
rules of evidence, and of the nature and
purpose of sentencing.
In Northern Ireland members of a lay panel
who serve in juvenile courts undertake training
courses; resident magistrates are drawn from
practising solicitors or barristers.
The Legal Profession
The legal profession is divided into two
branches: barristers (advocates in Scotland)
and solicitors. Barristers and advocates advise
on legal problems submitted through solicitors
or other recognised professional bodies and
present cases in all courts. Solicitors undertake
legal business for individual and corporate
clients; they can also, after appropriate training
and accreditation, present cases in all courts.
Although people are free to conduct their own
cases, most people prefer to be legally
represented, especially in more serious cases.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for
England and Wales conducts investigations
into the way professional bodies handle
complaints against barristers, solicitors and
licensed conveyancers. There is a separate
Ombudsman for Scotland.
LEGAL AID
A person who needs legal advice, assistance or
representation may be able to get help with
legal costs from the legal aid scheme. People
who qualify for help may have all their legal
costs paid for, or may be asked to contribute
towards them, depending on their means.
Legal Advice and Assistance
Legal advice is available under the Legal
Advice and Assistance (‘Green Form’) Scheme
in England and Wales. People whose income
and capital are within certain limits are entitled
to free advice from a solicitor on most legal
matters. The scheme provides for up to three
hours’ work for matrimonial cases where a
petition is drafted and two hours for other
work. Similar schemes operate in Northern
Ireland and Scotland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
Civil legal aid may be available for most civil
proceedings to those who satisfy the financial
eligibility conditions. Applicants for legal aid
must also show that they have reasonable
grounds for taking, defending or being a party to
proceedings. Legal aid may be refused if it is
considered unreasonable that an applicant should
receive it in the particular circumstances. In
England and Wales payments to lawyers are
made through the Legal Aid Fund, administered
by the Legal Aid Board. Scotland has a separate
Legal Aid Fund, administered by the Scottish
Legal Aid Board. In Northern Ireland legal aid is
administered by the Law Society for Northern
Ireland.
In certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
112
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
aided party may recover his or her costs from
the Legal Aid Board. Where the assisted
person recovers or preserves money or
property in the proceedings, the Legal Aid
Fund will usually have a first charge on that
money or property to recover money spent on
the assisted person’s behalf.
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland legal aid may be granted by
the court if it appears to be in the interests of
justice and if a defendant is considered to
require financial assistance.
The Legal Aid Board in England and Wales
makes arrangements for duty solicitors to assist
unrepresented defendants in the magistrates’
courts. Solicitors are available, on a 24-hour
basis, to give advice and assistance to those
being questioned by the police. The services of
a solicitor at a police station and of the duty
solicitor at court are not means-tested and are
free.
Where legal aid is granted for criminal cases
in Northern Ireland it is free. There is a
voluntary duty solicitor scheme at the main
magistrates’ court in Belfast.
Scotland
A duty solicitor is available to represent people
in custody on their first appearance in the sheriff
courts and the district courts without enquiry
into the person’s means. In other cases, a person
seeking legal aid in summary criminal
proceedings must apply to the Scottish Legal
Aid Board, which must be satisfied that the costs
of the case cannot be met by the applicant
without undue hardship, and that it is in the
interests of justice that legal aid is awarded.
In solemn proceedings the court decides on
the availability of legal aid and must be satisfied
that the accused cannot meet the costs of the
defence without undue financial hardship.
Where legal aid is granted to the accused in
criminal proceedings, he or she is not required to
pay any contribution towards expenses.
Proposed Changes to Legal Aid in
England and Wales
In a White Paper published in July 1996, the
Government proposed far-reaching changes to
the legal aid system in order to make it more
cost-effective and to concentrate available
resources on the most deserving cases. The
main changes would:
• regulate the allocation of financial
resources through predetermined budgets
reflecting local demand within national
priorities;
• introduce contracts between providers of
legal services and the Legal Aid Board for
specified services of defined quality at an
agreed price (this is being implemented
with immediate effect);
• introduce a stricter merits test for
assessing whether civil cases should be
given legal aid; and
• increase potential liability of assisted
people to contribute to their own and, in
civil cases, their opponents’ costs.
Free Representation Units
The Bar Council, the barristers’ professional
body, supports a Free Representation Unit
for clients at a variety of tribunals for which
legal aid is not available. Most of the
representation by the London unit is carried
out by Bar students supported and advised
by full-time case workers. Elsewhere,
barristers do such work through regional
units. A special Bar unit, based in London,
was formed in early 1996 through which
more senior barristers provide representation
in cases which might otherwise not be
heard.
Law Centres
In some urban areas law centres provide free
legal advice and representation. They may
employ a salaried lawyer and many have
community workers. Much of their time is
devoted to housing, employment, social
security and immigration problems.
Although there is a restriction on cases they
will accept, most law centres will give
preliminary advice.
Advice at minimal or no cost may be
available in Citizens Advice Bureaux,
consumer and housing advice centres and in
specialist advice centres run by voluntary
organisations.

The aims of British foreign policy are to promote and protect the security and
prosperity of the peoples of Britain and its Dependent Territories and to
contribute to a safer and fairer international order. To these ends, Britain is a
member of some 80 international organisations, including the United Nations
(UN), the Commonwealth, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and
the European Union (EU). It plays an active part in maintaining international
peace and security and has been fully involved in efforts to bring about a
negotiated settlement in former Yugoslavia. The British aid programme is
centred on the needs of the poorest countries.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of overall foreign policy and is
headed by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, who is assisted by five ministers
without Cabinet rank. One of these is the
Minister for Overseas Development, who is
responsible for the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA). The FCO’s
Permanent Under-Secretary of State is a civil
servant who heads the Diplomatic Service and
provides advice to the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Secretary on all aspects of foreign
policy.
Of about 6,000 staff of the FCO’s
Diplomatic Wing appointed in Britain,
nearly 2,500 serve overseas, of whom 167 are
seconded from other government
departments and other public and private
organisations. British diplomatic missions
also employ about 7,440 locally engaged
staff.
Some 26 per cent of frontline staff overseas
deal with political and economic work, while
35 per cent are engaged on commercial and
inward investment work, 14 per cent on entry
clearance to Britain, 7 per cent on consular
work, 5 per cent on aid administration, 5 per
cent on information and 8 per cent on other
activities, such as culture, science and
technology.
117
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The FCO administers pre-entry control
overseas for people wishing to enter Britain.
Applications for entry clearance are dealt with
by the visa section or consulate of a British
mission.
Britain is committed to maintaining a
worldwide diplomatic presence and has
diplomatic or consular relations with
188 countries. There are also missions at
nine international organisations or
conferences.
The FCO’s only executive agency, Wilton
Park International Conference Centre (at
Wiston House in West Sussex), contributes
to the solution of international problems by
organising conferences in Britain, attended
by politicians, business people, academics
and other professionals from all over the
world.
Other Departments
Other government departments are also
concerned with overseas relations and
foreign policy. The Ministry of Defence
maintains military liaison with Britain’s
NATO and other allies, in addition to
controlling and administering the armed
forces (see p. 149). The Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) has an important
influence on international trade policy and
commercial relations with other countries,
including EU member states. The FCO and
DTI have a joint export promotion
organisation—Overseas Trade Services (see
p. 181). The Treasury is involved in British
international economic policy and is
responsible for Britain’s relations with the
World Bank and other international financial
institutions.
When other departments are involved, the
FCO decides policy in consultation with
them. The department with the main interest
usually takes the lead, particularly in EU
matters and international economic policy.
The FCO co-ordinates British EU policy
through the Cabinet Office European
Secretariat.
The British Council is responsible for
British cultural relations with other countries
(see p. 140).
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
United Nations
Britain is a founder member of the United
Nations and one of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, along with
China, France, Russia and the United States.
In 1996 it was the fifth largest contributor to
the UN regular budget. It is also one of the
leading contributors to UN peacekeeping
operations (see p. 129). Britain is fully
committed to the purposes and principles of
the UN Charter, including the maintenance of
international peace and security, the
development of friendly relations among
nations, the achievement of international
co-operation on economic, social, cultural and
humanitarian issues and the protection of
human rights and fundamental freedoms.
European Union
Britain is a member of the European Union,
which comprises the European Community
(EC) and intergovernmental co-operation on
foreign and security policy, and on justice and
home affairs. The EU is an association of 15
democratic nations; its members are Austria,
Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain and Sweden.
As one of the five most populous countries,
Britain provides two of the 20 members of the
European Commission, which puts forward
legislative proposals, executes the decisions
taken by the Council of the European Union
and ensures that European Community rules
are correctly observed. Britain is represented at
every meeting of the Council, which is the
main decision-making body. Each Council
consists of government ministers from the 15
member states, representing national interests
in the subjects under discussion—for example,
trade, agriculture or transport. When a
member state has the Presidency of the Union
(for a period of six months), its ministers are
responsible for chairing meetings of the
Council. The Committee of Permanent
Representatives, consisting of member states’
ambassadors to the European Union, prepares
the work of the Council. European
118
The European Union
119
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Community policies are implemented by
various forms of Community legislation.
The European Council, which meets at
least twice a year, comprises the heads of state
or government accompanied usually by their
foreign ministers and the President of the
Commission, usually accompanied by a
Commissioner.
There are 626 members of the directly
elected European Parliament, which is
consulted about major decisions and has
substantial shared power with the Council over
the European Community budget. Britain has
87 seats. Elections to the Parliament take place
every five years (since 1979), the most recent
having been held in June 1994.
Each member state provides one of the
judges to serve on the European Court of
Justice, which is the supreme authority in the
field of Community law. Its rulings must be
applied by member states, and sanctions can be
imposed on those failing to do so. The Court is
assisted by a Court of First Instance, which
handles certain cases brought by individuals
and companies.
Britain is also represented on the Court of
Auditors, which examines Community
revenue and expenditure to see that it is legally
received and spent.
The Community enters into trade
agreements with third countries and has a
number of substantial aid programmes. Under
the common foreign and security policy,
member states agree common positions and
take joint action on foreign policy issues.
Member states also co-operate on justice and
home affairs issues such as asylum,
immigration and the fight against crime.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is central to British
defence policy (see p. 143). NATO is based on
the principle of collective security and its core
functions are to:
• provide a foundation for security in
Europe;
• deter aggression and defend member
states against it; and
• provide a forum for Allied transatlantic
consultation.
Each of the 16 member states (Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey and the United States) has a
permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The main
decision-taking body is the North Atlantic
Council. It meets at least twice a year at
foreign minister level, and weekly at the level
of permanent representatives. Defence
ministers also meet at least twice a year.
Western European Union
Britain is a member of the Western European
Union (WEU), which is the main forum for
co-operation and consultation on defence
issues for NATO’s European members. The
WEU’s other full members are Belgium,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Iceland,
Norway and Turkey are associate members;
Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Irish Republic
and Sweden are observers. ‘Associate
partnership’ (a new form of membership) has
been extended to 10 Central European and
Baltic states.
The Group of Seven
Britain is a member of the Group of Seven
(G7) leading industrialised countries. The
other members are Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States. As an
informal organisation, the G7 has no legal
force and no secretariat. Its Presidency rotates
each year between the members, the key
meeting being an annual summit of heads of
government. Originally formed in 1975 to
discuss economic issues, the G7 agenda now
includes political issues such as international
crime and terrorism. Russia has participated in
these political discussions since 1994.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
Britain is a signatory to the 1975 Helsinki
Final Act, which established a framework for
co-operation between OSCE states on
120
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
European security (see p. 135), respect for
human rights and economic matters. It was
agreed that the Helsinki commitments should
be reviewed at regular follow-up conferences.
The 1990 Charter of Paris committed the
signatories to democracy, human rights and
market economies. The OSCE has a
Secretariat in Vienna, where Britain has a
permanent delegation. Day-to-day business is
conducted in the Permanent Council. A
Prague office organises the twice-yearly
meetings of senior officials.
The OSCE has 54 members, including
every country in Europe, the states of the
former Soviet Union, and the United States
and Canada. The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia was suspended in 1992. All states
participate on an equal basis, and decisions are
taken by consensus.
The main areas of OSCE work are:
• early warning of potential conflict through
preventive diplomacy missions and the
work of the OSCE High Commissioner on
National Minorities;
• providing advice on human rights,
democracy and law through the OSCE
Office for Democratic Institutions and
Human Rights in Warsaw (see p. 135);
and
• promoting security through arms control
and military confidence building.
Council of Europe
Britain is a founding member of the Council of
Europe, which is open to any European
democracy accepting the rule of law and the
protection of fundamental human rights and
freedoms. The 39 member states co-operate on
culture, education, sport, health, anti-crime
policy, measures against drug trafficking,
youth affairs and the improvement of the
environment. The Council adopted its
European Convention on Human Rights in
1950 (see p. 135).
The Commonwealth
There are 53 members of the Commonwealth,
including Britain. It is a voluntary association
of states, nearly all of which were British
territories but are now independent. The
members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia,
Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Botswana, Britain, Brunei Darussalam,
Cameroon, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, The
Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India,
Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi,
Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius,
Mozambique (the most recent country to join,
in November 1995), Namibia, Nauru, New
Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New
Guinea, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St
Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra
Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu,
Uganda, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia
and Zimbabwe. Nauru and Tuvalu are special
members, entitled to take part in all
Commonwealth meetings and activities, with
the exception of the biennial Commonwealth
heads of government meetings. South Africa
rejoined in 1994 after an absence of 33 years.
Consultation between member states takes
place through:
• meetings of heads of government;
• specialised conferences of other ministers
and officials;
• diplomatic representatives known as high
commissioners; and
• non-governmental organisations.
The Queen is recognised as head of the
Commonwealth and is head of state in Britain
and 15 other member countries. In 1997
Britain will host the Heads of Government
Meeting for the first time in 20 years.
The Commonwealth Secretariat in London
promotes consultation, disseminates
information, and organises heads of
government meetings, ministerial meetings
and other conferences. It administers
co-operative programmes agreed at these
meetings, including the Commonwealth Fund
for Technical Co-operation, which provides
consultancy services and training awards to
Commonwealth developing countries.
The Commonwealth Institute is the centre
of Commonwealth education and culture in
Britain.
121
The Commonwealth
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Membership of the Commonwealth enables
Britain to play a responsible part alongside
other nations in aiding the democratisation and
progress of the developing world. About 56 per
cent of British bilateral aid to developing
countries went to Commonwealth countries in
1994-95.
Other International Bodies
Britain belongs to many other international
bodies, and was a founder member of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank. The IMF regulates the
international financial system and provides a
source of credit for member countries facing
balance-of-payments difficulties. The World
Bank provides loans to finance economic and
social projects in developing countries.
In addition, Britain, along with 24 other
industrialised countries, belongs to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which promotes
economic growth, support for less developed
countries and worldwide trade expansion.
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia.
BRITAIN’S DEPENDENT
TERRITORIES
Britain’s Dependent Territories have a
combined population of over 6 million, the
vast majority of whom live in Hong Kong.
Most territories have considerable
self-government, with their own legislatures.
Governors appointed by the Queen are
responsible for external affairs, internal
security (including the police) and the public
service. Certain responsibilities are delegated
to locally elected ministers but the ultimate
responsibility for all government affairs rests
with the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary. The British Indian Ocean
Territory, the British Antarctic Territory, and
South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands have commissioners, not governors; a
commissioner is not responsible for external
affairs. Britain seeks to provide the territories
with security and political stability, ensure
efficient and honest government, and help
them achieve economic and social development
on a par with neighbouring countries.
The territories are: Anguilla; Bermuda
(where, in a referendum in August 1995,
voters rejected decisively the principle of
independence from Britain); British Antarctic
Territory; British Indian Ocean Territory;
British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands;
Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Hong Kong;
Montserrat; Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and
Oeno; St Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension and Tristan da Cunha); South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and
Turks and Caicos Islands.
British policy is to help the inhabitants of
the Dependent Territories to take
independence if they want it and where it is
practicable, and to do so in accordance with
treaty obligations. The reasonable needs of the
Dependent Territories are a first call on the
British aid programme.
Hong Kong
Under the Second Convention of Peking,
signed in 1898, China granted Britain a
99-year lease for 92 per cent of Hong Kong’s
present-day territory, known as the New
Territories. Since this lease runs out on 30
June 1997, Britain is committed under
international law to return the New Territories
to China. The remaining, densely populated,
eight per cent of Hong Kong’s territory—
Hong Kong Island and Kowloon
Peninsula—was ceded to Britain in perpetuity
earlier in the nineteenth century. Because this
area would be unviable on its own, Britain
decided, under the terms of the 1984
Sino-British Joint Declaration, to return the
entire territory of Hong Kong to China with
effect from 1 July 1997, in return for
guarantees about Hong Kong’s future way of
life.
Thereafter Hong Kong will become a
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China. Apart from the fields of foreign affairs
and defence, the Hong Kong SAR will enjoy a
high degree of autonomy, with its own
government and legislature composed of Hong
Kong people. In addition, Hong Kong’s
123
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
capitalist system, freedoms, currency and
financial markets will remain intact.
Britain is pledged to co-operate with China
in bringing about a smooth transition in 1997.
The main forum for decisions between Britain
and China on the implementation of the Joint
Declaration is the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) which will be working hard in
the last months before the handover to ensure
that all outstanding transitional issues are
resolved.
One area of disagreement between Britain
and China concerns the legislature. The
Chinese Government has said that it will
replace in July 1997 the Legislative Council
elected in 1995. Britain does not accept the
need for the replacement of a body for which
Hong Kong people voted in record numbers.
The electoral arrangements in 1995 were
consistent with both the Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law, China’s mini-constitution for
Hong Kong. The British Government,
therefore, continues to see no justification for
the so-called ‘Provisional Legislature’ which
will be installed in July 1997.
Britain will have a strong commitment to
Hong Kong well beyond 1997. The JLG
continues until January 2000 and many of the
guarantees in the Joint Declaration last until
2047. There will still be three million British
passport-holders in Hong Kong. Britain’s
commercial interests will remain substantial
since Hong Kong is its second greatest export
market in Asia.
The Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina but the
inhabitants wish to remain under British
sovereignty. The British Government does not
accept the Argentine claim and is committed to
defending the Islanders’ right to live under a
government of their own choice. This right of
self-determination is set out in the 1985
Falkland Islands Constitution.
In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied
the Islands, but its forces were expelled by
British troops following Argentina’s failure to
abide by United Nations resolutions
requesting its forces to withdraw. Britain and
Argentina, while sticking to their respective
positions on sovereignty, maintain diplomatic
relations and continue to discuss their common
interests in the South Atlantic region, such as
fisheries conservation and the exploitation of
oil reserves. An agreement on oil exploration
co-operation was signed in September 1995,
enabling the Falkland Islands to launch an oil
licensing round.
Gibraltar
Gibraltar was ceded to Britain in 1713 by the
Treaty of Utrecht. It is the subject of a
territorial claim by Spain. Under the Treaty,
Spain has the right of first refusal should
Britain ever decide to relinquish sovereignty.
Britain is committed to honouring the
wishes of the people of Gibraltar on their
future. This is set out in the 1969 Gibraltar
Constitution.
Over the years, Spain has used various
means to pursue its national objectives
regarding Gibraltar, in particular pressure at
thq border, where the periodic imposition of
strict controls has caused severe delays and
substantial damage to Gibraltar’s economy.
Gibraltar is part of the European Union
within the United Kingdom member state,
although it is outside the common customs
system and does not participate in the
Common Agricultural or Fisheries policies or
the value added tax regime.
Gibraltar has recently introduced strict
anti-money laundering legislation (see also
p. 136) and has taken action to deter drug
smuggling from Morocco to Spain and tobacco
smuggling to Spain.
Caribbean Dependent Territories
The Dependent Territories Regional
Secretariat in Barbados administers aspects of
British government policy towards the
Caribbean territories (Anguilla, the British
Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands,
Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos
Islands). Jointly agreed country policy plans
for each territory receiving British aid have
been introduced or are under discussion.
In London an FCO minister chairs the
Ministerial Group for the Caribbean
Dependent Territories, drawn from a number
of government departments and agencies and
124
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
benefiting from wider expertise than the FCO
or the ODA alone can offer. It meets two or
three times a year. Policy initiatives by the
group are supported by the Good Government
Fund which, among other objectives, pays for
British personnel on loan to local governments
to help them fight drug trafficking and other
criminal activity. Assistance is also given to
local disaster response teams. In addition, the
Group monitors a programme of action
designed to improve regulation of the offshore
finance sector and anti-money laundering
measures.
EUROPEAN UNION POLICY
Britain regards the EU as a means of
safeguarding political stability in Europe and
generating economic prosperity. British trade
with Europe has risen by almost twice the rate
of that with the rest of the world. EU
membership has also been a key factor in
attracting inward investment into Britain.
Moreover, the creation of the internal
European market has helped remove barriers
to trade between member states and thereby
increase consumer choice and prosperity.
The Government wants Britain to be an
active participant in the EU but is opposed to a
gradual centralisation of powers in Brussels
and the development of a federal Europe.
Instead, it favours an EU which respects
cultural and political diversity and which
concentrates only on action that needs to be
taken at European level. It believes that the
great bulk of decisions should continue to be
taken by national governments. It is opposed
to harmonisation for its own sake or to any
further European integration not driven by the
prospect of practical benefit to member states.
Britain welcomed the accession of Austria,
Finland and Sweden in 1995 and favours
enlargement of the EU as a means of
consolidating democracy in eastern and central
Europe and healing the divisions originally
created by the Cold War. It therefore supports
the eventual membership of Bulgaria, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and
Slovenia, all of which have applied to join and
have agreements with the EU designed to lead
towards membership. The EU is also
committed to starting accession negotiations
with Cyprus and Malta six months after the
current intergovernmental conference
(IGC—see p. 126) ends.
Background
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent wars breaking out again between
themselves. The 1957 Rome Treaty, which
established the European Community, defined
its aims as the harmonious development of
economic activities, a continuous and balanced
economic expansion and an accelerated rise in
the standard of living. These objectives were to
be achieved by the creation of a common
internal market, including the elimination of
customs duties between member states, free
movement of goods, people, services and
capital, and the elimination of distortions in
competition within this market. These
objectives were reaffirmed by the 1986 Single
European Act, which agreed measures to
complete the internal market.
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments, including moves towards
economic and monetary union. It established
the EU, which comprises the European
Community and intergovernmental
arrangements regarding a common foreign and
security policy (see p. 118) and increased
co-operation on interior/justice policy issues
(see p. 83). The Maastricht Treaty also
codified the principle of subsidiarity under
which action should be taken at European level
only if its objectives cannot be achieved by
member states acting alone and can be better
achieved by the Community. Under an
agreement reached in 1992, a subsidiarity test
is applied to all European Commission
proposals for action.
In addition, the Treaty introduced the
concept of European Union citizenship as a
supplement to national citizenship.
Following ratification by Britain and the
other member states, the Treaty came into
force in November 1993.
125
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Intergovernmental Conference
Following on from the Maastricht Treaty, an
intergovernmental conference (IGC) was
convened by EU heads of government at
Turin in March 1996 to consider further treaty
amendments.
The British Government wants the
IGC to focus on making the EU more
relevant and acceptable to the people
of Europe by improving practical
co-operation, which produces the real
benefits of the EU, decentralising
powers and strengthening the
principle of subsidiarity. It is,
therefore, opposed to the extension of
European Community powers and to
more majority voting in the Council.
The IGC must also prepare the
institutions of the EU for
enlargement.
Any amendments to the treaties can only be
agreed by unanimity and cannot enter into force
until they have been ratified by each individual
member state according to its own constitutional
procedures; in Britain’s case this is passage
through Parliament of an Act amending the 1972
European Communities Act.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Maastricht Treaty provides for progress
towards economic and monetary union (EMU)
in three stages: the first—completion of the
single market—ended at the end of 1993. The
second stage, which began on 1 January 1994,
includes the establishment of a European
Monetary Institute with a largely advisory and
consultative role. Although the Institute is
preparing for stage 3, monetary policy remains
a national responsibility. Member states
co-ordinate economic policies in the context of
agreed non-binding policy guidelines. The
British Government is participating in stage 2.
The third stage is a single currency for EU
member states. Under the Treaty this is
envisaged by 1 January 1999, although
member states will have to satisfy certain
criteria on inflation rates, government deficit
levels, currency fluctuation margins and
interest rates. A special protocol, negotiated by
the British Government, recognises that
Britain is not obliged or committed to move to
this final stage of EMU.
The Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of:
• levies on agricultural imports;
• customs duties;
• the proceeds of a notional rate of value
added tax of up to 1.4 per cent on a
standard ‘basket’ of goods and services;
and
• contributions from member states based
on gross national product (GNP).
Britain has an annual rebate worth some
£2,000 million because of the fact that,
without it, the British net contribution would
be far greater than that justified by its share of
Community GNP.
An agreement on future finance was
reached at the European Council summit in
Edinburgh in 1992. Under the agreement, the
overall revenue ceiling was maintained at 1.2
per cent of Community GNP until 1995. It is
then rising in steps, reaching 1.27 per cent in
1999. Agricultural spending will be less than
half the budget by the end of the century,
compared with 80 per cent in 197.3 and 60 per
cent at present. It was also agreed that more
resources would be allocated to the poorer
regions of the Union.
Single Market
The single market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and
capital, is largely complete in legislative terms.
It covers, among other benefits, the removal of
customs barriers, the liberalisation of capital
movements, the opening of public
procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications. The
single market is designed to reduce business
costs, stimulate efficiency, increase consumer
choice and encourage the creation of jobs and
wealth. The British Government is supporting
continuing work on extending the single
market to important areas such as
telecommunications and energy.
126
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, which entered into force on 1
January 1994, most of the EU single market
measures have been extended to Iceland,
Norway and Liechtenstein.
Transport
The concept of a common transport policy
was laid down in the Treaty of Rome, and
Britain fully supports the extension of
competition and deregulation in transport.
Liberalisation measures relating to civil
aviation, shipping, and road haulage and
passenger services are described in Chapter 19.
Trans-European Networks
The EU is working towards the completion of
trans-European networks in the fields of
transport, energy and telecommunications.
The aim is to improve the interconnection and
interoperability of national networks. Of the 14
priority transport projects which have been
endorsed by the European Council, Britain has
an interest in four. One of these is the planned
construction of a new rail link between
London and the Channel Tunnel (see p. 311).
Ten priority energy projects have been
endorsed, but none with a British interest.
Britain has an interest in three non-priority
projects, including the Bacton-Zeebrugge
gas link.
Trade
Britain is the world’s fifth largest trading
nation. EEA member states comprise the
world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
about 40 per cent of all trade. The British
Government fully supports an open world
trading system, on which EU member states
depend for future economic growth and jobs.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of Britain and
the other member states in international trade
negotiations, such as the recently concluded
GATT Uruguay Round, which led to the
creation of the World Trade Organisation
(WTO). The Commission negotiates on a
mandate agreed by the Council. For further
information on trade, see Chapter 12.
The Environment
European Union member states are at the
forefront of many international measures on
environmental issues, such as air quality
standards and the depletion of the ozone layer.
For further information, see Chapter 22.
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is concerned
with the conservation and management of
fishery resources.
The operation of these policies, and
Britain’s advocacy of CAP reform, are
described in Chapter 18.
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
There are a number of Structural Funds
designed to:
• promote economic development in
underdeveloped regions;
• regenerate regions affected by industrial
decline;
• combat long-term unemployment and
facilitate the entry of young people into
the labour market;
• help workers adapt to industrial changes
and to advances in production systems;
• speed up the adjustment of production,
processing and marketing structures in
agriculture; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and industrial
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the unemployed and
young people. The Guidance Section of the
European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund supports agricultural
restructuring and some rural development
measures. The Financial Instrument of
Fisheries Guidance supports the
modernisation of the fishing industry.
127
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A Cohesion Fund, set up under the
Maastricht Treaty, is designed to reduce
disparities between levels of development in
the poorer and richer member states.
Other initiatives aim to assist the
development of new economic activities in
regions affected by the restructuring of
traditional industries, such as steel, coal and
shipbuilding.
The European Investment Bank, a
non-profit-making institution, lends at
competitive interest rates to public and private
capital investment projects. Lending is
directed towards:
• less-favoured regions;
• transport infrastructure;
• protection of the environment;
• improving industrial competitiveness; and
• supporting loans to small and
medium-sized enterprises.
Employment and Social Affairs
In Britain’s view, Community social policy
should be primarily concerned with helping
member states to create jobs and maintain a
well-educated and trained workforce.
The Government supports:
• freedom of movement for workers, mutual
recognition of professional and vocational
qualifications, equal opportunities at work
and measures which genuinely safeguard
health and safety at work; and
• practical measures to increase jobs and cut
unemployment which do not place more
costs on employers.
At Maastricht the Government opposed the
extension of Community social policy and
qualified majority voting into new areas of
social affairs on the grounds that this would
damage competitiveness and destroy jobs. It
also stressed that the main responsibility for
such policies should remain with individual
member states. It therefore negotiated the
Social Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty,
which allows other member states to agree
social legislation in these areas which is not
applicable in Britain. The British Government
is committed to maintaining this arrangement
during the current discussions in the
intergovernmental conference (see p. 126).
Research and Development
Research collaboration among member states is
promoted primarily through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities and
setting out the overall level of funding. The
British Government actively encourages
British companies and organisations to
participate in collaborative research and
development (R & D) with European partners
(see p. 342).
The Fourth Framework Programme,
adopted in April 1994, focuses on generic and
precompetitive research which is of use to a
number of industries. It covers information
and communications technologies, industrial
technologies, the environment, life sciences
and technology, energy, transport and
socio-economic research. The programme also
provides for international co-operation,
dissemination of research, and training and
mobility of researchers.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The common foreign and security policy
(CFSP), established by the Maastricht Treaty,
is intergovernmental, decisions being taken by
unanimity. This co-ordination of foreign
policy among EU member states has
progressed, with less emphasis being placed on
declaratory statements. Successful common
policies have been agreed on issues such as the
delivery of humanitarian aid to Bosnia and the
administration of the Bosnian town of Mostar,
assistance to the Middle East peace process
(including the organisation of Palestinian
elections), election monitoring in Russia and
South Africa and the promotion of nuclear
non-proliferation.
One of the main weaknesses of the CFSP so
far has been the practical implementation of
policy initiatives. During the current IGC, the
Government is pressing for a strengthening of
the CFSP Secretariat charged with
implementing policy and for more co-ordination
between member states. In particular, Britain
wants more planning and analysis in the CFSP
Secretariat and is prepared to consider the idea of
appointing a single figure, answerable to member
128
BRITISH ARMED FORCES IN BOSNIA
There are an estimated 6 million
unexploded mines in the former
Yugoslavia; over the past few years
Britain’s Royal Engineers have been
carrying out mine-awareness training
for thousands of inhabitants, concen¬
trating on those people returning to
areas of high risk.
Camouflaged Gurkha soldiers take part
in a training exercise in preparation
for peacekeeping duties in Bosnia.
One hundred infantry soldiers of the
Royal Gurkha Rifles, from Nepal, have
joined 13,000 British troops as part
of NATO’s Implementation Force.
CONSTRUCTION
The new road bridge linking England and Wales across the River Severn opened in June 1996, completing
Europe’s biggest bridge-building project.
Birmingham’s regenerated city centre canalside has helped attract huge investment
to the area, and won the 1995 international award for Excellence on the Waterfront.
I he largest Hindu temple to be built outside India is at the Swaminarayan Hindu Mission in north London.
Opened in 1995, it was funded mainly by donations from Britain’s Gujarati community.
This canal near Leeds, part of the Aire and Calder Navigation, is the first canal to be built
in Britain for 90 years. It is used by freight barges and leisure boats, and has a new lock,
two lock-keeper’s cottages, a weir, a marina, three bridges and a nature reserve.
THE QUEEN’S AWARDS FOR EXPORT
English Hop Products, Kent, exports
to many countries, including Russia,
the United States, India and Japan.
Hops are used to flavour beer and
other malt products.
Burberrys, the internationally renowned
clothing manufacturer based in London, -jf —

of other clothing, knitwear, sportswear
and accessories to 46 countries,

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
states’ foreign ministers, to represent EU foreign
policy to the outside world.
The Treaty differentiates between security
and defence policy, confirming that defence
issues are a matter for the Western European
Union (see p. 120). There is, however, a
commitment to ’the eventual framing of a
common defence policy, which might in time
lead to a common defence’.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND
SECURITY
Britain maintains that states should not use, or
threaten, force against other sovereign states
and that they should resolve their disputes by
peaceful means. The United Nations is the
principal body responsible for the maintenance
of international peace and security.
Britain considers that prevention of conflict
is better than cure. It is, therefore, particularly
active in looking for ways of strengthening the
capacity of the UN and other international
organisations to predict and prevent conflicts
before they arise.
Britain and UN Peacekeeping
Britain supports UN efforts to increase the
effectiveness of its peacekeeping capacity and
has pressed for the strengthening of the UN’s
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Ten
British officers are currently serving in the
Department and are performing operational,
financial and other specialist functions.
In 1994 Britain launched an initiative calling
for action on conflict in Africa, progressing from
early warning and preventive diplomacy through
to humanitarian and peacekeeping operations on
the ground. It has also taken the lead in the
UN’s efforts to reform the funding,
administration and logistics of peacekeeping
operations. Together with the United States,
Canada and other member states, Britain has
made practical proposals for improving support
for UN missions and modernising the UN’s
procurement policies.
Britain pays an assessed share of the costs of
UN peacekeeping (nearly 6.6 per cent of the
total), contributing about £137 million in
1995. In April 1996 over 12,500 British
personnel were engaged in operations in
support of UN Security Council resolutions,
with a further 425 under direct UN command.
British Contributions to UN Operations
Bosnia
Britain is continuing to work for peace and
stability in former Yugoslavia. Since the
outbreak of inter-ethnic hostilities in mid-1991
the European Union and the UN have sought
to bring about a negotiated and lasting
settlement for the area as a whole.
In December 1995 the Dayton Peace
Agreement for Bosnia was signed in the
United States, and Britain is playing a central
role in its implementation. Over 10,000 British
personnel are participating in the NATO-led
Implementation Force, which comprises about
60,000 troops from all NATO nations and 16
other countries, including Russia and a
number of other Partnership for Peace (see
p. 143) members. The main task of the force is
to assist in implementing the agreement’s
territorial and other provisions. These include
monitoring compliance, establishing secure
conditions for elections and assisting
humanitarian organisations.
Africa
In 1994 Britain deployed a battalion to serve
for three months with the UN mission in
Rwanda, where it repaired over 800 UN
vehicles, rebuilt bridges and restored utilities.
Another battalion was sent in 1995 to help
establish infrastructure for the UN
peacekeeping mission in Angola.
Cyprus
Britain continues to provide the largest
contingent (about 400 strong) to the UN Force
in Cyprus, which was established in 1964 to
help prevent the recurrence of fighting on the
island between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Since the serious hostilities of 1974, when
Turkish forces occupied the northern part of
the island, the Force has been responsible for
maintaining the ceasefire and control of a
buffer zone between the two communities.
129
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Iraq/Kuwait
In 1991 a Security Council resolution
established a demilitarised zone extending 10
km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter
violations of the boundary and to observe
hostile or potentially hostile actions. Britain,
with the other permanent members of the
Security Council, contributes 15 observers to
the 1,000-strong UN Iraq/Kuwait observer
mission (UNIKOM). Royal Air Force aircraft
are continuing reconnaissance missions over
Iraq to monitor Iraqi military activity and
police the ‘no fly’ zones from which Iraqi
aircraft are excluded (see p. 147).
Georgia
Ten British officers are deployed as military
observers in Georgia as part of a 127-strong
UN observer mission. The mission was
established by the Security Council in August
1993 to observe and monitor the ceasefire
established following violent conflict between
the Georgian armed forces and Abkhaz
separatists.
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AND CENTRAL ASIA
Since the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact
and the formation of democratically elected
governments in Eastern and Central Europe
and Central Asia, the European security
situation has been transformed.
In 1990 NATO Allies and former Warsaw
Pact states signed a joint declaration in Paris
saying that:
• they were no longer adversaries and would
build new partnerships;
• they would maintain only enough military
forces to prevent war and provide for
effective defence; and
• they would form the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council to foster
co-operation and understanding.
In 1994 a NATO summit meeting invited
the non-NATO states in Eastern and Central
Europe and Central Asia to join a Partnership
for Peace initiative in order to:
• develop a practical working relationship;
and
• enlist the Partners’ assistance in
peacekeeping operations and guide their
armed forces towards compatibility with
those of NATO countries.
The Partnership for Peace, which now
includes 26 countries, also monitors matters
such as the Partners’ respect for international
treaties, civilian control of the military and
openness in defence budgeting.
Economic Help
Britain and other Western countries are taking
action to help deal with the vast economic
problems following the fall of Communism,
and to promote the development of market
economies. The IMF and World Bank, with
Britain’s active support, provide advice and
finance to nearly all countries in the region,
while the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development channels Western
investment. The European Community’s
PHARE scheme is assisting Central European
countries in the process of reform and the
development of infrastructure. Eastern Europe
and Central Asia receive help through a
parallel programme (TACIS), which
concentrates on financial services, transport,
energy (including nuclear safety) and
humanitarian needs. Britain’s Export Credit
Guarantee Department provides insurance
cover for exporters to a number of countries.
Know How Fund
The Know How Fund is Britain’s programme
of bilateral technical assistance to the countries
of Central and Eastern Europe and Central
Asia. It aims to support their transition to
pluralist democracy and a market economy by
providing British skills and by encouraging
British investment in the region.
In Central and Eastern Europe, and
especially Russia, the Fund’s main priorities
are developing financial services, including
banking, insurance, audit and privatisation;
management training; small and medium-sized
enterprise development; public administration;
and employment services. Agriculture, energy
130
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
and health care management are also priorities
in some countries.
The Know How Fund also finances
activities promoting good government and civil
society, such as parliamentary exchanges,
police training, development of legal services,
and media development and training.
The Fund spent over £86.5 million in
1995—96 and over £300 million since its
inception in 1989.
Europe (Association) Agreements
The European Union has strengthened
relations with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia by signing
Europe (Association) Agreements with these
countries. The agreements envisage accession
to the European Union when these countries
are able to assume the obligations of
membership.
The EU has signed partnership and
co-operation agreements with Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus,
Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.
A Trade and Co-operation Agreement is in
force with Albania.
The purpose of all these agreements is to
reduce trade harriers, develop wide-ranging
co-operation and increase political dialogue at
all levels.
OTHER REGIONS
The Middle East
Middle East Peace Process
Britain warmly welcomed the breakthrough in
the Middle East peace process in 1993, when
Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) agreed to mutual
recognition and signed a Declaration of
Principles on interim self-government for the
Palestinians in Israeli-held territories occupied
in 1967. The first stage of the Declaration was
implemented in May 1994, when the
Palestinians adopted self-government in the
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. In October
1994 a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan
was formally signed. Britain continues to
encourage peace negotiations between Israel,
Syria and Lebanon.
A further major advance was achieved in
September 1995, when Israel and the PLO
reached an interim agreement providing for a
phased Israeli troop withdrawal from occupied
Palestinian areas of the West Bank and for
elections to a new Palestinian Council with
legislative and executive powers. The British
Government applauded the agreement,
recognising the difficult compromises made on
both sides. Britain took part in the
EU-co-ordinated international observation of
the Palestinian elections in January 1996.
Along with its European Union partners,
Britain continues to support peace moves,
politically and economically, and is committing
£87 million over three years in aid to the
Palestinians and the peace process through
bilateral and multilateral channels. Many
programmes are already under way and are
designed to support Palestinian administration,
police training, the Palestinian Monetary
Authority, legal structures and the judiciary,
water management and health care.
In June 1996, following a general election in
Israel the previous month which led to a
change of government, Britain and its EU
partners reiterated their support for the peace
process, and appealed to all parties in the
region to avoid and prevent actions which
might prejudice further negotiations. In
response to conflict between Palestinians and
Israeli forces in the West Bank and Jerusalem
in September 1996, the British Government
appealed to Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
step back from confrontation and return to the
path of trust and reconciliation.
The Gulf Conflict
As a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, Britain strongly condemned Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and
supported all the Council’s resolutions
designed to force Iraqi withdrawal and restore
international legality. Because of Iraq’s failure
to withdraw, its forces were expelled in
February 1991 by an international coalition led
by the United States, Britain, France and
Saudi Arabia, acting under a UN mandate.
UN Security Council Resolution 687,
131
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
adopted in April 1991, formalised the ceasefire
in the Gulf War and stipulated conditions for
Iraqi acceptance, including measures to
prevent the development of weapons of mass
destruction, recognition of the border with
Kuwait and the payment of compensation to
those who suffered as a result of the invasion of
Kuwait. The resolution, fully supported by
Britain, imposed sanctions on Iraq which
remain in force until the Security Council is
satisfied that Iraq is fully in compliance with it.
As part of the agreement ending hostilities,
the Security Council authorised the creation of
a Special Commission (UNSCOM) to
supervise the elimination of Iraq’s weapons of
mass destruction. Britain has provided
considerable support to UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Authority in the
form of personnel, equipment and information
since the first inspection in 1991.
The Security Council approved a separate
resolution (688) in response to continued
oppression by the Iraqi regime of the civilian
population in northern Iraq and the marshes of
southern Iraq. British military aircraft help to
police the ‘no fly’ zones which operate over
both areas to monitor Iraqi actions and to deter
air attacks.
Iraqi troop movements threatening Kuwait
in September/October 1994 were countered
by swift military reinforcements by Britain and
its coalition partners. In September 1996
Britain supported United States air raids on
Iraqi military installations following an
advance by Iraqi troops into the Kurdish areas
of northern Iraq.
Sub-Saharan Africa
For many years, Britain has been concerned
with the affairs of sub-Saharan Africa, where
positive developments have included the
abolition of apartheid and the establishment of
a non-racial democracy in South Africa and
free elections in Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and
Zambia.
Since the election of President Mandela’s
government in 1994, South Africa’s relations
with Britain have broadened into new areas,
ranging from development assistance to
military advice, and sporting links to scientific
co-operation. There has also been a steady flow
of ministerial visits to and from South Africa,
the most notable being that of the British
Prime Minister in 1994.
The British Government is supporting the
South African Government in its efforts to
tackle the economic distortions and
inequalities inherited from the apartheid era.
In addition to a £100 million aid
package over the three years from
1994 to 1996 and an additional £60
million announced during President
Mandela’s state visit to Britain in
July 1996, Britain is supporting South
Africa’s development through trade
and investment and through official
export credit guarantees.
Britain is the second highest exporter to
South Africa and its largest foreign investor,
with a market value of between £8,000 million
and £10,000 million. Nine of the top twenty
foreign employers in South Africa are British.
South Africa also has a significant investment
in Britain. In addition there is a British
investment promotion scheme designed to
encourage more small and medium-sized
businesses to invest in South Africa.
The importance of British-South African
relations was symbolised by the historic state
visits of the Queen in 1995 and of President
Mandela in 1996, the latter being accompanied
by a high-level ministerial team and a large
trade delegation.
Asia-Pacific Region
The dynamic growth of the East Asian
economies has made the Asia-Pacific region
increasingly important in world affairs. There
is also an encouraging trend towards political
liberalisation. Britain has a long association
with the region and is giving it an even higher
priority in its foreign policy. Close relations are
maintained with Japan, China, the ASEAN
countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam), Australia and New Zealand. Britain
has defence links with some countries in the
region.
132
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
In South Asia the Indo-British Partnership
initiative, established in 1993, is continuing to
promote commercial and investment links
between Britain and India.
Britain has stepped up political dialogue
with countries in the region, developing
British commercial activity through more trade
and investment, and the setting up of business
councils, joint commissions or industrial
co-operation agreements. In addition Britain is
working even more closely with governments
there on international problem-solving. It is
also taking advantage of growing opportunities
for English language teaching, co-operation in
science and technology, and educational
exchanges.
Britain has welcomed the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) process which held its first
meeting in Bangkok in March 1996. Intended
to balance existing transatlantic and
transpacific relationships, ASEM will foster
closer economic and political ties between
European Union countries, the seven ASEAN
nations, China, Japan and Korea. The second
meeting will take place in Britain in 1998.
North and Latin America
Britain has long-established political, trade and
cultural links with the United States. As
founding members of NATO, both countries
are deeply involved in Western defence
arrangements (see p. 143) and, as permanent
members of the UN Security Council, work
closely together on major international issues.
Strong links are also maintained with Canada,
with whom Britain shares membership of the
Commonwealth, NATO and other key
international organisations.
Important British connections with Latin
America date from the participation of British
volunteers in the wars of independence in the
early 19th century. Britain has welcomed the
fact that democratically elected governments
are now the norm in the region; this, together
with the trend towards freer market
economies, presents many opportunities for
Britain to strengthen its relations with Latin
American governments. In 1995 the British
Government launched a Latin American trade
campaign—Link into Latin America—to
promote trade and investment. There has been
considerable British investment in Latin
America as a result of the free market
economic policies and economic growth of the
last few years.
ARMS CONTROL
Britain plays a major role in international
efforts to control weapons of mass destruction,
conventional weapons and related exports.
Weapons of Mass Destruction
Nuclear Weapons
The main instrument for controlling nuclear
weapons is the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT). Britain took an active part in
negotiating the treaty and more recently in
securing its indefinite extension in 1995. It is
now working to ensure a successful follow-up
to the other decisions taken during the 1995
negotiations.
As part of this effort Britain played an
important role in negotiations on the recently
agreed Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which it
signed in September 1996. Britain has made it
clear that it will respond to the challenge of
multilateral talks on the global reduction of
nuclear arms in a world in which those of the
United States and Russian forces are counted
in hundreds rather than thousands.
Meanwhile, Britain has already made
substantial reductions in its nuclear forces.
Biological Weapons
Britain played a large part in promoting the
1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which
provides for a world-wide ban on such
weapons. Unfortunately, it has no verification
mechanism so Britain is taking part in
international efforts to develop one. Britain
will chair a review conference at the end of
1996 attended by parties to the convention.
Chemical Weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
provides for a worldwide ban on chemical
weapons. Britain made a particular
contribution to the negotiations on the
133
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
convention’s extensive verification provisions.
British efforts are now concentrated on
ensuring that the Organisation of the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established
under the convention, can implement the
verification provisions effectively once the
convention enters into force.
Conventional Weapons
In Europe
Britain and its NATO allies have contributed
to a number of conventional arms control
measures designed to contribute to European
security. These include:
• the Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe Treaty (the CFE Treaty),
committing all NATO members and all
members of the former Warsaw Pact to
limit five major classes of offensive
conventional weapons; and
• the Open Skies Treaty, which, when it
comes into force, will allow regular flights
by aircraft over the entire territories of the
same states to monitor their military
capabilities and activities.
A wide range of confidence- and security¬
building measures have been developed under
the auspices of the Organisation for Security
and Co-operation in Europe. Britain continues
to play a full part in implementing and
developing these measures. It will participate
fully in a new process aimed at adapting the
CFE Treaty in order to take account of
changes in the European security situation. It
will also press for the entry into force of the
Open Skies Treaty, and will continue to
contribute to arms control efforts relevant to
maintaining peace in former Yugoslavia.
Around the World
In 1991 Britain pressed successfully for the
establishment of a United Nations Register of
Conventional Arms, aimed at making it easier
to monitor any excessive arms build-up by any
country in the world. During 1995-96 Britain
helped secure changes to the 1981 United
Nations Weaponry Convention which
substantially strengthen its provisions on
anti-personnel landmines and add new ones on
blinding laser weapons.
Britain continues its strong support for the
UN Register and is pressing for international
agreement on a total ban on anti-personnel
mines.
Export Controls
In addition to efforts to control weapons of
mass destruction and conventional arms, it is
also necessary to control the export of directly
related items and of so-called dual-use items.
Dual-use items may have a quite legitimate
civilian use but could also have a weapons-
related one. Britain participates actively in all the
major export control arrangements related to
these types of weapons and missiles.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The protection of human rights is an important
part of British foreign policy. Universal respect
for human rights is an obligation under the UN
Charter, reinforced by human rights law in the
form of UN and regional human rights treaties.
Britain played a key role at the 1993 UN World
Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, which
reaffirmed that human rights are a legitimate
concern of the international community. The
expressions of concern about human rights do
not, therefore, constitute interference in the
internal affairs of another state.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted by the UN General
Assembly in 1948. Since this is not a legally
binding document, the General Assembly
adopted two international covenants in 1966,
placing legal obligations on those states
ratifying or acceding to them. The covenants
came into force in 1976, Britain ratifying both
in the same year. One covenant deals with
economic, social and cultural rights and the
other with civil and political rights. States
which are parties to the covenants undertake to
submit periodic reports detailing compliance
with their terms. Each covenant has a UN
treaty monitoring committee which examines
these reports. Britain recognises the
competence of these committees to receive and
consider state-to-state complaints.
134
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Other international conventions to which
Britain is a party include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• the rights of the child;
• torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
• the prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery; and
• the status of refugees.
The Council of Europe
Britain is bound by the Council of Europe’s
Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
covers:
• the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
• the right to marry and have a family;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
• freedom of expression, including freedom
of the press;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
• the prohibition of torture and inhuman or
degrading treatment.
Complaints about violations of the
Convention are made to the European
Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Although one state may lodge a complaint
against another, most complaints are brought
against states by individuals or groups. The
Commission decides whether cases are
admissible and, if so, examines the matter with
the parties with a view to achieving a
settlement. If this fails, the Commission or the
state concerned can refer the case to the
European Court of Human Rights, which rules
on whether the Convention has been breached.
Britain has signed and ratified the 11th
Protocol to the Convention, which concerns
the replacement of the existing Commission
and Court with a full-time Court.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s human rights body, the Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights
in Warsaw, is responsible for furthering
human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
It provides a forum for meetings and expert
seminars to discuss the implementation of
commitments in the area of human rights. The
Office shares and exchanges information on
the building of democratic institutions and the
holding of elections in participating states. It
also co-ordinates the monitoring of elections
and provides expertise and training on
constitutional and legal matters.
Westminster Foundation for Democracy
The Westminster Foundation for Democracy,
an independent non-departmental public body
established in 1992, provides assistance in
building and strengthening pluralist
democratic institutions overseas. It receives an
annual grant from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (£2.5 million in
1995-96) and raises funds through donations
from other organisations.
The three main political parties (see p. 56)
are each represented on the Foundation’s
Board of Governors and are appointed by the
Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary after
consultations with the parties. There is also a
representative from one of the smaller political
parties and non-party figures drawn from
business, trade unions, the academic world,
the media and other non-government sectors.
The Foundation is fully independent in its
decision-taking, the British Government
having no right of veto over the projects which
the Board chooses to support. The FCO
provides a non-voting member of the Board to
act as a channel of communications and
provide factual advice when required.
The Foundation supports projects which
promote the development of:
• electoral systems, administration and
monitoring;
• parliaments or other representative
institutions;
• political parties;
• independent media;
135
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• trade unions; and
• human rights groups.
Efforts are being concentrated on three
priority areas—Central and Eastern Europe,
Russia and Central Asia, and Anglophone
Africa. The Foundation also gives sympathetic
consideration to worthwhile projects in other
parts of the world.
INTERNATIONAL CRIME
The British Government attaches great
importance to action against international
terrorism and to international co-operation
against drug traffickers and organised crime.
Britain and the other members of the
European Union have agreed not to export
arms or other military equipment to countries
clearly implicated in supporting terrorist
activity, and to take steps to prevent such
material being diverted for terrorist purposes.
It is EU policy that no concessions should
be made to terrorists or their sponsors, and
that there should be solidarity among member
states in the prevention of terrorism.
Britain participates actively in international
forums on co-operation against the illegal
drugs trade, maintains a substantial
programme of overseas assistance in this field
and stations drug liaison officers in a number
of countries in order to liaise with the host
authorities in the fight against drug trafficking.
Britain is one of the main contributors to the
UN International Drug Control Programme,
providing £4.26 million in 1995-96. In
December 1995, a British-French initiative to
combat drug trafficking in the Caribbean
secured support from the EU, and has since
been extended to Latin America.
EU member states are setting up a central
European Police Office (EUROPOL) to
provide a Union-wide centre for the exchange
and analysis of intelligence about serious
international crime. As a step in this process,
the EUROPOL Drugs Unit has already been
established. EU member states also belong to
the International Criminal Police Organisation
(INTERPOL). British liaison with
INTERPOL is provided by the National
Criminal Intelligence Service (see p. 89).
Co-operation between the governments of
EU member states on justice and home affairs
takes place under the provisions of the
Maastricht Treaty (see p. 125). A number of
conventions have been agreed under these
arrangements, including those on EUROPOL,
extradition and the protection of the European
Community’s financial interests.
Britain plays a leading role in supporting
international and regional initiatives to counter
money laundering.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The objective of Britain’s official overseas aid
effort is to improve the quality of life of people
in poorer countries by contributing to
sustainable development and reducing poverty
and suffering. To achieve this, the aid
programme is aiming:
• to encourage sound development policies,
efficient markets and good government;
• to help people achieve better education
and health and to widen opportunities,
particularly for women;
• to enhance productive capacity and to
conserve the environment; and
• to promote international policies for
sustainable development and to increase
the effectiveness of multilateral
development institutions.
Britain’s aid programme (the sixth largest
in the world), which is delivered through the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office’s Overseas
Development Administration (ODA),
amounted to £2,314 million in 1994-95. Of
this, 87 per cent went to developing countries
and 10 per cent to countries in transition in
Central and Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. (The remaining three per cent
comprises mainly administrative costs.) About
48 per cent was given directly to individual
countries and the remainder channelled
through international bodies, such as the
European Union, the United Nations and the
World Bank group of institutions. In addition,
over £276 million was invested in developing
countries by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation in 1995 (see p. 137). Some of the
aid budget goes to programmes administered
by the British Council (see p. 140) and by over
110 non-governmental organisations (such as
Oxfam and Save the Children Fund).
136
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Economic Reform
Britain works closely with developing
countries and countries in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia to promote sound economic
management and create efficient market
economies. Britain’s aid programme helps
British experts to assist countries design and
implement changes to their economies, for
example, tax reform, privatisation, civil service
reform and management of the financial sector.
Aid is also used to support imports of essential
goods and pay for important public services in
countries such as Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana
and Zambia, which are reforming their
economies. In Eastern Europe and Central
Asia know-how from Britain has been very
important in helping countries privatise old
state assets and support the growth of new
small businesses.
The Private Sector
The Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) is the Government’s main instrument
within the aid programme for encouraging
private-sector investment in developing
countries. It provides loans, equity funds and
management services for financially viable
investments in agriculture, fisheries, minerals,
industry, transport, communications and
housing. At the end of 1995 it had investments
and commitments worth nearly £1,490 million
in 369 enterprises in 50 countries.
The ODA itself supports private sector
development by providing British expertise
and financial support through schemes such as:
• business management training in
Zimbabwe;
• setting up an enterprise centre to give advice
and help for small firms in Namibia;
• privatising farms in Russia; and
• supporting new stock markets in Eastern
Europe.
Good Government
Assistance for good government is a major
priority for the British aid programme. In
1994-95 there were 180 new projects—up by
30 per cent on the previous year—and
expenditure totalled about £164 million. The
aim is to help promote democracy, human
rights and the rule of law and assist
governments to become more accountable and
competent. British assistance includes:
• support for civil service and local
government reform;
• electoral assistance;
• reform of the police and judiciary;
• projects to control corruption; and
• advice on the promotion and protection of
human rights.
Reducing Poverty
About three-quarters of British bilateral aid to
developing countries goes to the poorest ones. In
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh projects include
rural development, urban slum upgrading and
the provision of health, family planning and
education services for poor people. Some of the
ODA’s projects to help the poor are carried out
in conjunction with non-governmental
organisations. In Nepal, for example, WaterAid
has built a gravity-fed water system, piping water
from springs in the hills to tapstands in the
village so that all the houses now have latrines
and access to water.
Britain is at the forefront of efforts to
relieve the heavy burden of debt on
many developing countries. The
ODA has written off over £1,200
million of British aid loans to 31 of
the poorest countries. Britain has also
initiated a number of schemes for
debt relief, including the present
rescheduling arrangements agreed by
western creditor governments (the
Paris Club) in 1995. These terms
allow for up to two-thirds relief on
the eligible debt of the poorest, most
indebted countries that have a good
record of economic reform. Nineteen
countries have benefited so far from
these higher rates of debt relief.
Britain is also working with the
international financial institutions, such as the
World Bank and the International Monetary
137
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fund, to examine further measures to tackle
the problem of multilateral debt for the
poorest, most indebted countries.
Education
ODA education policy is in line with the
principles agreed at the 1990 World
Conference on ‘Education for AH’, to which
other major international institutions
subscribe. ODA projects focus on primary and
tertiary education and concentrate on key areas
such as:
• curriculum development;
• teacher education;
• examination reform;
• the development of learning materials,
including books;
• the planning, financing and administration
of education; and
• the provision of school buildings and
equipment.
In 1994—95 some 9,500 students and
trainees from developing countries, mainly
postgraduates, received ODA support to study
and train in Britain under technical
co-operation training arrangements and three
scholarship schemes—the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the British
Chevening Scholarships (see p. 463) and the
ODA Shared Scholarships Scheme. Part of
Britain’s grant aid to South Africa is a £2
million project that will provide bursaries and
loans to 1,200 university and technical
students from disadvantaged communities
studying science, engineering, commerce and
medicine.
Health
Britain’s objective in health and population
policy is to help countries obtain the best
possible use of limited resources by improving
the relevance, effectiveness and coverage of
health services, in particular by increasing
access to essential health care for women and
children. Over 10 per cent of the aid
programme is spent on health and population
activities.
Through its Children by Choice, Not Chance
policy, Britain seeks to ensure that more
women and men can receive good quality
family planning and reproductive health care,
allowing them to choose the size of their
families and the spacing and timing of the
birth of their children. The policy also enables
women to go through pregnancy and
childbirth more safely. Over £180 million has
been committed for new population and
reproductive health projects since the
International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo in 1994.
The British aid programme also aims to
reduce suffering from communicable diseases,
especially tuberculosis, malaria and
HIV/AIDS. In 1995 Britain was the largest
bilateral donor to the World Health
Organisation’s anti-tuberculosis programme.
Britain has also strongly supported the
establishment of the new joint UN programme
on HIV/AIDS.
Britain funds a strong programme of
technology development and research—about
£8 million annually—in four priority areas:
• health care management and health sector
reform;
• reproductive health;
• communicable diseases; and
• health care in unstable living
environments.
Promoting Opportunities for Women
In the last few years Britain has made
considerable progress in supporting the
advancement of women in the aid programme.
In 1994-95 over 16 per cent of bilateral aid was
targeted at improving women’s as well as
men’s needs, compared with 12 per cent the
previous year. Making women and men more
equal will improve the quality of life for people
in poorer countries.
At the Fourth World Conference on
Women in Peking in 1995 the governments of
189 countries committed themselves to the
long term goal of gender equality. The
Conference adopted an action plan to promote
a more equal partnership between women and
men in the home, in communities and at all
levels of political and economic life. The ODA
is already addressing many of these concerns
138
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
through its bilateral aid programme and in the
support it gives to multilateral and
non-governmental organisations.
Projects designed to help women and girls
gain greater access to education, health and
incomes will continue to play a key role in the
British aid programme. The ODA is also
committed to giving more support to:
• help institutions in partner governments
to train staff and develop systems to
address gender issues in policies and
programmes, such as economic reform
and public expenditure;
• improve data collection and statistical
analysis to measure and value women’s, as
well as men’s, work;
• revise legal frameworks to promote gender
equality;
• promote women’s participation in
government and politics; and
• assist non-governmental organisations
concerned with the promotion of gender
equality.
The Environment
Protection and sustainable management of the
environment are key aims of the British aid *
programme. In 1994-95 the ODA committed
over £285 million bilaterally in support for
over 260 projects aimed at protecting the
environment, promoting cleaner technologies
or supporting sustainable agriculture.
Activities ranged from preparing integrated
coastal zone management plans in South
Africa, Eritrea and Ghana, to funding country
studies on climate change and desertification.
In addition to helping countries address
national environmental problems, Britain takes
action on global environmental concerns
shared by all countries.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is
a trust fund of over $2,000 million which helps
developing countries and countries with
economies in transition to meet the
incremental costs of protecting the world’s
environment in four main areas:
• climate change;
• biodiversity;
• pollution of international waters; and
• protection of the ozone layer (for
countries in transition only).
Britain has committed £130 million to the
GEF and is the Fund’s fifth largest donor.
Climate Change
Britain signed the Convention on Climate
Change at the 1992 Earth Summit and ratified
it in the following year. The aim of the
Convention is to stabilise atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level
which will prevent dangerous climate change.
It commits all parties to prepare national
programmes identifying the sources of such
gases and steps to limit emissions. Britain
believes that the best way of assisting
developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas
emission is through energy efficiency
programmes. In 1994-95 Britain committed
£48 million for development projects that
promote energy efficiency.
Ozone Depletion
The Montreal Protocol’s Multilateral Fund
helps developing countries to meet some of the
extra costs of phasing out ozone-depleting
substances. Britain has so far committed $40
million to the Fund, which will be replenished
in 1997.
Biodiversity
The Rio Biodiversity Convention, which
Britain signed in June 1992 and ratified a year
later, requires countries to take action to halt
the loss of animal and plant species and
preserve genetic resources, and to produce
plans for conserving them.
Britain is helping countries to fulfil their
obligations under the Convention through its
contributions to the GEF, the British bilateral
aid programme, and the Darwin Initiative for
the Survival of Species, which was launched at
the Earth Summit in 1992. Since 1994 Britain
has committed £48 million to projects
promoting biodiversity.
Forestry
The ODA has about 200 forestry projects
under way or under preparation in 41
139
BRI TAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
countries, at a total cost of over £180 million.
The aim is to help developing countries utilise
their forests sustainably and to reduce the rate of
deforestation. When sustainably managed,
forests can be an invaluable resource for
communities in developing countries and
represent a major habitat for biological diversity.
Forests are also important for the world’s
climate, since trees absorb carbon dioxide, a gas
which contributes to global warming.
Natural Resources
The ODA spends some £100 million a year on
helping developing countries to promote
sustainable and efficient management of their
renewable resources in areas such as
small-scale agriculture, animal production,
fisheries, forestry and wildlife. This involves
working directly with communities as well as
helping governments to formulate and
implement appropriate policies.
Examples of ODA natural resources
programmes include:
• helping Botswana develop better
rangelands and wildlife management
systems;
• working through the non-governmental
organisation CARE to help farmers in
Bangladesh farm fish in their rice fields;
• supporting community-based forestry
management in Nepal; and
• developing sustainable land-use systems
in the buffer zones around national parks
and protected areas in Bolivia.
In addition to programmes in individual
developing countries, Britain spends around
£20 million a year on technology development
and research in agriculture, forestry, livestock
and fisheries.
Britain is also a founder member of, and
contributor to, the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research, which is
dedicated to improving food security through
sustainable agriculture. Research through the
Group helps to increase the supply of staple
foods, preserve plant genetic resources and
strengthen scientific capacity in developing
countries.
The ODA’s scientific executive agency, the
Natural Resources Institute, was privatised in
1996 and continues to be a multi-disciplinary
centre of expertise on which the ODA can
draw. In 1995 the Agency’s work for the ODA
included:
• research into replacing a chemical
pesticide causing ozone depletion with a
more environmentally-friendly technique
for fumigating crops;
• management and conservation of forestry
and fisheries; and
• the provision of advice on the storage,
handling and marketing of food and cash
crops after harvest.
Emergency Relief
The ODA’s Disaster Unit co-ordinates the
British Government’s provision of
humanitarian aid, which takes the form of
financial grants, practical items such as tents,
blankets and medical supplies, or staff with
needed skills. The unit works closely with the
International Red Cross and Red Crescent, the
European Union and voluntary agencies.
Through its Disaster Relief Initiative, the unit
also mounts its own response to emergencies
overseas; for example, road convoys and
engineering projects in former Yugoslavia, and
water tankerage for Rwanda refugees.
The ODA also funds over £3 million each
year for disaster mitigation projects, such as a
volcanic hazards mapping project in Chile and
a disaster management programme in
Bangladesh run by OXFAM.
In 1994—95 Britain spent nearly £334 million
on emergencies; £209 million was provided
bilaterally, of which £85 million was channelled
through non-governmental organisations
CULTURAL RELATIONS
The British Council is Britain’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas, with 228
offices in 109 countries (compared with 108
offices in 79 countries in 1979). Its purpose is
to promote a wider knowledge of Britain and
the English language and to encourage
cultural, scientific, technological and
educational co-operation between Britain and
other countries. The Council:
• helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in Britain;
140
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
• enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaches English and promotes its use;
• provides library and information services;
• promotes scientific and technical training,
research collaboration and exchanges; and
• makes British arts and literature more
widely known.
I he Council runs 185 libraries, resource
centres and information centres (including 40 in
Central and Eastern Europe), and 95 English
language teaching centres. In 1994-95 ten
million loans of books and other materials were
made to 500,000 library members. The Council
funds over 9,000 scientific visits and more than
1,300 research links. Additionally, it administers
over 400,000 British professional and academic
examinations each year. The Council is financed
partly by a grant from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office. The training and
education programmes organised by the Council
as part of the British aid programme are another
important source of income. One third of its
income comes from other earnings.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by
British experts, encourages cultural exchange
visits, and organises academic interchange
between British universities and colleges and
those in other countries. It arranges over
50,000 visits to and from Britain each year.
The ODA helps fund certain Council
programmes, such as:
• recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
• secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
• organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits
and Exchanges, which is part of the British
Council, promotes partnerships and exchanges
between schools, teachers, students and pupils
throughout Europe. Opportunities for young
people include school and class links and /
English language summer camps. For the
post-16 age group, there are work placements
and English language assistants’ posts as well
as other exchange programmes.
The Arts
The British Council initiates or supports more
than 2,000 arts and literature events each year.
These activities include tours by British
theatre companies, orchestras, choirs, opera
and dance companies, and jazz, rock and folk
groups, as well as visits by individual actors,
musicians and artists. The Council also
arranges for directors, designers,
choreographers and conductors to work in
other countries. In addition, it organises and
supports literature, fine arts and other cultural
exhibitions, and British participation in book
fairs and international film festivals.

Britain’s defence policy supports its wider security policy, which is to maintain
the country’s freedom and territorial integrity, and that of its Dependent
Territories, as well as its ability to pursue its legitimate interests at home and
abroad. As a member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), Britain
makes a significant contribution to maintaining stability throughout Europe
and has been providing a major part of the NATO peace implementation force
in Bosnia.
INTRODUCTION
With the reduction in the potential strategic
threats facing Britain as a result of the end of
the Cold War, progress has been made in
security-building and co-operation with states
in central and eastern Europe. However, the
end of East-West confrontation has been
followed by problems of instability,
nationalism and extremism within parts of
Europe and beyond. These developments are
the major factors shaping defence policy today.
Britain and its NATO allies have responded to
these changes by adapting their policies and
the structure of their armed forces to meet the
defence requirements of the future.
NATO remains the foundation of Britain’s
defence and security policies. In addition,
Britain works to increase security through its
membership of the Western European Union
(WEU), the European Union (EU—see
p. 118), the Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE—see p. 120)
and the United Nations (UN—see p. 118).
These organisations have been involved in
negotiating an end to conflicts, in peacekeeping
deployments and in humanitarian missions.
Britain and the other WEU member states
are developing the WEU as the body which
will provide political authority and direction
for European operations in the future. At the
January 1994 NATO Summit it was decided
that NATO assets could be made available
for European/WEU operations. In
co-operation with NATO, Britain and the
rest of the WEU are supporting the
implementation of conflict prevention and
crisis management measures.
The current fundamental restructuring of
Britain’s armed forces recognises the need
for flexibility in the face of future
uncertainty. The armed forces are, therefore,
equipped to take part in combined
operations, ranging from small-scale
peacekeeping or humanitarian missions to
large-scale high-intensity conflict.
142
DEFENCE
A permanent Joint Headquarters, at
Northwood in London, and a Joint
Rapid Deployment Force became
operational in 1996. They will
strengthen Britain’s ability to project
military forces worldwide in support
of its interests and will enable the
three armed Services to work
together more effectively.
The highest priority continues to be placed
on maximising the cost-effectiveness and
military capabilities of the armed forces.
Published in 1993, the Defence Costs
Study—Front Line First (see p. 149)—
examined all areas of administration and
support to the front line to ensure that the
money spent contributes to fighting capability.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
NATO has provided Britain’s main means of
defence against a major external threat for over
45 years. It is the only security organisation
with the military means to back up its security
guarantees and has consequently undertaken
action on behalf of the UN in former
Yugoslavia. NATO unites the interests of
Europe and North America in the pursuit of
peace, stability and well-being in the whole of
Europe. Most of Britain’s forces are
committed to NATO.
Adaptation of NATO
As part of its continuing post-Cold War
evolution NATO launched a number of
important initiatives at the 1994 Summit,
including the creation of the Combined Joint
Task Force concept, the Partnership for Peace,
the enlargement of NATO, and the
development of a stronger European defence
identity. NATO also agreed to intensify and
expand its efforts against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction (see p. 133).
Combined Joint Task Force
I he Combined Joint Task Force concept will
enable NATO to carry out a wide range of
crisis management missions, such as support
for peacekeeping operations under the auspices
of the UN and the OSCE. It also gives NATO
the flexibility within the Alliance’s command
structures to involve other non-NATO
countries in its operations.
Partnership for Peace
The Partnership for Peace seeks to deepen
co-operative political and military ties
between NATO and the central and eastern
European countries. It also promotes better
co-operation between military forces engaged
in multinational operations such as
peacekeeping and humanitarian relief. By
April 1996, 27 states had signed the
Partnership for Peace, including Russia,
almost all the central and eastern European
states, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Malta
and most of the central Asian and Trans-
Caucasian states of the former Soviet Union.
In addition to its work within NATO on
Partnership for Peace, Britain has signed
formal Memoranda of Understanding on
bilateral defence contacts with 16 central and
eastern European countries. The Memoranda
are designed to promote stability in the
region, encourage openness in all military
affairs and develop closer co-operation
between the states concerned and Western
security institutions. Britain’s contacts
include exchanges between Ministers and
senior military and civilian staff, the
provision of places on British military
training courses, English language training
and assistance with the development of
expertise in defence management.
NATO Enlargement
NATO is committed to opening Alliance
membership to other European countries.
Following a study into the principles guiding
enlargement and their implications, NATO
agreed to intensify discussions with interested
members of the Partnership for Peace and to
work towards strengthening ties between
NATO and all Partner countries. These
discussions will lead in due course to
individual countries being invited to apply for
NATO membership.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
European Defence Identity
The Alliance is also taking steps to develop,
within an adapted NATO, a stronger
European defence identity that would permit
the creation of effective forces capable of
operating under the control of the WEU in
line with the objectives agreed at the 1994
Summit.
NATO Force and Command Structures
The size, availability and deployment of
NATO forces reflect the Alliance’s defensive
nature. NATO strategy involves:
• deployment in Europe of smaller and
highly mobile flexible forces;
• a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons;
• a higher proportion of forces kept at lower
levels of readiness;
• increased importance of mobile reserves
and augmentation forces; and
• the continuing need for force
modernisation.
Forces available to NATO fall into three
categories: immediate and rapid reaction, main
defence and augmentation forces.
Under the present structure, major NATO
commands exist for Allied Command Europe
and Allied Command Atlantic. Among the
sub-commands covering Britain is Allied
Forces North West Europe, which
incorporates the land mass of Britain and
Norway, the United Kingdom air defence
region and the North Sea; it is commanded
from headquarters at RAF High Wycombe, in
Buckinghamshire. NATO members have
agreed that the command structure should be
renovated to reflect the new circumstances and
challenges facing the Alliance; changes, once
agreed, will be made over the next few years.
UNITED KINGDOM DEFENCE POLICY
The aim of Britain’s defence strategy is:
• to deter any threats to, and, if necessary,
defend the freedom and territorial
integrity of, Britain and its Dependent
Territories; this includes providing
support as necessary for the civil authority
in countering terrorism;
• to contribute to the promotion of Britain’s
wider security interests, including the
protection of freedom, democratic
institutions and free trade; and
• to promote peace and help maximise
Britain’s international prestige and
influence.
Within this aim is a range of tasks which
define the military activities to be undertaken
by the Ministry of Defence and the armed
forces in order to give effect to defence and
security policy.
Britain and its Dependencies
The armed forces continue to have day-to-day
responsibility for safeguarding Britain’s
territory, airspace and territorial waters. They
also provide for the security and
reinforcement, as necessary, of the Dependent
Territories and, when required, support for
the civil authorities in Britain and the
Dependent Territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy ensures the integrity of
British territorial waters and the protection of
British rights and interests in the surrounding
seas. The maintenance of a 24-hour,
year-round presence in British waters provides
considerable reassurance to merchant ships
and other mariners. The Royal Air Force
(RAF) also contributes to maritime
requirements, for instance through the
Nimrod MR2 force, which provides air
surveillance of surface vessels and submarines.
Land Defence
Regular Army units committed to activities in
defence of Britain and its Dependent
Territories include 24 Infantry battalions and
seven Home Service battalions. Tasks include
contributing to the security of national and
NATO nuclear forces, military support to the
machinery of government in war, military aid
to the civil power throughout Britain and its
144
DEFENCE
Dependent Territories, maintaining the
security of the Dependent Territories and
State ceremonial and public duties.
Air Defence
Air defence of Britain and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the Improved United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment (IUKADGE),
supplemented by the NATO Airborne Early
Warning Force, to which the RAF contributes
six E-3D aircraft. The RAF also provides six
squadrons of all-weather Tornado F3 air
defence aircraft, supported by tanker aircraft
and, in wartime, an additional F3 squadron
and armed Hawk trainer aircraft. Royal Navy
air defence destroyers can be also linked to the
IUKADGE, providing radar and electronic
warfare coverage and surface-to-air missiles.
Ground-launched Rapier missiles defend the
main RAF bases. Naval aircraft also contribute
to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
Britain maintains garrisons in Hong Kong,
Gibraltar, the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus
and the Falkland Islands. The Hong Kong
garrison is being reduced in stages until 1997,
when the territory will revert to Chinese
sovereignty (see p. 123). Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities for
NATO in the western Mediterranean, and
Cyprus acts as a base for operations in the
Middle East and North Africa.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces provide support to the Royal
Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in maintaining law
and order and countering terrorism. There are
currently 18 major units in the infantry role
assigned to Northern Ireland, including six
Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish
Regiment. The number of those major units
deployed to the province at any one time is
dependent on the prevailing security situation.
Fhe Royal Navy patrols territorial waters
around Northern Ireland and its inland
waterways in order, among other things, to
deter and intercept the movement of terrorist
weapons. The Royal Marines provide troops to
meet Navy and Army commitments, while
RAF helicopters provide support to ground
forces.
Other Tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
• military assistance to civil ministries,
including assistance to maintain the
essentials of life in the community and
carrying out work of national importance;
• military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies;
• military search and rescue;
• military intelligence and surveillance; and
• physical protection and security.
Britain and its Allies
The foundation of Britain’s defence is
provided through its membership of NATO.
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO. Permanent contributions are made to
NATO’s standing naval forces in the Atlantic,
the English Channel and the Mediterranean.
The main components of the Fleet are:
• three aircraft carriers operating Sea
Harrier aircraft and Sea King
anti-submarine helicopters;
• 35 destroyers and frigates;
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines;
and
• amphibious forces, including two assault
ships and a helicopter carrier which is
currently under construction.
For information on Britain’s independent
nuclear deterrent see p. 147.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
145
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
component of NATO’s rapid reaction forces.
Britain is the lead nation of the Corps, which
became fully operational in April 1995.
Britain is fully committed to the continuing
effectiveness of the ARRC. It is commanded
by a British general and some 55,000 British
regular troops are assigned to it. This includes
Britain’s contribution, as the ARRC’s lead
nation, of some 60 per cent of the headquarters
staff and Corps level combat support and
combat service support units. Britain also
provides two of the ten divisions available to
the Corps—an armoured division of three
armoured brigades stationed in Germany, and
a mechanised division of two mechanised
brigades and an airborne brigade based in
Britain. An air-mobile brigade, assigned to one
of the ARRC’s two multinational divisions, is
also located in Britain. A British contingent is
present in Bosnia as part of an international
peacekeeping force from NATO and non-
NATO countries (see p. 129).
Air Forces
The RAF makes a major contribution to
NATO’s Immediate and Rapid Reaction
Forces. Around 100 fixed-wing aircraft and 40
helicopters are allocated to support these
Reaction Forces. Tornado F3 and Rapier
surface-to-air missiles form part of the
Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s
Immediate Reaction Force, while Harrier,
Tornado GR1 and GRIa provide offensive
support and tactical reconnaissance to the
Rapid Reaction Force. Chinook and Puma
helicopters provide troop airlift facilities for
the ARRC (see above) or other deployed land
forces. Tornado F3 and Tornado GRlb
aircraft support NATO’s maritime reaction
forces.
Modified RAF Tornado GR1 aircraft
(designated GRlb), equipped with the Sea
Eagle missile, have the task of maritime attack.
The Tornado GRlb force has been in service
since March 1994. The RAF will continue to
provide Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and
search and rescue helicopters.
Since 1991 the number of RAF squadrons
in Germany has been reduced to four Tornado
GR1 strike/attack squadrons, two Harrier
offensive support squadrons and a Puma/
Chinook support helicopter squadron at RAF
Bruggen and RAF Laarbruch. It is intended
that RAF Laarbruch will close in 1999 and,
subject to consultation, RAF Bruggen will
close in 2002; the aircraft squadrons and the
support helicopters currently based there will
be withdrawn to existing bases in Britain.
Meanwhile these aircraft and personnel,
alongside the continuing and significant Army
presence in Germany, are a visible sign of
Britain’s commitment to the defence of
Europe.
Other Forces
Britain contributes to NATO’s maritime
augmentation forces. These are held at the
lowest state of readiness and in peacetime
comprise ships mainly in routine refit or
maintenance. It also contributes special forces
to support reaction and main defence force
deployments for surveillance, reconnaissance,
offensive action and military assistance
operations. The United Kingdom Amphibious
Force, together with its Dutch counterpart, is
assigned to the Supreme Allied Commander
Atlantic for the reinforcement of Norway and
could be deployed by the Supreme Allied
Commander Europe, for example, with the
ARRC. The Force is also a candidate for a
range of WEU operations. RAF fighter and
transport aircraft will also be available for
WEU operations.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks to promote Britain’s wider
security interests may be undertaken
unilaterally or multilaterally with support from
NATO or directly for UN or OSCE
operations.
United Nations Operations
Britain remains a major contributor to UN
operations. Contingents are currently deployed
in Cyprus, where Britain is the largest UN
contributor, and Iraq/Kuwait.
Other Operational Deployments
Royal Navy ships of the Armilla Patrol
continue to provide reassurance and assistance
146
DEFENCE
to entitled merchant shipping in the Gulf area
and regularly participate in maritime exercises
with navies of Gulf states and Gulf war
coalition allies. The Patrol also conducts
interception and boarding operations to ensure
that ships do not breach UN sanctions against
Iraq (see p. 130).
The number of operations against
trafficking in illicit drugs has increased in
recent years, especially in the Caribbean,
where the West Indies Guardship and other
Royal Navy ships work closely with the
authorities of the United States, the
Dependent Territories and the Regional
Security System to combat drug trafficking.
Although primary responsibility for this work
rests with other government departments, the
armed forces assist where this can be done
without detriment to the performance of other
military tasks.
British Garrisons
A British garrison is maintained in Brunei,
South-East Asia, at the request of the Brunei
Government. A British military presence is
maintained in Belize, Central America, in the
form of a jungle training support unit. The
withdrawal of the full British garrison was
completed in 1994.
Military Assistance
During 1995-96, some 4,270 students from
117 countries attended military training
courses in Britain. On 1 January 1996, 353
British Service personnel (61 Royal Navy and
Royal Marines, 226 Army and 66 Royal Air
Force) were on loan in 22 countries. Their
duties include assisting, advising and training
the armed forces of the country or territory to
which they are loaned.
NUCLEAR FORCES
Britain’s operationally independent nuclear
deterrent forces continue to provide the
ultimate guarantee of national security. All of
these forces are also allocated to NATO and
make an important contribution to the
Alliance’s strategy of war prevention.
British nuclear forces currently comprise
two Vanguard class ballistic missile
submarines, carrying Trident missiles
procured from the United States and equipped
with British nuclear warheads, together with
free-fall nuclear bombs carried by RAF
Tornado aircraft. A third Vanguard class
submarine will enter service in 1998 and a
fourth around the turn of the century. Four
submarines will ensure that Britain can
maintain continuous deterrent patrols
throughout the 25-year life of the Trident
force.
Adjusting to improving strategic
circumstances, Britain is deploying far fewer
warheads on each submarine than the Trident
system’s theoretical maximum. The
assignment of Trident to both the strategic and
sub-strategic nuclear roles is also allowing
reductions in the size of Britain’s nuclear
deterrent forces. All nuclear free-fall bombs
will be taken out of service by the end of 1998,
and Trident will then provide Britain’s single
nuclear system.
DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
PROGRAMMES
Modern equipment is essential if one of the
key aims of Britain’s force restructuring
programme is to be achieved, namely that of
increasing the flexibility and mobility of the
armed forces. The outcome of the Defence
Costs Study (see p. 149) has enabled the
British Government to preserve the front line
(and its essential operational support) and to
make a number of important improvements in
the armed forces.
Current and planned front-line
improvements for the Royal Navy equipment
programme include:
• the introduction of the rest of the Trident
submarines;
• an invitation to tender for the design and
building of a second batch of Trafalgar
class submarines to enter service at the
beginning of the next century;
• a substantially modernised destroyer and
frigate fleet, including the introduction of
a new air defence frigate developed
collaboratively with France and Italy;
147
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• a follow-on batch of 7 Sandown class
single role minehunters;
• introduction of a new helicopter carrier,
planned to enter service in 1998, to
enhance Britain’s amphibious forces;
• 18 new Sea Harrier F/A2 aircraft and the
upgrading of the existing Harriers to F/A2
standard; and
• the building of replacements for the
assault ships Fearless and Intrepid.
The Army front line is being enhanced by:
• the introduction of an all-Challenger 2
tank fleet;
• Westland Apache attack helicopters to
replace the Lynx in the anti-armour role;
• improved Rapier and new Starstreak
missiles to improve air defence;
• a new medium-range anti-tank missile;
and
• a new generation of combat radios.
Improvements for the RAF include:
• the Eurofighter 2000 from the beginning
of the next century;
• upgrading of the Jaguar, Tornado GR1 (to
GR4), and Tornado F3 aircraft;
• refurbishment of the Nimrod maritime
patrol aircraft;
• orders for new air-launched anti-armour
and stand-off missiles; and
• orders for further EH101 and Chinook
support helicopters and the introduction
of Hercules C130J aircraft from 1997.
THE ARMED FORCES
Personnel
It is predicted that by April 1997 the strength
of the armed forces will be around 111,000 in
the Army, about 57,000 in the RAF and about
46,000 in the Royal Navy. In April 1996
regular reserves totalled 263,800 and volunteer
reserves and auxiliary forces almost 62,000.
Civilian staff numbers are planned to fall from
127,700 (in April 1996) to 115,800 (102,600
British-based and 13,200 locally engaged) by
2002.
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the
ranks or by direct entry based on educational
and other qualifications, are granted for short,
medium and long terms. All three Services
have schemes for school, university and college
sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities.
Higher training for officers is currently
provided by the Royal Naval College and Joint
Services Defence College, Greenwich; the
Army Staff College, Camberley; and the Royal
Air Force Staff College, Bracknell. The
Defence Costs Study (see p. 149) concluded
that courses should be subsumed into a
tri-Service course which will reinforce the
joint approach to the tactical and operational
levels of conflict. As such, the Joint Services
Command and Staff College will be
established in 1997 at Camberley. The Higher
Command and Staff Course, conducted at
Camberley, will remain as a focus for the study
of the operational level of command, but will
be expanded from 24 to 30 officers for each
course to increase the joint service aspect.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks in
the Army and the RAF range from six months
to 22 years; they can be for a maximum of 37
years in the Royal Navy (22 years in the Royal
Marines). There is a wide choice of
engagement length and terms of service.
Subject to a minimum period of service,
entrants may leave at any time, giving 18
months’ notice (12 months for certain
engagements). Discharge may also be granted
on compassionate or medical grounds.
Throughout their Service careers,
non-commissioned personnel receive basic
training supplemented by specialist training.
Study for educational qualifications is
encouraged and Service trade and technical
training lead to nationally recognised
qualifications.

DEFENCE
Reserve Forces
Reserve forces are a central component of
Britain’s armed forces. They include members
who become reservists following a period of
regular service (regular reserve); others are
volunteers who train in their spare time.
Volunteer reserve forces include the Royal
Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve, the
Territorial Army, the Royal Auxiliary Air
Force and the Royal Air Force Volunteer
Reserve. Reserves are available to support
regular forces, either as units or as individuals,
in time of tension or war. In particular,
reserves can provide skills and units not
available or required in peacetime. Reserves
are also a valuable link between the Services
and the civil community. New legislation (the
Reserve Forces Act 1996) allows more flexible
use of the Reserves, especially the Volunteer
Reserves, in roles such as peacekeeping,
humanitarian and disaster relief operations.
ADMINISTRATION
The Defence Budget
The estimated defence budget for 1996-97 is
£21,425 million, with expenditure plans for
1997-98 and 1998-99 of £21,923 million and
£22,624 million respectively. The
Government anticipates a reduction of 14.5
per cent in real terms between 1992-93 and
1997—98. By 1998—99 defence spending will
reduce to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic
product; the current average for NATO
countries is 2.3 per cent.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence has a dual role as a
Department of State and the highest military
headquarters of the armed forces. A unified
Central Staff made up of military officers and
civilians is responsible for defence policy,
resource allocation and equipment
requirements, direction of operations at the
highest level, and management policy for the
armed forces and the Ministry of Defence.
Department support services are provided
to the Head Office, Commands and
budget-holders by, among others, the
Procurement Executive, the Defence
Intelligence Service, the Defence Estates
Organisation, and the Defence Export Services
Organisation.
Each Service’s Chief of Staff is responsible,
through the Chief of the Defence Staff and the
Secretary of State for Defence, for the fighting
effectiveness, efficiency and morale of his
Service. They and the other senior officers and
officials at the head of each of the
Department’s main functions form a single
body responsible for all the activities of the
Ministry of Defence and the armed forces.
This corporate board is chaired by the
permanent civilian head of the Department,
the Permanent Under-Secretary.
Since 1991, military and civilian managers
have been given ever greater authority and
responsibility for fulfilling their objectives
through the most efficient use of the resources
allocated to them. This is aimed at achieving
greater value for money and clearer direction
and accountability. The Defence Costs Study
examined all aspects of the Ministry of
Defence other than the front line itself. Its aim
was to identify cost savings that could be made
in the support area without reducing front-line
effectiveness, and the study teams examined
over 30 functional areas. As a result, in 1994
proposals were announced for savings of
£750 million in 1996-97, rising to more than
£1,000 million a year by the end of the decade,
together with a number of improvements in
the equipment programme.
Wherever possible the Study sought to
identify and implement changes designed to
achieve greater working efficiency rather than
financial savings. Major emphasis was placed
on a clearer definition of the role of the Head
Office, further delegation of responsibility to
Commands and budget-holders outside
London and the rationalisation of many
Commands, and training and support activities
on a joint-Service basis.
Defence Procurement
About 40 per cent of the defence budget is
spent on military equipment, including the
procurement of spares and associated costs.
The aim is to procure equipment, works and
services from the suppliers offering the best
149
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
value for money, taking all relevant factors into
account. When assessing options, particular
consideration is given not just to the initial
procurement cost of a project, but also to the
costs that could be necessary to support it
through its Service life. Competition is
fundamental to obtaining value for money and
takes place wherever possible. In general,
competitions are open to prime and
sub-contractors from overseas. Britain also
seeks to promote market liberalisation for
defence equipment worldwide.
International Procurement Collaboration
International collaborative projects are
becoming increasingly important as equipment
development and production costs increase
and defence budgets are reduced. Britain
favours such co-operation wherever it makes
economic and military sense by providing
value for money and improving
standardisation. It therefore plays an active
role in NATO’s Conference of National
Further Reading
Armaments Directors, which promotes
equipment collaboration between NATO
members. Britain is also a member of the
WEU’s Western European Armaments
Group, which is the main European forum for
consultations about armaments.
Current collaborative programmes include:
• development of the Eurofighter 2000
(with Germany, Italy and Spain);
• anti-tank guided weapons (with Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands);
• a new air defence frigate (with France and
Italy);
• the Multiple Launch Rocket System (with
the United States, Germany, France and
Italy);
• the EH 101 helicopter (with Italy);
• anti-air missiles (with France and Italy);
and
• a multi-role armoured vehicle (with
France and Germany).

The British economy emerged from recession in 1992 and is continuing to grow,
with inflation remaining at historically low levels. Output is currently more
than 7 per cent above the previous peak reached in 1990. Growth has taken place
across a broad front, with major contributions coming from exports and
consumer spending. The current economic climate is also characterised by
falling unemployment and low interest rates. The economy is based primarily
on private enterprise, with the private sector accounting for 82 per cent of
output and 79 per cent of employment. Government economic policies are
designed to help businesses and individuals generate sustainable economic
growth and rising prosperity by creating a stable economic environment with
permanently low inflation and sound public finances, and by allowing markets
to operate efficiently.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Output
From 1981 to 1990 the British economy
experienced nine years of sustained growth at
an annual average rate of over 3 per cent. In
the early 1990s, Britain, in common with other
major industrial countries, experienced
recession, with output falling by over 3 per
cent between mid-1990 and mid-1992.
Economic recovery began in the second half of
1992 and output has increased each year since
then. Values for some of the main economic
indicators in selected years since 1985 are
shown in Table 11.1.
Following a rise in gross domestic product
(GDP) of 4 per cent in 1994, economic growth
slowed to 2.5 per cent in 1995 as the
Government tightened monetary policy to
ward off emerging inflationary pressures. In
the second quarter of 1996 GDP was 2.2 per
cent higher than a year earlier. GDP growth is
expected to be stronger in the second half of
1996 and through 1997.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector (finance,
tourism, shipping and aviation, and so on),
which now accounts for around two-thirds of
GDP, compared with about one-half in 1950.
Manufacturing contributes less than one-
quarter of GDP, compared with over a third in
1950.
Output of the services industries reached a
record level in 1995, up 2.9 per cent on the

previous year. In the second quarter of 1996
services output was 3.2 per cent higher than a
year earlier.
Manufacturing output was adversely
affected by oil price rises and bouts of
stagnation in the world economy in the 1970s
and early 1980s. A period of growth then
occurred until 1990, when manufacturing
output again fell significantly during the
recession. Manufacturing growth resumed
slowly in 1992, and in 1995 there was a 2.2 per
cent increase in manufacturing output.
Oil and gas output reached a peak in the
mid-1980s and then declined. Since 1991 it has
recovered, with exceptionally high increases in
1993 and 1994, when output grew by 14 and 24
per cent respectively. It was up by 5.7 per cent
in 1995, and in the three months to August 1996
was 8.3 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Table 11.2 shows output and employment
in 1994 and 1995, and Table 11.3 compares
GDP by industry in 1985 and 1995.
Productivity
Between 1980 and 1994 output per head
increased by an average of 2.1 per cent a year
in the economy as a whole and by 4.6 per cent
a year in manufacturing. Output per head in
the whole economy rose by 1.8 per cent in
1995, although the rise in manufacturing was
lower, at 1.1 per cent.
Investment and Profitability
During the 1980s fixed capital investment
increased by about 4 per cent a year on
average. It declined during the recession of the

early 1990s, but has recovered since 1992,
although it fell very slightly in 1995; in the
second quarter of 1996 investment grew by 3.2
per cent, compared with a year earlier.
Between 1980 and 1995 the private
sector’s share of fixed capital investment
increased from 70 to 83 per cent, due in part
to privatisation (see p. 207). In the same
period, there was a rise in the share of
investment undertaken by the services
sector and a fall in that carried out by
manufacturing. Table 11.4 shows investment
by business sector.
A recent survey disclosed that Britain had
16 of the 25 most profitable quoted companies
in Europe. The rate of return on capital
employed in non-oil industrial and commercial
companies in Britain increased in the late
1980s to the highest levels for 20 years. It then
declined, but since 1992 there has been a
recovery. Non-oil corporate earnings grew
strongly in 1995, when net profitability of
industrial and commercial companies reached
9 per cent.
Inward Investment
Britain is recognised as a prime location for
inward direct investment and over 8,000
overseas companies are currently operating in
Britain, including more than 4,200 from the
United States, over 1,000 from Germany and
210 from Japan. Attractions include Britain’s
membership of the European Union (EU) and
proximity to other European markets, its open
trading system and ‘enterprise culture’, stable
labour relations and comparatively low
personal and corporate taxation. Overseas-
owned firms are offered the same incentives as
British-owned ones.

In recent years Britain has received the
greatest share of inward investment into the
European Union, including about 40 per cent
of Japanese and of US investment. It is second
only to the United States as a destination for
international direct investment.
Inflation
During most of the 1950s and the 1960s
the inflation rate in Britain rarely rose
above 5 per cent. However, in 1971 it
reached double figures, climbing to 27 per
cent in 1975. Contributory factors included
oil price rises in 1973 and increases in the
money supply and public spending. Inflation
fell in the early 1980s and stayed low for
a number of years, before picking up
towards the end of the decade and
reaching a peak of 10.9 per cent during
1990.
Since then inflation has declined
substantially. For the Retail Prices Index
(RPI—which records the price of goods
and services purchased by households in
Britain), the annual rate was 2.1 per cent in
August 1996. The RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments (‘underlying’ inflation) was
2.8 per cent in August 1996. Underlying
inflation has now been below 4 per cent for
four years, the longest period for almost 50
years.
Labour Market
Following an increase of over 3 million
between 1983 and 1990, the workforce in
employment fell by around 2 million in the
early 1990s. With economic recovery,
employment levels have stabilised at an earlier
stage than in previous cycles and are now
rising.
Unemployment increased during the early
1990s, reaching nearly 3 million on a seasonally
adjusted basis in 1992, 10.6 per cent of the
workforce. Since then it has fallen by over
870,000. In August 1996 it was 2.1 million—
7.5 per cent of the workforce—the lowest level
for more than five years (see p. 188).
The number of working days lost through
industrial disputes in 1994 and 1995 was the
lowest since records began over 100 years
ago.
Overseas Trade
Britain has an open economy in which
international trade plays a vital part. The share
of GDP accounted for by exports of goods and
services was 28 per cent in 1995. Investment
income on overseas assets now accounts for
around 30 per cent of all Britain’s overseas
earnings.
Membership of the European Union has
had a major impact on Britain’s pattern of
trade. Between 1972—the year before Britain
156
ECONOMY
became a member—and 1995 the share of its
exports of goods going to other EU members
rose from 40 per cent to almost 60 per cent.
Imports have followed a similar trend, rising
from 45 per cent to 57 per cent. Germany,
Britain’s most important trading partner,
accounts for 13 per cent of Britain’s exports
and nearly 16 per cent of its imports.
Since 1983 Britain has had a deficit on its
trade in goods. In 1995 it stood at £11,600
million, about £800 million higher than in
1994. Nevertheless, exports have recently
performed strongly as a result of improved
competitiveness and a sharp recovery in world
trade.
Substantial earnings from trade in services
and from overseas investments kept the
balance of payments current account in surplus
between 1980 and 1985, but it has been in
deficit since then. The deficit rose slightly
from £2,419 million in 1994 to £2,892 million
in 1995, although these figures were the lowest
levels for nearly a decade. In 1995 exports of
services amounted to 23 per cent of exports of
goods and services combined.
Energy
With the exploitation of oil and natural gas
from the Continental Shelf, particularly under
the North Sea, Britain is self-sufficient in
energy in net terms and expects to remain so
for some years. In 1995 it was the world’s
ninth largest oil producer. The extraction of oil
and gas accounted for 2.1 per cent of GDP in
1995, while crude oil and petroleum products
made up about 6 per cent of exports of goods.
The benefits to the balance of payments
began to appear in the second half of the
1970s, and in 1980 Britain had its first surplus
on oil trade. Exports, mainly to other EU
countries, are equivalent to 75 per cent of
domestic oil and gas production. They are
partly offset in balance-of-payments terms by
imports of other grades of crude oil from the
Middle East and elsewhere.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The Government’s strategy is directed at
providing the stability needed by business and
individuals to plan ahead and generate lasting
economic expansion and prosperity. It seeks to
do this by creating a stable macroeconomic
environment and by means of structural
policies to improve the long-term performance
of the economy.
The Government’s economic policy is
outlined in the medium-term financial
strategy, which is published each year at the
time of the Budget. Within this strategy, the
role of monetary policy is to secure
permanently low inflation, while fiscal policy is
designed to maintain sound public finances.
Macroeconomic policy is focused on
creating a stable economic environment.
Microeconomic policies seek to improve the
working of markets and encourage enterprise,
efficiency and flexibility through measures
such as privatisation, developing new
partnerships with the private sector,
deregulation, promoting competition, trade
liberalisation, labour market reform, better
training, and tax reforms.
Monetary Policy
Since 1992 the Government has set an explicit
target of keeping underlying inflation within a
range of 1 to 4 per cent, bringing it down to
the lower half of this range—2.5 per cent or
less—by the end of the present Parliament,
and a target of 2.5 per cent or less
subsequently.
Short-term interest rates remain the key
instrument of monetary policy. Monetary
policy takes time to influence inflation: hence,
interest rate decisions are based on an
assessment of the prospects for underlying
inflation in one to two years’ time. That
assessment is based on a wide range of
information, including monetary and other
financial indicators, activity indicators and
measures of costs.
Since 1994 a record has been published of
the monthly monetary meeting between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor
of the Bank of England. This, together with
the Bank’s Quarterly Inflation Report—which
is prepared independently of the Treasury
—and full explanations whenever interest rates
are changed, is designed to make Britain’s
monetary policy framework as open as
possible.
157
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fiscal Policy
The Government aims to bring the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) back
towards balance over the medium term, and in
particular to ensure that the Government
borrows no more than is required to finance
net capital spending. It is committed to
reducing the share of public expenditure in
national income to below 40 per cent of GDP,
and at the same time constantly improving
value for money and providing extra resources
for priority services (see pp. 161—2).
Within the overall policy of moving
towards a balanced budget, the Government
aims to reduce taxes when possible so as to
leave businesses and individuals with more of
their own money. The basic rate of income
tax has been cut from 33 to 24 per cent,
and a lower rate of 20 per cent now applies
on the first /3,900 of taxable income (see
pp. 166-7).
Supply-side Policies
The Government is trying to improve the
supply response, and thus the efficiency, of the
economy through microeconomic policies.
Action has been taken to expose as much of the
economy to market forces as possible. Direct
controls—for example, on pay, prices, foreign
exchange, dividend payments and commercial
credit—have been abolished and competition
in domestic markets strengthened.
A substantial number of activities have been
transferred from the public to the private
sector through privatisation and contracting
out. In addition, the Government is seeking
greater efficiency and value for money in the
public sector through market testing and
competitive tendering, efficiency reviews and
scrutinies, and better financial management.
The Government’s Private Finance Initiative
aims to provide high quality capital assets and
services to the public using private-sector
financing and know-how (see pp. 162-3).
Measures have been implemented to reduce
regulatory burdens on business and
administrative obstacles facing small firms and
self-employed people (see p. 208). Where there
is evidence of market failure, and government
intervention can be cost-effective and is likely
to cause minimal distortion, efforts have been
made to increase the flow of investment funds
to small firms, help facilitate innovation in
industry and attract industry to the inner
cities. Steps have been taken to encourage
saving and share ownership; TESSAs (Tax
Exempt Special Savings Accounts) and
Personal Equity Plans are recent examples (see
Chapter 15).
The Government has sought to increase
work incentives by reducing personal income
tax rates whenever possible, raising tax
thresholds and reforming the benefits system.
It has also, through the tax system, encouraged
the extension of share ownership among
employees. A scheme of income tax relief has
been introduced to encourage the spread of
profit-related pay. The Government has
expanded training opportunities and put in
place a new training framework, with a greater
role for employers, so that training better
reflects labour market needs.
Since 1994 the Government has issued an
annual White Paper with measures designed to
improve business competitiveness. The first
contained over 60 new measures, many
relating to improving education and training
and the performance of small businesses (see
p. 206). The most recent, published in June
1996, included new analysis on skills and
competitiveness in firms, with over 130
examples of excellence for firms to follow. It
contained further measures on education and
training, and measures to attract more inward
investment, create new jobs and raise living
standards.
Economic Management
HM Treasury has prime responsibility for the
formulation and conduct of economic policy,
which it carries out in conjunction with the
Bank of England (the central bank—see
pp. 222-3) and other government departments
—Trade and Industry, Education and
Employment, the Environment, Transport,
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food. While the Chancellor of the Exchequer
makes the decisions about whether to change
interest rates, the Governor of the Bank of
England is responsible for deciding the precise
timing of any interest rate change.
158
ECONOMY
Several other bodies deal with specific
aspects of economic policy and the regulation
of certain sectors of the economy. These
include the Office of Fair Trading and the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (see
pp. 208-9), with responsibilities for protecting
consumers and ensuring markets work
effectively and fairly.
The Government makes known its
economic policies and keeps in touch with
developments throughout the economy by
means of informal and continuous links with
representatives from the industrial, financial
and commercial sectors as well as other
interested parties. This includes the Panel of
Independent Forecasters, which reports to
the Chancellor twice a year on the current
position of, and future prospects for, the
economy. Final responsibility for the broad
lines of economic policy rests with the
Cabinet.
NATIONAL INCOME AND
EXPENDITURE
The value of all goods and services produced
in the economy is measured by GDP. This
may be expressed either in terms of market
prices (the prices people pay for the goods and
services they buy) or at factor cost (the cost of
the goods and services before adding taxes and
subtracting subsidies). It can also be expressed
in current prices or in constant prices (that is,
removing the effects of inflation to measure the
volume of growth in the economy). In 1995
GDP at current factor cost totalled £604,259
million. Between 1985 and 1995 the index of
GDP at constant factor cost increased by 25
per cent.
Table 11.5 gives figures for GDP, at both
current market prices and current factor cost.
It also shows the components of two other
main aggregates, gross national product and
national income.
Table 11.6 shows the categories of total
final expenditure in 1995. Consumers’
expenditure accounted for over 49 per cent of
total final expenditure, and exports of goods
and services for 22 per cent.
Personal Incomes and Expenditure
Personal disposable income consists of
personal incomes after deductions—mainly
taxation and social security contributions. This
rose from £243,413 million in 1985 to
£502,433 million at current prices in 1995.
Personal disposable income in 1995 was 3 per
cent higher in real terms than in 1994.
Consumers’ expenditure, though, rose by only
2 per cent in real terms and there was a rise in
the savings ratio (see p. 160).
Consumers’ expenditure amounted to 89
per cent of post-tax personal income in 1995.

Table 11.7 shows the changing pattern of
consumers’ expenditure from 1985 to 1995.
Declining proportions are being spent on food
and alcoholic drink, tobacco, clothing and
footwear, and fuel and power. Over the longer
term, as incomes rise, people tend to spend
increasing proportions on services. Spending
on leisure pursuits and tourism, health and
financial services have all shown significant
growth in recent years. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, tobacco, clothing and
footwear, and fuel and power together
accounted for 45 per cent of the total in 1995.
The ratio of saving to personal disposable
income declined substantially during the
1980s. However, in 1992 it increased to 11.9
per cent, falling to 10.1 per cent in 1994, but
rising again to 11 per cent in 1995.
Sources of Income
The proportion of total personal pre-tax
income accounted for by income from
employment was 60 per cent in 1995; average
gross weekly earnings in April 1996 in Great
Britain were £392 for full-time male workers
and £283 for full-time female workers. The
three other main sources of personal income
were self-employment (11 per cent), rent,
dividends and interest (14 per cent), and social

security benefits and other current grants from
government (15 per cent).
PUBLIC FINANCE STRATEGY
General government expenditure (GGE) is the
total public expenditure by central and local
government, including central government
support for nationalised industries and other
public corporations. In terms of the
Government’s measure GGE (X) (see p. 163),
it is expected to be around £306,800 million in
1996—97 (see Table 11.8). The Government’s
policy is to reduce public spending to below
40 per cent of national income. Public
expenditure as a proportion of GDP is
expected to fall from 43 per cent in 1992-93 to
40.5 per cent in 1997—98 and below 40 per cent
shortly afterwards.
The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
rose rapidly during the early 1990s, largely
reflecting the impact of the recession, but since
then it has fallen and in 1995—96 amounted to
£32,200 million, 5 per cent of GDP. The
Government’s tax and spending policies are
designed to ensure that the PSBR returns
towards balance over the medium term. The
PSBR is forecast to fall to £26,900 million in
1996—97 (see Table 11.9) and to be close to
zero by the end of the 1990s.
MAIN PROGRAMMES AND
PRIORITIES
The diagram on p. 164 shows the main
categories of expenditure, together with the
main sources of revenue. The government
departments with the largest spending
programmes are:
• the Department of Social Security (with
planned expenditure of £76,800 million in
1996-97, excluding ‘cyclical’ social
security);
• the Department of the Environment
(£39,500 million, of which £31,300
million is on local government);
• the Department of Health (£33,800
million); and
• the Ministry of Defence (£21,400
million).
Planned spending is being concentrated bn
priority areas, with higher expenditure on
schools, health and the police. These increases
are being funded from savings elsewhere, for
example, in housing, defence, roads and
employment measures.
A greater contribution is being made by the
private sector in the provision of public
services through the Private Finance Initiative
and challenge funding (see below). In addition,
161
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the costs of government are being strictly
controlled, with the running costs of
government departments planned to fall by 12
per cent in real terms by 1998-99. Under
reforms to government (see Chapter 7),
departmental expenditure is being contained in
a variety of ways, including cutting
bureaucracy, waste and management
overheads; rationalising functions and
activities; and contracting out services.
Tackling the growth in social security
expenditure (which has been running at higher
levels than planned) is the Government’s most
important priority in controlling public
expenditure. A new campaign against social
security fraud is planned (see p. 431), and tax
evasion in other areas, such as vehicle excise
duty, is also being tackled.
Local authorities spend about £75,000
million a year, around a quarter of public
expenditure. The main categories of
expenditure are education, law and order,
personal social services, housing and other
environmental services, and roads and
transport.
Private Finance Initiative
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI), launched
in 1992, aims to bring the private sector more
directly into the provision of public services. It
enables the Government to obtain the benefits
of private sector capital and management
experience. Under the PFI, the public sector
acts as a purchaser rather than a provider of
services. The aim is to obtain better value for
money for the taxpayer while also providing
new business opportunities for the private
sector. Partnership between the public and
private sectors is a key feature of the PFI. The
public sector specifies the services and the level
of performance, and the private sector
competes for the opportunity to deliver the
service. By combining responsibility for
design, construction, finance and operation,
lasting partnerships can be developed.
By the end of 1998—99 contracts involving
capital investment of about £14,000 million
are expected to have been awarded under the
PFI. The largest single PFI project is the
£3,000 million Channel Tunnel Rail Link
(see p. 312).
Other transport projects include a number
of‘design, build, finance and operate’ road
projects, the largest of which is the £200
million Ml-Al link road near Leeds; a £400
million contract for new trains on London
Underground’s Northern Line; the Croydon
Tramlink; and the extension of the Docklands
Light Railway to Lewisham (see p. 312). PFI
projects in other sectors include:
• several redevelopment and improvement
projects in the National Health Service
(see p. 404);

• new prisons in Bridgend in south Wales
and Fazakerley (Merseyside) (see p. 104);
and over 100 information technology
projects;
• with a capital value of about £2,000
million, which are in progress or being
considered.
The Government has set up the Private
Finance Panel (comprising high-level
representatives from the public and private
sectors) to provide independent assistance and
advice with projects. The Panel has identified
over 1,000 potential projects, worth a total of
some £25,000 million, for consideration by the
Government.
Challenge Funding
Partnerships between the public and private
sectors on capital projects are also being
encouraged by ‘challenge funding’, under
which funding for public sector projects is
allocated on a competitive basis. So far this
approach has been used mainly in urban
regeneration. For example, successful bids for
projects supported by the Single Regeneration
Budget (see pp. 375-6) have involved a wide
range of schemes from the public, private and
voluntary sectors. Challenge funding schemes
are being investigated in other areas, such as
schools refurbishment and tackling benefit
fraud.
CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
The Government’s objective of reducing
public expenditure is expressed in terms of
GGE (X), which excludes from general
government expenditure privatisation
proceeds, spending financed out of the
proceeds of the National Lottery (see pp.
42-3), and interest and dividend receipts.
GGE (X) is a key measure and is used in the
medium-term financial strategy (see p. 157),
where public spending is set in the context of
broader economic policy.
The Government seeks to achieve its public
expenditure objective by planning and
controlling a narrower target: the Control
Total, which covers about 85 per cent of
government expenditure. The Control Total
includes:
• expenditure for which central government
is itself responsible;
• the support it provides or approves for
local authority expenditure;
• local authority self-financed expenditure;
• the external financing requirements of
public corporations, including
nationalised industries; and
• a reserve to cover unanticipated
expenditure.
It excludes accounting adjustments and the
two main items of expenditure most affected
by the economic cycle-debt interest and
cyclical social security. Annual ceilings are set
for the growth of the Control Total, in line
with the Government’s medium-term
objectives.
Planning Cycle and the Unified Budget
The present planning system took effect with
the introduction of the unified Budget
arrangements in November 1993, under which
the Government presents taxation and
spending proposals to Parliament at the same
time. The Budget now covers both the
Government’s taxation plans for the coming
financial year and its spending plans for the
next three years. The proposals are announced
to the House of Commons by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer in the Budget statement and
are published in the Financial Statement and
Budget Report. This report also contains a
review of recent developments in the economy,
together with an economic forecast, and sets
out the fiscal and monetary framework within
which economic policy operates. This is the
medium-term financial strategy.
The Budget statement is followed by the
presentation to Parliament of a set of Budget
resolutions in which the tax proposals are
embodied. These resolutions are the
foundation of the Finance Bill, published in
January. The Provisional Collection of Taxes
Act 1968 allows the tax authorities to collect
taxes provisionally, at the levels provided by
the Budget proposals, pending enactment of
the Finance Bill.

Public Expenditure Survey
Departmental spending decisions are based on
allocating available resources within agreed
ceilings for aggregate spending; resources are
devoted to priority areas, with an emphasis on
obtaining maximum value for money. The
process of deciding the individual
departmental allocations within the overall
target takes place each autumn in the Public
Expenditure Survey. The outcome is
announced in the Budget.
Estimates
Individual reports for government
departments setting out expenditure plans are
published between February and April. These
Estimates, which each government department
submits to the Treasury, give details of the
cash requirements for the coming financial
year. After Treasury approval, these Supply
Estimates are presented to Parliament.
Parliamentary authorisation is required for the
major part of the new spending plans for the
year ahead announced in the Budget.
Parliament approves them as part of the annual
Appropriation Act. Supplementary Estimates
may also be presented to Parliament during the
course of the year to reflect any necessary
changes to the original main Estimate.
If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the
Committee of Public Accounts (see p. 165)
may investigate before Parliament is asked to
approve any Excess Vote to balance the
account. In each parliamentary session, up to
three ‘Estimates days’ are available for debates
on the Supply Estimates, following scrutiny by
select committees of the House of Commons.
Cash Limits
The Government sets cash limits on just over
60 per cent of Supply expenditure—
expenditure financed out of money voted by
Parliament in the Supply Estimates. The
imposition of cash limits indicates that the
Government intends to avoid extra provision
for programmes even in the event of
unexpected increases in costs. They cover the
major part of grants to local authorities, which
164
ECONOMY
are financed out of Supply expenditure. Cash
limits also apply to some expenditure not voted
in the Estimates. Running cost limits are
imposed on the administrative costs of central
government, which are identified separately in
the Estimates.
Those Estimates not subject to cash limits
mainly finance demand-led services like income
support from the Department of Social Security.
In such cases, once policy and rates of payment
are determined, expenditure depends on factors
beyond the direct control of government—such
as the number of eligible recipients.
Changes in Government Accounting
Procedures
Government proposals to change accounting
and budgeting procedures by government
departments were set out in a White Paper in
1995. Cash-based government accounts will be
replaced by more commercial ‘resource
accounting’ and budgeting methods, a process
already adopted in executive agencies and the
National Health Service. The new methods are
designed to strengthen cash management,
bring improved efficiency and focus more on
departmental objectives and outputs in terms
of resources used rather than the money
available for spending. Departments will have
their own balance sheets showing assets and
liabilities. Resource accounting is expected to
be introduced for most departments in April
1997 and the remainder in April 1998. The
first resource-based Public Expenditure
Survey is expected to be produced in 2000. In
February 1996 the Financial Reporting
Advisory Board was set up to provide
independent advice to the Government on the
new accounting principles.
Central Government Funds
The Government’s sterling expenditure is
largely met out of the Consolidated Fund, an
account at the Bank of England into which tax
receipts and other revenues are paid. Any
excess of expenditure over receipts is met by
the National Loans Fund, which is another
official sterling account at the Bank of England
and is the repository for funds borrowed by the
Government. The National Insurance Fund,
into which contributions are paid by employers
and employed people, is used mainly to pay for
social security benefits.
Examination and Audit of Public
Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the activities
of particular government departments and
cross-examine ministers and officials.
The Committee of Public Accounts considers
the accounts of government departments,
executive agencies and other public sector
bodies, and reports by the Comptroller and
Auditor General (see below) on departments and
their use of resources. It submits reports to
Parliament. The Government’s formal replies to
the reports are presented to Parliament in the
form of Treasury minutes, and the reports and
minutes are usually debated annually in the
Commons.
Audit of the Government’s spending is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of
the National Audit Office, who has two
distinct functions:
• as Comptroller General, responsibility for
ensuring that all revenue and other public
money payable to the Consolidated Fund
and the National Loans Fund is duly paid
and that all payments from these funds are
authorised by statute; and
• as Auditor General, responsibility for
certifying the accounts of all government
departments and executive agencies and
those of a wide range of other public
sector bodies; scrutinising the economy,
efficiency and effectiveness of their
operations; examining revenue accounts
and inventories; and reporting the results
of these examinations to Parliament.
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax;
• taxes on expenditure, which include VAT
(value added tax) and customs and excise
duties; and
165
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• National Insurance contributions, which
give entitlement to a range of benefits.
Among the other sources are inheritance tax,
capital gains tax, and the council tax and
business rates.
Taxation Policy
The overall level of taxation—around 36 per
cent of GDP—is below the average for
member states of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Government’s programme of tax reform
has sought to maintain a climate in which
business can thrive and individual initiative is
rewarded. Its aims include:
• keeping the overall tax burden as low as
possible through firm control over public
expenditure;
• reducing marginal tax rates of income and
profits to sharpen incentives to work and
create wealth;
• maintaining a broad tax base, which helps
to keep tax rates low and avoids distorting
commercial decisions; and
• shifting the balance of taxation from taxes
on income to taxes on expenditure.
Steps have also been taken to close tax
loopholes. The Government is committed to
simplifying the administration of the tax
system, both for individuals and for
companies. For example, tax law is to be
rewritten so that it is easier to understand.
Tax Measures in the 1995 Budget
The November 1995 Budget aimed to cut tax in
a way designed to improve incentives and boost
enterprise. Taxes for 1996-97 were reduced by
over £3,000 million. Measures included:
• cutting the basic rate of income tax from
25 per cent in 1995-96 to 24 per cent in
1996-97;
• widening the lower rate band (20 per cent)
by £700 (see Table 11.10);
• increasing personal allowances by £100
more than ‘indexation’ (allowing for the
effects for inflation);
• reducing taxes on savings income, such as
bank and building society deposits, for
basic rate taxpayers, from 25 to 20 per
cent; and
• introducing measures to help protect
family savings, with a large increase in the
starting point for inheritance tax (see
p. 169) and a doubling to £16,000 in the
level of assets below which people are
eligible for help for care in residential and
nursing homes.
Measures to boost enterprise included
cutting the small companies’ rate of
corporation tax (see p. 168) from 25 to 24 per
cent, a series of changes to stimulate employee
share ownership, and extra help for businesses
facing higher non-domestic rates bills. The
Budget’s measures for taxes on spending
included raising in real terms road fuel duties
by 5 per cent and tobacco duties by 3 per cent,
thereby continuing the policy announced in
the November 1993 Budget to curb vehicle
emissions and encourage people to stop
smoking. The tax on road fuel gases—
compressed gas and liquid petroleum gas—was
reduced, as these fuels produce significantly
lower levels of emissions of major pollutants.
A new landfill tax, first announced in
the 1994 Budget, was introduced in
October 1996. It is intended to promote
a more sustainable approach to waste
management by encouraging business
and consumers to produce less waste
and dispose of less waste in landfill
sites, and to provide an additional
incentive for recycling. The tax is
levied at £2 a tonne on inactive waste
(such as bricks) which does not decay
or contaminate land and £7 a tonne on
other waste. To avoid imposing
additional costs on business, cuts in
employers’ National Insurance
contributions will be made in April
1997.
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects taxes
on income, profits and capital, and stamp duty.
HM Customs and Excise collects the most
important taxes on expenditure (VAT and
most duties). Vehicle excise duty is the
166
ECONOMY
responsibility of the Department of Transport.
National Insurance contributions are the
responsibility of the Department of Social
Security, although they are mainly collected by
the Inland Revenue. The council tax and
business rates are collected by local authorities.
In March 1996, as part of a series of
measures designed to help small firms, the
Government announced that the tax and
National Insurance contributions systems for
new businesses would be streamlined, for
example, by adopting a single form of
registration for new self-employed business
people for VAT, PAYE income tax (see below)
and National Insurance contributions.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Taxes on individual incomes are generally
progressive in that larger incomes bear a
greater amount of tax. Income tax is imposed
for the year of assessment beginning on 6
April. The tax rates and bands for 1995-96 and
1996-97 are shown in Table 11.10 and apply to
total income, including earned and investment
income. Of nearly 26 million income taxpayers,
around 6.3 million are expected to pay only
lower rate tax in 1996-97, about 17.3 million will
be basic rate taxpayers and 2 million will be in
the higher rate tax band.
A number of allowances and reliefs reduce
an individual’s income tax liability, and the
main allowances are shown in Table 11.10. All
taxpayers, irrespective of sex or marital status,
are entitled to a personal allowance against
income from all sources. Married women pay
their own tax on the basis of their own income.
In addition, there is a married couple’s
allowance, which may be allocated to either
partner or they may receive half each. Wives
can elect to receive half the allowance as of
right. Tax relief for some allowances,
including the married couple’s allowance, was
restricted to 20 per cent from April 1994, and
this was reduced to 15 per cent in April 1995.
Among the most important reliefs is that for
mortgage interest payments on borrowing for
house purchase up to the statutory limit of
£30,000. Relief, which has been limited to 15 per
cent since April 1995, is usually given ‘at source’,
that is, repayments which the borrower makes to

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the lender are reduced to take account of tax
relief and the tax refund is passed directly by the
tax authorities to the lender rather than to the
individual borrower. Employees’ contributions
to their pension schemes also qualify for tax relief
within limits laid down by Parliament.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income which originates in Britain—although
some forms of income are exempt, such as
certain social security benefits—and on all
income arising abroad of people resident in
Britain. Britain has entered into agreements
with many countries to provide relief from
double taxation; where such agreements are
not in force unilateral relief is often allowed.
British residents working abroad for the whole
year may benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
system whereby tax is deducted and accounted
for to the Inland Revenue by the employer, in
a way which enables most employees to pay the
correct amount of tax during the year.
A new self assessment system for
collecting personal taxation is being
introduced. It will apply to everyone
who fills in a tax return (about 9
million people). Taxpayers will be
able to calculate their own liability to
tax, although they can choose to have
the calculations done by the Inland
Revenue. A uniform set of dates will
apply for the payment of income tax
and capital gains tax. The ‘preceding
year’ basis of income tax for the
self-employed will be replaced by a
simpler ‘current year’ basis; people
who have become self-employed
since April 1994 are already being
taxed on the latter basis.
A new legal requirement to keep
records of income and capital gains
from all sources was introduced in
April 1996. The first ‘new style’ tax
returns will be sent out to taxpayers
in April 1997.
Corporation Tax
The rates of company tax in Britain are lower
than in most other industrialised countries.
Companies pay corporation tax on their income
and capital gains after deduction of certain
allowances and reliefs. A company which
distributes profits to its shareholders is required
to pay advance corporation tax (ACT) on these
distributions to the Inland Revenue. This ACT
can be set against the company’s liability to
corporation tax, subject to a limit. Shareholders
resident in Britain receiving dividends from
British-resident companies are entitled to a tax
credit, which is equivalent to the ACT paid.
This satisfies some or all of their liability to
income tax on dividend income.
The main rate of corporation tax is 33 per
cent, with a reduced rate of 24 per cent for
small companies (those with profits below
£300,000 in a year). Relief is allowed for
companies with profits between £300,000 and
£1.5 million, so that the company’s overall rate
is between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate. Relief for capital expenditure
on plant and machinery, on scientific research
and on industrial and agricultural buildings is
available in the form of capital allowances,
which are deducted from profits.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT), deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production—as
opposed, for example, to the refining—of oil
and gas in Britain and on its Continental Shelf
under licence from the Department of Trade
and Industry. Each licensee of an oilfield or
gasfield is charged at a rate of 50 per cent on
the profits from that field after deduction of
certain allowances and reliefs. New fields given
consent for development on or after 16 March
1993 and gas from certain fields sold under
contracts negotiated before 1975 are not liable
to PRT.
Taxes on Capital
The Government’s aim is to reduce taxes on
capital—inheritance tax and capital gains
tax—and to abolish them eventually.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is essentially charged on estates
at the time of death and on gifts made within
168
ECONOMY
seven years of death; most other lifetime
transfers are not taxed. There are several
important exemptions. Generally, transfers
between spouses are exempt, and gifts and
bequests to British charities, major political
parties and heritage bodies are also normally
exempt. In general, business assets are now
exempt from inheritance tax, so that most
family businesses can be passed on without a
tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40 per cent
above a threshold. This threshold was raised
from £154,000 to £200,000 in April 1996.
Only about 2 per cent of estates will now be
liable for an inheritance tax bill.
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by
individuals and trusts on gains realised from
the disposal of assets. CGT is payable on the
amount by which total chargeable gains for a
year exceed the exempt amount (£6,300 for
individuals and £3,150 for trusts in 1996-97).
For individuals, CGT is calculated at income
tax rates, as if the amount were additional
taxable income, while there are special rates for
trusts. Only gains arising since March 1982 are
subject to tax. Indexation relief is given to take
account of the effects of inflation, and this can
reduce a gain but no longer create or enhance a
capital loss—capital losses may be set against
capital gains during the same year or a
subsequent year. Gains on some types of asset
are exempt from CGT. These include the
principal private residence, government
securities, certain corporate bonds, and gains
on shares and corporate bonds owned under
Personal Equity Plans (see p. 230).
For companies capital gains are charged to
corporation tax, although there is no annual
exempt amount.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax, with a
standard rate of 17.5 per cent and a reduced
rate of 8 per cent on domestic fuel and power.
It is collected at each stage in the production
and distribution of goods and services by
taxable persons. The final tax is payable by the
consumer. When a taxable person purchases
taxable goods or services, the supplier charges
VAT—the taxable person’s input tax. When
the taxable person supplies goods or services,
the customers are then in turn charged VAT,
which is the taxable person’s output tax. The
difference between the output tax and the
input tax is paid to, or repaid by, Customs and
Excise.
The annual level of turnover above which
traders must register for VAT is £47,000.
Certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT, either by being charged at a zero rate or
by being exempt.
• Under zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but reclaims
any input tax paid to suppliers. Among
the main categories where zero-rating
applies are goods exported to other
countries, and goods shipped as stores on
ships and aircraft; most food; water and
sewerage for non-business use; domestic
and international passenger transport;
books, newspapers and periodicals;
construction of new residential buildings;
young children’s clothing and footwear;
drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription; specified aids for
handicapped people; and certain supplies
by or to charities.
• For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any output tax but
is not entitled to reclaim the input tax.
The main categories where exemption
applies are many supplies of land and
buildings; insurance; postal services;
betting; gaming (with certain important
exceptions); lotteries; finance; much
education and training; and health and
welfare.
The Government has announced a number
of changes designed to simplify VAT. These
include implementing the EC’s Second VAT
Simplification Directive.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EU in accordance with its
Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
169
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise duty and
VAT are charged in the member state of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Hydrocarbon oils used as road fuel bear higher
rates of duty than those used for other
purposes, although the rate of duty on
unleaded petrol is lower than that on leaded.
Kerosene, most lubricating oils and other oils
used for certain industrial processes are free of
duty. There are duties on spirits, beer, wine,
made-wine (wine with added constituents,
such as fruit juice), cider and perry, charged
according to alcoholic strength and volume.
Spirits used for scientific, medical, research
and industrial processes are generally free of
duty. Cigarette duty is charged partly as a cash
amount per cigarette and partly as a percentage
of retail price. Duty on other tobacco products
is based on weight.
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
amusement machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. Duty is charged
either as a percentage of gross or net stakes or,
in the case of amusement machines, as a fixed
amount per machine according to the cost of
playing and the prize level. Some of these
duties were reduced in the 1995 Budget in
response to growing competition from the
National Lottery (see pp. 42-3). On the
Lottery there is a 12 per cent duty on gross
stakes, but no tax on winnings.
Vehicle excise duty (VED) on a privately-
owned motor car, light van or taxi with fewer
than nine seats is £140 a year. The duty on
goods vehicles is levied on the basis of gross
weight and, if over 12 tonnes, according to the
number of axles; it is designed to ensure that
such vehicles at least cover their share of the
full costs of road use through the tax paid
(VED and fuel duty). Duty on taxis and buses
varies according to seating capacity, and duty
on motor cycles according to engine capacity.
Privately owned vehicles over 25 years old—
cars, taxis, motor cycles and non-commercial
vehicles—are now exempt from VED
following the 1995 Budget.
Other taxes include a 2.5 per cent tax on
most premiums for general insurance, and a
duty on air passengers of £5 for flights to
internal destinations and those in the European
Economic Area and £10 elsewhere.
Stamp Duty
Certain kinds of transfer are subject to stamp
duty. These include purchases of houses, at 1
per cent of the total price if this exceeds
£60,000. Transfers of shares attract duty at 0.5
per cent of the cost, while certain instruments,
such as declarations of trust, have small fixed
duties of 50p or £1. Transfers by gift and
transfers to charities are exempt.
Taxpayer’s Charter
The Taxpayer’s Charter sets out the standard
of service that people can expect from the
Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise.
Both departments should be fair, helpful,
courteous, efficient and accountable, and keep
taxpayers’ financial affairs private.
Other Revenue
National Insurance Contributions
There are five classes of National Insurance
contribution:
• Class 1—-paid by employees and their
employers;
• Class 1A—paid by employers on the cash
equivalent of the benefit of cars and fuel
provided to their employees for private
use;
• Class 2—paid by the self-employed;
• Class 3—paid voluntarily for pension
purposes; and
• Class 4—paid by self-employed people on
their taxable profits between £6,860 and
£23,660 a year (in addition to their Class 2
contribution).
Details of the rates of contribution are given
in Chapter 26, Social Security, on pp. 431-2.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
170
ECONOMY
central government; council tax; non-domestic
rates; and sales, fees and charges. About 80 per
cent of expenditure (excluding sales, fees and
charges) is financed by government grants and
redistributed business rates.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years; the most recent revaluation in Great
Britain took place in April 1995. As this
resulted in some very large local and sectoral
changes in rateable values, a transitional
scheme was introduced to phase in increases
and reductions in rates bills. The non¬
domestic rate is set nationally by central
government and collected by local authorities.
It is paid into a national pool and redistributed
to local authorities in proportion to their
population. In Northern Ireland, rates are not
payable on industrial premises or on
commercial premises in enterprise zones.
Certain other properties in Northern Ireland,
such as freight transport and recreational
premises, are partially derated.
Domestic property in Great Britain is
generally subject to the council tax, which
replaced the community charge in 1993. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
hands, based on its capital value in April 1991.
Capital values are based on the amount each
dwelling might have sold for on the open
market, subject to certain assumptions, if it
had been sold on 1 April 1991. Discounts are
available for dwellings with fewer than two
resident adults. A council tax payer on a low
income may receive council tax benefit of up to
100 per cent of the tax bill (see p. 439).
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes based on the value of the
property—are collected by local authorities.
PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCIAL
OPERATIONS
Debt Management
The Government funds its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private
sector. Public sector borrowing, or debt
repayment, each year represents an addition to,
or subtraction from, the net debt of the public
sector. This debt is the consolidated debt of
the public sector less its holdings of financial
assets. Net public sector debt held outside the
public sector amounted to £323,000 million at
the end of March 1996, representing 44.5 per
cent of GDP in 1995—96. This is expected to
rise to 46.5 per cent of GDP by the end of
March 1998, but thereafter to fall steadily as
the PSBR is brought towards balance.
The funding requirement for 1996-97 is
forecast to be about £42,700 million, of which
National Savings products (see p. 227) are
assumed to contribute about £3,000 million,
with gilt-edged stock contributing the balance.
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument is known as
gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’) as there is no risk of
default. Gilts are marketable and widely
traded. Pension funds and life insurance
companies have the largest holdings. The
Government publishes an annual debt
management report which sets out the
framework for issuing gilts in the coming year.
Gilts are sold by the Bank of England on the
Government’s behalf. Issues are primarily by
auction (broadly monthly), supplemented by
ad hoc ‘tap’ sales. Gilts include ‘conventional’,
which pay fixed rates of interest and
redemption sums; index-linked stocks, on
which principal and interest are linked to
inflation through the movement in the Retail
Prices Index; and floating-rate gilts, with
payments linked to short-term interest rates.
A series of changes has been implemented
to increase the efficiency and liquidity of the
gilts market, so enhancing the overall
efficiency of Britain’s financial system. Among
these was a new open sale and repurchase
(‘repo’) market in gilts, launched in January
1996.
Bills
Sterling Treasury bills are sold at a weekly
tender; the majority have a maturity of three
months. These are currently used to manage
the money markets and meet the weekly cash
needs of the Government, rather than to meet
the Government’s annual borrowing needs.
171
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government also issues bills denominated
and payable in European Currency Units
(ECUs). The proceeds are added to the official
foreign exchange reserves rather than being
used to finance public expenditure.
Other Public Sector Borrowing
The bulk of public corporations’ borrowing is
funded by central government, although their
temporary borrowing needs are met largely
from the market, usually under Treasury
guarantee. That part of local authority
borrowing met by central government is
supplied by authorisation of Parliament
through the Public Works Loan Board from
the National Loans Fund. The Board remains
an independent body even though it is merged
for administrative purposes with the former
National Debt Office, forming the National
Investment and Loans Office. Local
authorities may also borrow directly from the
market, both short-term and long-term,
through a range of instruments.

Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for
hundreds of years. With only about 1 per cent of the world’s population, Britain
is the fifth largest trading nation, accounting for around 5 per cent of world
trade. Some 100,000 companies based in Britain currently sell their products
overseas. As a member of the European Union (EU), it is part of the world’s
largest established trading group, responsible for 40 per cent of world exports.
Having a far higher degree of inward and outward investment than any other
leading economy, relative to gross domestic product (GDP), Britain is taking
advantage of increasing global free trade.
Britain exports more per head than the
United States and Japan. Its overseas sales of
goods and services are equivalent to about a
quarter of GDP. Receipts from trade in
services and investment income make up about
one-half of Britain’s total overseas earnings,
and Britain consistently runs large surpluses
on these accounts. Britain is the world’s second
biggest overseas investor and the leading
destination for inward direct investment into
the EU. British investors have more overseas
direct investments than foreign firms have in
Britain.
The British Government is a strong
supporter of an open multilateral trading
system and advocates further trade
liberalisation. World trade is set to grow by 5
to 10 per cent a year in the next ten years, due
in part to the successful conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in 1993. This led to the creation in
1995 of the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), of which Britain is a founder member.
TRADE IN GOODS
In 1995 Britain’s exports of goods were valued
at about £152,300 million and imports at
£164,000 million on a balance-of-payments
basis (see Table 12.1). Between 1994 and 1995
the volume of exports of goods rose by 7 per
cent and their value by 13 per cent. Over the
same period, imports grew by 4 per cent by
volume and 13 per cent in terms of value.
Re-exporting plays a prominent role in trade: a
recent survey found that nearly half of British
importers export products.
Commodity Composition
Britain has traditionally been an exporter of
manufactured goods and an importer of food
and basic materials. In 1970 manufactures

import substitution. In 1995 exports of fuels in
volume terms were over six times their 1975
level, while imports were around three-fifths of
the 1975 figure. The share of fuels in exports
rose from 4 to 22 per cent by the mid-1980s,
when the value of North Sea oil and gas
production was at its peak, falling back to 6 per
cent in 1995. The import share decreased from
19 per cent in 1975 to 13 per cent in the
mid-1980s and to 3.5 per cent by 1995. In 1995
the surplus on trade in oil amounted to over
£4,000 million.
Imported manufactures have taken a greater
share of the domestic market in recent decades.
The share of finished manufactures in total

imports rose from 25 per cent in 1970 to 55 per
cent in 1995, while the share of basic materials
fell from 15 to 4 per cent between 1970 and
1995. The percentage of food, beverages and
tobacco in total imports has been dropping
since the 1950s, down to 9 per cent in 1995, as
a result both of the extent to which food
demand has been met from domestic
agriculture and of the decline in the proportion
of total expenditure on food.
Geographical Distribution
Britain’s overseas trade is mainly with other
developed countries. In 1970 these accounted
for 70 per cent of exports and imports; by 1995
the shares were 80 and 83 per cent
respectively. The proportion of Britain’s trade
with non-oil developing nations declined from
about 24 per cent in 1970 to 13 per cent in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, but has risen since
1992 to 16 per cent of trade in 1995.
In 1972, the year before Britain joined the
European Community, 40 per cent of its trade
in goods was with the other 14 countries which
presently make up the European Union. The
proportion rose to 57 per cent in 1995.
Western Europe as a whole took 62 per cent of
British exports in 1995.
In 1995 EU countries accounted for eight of
Britain’s top ten export markets and seven of
the ten leading suppliers of goods to Britain
(see Table 12.4). In 1990 Germany overtook
the United States to become Britain’s biggest
overseas market for goods; Germany is also
Britain’s largest single supplier. In 1995 it took
13 per cent of Britain’s exports and supplied
nearly 16 per cent of its imports.
There have been a number of other changes
in the pattern of Britain’s overseas trade in
recent years. Exports to Japan, which is
presently Britain’s tenth largest export market,
rose by 26 per cent in 1995. Japan has steadily
increased its share of Britain’s imports and

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
now accounts for 6 per cent. In 1995 there was
a significant increase in Britain’s exports to
most of the expanding markets in newly
industrialising Asia, of around 12 per cent,
including Hong Kong, Singapore, South
Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, while exports to
India grew by 28 per cent. Exports to South
Africa also rose substantially in 1995, by 30 per
cent.
OTHER TRANSACTIONS
Other transactions fall into three main
groups:
• internationally tradeable services;
• investment income on external assets; and
• non-commercial transfers (chiefly between
governments, between the British
Government and EU organisations, and
between private individuals).
Services range from banking, insurance and
stockbroking, tourism, and shipping and
aviation to specialist services such as
engineering consultancy, computer
programming and training. Financial services
make a major contribution to overseas
earnings: net overseas receipts from services
rendered and investment income were £20,400
million in 1995, up from £18,800 million in
1994.
Earnings from trade in services as a whole
rose by 9 per cent in 1995 to over £45,000
million (see Table 12.5). There was an overall
surplus on services of £6,100 million,
compared with £4,700 million in 1994.
Earnings on investment income rose by
nearly 20 per cent to £93,100 million in 1995,
while debits rose by a similar proportion to
almost £83,600 million (see Table 12.6). The
surplus on investment income was a record
level of nearly £9,600 million. Within this
there were surpluses on earnings from direct
investment of £12,900 million and from
portfolio investment of over £3,000 million,
although these were partly offset by a deficit on
bank borrowing and lending.
Transfers have almost always been in
deficit, amounting to nearly £7,000 million in
1995—with a deficit on government transfers
of £7,200 million and a surplus on private
sector transfers of £200 million.
COMMERCIAL POLICY
Britain remains committed to the open '
multilateral trading system and to the further
liberalisation of world trade. To this end it has
taken a leading part in the activities of such
organisations as the WTO, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
GATT/World Trade Organisation
The eighth and final GATT round—the
Uruguay Round—was launched in 1986 and
successfully concluded in 1993. It was the
largest-ever international trade negotiation and is
leading to a reduction in tariffs on goods and a
liberalising of trade in services and agriculture.

Creation of the WTO—which now has over 120
member states—has put the new arrangements
on a permanent institutional footing. A GATT
report has estimated that annual world income
will be boosted by at least £330,000 million by
2005, as a result of the Uruguay agreement. The
Government estimates that it will lead to a rise in
Britain’s GDP of 2 per cent after ten years.
The main features of the new agreement,
which is gradually being brought into force,
are as follows:
• There will be overall tariff reductions
across all countries of about 40 per cent
(tariff reductions by the EU will average
over 33 per cent) and member states have
undertaken not to raise tariffs again on 95
per cent of world trade.
• With the formation of the General
Agreement on Trade in Services, services
are being brought within the framework of
GATT multilateral trade rules. Any
remaining restrictions on trade in services
are being made transparent and
non-discriminatory.
• Agriculture is coming fully under the rules
of multilateral trade for the first time; there
will be a 36 per cent reduction in tariffs as
well as substantial cuts in subsidies.
• Agreed multilateral rules govern
trade-related intellectual property rights,
providing protection for holders of
trademarks, patents, copyrights and
design rights.
• Trade in textiles, where restrictions on
imports have been allowed under the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA—see
p. 180) to balance the interests of
exporters and importers, is being
reintegrated into the rules of the WTO
over ten years.
Britain is now focusing on ensuring that
unfinished Uruguay Round business is brought
to a successful conclusion and that the
multilateral trading system of the WTO works
properly in practice. It is also seeking to make
further progress, through the WTO, in reducing
external barriers to trade. Increasingly, the focus
for trade negotiations has shifted from the
elimination of border barriers to examining the
impact of domestic policies on trade. Policies on
competition, investment, procurement,
subsidies, standards, intellectual property rights,
rules of origin, regulation and financial services
are all being discussed. The first WTO
ministerial conference will be held in Singapore
in December 1996.
European Union
Austria, Finland and Sweden are the latest
members of the European Union, joining in
1995. The single European market ‘opened for
business’ in 1993, with the essential legislation
in place for the free movement of goods,
services, people and capital within the EU.
The main changes were:
• the ending of routine customs clearance of
commercial goods at national frontiers
within the EU;
• the introduction of the right to trade
179
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
financial services throughout the EU on
the basis of a single home authorisation
‘passport’ (see p. 222); and
• deregulation of airlines, with national flag
carriers losing preferential treatment.
Member states are now concentrating on
ensuring that the market operates efficiently
and completing work in energy and
telecommunications liberalisation. The DTFs
Single Market Compliance Unit helps
companies that encounter prohibited barriers
to trade to overcome them.
Special Trading Arrangements
The EU has association and co-operation
agreements with virtually all non-member
countries with a Mediterranean coastline,
plus Jordan; these give preferential access to
EU markets. Non-preferential co-operation
agreements have also been made with
countries in South Asia and Latin America,
as well as with the People’s Republic of
China, the Association of South East Asian
Nations, the Andean Pact and the Central
American states. Trade relations with the
developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean
and the Pacific are governed by the Lome
Convention, which gives these countries
tariff-free access, subject to certain
safeguards, to the EU for industrial and
agricultural products.
Tariff preference is also given to developing
countries under the Generalised System of
Preferences. This applies to industrial
products, including textiles and certain
(mainly processed) agricultural products. The
scheme focuses benefits on poorer producers
and countries.
Europe (Association) Agreements are in place
between the EU and Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania,
Slovenia and the Baltic states. They are designed
to facilitate closer political and economic ties and
the eventual creation of a free trade area with a
view to those countries becoming full members
of the EU. A trade and economic co-operation
agreement has also been made with Albania.
Partnership and co-operation agreements have
been concluded with ten states of the former
USSR (seep. 131).
CONTROLS ON TRADE
With the completion of the single European
market, all routine internal border controls and
requirements were removed for trade in EU
goods between the members of the EU. This
has substantially cut travel times and costs; for
example, freight journey times by road from
Britain to Italy have been reduced by up to 24
hours.
Import Controls
Following the completion of the single
European market, all national quantitative
restrictions have been abolished. However,
some EU-wide quotas have been imposed on a
small range of non-textile and clothing
products from the People’s Republic of China,
while EU imports of some steel products from
Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan are also
restricted. Quantitative restrictions on textiles
and clothing stem from the MFA, under
which there is a series of bilateral agreements.
Some quotas are also maintained against
non-WTO countries. The MFA restrictions
will be eliminated by 2005 as part of the WTO
agreement.
Imports from certain countries remain
subject to sanctions controls or embargo
agreed by, for example, the United Nations.
Imports of certain other goods from all
countries are prohibited or restricted in order
to protect human, animal or plant life and
health. These include firearms and
ammunition; nuclear materials; certain drugs;
explosives; endangered wildlife and derived
products; and certain agricultural,
horticultural and food products.
Export Controls
The great majority of British exports are not
subject to any government control. Controls
on certain strategic goods are imposed for a
variety of reasons, including foreign policy and
non-proliferation concerns, the need to comply
with international treaty commitments, the
operation of sanctions and national security.
The scope of export controls is limited to what
is necessary to meet these concerns. Most
controls apply on a worldwide basis, although
180
OVERSEAS TRADE
certain sanctions and embargoes are applied
against specific countries as a result of
agreement by members of bodies such as the
United Nations.
There are controls relating to the export of
conventional military equipment and firearms
as well as dual-use industrial goods that can be
used for civil and military purposes. Most
dual-use industrial goods are allowed to move
within the EU without an export licence.
Controls on conventional weapons and
equipment for their manufacture date back to
an agreement by members of the
Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls (COCOM). Although this
body has been disbanded, ex-members are
maintaining the controls in their present form.
A new forum, the Wassenaar Arrangement, is
expected to agree new lists shortly. Lists of
controls on certain dual-use related goods are
agreed by members of the Australia Group, the
Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile
Technology Control Regime; Britain is a
member of all three. The aim of these groups
is to help prevent the spread of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and missile
systems for their delivery.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government assists exporters by creating
economic conditions favourable to the export
trade and by providing practical help, advice
and financial support. This includes a wide
range of services and assistance to meet the
requirements of exporters, especially small and
medium-sized enterprises.
Export Promotion Services
Overseas Trade Services (OTS) comprises the
leading government departments engaged in
export promotion, including the Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (ECO), the Industry
Department of the Welsh Office, Scottish
Trade International and the Industrial
Development Board of Northern Ireland.
There are over 2,000 staff worldwide, based at
the DTI in London, in regional offices and
Business Links (see p. 212) around Britain,
and at 218 diplomatic posts overseas.
OTS gathers and disseminates export
intelligence, helps in researching potential
markets, and supports firms participating in
trade fairs and missions. In 1995-96 around
£225 million was spent on support for
exporters.
In England the development of local
Business Links is making OTS more accessible
to potential users. The DTI is financing 70
‘export development counsellors’ in Business
Links to give advice to exporters and outward
investors at local business level.
OTS works closely with over 100 ‘export
promoters’ seconded from private industry, as
well as with the British Overseas Trade Board
(BOTB), the BOTB’s Area Advisory Groups
and with FCO posts abroad. The BOTB’s
aims are to:
• help guide the Government’s export
promotion efforts, including the provision
of export services; and
• provide advice on policy issues affecting
international trade and exports.
The BOTB’s Area Advisory Groups, which
are made up of business people with expert
knowledge of trade with particular world
markets, provide advice on the world’s main
trading areas. The Overseas Projects Board
advises on major project business overseas, and
the Small Firms Committee gives guidance on
matters relating to small businesses. Some 200
businessmen and women are involved in the
Board’s work.
OTS pays special attention to the
promotion of exports to its top priority areas in
Western Europe, North America, and Japan
and the fast-growing countries of the
Asia-Pacific Rim. These three areas contain
the world’s largest and richest markets, and
account for around four-fifths of Britain’s
exports. Emerging markets in other areas, such
as Latin America, where some countries have
been achieving rapid growth rates, are also
being targeted.
The Government has set a target of
introducing 30,000 firms to new export
markets by the year 2000. It has also
announced:
• an improved programme of trade fair and
mission support;
181
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• a programme of ‘British Excellence’ fairs
in key markets;
• additional commercial staff abroad and 14
new overseas posts;
• ‘export vouchers’ for small and
medium-sized enterprises to help them
buy assistance at Business Links; and
• an ‘Export Challenge’ for trade
associations, to encourage them to
improve the international competitiveness
of the sectors they represent.
British Invisibles
British Invisibles is an organisation which
promotes the international activities of
financial institutions and business services. Its
role is to suggest and, where possible,
implement measures for boosting such
earnings in Britain and abroad. It also seeks to
increase awareness of London as an
international financial centre and of the role of
the service sector in the British economy.
Export Insurance
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) is a government department
responsible to the President of the Board of
Trade. It helps British firms overcome many of
the risks of selling and investing overseas.
ECGD supports British exporters of capital
goods and services sold on medium- and
long-term credit by:
• guaranteeing exporters and financing
banks against the risk of non-payment by
overseas buyers/borrowers;
• giving interest rate support to British
banks, allowing overseas borrowers access
to funds at fixed, often favourable, rates of
interest; and
• providing reinsurance to British
private-sector insurance companies
covering exports sold on short-term
credit.
In order to encourage investment in less
developed countries, ECGD also insures
investment earnings against the main political
risks, such as war, expropriation and
restrictions on repatriation of profits.
Particular attention is paid to ensuring that
sufficient cover capacity is available for exports
to ECGD’s main markets, such as China,
Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. The Asia-Pacific
region is currently ECGD’s largest source of
new business.
ECGD’s premium rates have been reduced
by 25 per cent overall since 1992 and cover has
been resumed for almost 30 markets
worldwide.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

transactions in Britain’s external assets and
liabilities, sometimes known as the capital
account. The current account records trade in
goods and services, including finance, tourism
and transport; transactions in investment
income; and transfers. Capital transactions
include inward and outward investment,
overseas transactions by banks in Britain,
external borrowing and lending by residents in
Britain and drawings on and accruals to the
official reserves.
Britain has no exchange controls; residents
are free to acquire foreign currency for any
purpose, including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. There are also no
controls on the lending of sterling abroad and
non-residents may acquire sterling for any
purpose. Gold may be freely bought and sold.
Exchange controls were abolished in 1979, and
Britain meets in full its obligations on capital
movements under an OECD code and under
EC directives.
Britain’s balance of payments current
account deficit remains modest, at less than
1 per cent of GDP. It has been in deficit since
1986, although the deficits recorded in 1994
and 1995 were the lowest since 1986, at £2,400
million and £2,900 million respectively (see
Table 12.7). Since 1983 Britain has had a
deficit on trade in goods, and this amounted to
£11,600 million in 1995. However, it has
usually run large surpluses on trade in services
and investment income. In 1995 the surplus on
services rose by £1,400 million and that on
investment income by £900 million, but the
deficit on transfers grew by nearly £2,000
million.
Inward and Outward Investment
The Government welcomes both outward and
inward investment.1 Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports
while providing earnings in the form of
investment income. Inward investment is
promoted by DTFs Invest in Britain Bureau
(IBB—see p. 218) as a means of introducing
new technology, products, management styles
and attitudes; creating or safeguarding
employment; and increasing exports or
substituting imports. In recent years Japanese
investment has helped transform the
automotive industries in Britain.
The IBB was notified of 477 new inward
investment projects from 29 countries in
1995-96. The projects are expected to create
’A distinction needs to be made between capital flows and
capital holdings. Flows comprise transactions resulting in
a change of ownership of financial assets and liabilities
between British residents and non-residents, while
holdings are measured by the total values of British
external assets and liabilities at the end of the year. Income
earned on external assets is dealt with in the section on
other transactions.

nearly 48,300 jobs. Inward investment is
playing an increasingly important role in
Britain’s economy, with overseas firms
providing 18 per cent of all manufacturing
jobs, 24 per cent of net output, 32 per cent of
manufacturing investment and about 40 per
cent of manufacturing exports. At present
Britain has over 40 per cent of US and
Japanese investment in the EU. Inward
investment has benefited a range of
industries, including communications and
the information sector, electronics, medical
equipment, pharmaceuticals, financial
services, food and drink, and the automotive
industry.
At the end of 1995 the stock of inward
direct investment (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies which
gives the investor an effective role in their
management) was £150,400 million. The stock
of direct investment overseas by British
residents was £213,800 million at the end of
1995. The stock of overseas portfolio
investment in Britain amounted to £309,000
million at the end of 1995, while the stock of
British portfolio investment overseas was
£482,000 million. An analysis of transactions
in Britain’s external assets and liabilities for
1993—95 is given in Table 12.8. Britain’s
identified external assets at the end of 1995
exceeded liabilities by nearly £50,000
million.
At the end of 1994, 81 per cent of outward
direct investment was in developed
countries, with 35 per cent in the EU and 32
per cent in the United States. Investment
from developed countries accounted for 97
per cent of overseas direct investment in
Britain: 41 per cent originated in the United
States and 33 per cent in the EU.

Britain has a higher proportion of the adult population in work—70 per
cent—and a lower level of unemployment than any other major European
Union (EU) country. Features of the changing labour market include the
growing proportion of women in the workforce and increases in part-time
employment, among both women and men, and in temporary employment.
About three-quarters of employees now work in the service sector, compared
with less than one-fifth in manufacturing. Industrial relations have been
transformed, and the number of working days lost in 1994 and 1995 were the
lowest annual totals recorded. Health and safety at work has improved, with
fatalities from accidents at work at a record low level.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
The total workforce in 1996 was almost 28
million. The workforce in employment in June
1996 totalled 25.8 million (see Table 13.1), of
whom 22.1 million (nearly 11.2 million men and
almost 11 million women) were classed as
employees in employment. Employment is
recovering from the fall during the recession of
the early 1990s. Since December 1992 (the most
recent employment trough) the workforce in
employment has grown by over 480,000.
The long-term trend has been for a move
away from full-time employment towards
part-time employment (see graphs on p. 186),
while the number of women in employment
has grown considerably; women now make up
46 per cent of all in employment. Since 1986
part-time employment in Great Britain has
risen by 26 per cent to 6.4 million in spring
1996: 5.2 million women and 1.2 million men.
About 45 per cent of women in employment
were working part-time, compared with 8 per
cent of men. Around 1.3 million people had
two or more jobs. Nearly 1.6 million people
were engaged in temporary jobs, of whom 51
per cent were on fixed-period contracts.
Contracting out by firms of specialist and
non-core functions has increased.
‘Teleworking’—people working from home
using information technology—is also
becoming more widespread, for example, in
journalism, consultancy and computer
programming.
About 3.3 million people are self-employed
in Britain, 19 per cent more than in 1986. The
sectors with the highest concentrations of
self-employed people are agriculture and
construction. Around 18 per cent of men and 7
per cent of women in employment are
self-employed.

Government Policy
Britain now has one of the least regulated
labour markets among the major industrialised
nations. This has arisen following action taken
by the Government, with the aim of creating
an economic climate in which business can
flourish and create more jobs. These include:
• increasing the flexibility of the labour
market, for example, by promoting
decentralised and flexible pay arrangements;
• removing regulations which have
restricted job creation; and
• encouraging better training, especially
through employer-led Training and

EMPLOYMENT
Enterprise Councils and, in Scotland,
Local Enterprise Companies (see p. 188).
In the EU the Government emphasises the
importance of improving competitiveness,
creating jobs and tackling unemployment. In
European Councils and other fora it consistently
argues for attention to be paid to tackling
unemployment rather than to the creation of
legislation which it considers to be unnecessary
and damaging, and which adds to the burdens of
business and makes it more difficult to retain or
create jobs. Britain has welcomed the conclusions
of successive European Councils in recent years
which have put the need to tackle unemployment
at the top of the EU’s employment agenda, and it
has been active in sharing information about its
policies, programmes and experiences with other
member states.
Occupational Changes
There has been a gradual move away from
manual occupations towards non-manual
occupations, which are now held by nearly
three-fifths of people in employment in Great
Britain. Self-employment is highest in craft and
related occupations (29 per cent of those in this
sector in Great Britain in spring 1996), followed
by managers and administrators (18 per cent).
Employment by Sector
As in other industrialised countries, there has
been a marked shift in jobs from
manufacturing to service industries (see Table
13.2). In the last 40 years the proportion of
employees in employment engaged in service
industries has more than doubled, to nearly 76
per cent. In June 1996 there were 16.4 million
employees in the service sector in Great
Britain, about 2.1 million more than in 1986
(see Table 13.3). Business activities,
distribution, hotels and restaurants, education,
medical services and social work experienced
significant increases. Employment in the sector
of public administration, defence and
compulsory social security, however, has
fallen.
Most other sectors—manufacturing,
construction, agriculture, and mining, energy
and water supply—have experienced lower
levels of employment. By 1996 manufacturing
accounted for 18 per cent of employees in
employment, compared with 42 per cent in
1955. Traditional manufacturing industries,
such as steel and shipbuilding, have recorded
particularly large falls in employment. In August
1996 employment in the main manufacturing
sectors in Great Britain included:
• 700,000 employees in non-metallic
mineral products, metal and metal
products;
• 491,000 in electrical and optical
equipment;
• 436,000 in paper, pulp, printing,
publishing and recording media;
• 422,000 in food products, beverages and
tobacco; and

Unemployment
Unemployment in Britain—as measured by
the number of people claiming
unemployment-related benefits and adjusted
for seasonal variation-—has fallen by over
870,000 since the end of 1992. This decline has
occurred in all regions, and the number of
long-term unemployed (who have been out of
work for a year or more) has fallen by about 20
per cent. The level of unemployment is below
the EU average and the rates of youth and
female unemployment are below those in most
other EU countries. In August 1996 claimant
unemployment totalled 2.1 million, 7.5 per
cent of the workforce. It ranged from 5.8 per
cent in East Anglia to 11.3 per cent in
Northern Ireland.
The Government has introduced a wide
range of measures to help combat
unemployment. In 1996—97 about 1.5 million
places on employment and training schemes
are being offered to help unemployed people.
TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
ENTERPRISE
The Government’s aim is to support economic
growth and improve Britain’s competitiveness
by raising standards of educational
achievement and skill. It encourages employers
to invest in training through Investors in
People (see p. 190) and the development of
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs—
see pp. 458—9). In addition, individuals are
encouraged to take responsibility for their own
training and development. Key initiatives are
Career Development Loans and tax relief.
Britain is acknowledged as an innovative world
leader in open and flexible learning, for
example, through the Open University.
Training and Enterprise Councils
There are 81 Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales. They
are independent companies with employer-led
boards. Seven TECs have merged with local
chambers of commerce to form Chambers of
Commerce, Training and Enterprise, while a
188
EMPLOYMENT
number of other TECs are considering
possible mergers.
The objective of TECs is to foster local
economic development and stimulate employer
investment in skills—in particular through the
Investors in People standard—within their area.
Their special focus is to strengthen the skills
base and assist local enterprise programmes
which are funded by the Government.
TECs manage the provision of training and
enterprise programmes which are funded by
the Government. For 1996-97, £1,200 million
is being provided by the Department for
Education and Employment to TECs in
England to deliver its programmes. TECs also
have access to funding from other government
departments. For example, the Department of
Trade and Industry funds TECs to deliver
enterprise programmes (see Chapter 14) and
TECs are lead partners in many of the projects
funded through the Single Regeneration
Budget (see p. 375).
In 1996—97 the Government set aside £55
million over a three-year period for a
discretionary fund for TECs to use on local
projects on training and enterprise. The fund
operates under ‘challenge’ principles, and the
prime basis for funding is the extent to which
projects attract private finance.
TECs are accountable to the Government
through their contracts. The Government
Offices for the Regions are responsible for
managing and overseeing the overall
government contract with TECs.
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering economic development and
environmental improvement. LECs operate
training programmes but, unlike TECs, have no
responsibility for work-related further education.
They run under the supervision of the two
enterprise bodies: Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see p. 216).
Industry Training Organisations
Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) act as
the focal point for training matters in their
particular sector of industry, commerce or
public service. Their role is to ensure that the
skills needs of their sectors are being met and
that occupational standards are being
established and maintained for key
occupations. There are over 120 independent
ITOs, covering sectors employing about 85 per
cent of the civilian workforce. The National
Council of Industry Training Organisations, a
voluntary body set up to represent the interests
of ITOs, aims to improve their effectiveness,
for example, by encouraging good practice.
By September 1997 a new network of
National Training Organisations will replace
ITOs, ‘lead bodies’ and occupational standards
councils (OSCs). Lead bodies and OSCs have
the prime function of representing
occupational groups (a function also carried
out by many ITOs) in developing occupational
standards and NVQs and their Scottish
equivalent.
National Targets for Education and
Training
The National Targets for Education and
Training were launched by the Confederation
of British Industry in 1991 and are supported
by the Government and many national and
local organisations, including all TECs, LECs
and ITOs, and other major education, training
and employer bodies. The principal aim of the
Targets is to improve Britain’s international
competitiveness by raising standards and
attainment levels in education and training
through ensuring that:
• all employers invest in employee
development to achieve business success;
• everyone has access to education and
training opportunities, leading to
recognised qualifications which meet their
needs and aspirations; and
• all education and training develops
self-reliance, flexibility and breadth,
through fostering competence in core
skills.
The independent National Advisory
Council for Education and Training Targets
(NACETT) and the Advisory Scottish
Council for Education and Training Targets
monitor progress towards the Targets.
189
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Targets cover both young people and
the workforce as a whole. Following a review
by NACETT, new, more challenging Targets
were set in 1995, relating to the year 2000. The
‘Foundation Learning’ Targets are that:
• by the age of 19, 85 per cent of young
people should achieve five GCSEs at
grade C or above, an intermediate GNVQ^
or NVQJevel 2;1
• 75 per cent of young people should
achieve level 2 competence in
communication, numeracy and
information technology by the age of 19,
with 35 per cent reaching level 3 by the
age of 21; and
• by 21, 60 per cent of young people should
achieve two GCE A levels, an Advanced
GNVQ_or NVQJevel 3.
The ‘Lifetime Learning’ Targets are that:
• 60 per cent of the workforce should be
qualified to the standard of NVQJevel 3,
an Advanced GNVQ^or two GCE A
levels;
• 30 per cent of the workforce should have a
vocational, professional, management or
academic qualification at NVQJevel 4 or
above; and
• 70 per cent of organisations employing
200 or more people and 35 per cent of
those employing 50 or more should be
recognised as Investors in People.
Separate targets, set within the framework
of the national targets, are in force in Scotland.
Training for Work
The Government’s Training for Work
programme is designed to help unemployed
and disadvantaged adults to find jobs through
training and work experience. The programme
is open to those aged 18 to 63 who have been
unemployed for six months or longer, although
some groups with special needs can join
earlier. Training is carried out by training
providers under contract with the local TEC
’For information on General National Vocational
Qualifications (GNVQs) and examinations, see
Chapter 27.
or LEC. Each new trainee receives an
individually adapted package of training
and/or structured work activities. Planned
expenditure in England in 1996-97 is £485
million, when about 197,000 people are
expected to join the programme.
Investors in People
Investors in People is the main initiative in
support of employers’ investment in people. It
is based on a rigorous national standard which
helps companies to improve their performance
by linking the training and development of all
employees directly to the achievement of
business objectives. TECs and LECs provide
advice and information to help organisations to
work towards the standard. Some 25,000
organisations, employing more than 5 million
people, have made a commitment to work
towards the Investors in People standard. By
mid-1996 more than 4,000 organisations had
achieved the standard. Reported benefits
include increased productivity, higher profits,
lower rates of sickness and absenteeism, and
improved morale.
National Training Awards
The National Training Awards are an annual
competition designed to promote good training
practice by example, rewarding those who have
carried out exceptionally effective training. In
1996, 93 awards (including 56 to employers
and 23 to training providers) were presented to
national winners, who were selected from
about 250 regional winners.
Career Development Loans
Career development loans are available to help
people to pay for vocational education or
training in Great Britain. Loans of between
£200 and £8,000 are provided through four
major banks, and interest payments on the loans
during training and for one month after training
are funded by the Department for Education
and Employment. The loans help to pay for
courses lasting up to two years. More than
80,000 people have borrowed over £250 million
through the programme since 1988 to pay for
training. Over two-thirds of people go directly
into employment following the training.
190
EMPLOYMENT
Small Firms Training Loans
Small Firms Training Loans were introduced
in 1994. The programme helps firms with 50
or fewer employees to meet a range of
training-related expenses, including training
consultancy. Loans of between £500 and
£125,000 are available through seven major
banks and repayments can be deferred for up
to 12 months.
Skills for Small Businesses
In 1995 Skills for Small Businesses was
introduced. It is designed to help companies
by training selected key workers—one per
company—who then pass on their knowledge
and expertise to other employees. Under the
£63 million programme run by TECs, there is
provision for training up to 24,000 key
employees.
A Skills Challenge competition was held by
the Department for Education and
Employment and the Department of Trade
and Industry in 1995-96. Groups of at least
ten small companies were invited to bid for
awards to develop innovative solutions to
shared training needs. A total of 74 awards
were made under the scheme, worth about
£3.5 million.
Improving the Training Market
The Improving the Training Market
programme covers a range of activities funded
by the Department for Education and
Employment aimed at improving the quality,
impact and cost-effectiveness of vocational
education and training. Priority is being given
to encouraging investment by individuals in
learning, supporting the implementation of
new qualifications and developing frameworks
for the new Modern Apprenticeships (see
below).
Training for Young People
The Government is committed to ensuring that
high-quality further education or training is
available for all young people who can benefit
from it. All those aged 16 or 17—and some aged
18 or above in special circumstances—who are
not in full-time education, a job or a Modern
Apprenticeship are guaranteed the offer of a
suitable training opportunity.
The objectives of the two main youth
programmes—Modern Apprenticeships and
Youth Training—are to:
• provide participants with training leading
to vocational qualifications at NVQ/SVQ.
levels 2 and 3 or above and with
broad-based skills necessary to become
flexible and self-reliant employees; and
• to meet the skill needs of the national and
local economies.
The delivery of training is arranged
through TECs and LECs.
Following a review of the
qualifications framework for those
aged 16 to 19 (see p. 457), the
Government announced in July 1996
proposals for a major strengthening
of training for young people from
September 1997. They will include
the introduction of National
Traineeships for training to NVQ
levels 1 and 2, and these will draw on
the best features of current
arrangements, including Modern
Apprenticeships. They will offer a
broad and flexible learning
programme, including the key skills
of communication, numeracy and
information technology.
Modern Apprenticeships
‘Modern Apprenticeships’ became fully
operational in 1995 following prototype
schemes which had been run in 17 sectors.
They are designed to build on the best features
of existing apprenticeships and to increase
significantly the number of young people
trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. Over 30,000 young people
have begun Modern Apprenticeships, which
are now in operation in over 50 industry
sectors. A £3 million government advertising
campaign was launched in 1996 to encourage
more young people to take up Modern
Apprenticeships.

Youth Credits
Youth Credits are intended to offer young
people more individual choice and a greater
sense of personal responsibility when buying
training. Each credit has a financial value and
can be presented to an employer or training
provider in exchange for training. In England
16- and 17-year-old school- and college-leavers
can obtain access to Youth Training or
Modern Apprenticeships.
Skillseekers, the equivalent training credit
scheme in Scotland, has been gradually
extended following a pilot scheme in 1991, and
by 1996 all young people leaving full-time
education were eligible for the scheme.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development, has primary
responsibility for training and employment
services. Its overall aim is to assist economic
development and help people to find work
through training and employment services
delivered on the basis of equality of
opportunity. Its budget in 1996-97 is
£210 million.
The Agency has encouraged the formation
of a sector training council in each of the main
sectors to advise on employers’ training needs
and develop sectoral training strategies. In
addition, the Agency supports company
training through its Company Development
Programme and encourages management
development by providing training
programmes and seminars for existing and
future managers.
Northern Ireland has its own range of
training and employment programmes for
people seeking work. Its Jobskills programme
is designed to raise skill levels and enhance the
employment prospects of school-leavers and
unemployed adults. The programme is
incentive-based and focuses on the
achievement of NVQs. In order to combat the
high level of long-term unemployment in
Northern Ireland, the Agency operates the
Action for Community Employment Scheme
and is running a two-year pilot Community
Work Programme. The latter is being tested in
three areas of the Province with high
unemployment levels. Participants receive a
weekly allowance in addition to their benefit
and are given the opportunity to develop their
skills, undertaking work of benefit to the
community, to become better equipped to find
permanent employment.
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
There are a variety of ways in which people
find jobs. These include replying to
advertisements in the national, local or
specialist press; direct approaches to
employers; and through a Jobcentre or
employment agency.
Government Employment Services
The Government provides a range of services
to jobseekers through the Employment
Service, an executive agency within the
Department for Education and Employment.
These include:
• a network of local offices, at which people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into employment,
for example, by training; and
• a range of special programmes.
The Employment Service has about 1,100
Jobcentres and employs about 42,000 staff. In
1995-96 it placed over 1.9 million unemployed
people into jobs and conducted over 3.25
million advisory interviews to help people find
appropriate work or places on employment and
training programmes.
The Jobseeker’s Charter contains provisions
governing the standard of service to users. These
include provisions on the speed of service, and
ensuring that vacancies on display boards at
offices are both up to date and available, and that
those entitled to benefit receive the correct
payments promptly. A revised Charter will be
issued after the introduction of the Jobseeker’s
Allowance (see below).
The Employment Service is an active
participant in the European Employment
Services Network (EURES), a partnership
between the employment services in the
member states of the EU. EURES facilitates
the circulation of vacancies in member states
through a computer network.
192
THE METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE
The Meteorological Office, based in
Berkshire, provides a range of weather
forecasting services for its customers,
which include international shipping
and cargo companies.
Weatherproof instruments such as these produced by Sewills, Liverpool, are used
by the Meteorological Office because of their ability to withstand all extremes of weather.

to be available for commercial production
in the near future.

EMPLOYMENT
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
employment advice and training opportunities.
Advisers provide unemployed people with
information on employment and training
opportunities available locally.
A new Jobseeker’s Allowance replaced
unemployment benefit and income
support for unemployed people in
October 1996 (see p. 438). It is
intended to improve the operation of
the labour market by helping people
in their search for work and to secure
better value for money by targeting
resources more closely on those
needing financial support. To receive
the allowance each unemployed
person will have to complete a
Jobseeker’s Agreement, which will
include the steps that the jobseeker
has agreed to take in order to find
work.
The Employment Service is
investing ^70 million in a new
computer system to support the
operation of Jobseeker’s Agreements
and to help unemployed people to
compete effectively for jobs and find
employment as quickly as possible.
New Client Advisers interview newly
unemployed people to check their eligibility
for benefit. Together with the unemployed
person, they agree a ‘Back to Work Plan’,
which sets out specific courses of action to
improve the prospects of finding a job.
Thereafter unemployed people are required to
attend a Restart advisory interview every six
months. Restart interviews are intended to
offer help and advice to unemployed people
while they are on the unemployment register.
Following the establishment of the Jobseeker’s
Allowance, a new in-depth interview will be
introduced after 13 weeks of unemployment.
The unemployed will then be expected to
widen the range of jobs being considered if
they have been unable to find work in their
normal occupation.
The Employment Service has a wide
variety of programmes. Those designed to help
the long-term unemployed include:
• T-2-T, a programme offering 239,000
places in 1996-97, which is designed to
provide intensive help with looking for
jobs for those who have been unemployed
for over a year;
• Jobplan, which provides guidance and
other support to enable those unemployed
for a year to assess their skills, qualities
and training needs, and to act as an
introduction to future job and training
options;
• Jobclubs, where participants are given
training and advice in job-hunting skills
and have access to facilities to help an
intensive job search;
• Restart courses, designed to rebuild
self-confidence and motivation, and
including help with job-hunting skills;
• Work Trials, which encourage employers
to take on people who have been
unemployed for at least six months for a
trial period of up to three weeks, during
which they can assess their potential; and
• Project Work Pilots, a pilot scheme
running for 15 months from April 1996 in
two areas—in Hull, and Medway and
Maidstone (Kent)—in which those aged
18-50 and unemployed for two years or
more are offered an intensive period of
help with finding a job; if this proves
unsuccessful, they then have to take up a
place on a programme combining work
experience and job search.
Help for People with Disabilities
Most disabled people assisted by the
Employment Service are helped through its
mainstream services, and have priority access
to most of the main programmes for
unemployed people. Services for people
with disabilities who need more specialist help
to get or keep a job are available through
Disability Employment Advisers based in
Jobcentres. The advisers are members of local
integrated specialist teams—Placing
Assessment and Counselling Teams.
193
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
These services include:
• the Access to Work programme, which
helps people with disabilities to overcome
barriers to employment; and
• the Supported Employment Programme,
which provides job opportunities to
around 21,800 people with severe
disabilities who can work but, because of
their limited productivity, are unlikely to
obtain and keep jobs in open employment
without some support.
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with many
branches. The total value of the market has
been estimated at about £8,000 million a year.
The main trade body for the employment
agency industry is the Federation of
Recruitment and Employment Services, which
regulates the activities of its members by
means of a Code of Good Recruitment Practice
and by specialist section codes of practice.
The law governing employment agencies is
less restrictive than that of most other EU
countries. Under the Deregulation and
Contracting Out Act 1994 (see p. 208), the
licensing of employment agencies was
abolished in 1995. The Act contains powers to
prohibit people from operating agencies if it is
not appropriate that they should do
so. Agencies have to comply with statutory
standards of conduct. This includes a general
prohibition on charging fees to jobseekers,
although there are conditional exceptions for
entertainment and modelling agencies.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT
Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
main conditions, including pay, hours of work
and holidays. Many rights have long applied to
part-time workers. In 1995 the Government
introduced regulations under which part-time
employees now qualify for all statutory
employment rights on exactly the same basis as
full-time employees.
Employees with the necessary period of
continuous employment with their employer
(two years) are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist (for example, because of technological
improvements or a fall in demand) and their
employers cannot offer suitable alternative
work. Where employers are insolvent,
redundancy payments are met directly from
the National Insurance fund.
Minimum periods of notice when
employment is to be terminated are laid down
for both employers and employees. Most
employees who believe they have been unfairly
dismissed have the right to complain to an
industrial tribunal. If the complaint is upheld,
the tribunal may make an order for
re-employment or award compensation.
All pregnant employees, regardless of length
of service, have the right to 14 weeks’ statutory
maternity leave with all their non-wage
contractual benefits maintained, and protection
against dismissal because of pregnancy.
New rights for disabled people in
employment in Great Britain are
contained in the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 (see p. 424).
Virtually all the employment-related
provisions will take effect in
December 1996. Disabled people will
have the right not to be discriminated
against in the field of employment.
Employers with 20 or more employees
will have a duty not to discriminate
against disabled employees or
applicants. Among other things, this
will mean that such employers may
have to make a reasonable adjustment
where their workplace or working
arrangements put disabled people at a
substantial disadvantage compared
with non-disabled people. A Code of
Practice gives guidance to employers
on the new requirements. ,
Legislation forbids any employment of
children under 13 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of
194
EMPLOYMENT
children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age, with some
exceptions for family undertakings. The
Government has announced proposals to
update the law and to bring it into line with the
European Community (EC) Directive on the
Protection of Young People at Work. The
main changes planned would involve a
permitted list of occupations for those aged 13,
and require children to have a period free from
work during school holidays.
Equal Opportunities
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it
generally unlawful to discriminate on grounds
of colour, race, nationality (including
citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters. The
Department for Education and Employment’s
Race Relations Employment Advisory Service
promotes those government policies aimed at
combating racial discrimination in
employment and at promoting fair treatment
and equality of opportunity in employment.
Advisers provide employers with advice and
practical help in developing and implementing
effective equal opportunity strategies.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, as
amended, makes it generally unlawful in Great
Britain to discriminate on grounds of sex or
marital status when recruiting, training,
promoting, dismissing or retiring staff. The
Equal Pay Act 1970 makes it generally unlawful
to discriminate between men and women in pay
and other terms and conditions of employment.
The Act was significantly extended in 1984 to
meet EU requirements by providing for equal
pay for work of equal value.
Practical advice to employers and others on
the best arrangements for implementing equal
opportunities policies in Great Britain is given
in codes of practice from the Commission for
Racial Equality and from the Equal
Opportunities Commission (see p. 40). The
Government is encouraging voluntary action
by employers to increase the employment
opportunities for women and supports the
‘Opportunity 2000’ campaign (see p. 39). The
Government’s Campaign for Older Workers
encourages employers to recruit and retain
workers on merit, irrespective of age.
Similar legislation to that in Great Britain
on equal pay and sex discrimination applies in
Northern Ireland; legislation on race relations
is planned. Discrimination in employment on
grounds of religious belief or political opinion
is unlawful. The Fair Employment
Commission (see p. 15) has the task of
promoting equality of opportunity and
investigating employment practices, with
powers to issue legally enforceable directions.
Industrial Tribunals
Industrial tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints on a range of
employment rights, including unfair dismissal,
redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex and race
discrimination. They received 108,800
applications in 1995-96 and the number of
cases continues to grow steadily. In July 1996
the Government issued for consultation a draft
Bill designed to implement the majority of the
proposals contained in a 1994 Green Paper on
resolving disputes on employment rights. The
draft Bill includes provisions to promote the
use of voluntary alternatives to tribunal
hearings (such as independent, binding
arbitration), to streamline and improve
tribunal procedures, and to rename industrial
tribunals as ‘employment tribunals’ to reflect
their modern role.
Northern Ireland has its own separate
tribunal system, which is being reviewed in
conjunction with work by the Standing
Advisory Commission on Human Rights on
the functioning of the Province’s fair
employment legislation. Reform of tribunals in
Northern Ireland will take into account the
operation of the Fair Employment Tribunal,
which operates alongside, and as an integral
part of, the tribunals’ administration.
Earnings
According to the official New Earnings
Survey, the average weekly earnings,
unaffected by absence and including overtime
payments, in Great Britain in April 1996 of
full-time employees on adult rates were ^352.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£390) than for manual employees
(£281). Managerial and professional groups
195
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are the highest paid. The sectors with the
highest average weekly earnings were mining
and quarrying (^475) and financial services
(£453).
Overtime and other additional payments are
particularly important for manual employees,
for whom such additional payments
represented over one-fifth of earnings. About
49 per cent of manual employees and 18 per
cent of non-manual employees received
overtime payments.
In the year to July 1996 the underlying
average increase in earnings in Great Britain
was about 3.75 per cent, compared with a rise
of 2.2 per cent in the Retail Prices Index.
Fringe Benefits
A variety of fringe benefits are used by
employers to provide additional rewards to
their employees, including schemes to
encourage employee financial participation in
their companies, pension schemes, private
medical insurance, subsidised meals, company
cars and childcare schemes.
Many employees are covered by pension
schemes provided by their employers. Such
benefits are more usual among clerical and
professional employees than among manual
workers. Over 11 million people in Britain are
members of occupational schemes.
Company cars are provided for employees
in a wide variety of circumstances. It is
estimated that around 1.7 million people have
a company car and around half of these receive
fuel for private motoring in their cars.
The Government has introduced tax reliefs
to encourage employers to set up financial
participation schemes, and give employees a
direct financial stake in the business they work
for. Profit-related pay (PRP) schemes link part
of pay to changes in a business’s profits. By the
end of September 1995 over 10,500 PRP
schemes were registered with the Inland
Revenue, covering more than 2.6 million
people. Employee share schemes allow
employees to receive low-cost or free shares
from their employer without paying income
tax. Many companies have adopted such
schemes. The 1995 Budget contained a series
of measures to encourage companies to adopt
employee participation schemes and to involve
more of their workforce in them. Measures
include more flexible arrangements for
profit-sharing and savings-related schemes,
and a new company share option plan enabling
employees to exercise options over shares
worth up to a maximum of £30,000 free of
income tax.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic working
week of between 34 and 40 hours, and work a
five-day week. When overtime is taken into
account, average weekly hours worked in
Great Britain in April 1996 were 41.7 for men
and 37.6 for women. Both male and female
full-time employees tend to work more hours
than in other EU countries. Hours worked
tend to be longest in agriculture, construction
and transport and communications, and
shortest in most service industries. More men
than women work overtime, and those in
manual occupations generally work more
overtime than employees in non-manual jobs.
Flexible working hours were worked by about
15 per cent of female and 10 per cent of male
full-time employees in Britain in spring 1995.
In general, there are no limits on hours
worked by adults except in a few occupations
(such as for drivers of goods and public service
vehicles).
I
Holidays with Pay
There are no general statutory entitlements to
holidays, and holiday entitlements are
determined by negotiation. Holiday
entitlements (excluding public holidays)
generally provide for at least four weeks’ paid
holiday a year for full-time workers. According
to the Labour Force Survey in autumn 1995,
holiday entitlements in Great Britain averaged
24 days for full-time employees and 13 days
for part-time employees. Non-manual workers
tend to have longer holidays than manual
workers. Holiday entitlements may also be
dependent upon length of service.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in Britain
has been established mainly on a voluntary
196
EMPLOYMENT
basis. The system is based chiefly on the
organisation of employees and employers into
trade unions and employers’ associations, and
on freely conducted negotiations at all levels.
Trends in Bargaining and Pay
There has been a considerable reduction in the
proportion of employees and workplaces where
pay is determined by collective bargaining.
Around 48 per cent of employees in
employment in Great Britain work in firms
where trade unions negotiate on pay and
conditions of employment. Private sector
employees are much less likely to be covered
by collective bargaining than are public sector
employees.
Where agreements in the private sector are
industry-wide, they are often supplemented by
local agreements in companies or factories
(plant bargaining). Where there is no collective
bargaining, pay is usually determined by
management at local level. Most medium and
large employers make some use of
performance-related pay systems such as merit
pay, profit-related pay (see p. 196) and
individual payment by results. Private sector
organisations are more likely than public sector
bodies to use performance-related pay.
Performance-related pay has, though,
become much more widespread in the public
sector, as part of the Government’s policy of
improving the quality of public services.
Another feature is the delegation of pay
determination to a local level, such as to
self-governing National Health Service Trusts
and to grant-maintained schools. Since April
1996 all government departments and agencies
have had responsibility for negotiating pay and
conditions of staff below senior levels.
‘New-style’ agreements, often associated
with overseas-owned companies, have become
more widespread. Features normally include
flexibility in working practices, recognition of a
single union for all of a company’s employees
and ‘single status’, involving the elimination of
the traditional distinction between managers,
supervisors and other employees.
Employee Involvement
Employers use a variety of methods of
informing and consulting their employees, not
only through committees but also through
direct communication between management
and employees. These methods include
employee bulletins and reports, quality circles,
and attitude surveys.
Some of the largest British-based
multinational companies, such as ICI and
United Biscuits, have set up works councils
covering consultation arrangements, in line
with the EC’s Directive on Works Councils.
However, the Government has refused to
accept the Directive and believes that
companies should be free to develop employee
involvement arrangements which are
appropriate to their own circumstances and the
needs of their employees.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. They are widely recognised by
employers in the public sector and in large
firms and establishments. As well as
negotiating pay and other terms and conditions
of employment with employers, they provide
benefits and services such as educational
facilities, financial services, legal advice and aid
in work-related cases. In recent years many
unions have extended considerably the range
of services for members.
At the end of 1994 there were 8.3 million
trade union members in Britain, 5 per cent fewer
than a year earlier and the lowest number since
1945. The decline in membership reflects the
moves away from manufacturing and public
services, both of which have a relatively high
level of membership, and the growth in
part-time employment. About 58 per cent of
union members were male and 42 per cent
female. While male membership of trade unions
fell by nearly 9 per cent in 1994, there was a
slight increase in the number of female union
members.
Unison, with about 1.4 million members, is
the biggest union in Britain, accounting for 17
per cent of all union members. It was formed
in 1993 from a merger of three unions: the
Confederation of Health Service Employees,
the National Union of Public Employees and
the National and Local Government Officers’
Association. Three other unions have over
500,000 members:
197
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the Transport and General Workers
Union (with 897,000 members);
• GMB (740,000)—a general union with
members in a range of public and private
sector industries; and
• the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (726,000).
The number of unions has declined by
around a third in the last 20 years, mainly as a
result of mergers. At the end of 1995 there
were 256 trade unions on the list maintained
by the Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations. A further 25 unions were known
to the Certification Officer.
Trade union organisation varies widely, but
there is usually a national executive council or
committee. Many unions also have regional
and district organisations, while local branches
cover one or more workplaces. Elected
workplace representatives are often called
‘shop stewards’. Where two or more unions
have members in the same workplace, shop
stewards’ committees may be formed to
discuss matters of common concern.
Trades Union Congress
In Britain the national body of the trade union
movement is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. Its affiliated
membership comprises 71 trade unions, which
together represent some 6.75 million people, or
about 80 per cent of all trade unionists in
Britain.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions of
working people. It deals with all general
questions which concern trade unions, both
nationally and internationally, and provides a
forum in which affiliated unions can
collectively determine policy. There are six
TUC regional councils for England and a
Wales Trades Union Council. The annual
Congress meets in September to discuss
matters of concern to trade unionists. A
General Council represents the TUC between
annual meetings.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions and the European Trade
Union Confederation. It also nominates the
British workers’ delegation to the annual
International Labour Conference.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
Trade unions in Scotland also have their
own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress, which in many
respects is similar in constitution and
function to the TUC. Nearly all trade unions
in Northern Ireland are represented by the
Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Most
trade unionists in Northern Ireland are
members of unions affiliated to the ICTU,
while the majority also belong to unions
based in Great Britain which are affiliated to
the TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee
of the ICTU enjoys a high degree of
autonomy.
Legal Framework
The Government’s reforms of industrial
relations and trade union law have changed the
balance of power between trade unions and
employers, and between trade unions and their
own members. For example, since 1980
employers have been able to decide whether or
not to bargain with a trade union or continue
to do so. Legislation for Great Britain is
consolidated in the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, as
amended by the Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Act 1993. There is broad
parity of provision in respect of industrial
relations and trade union law in Northern
Ireland.
There were 415,000 working days lost in
235 stoppages of work as a result of industrial
action in 1995 (see Table 13.4). The number of
days lost in 1994 and 1995 were the lowest
annual figures since records began in 1891.
198
EMPLOYMENT
Union Membership and Non-membership Rights
All individuals have the right under the law
not to be dismissed or refused employment (or
the services of an employment agency) because
of membership or non-membership of a trade
union. Individuals who believe that they have
been dismissed or refused employment on
such grounds may complain to an industrial
tribunal. All employees who are union
members also have the right not to have union
membership subscriptions deducted from their
pay unless they have authorised this, and
authorisation has to be renewed every three
years.
The Conduct of Union Affairs
The law requires a trade union to elect every
member of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections must be
held at least every five years and be carried out
by a secret postal ballot under independent
scrutiny. Any union member who believes that
the union has not complied with the statutory
requirements may complain to the courts or to
the Certification Officer. .
A trade union may establish a political fund
if it wishes to use its money for what the law
defines as ‘political objects’. If a union wishes
to set up a political fund, its members must
first agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an aim of
the union. The union must also ballot its
members every ten years to maintain the fund.
Union members have a statutory right to opt
out of contributing to a political fund.
The law also gives all union members a
statutory means of redress if unjustifiably
disciplined by their union, for example, for
refusing to take part in industrial action or for
crossing a picket line. Members also have the
right to inspect their union’s accounting
records and obtain an annual statement from
the union about its financial affairs.
Industrial Action
For most of the 20th century trade unions
enjoyed wide immunity protecting them from
legal proceedings for organising industrial
action, so that the organisation of almost any
industrial action was protected. Legislative
reforms have restricted the scope of these
immunities. To have the benefit of statutory
immunity (that is, to be ‘lawful’), the
organisation of industrial action must now be
wholly or mainly in contemplation or
furtherance of a trade dispute between workers
and their own employer, and must not:
• involve workers who have no dispute with
their own employer (so-called ‘secondary’
action);

• involve unlawful forms of picketing;
• be to establish or maintain a union-only
labour agreement (the ‘closed shop’); or
• be in support of any employee dismissed
while taking unofficial industrial action.
Before calling for industrial action, a trade
union must first obtain the support of its
members in a secret postal ballot and must
notify employers of its intention to conduct
such a ballot. The union must also provide
employers, in writing, with at least seven days’
notice of official industrial action following a
ballot, and with details of the ballot result.
Any trade union member has the right to
restrain the union from calling on him or her,
and other members, to take action unless a
properly conducted secret ballot has supported
the action. Anyone deprived of goods or
services because of unlawful organisation of
industrial action has the right to obtain a court
order to stop this happening.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Britain are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also trade associations
concerned with commercial matters in general.
With the move away from national pay
bargaining, many employers’ associations have
moved towards concentrating on areas such as
supplying information for bargaining purposes
and dealing with specialist issues. As with
some of the larger trade unions, a number of
employers’ associations are increasingly
concerned with legislation and other issues
relating to Europe.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. In
some of the main industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national
federations. At the end of 1995, 114 listed and
115 unlisted employers’ associations were
known to the Certification Officer.
Most national organisations belong to the
Confederation of British Industry (see p. 205),
which represents directly or indirectly some
250,000 businesses.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body which has a general duty of promoting
the improvement of industrial relations.
ACAS aims to operate through the voluntary
co-operation of employers, employees and,
where appropriate, their representatives. Its
main functions are collective conciliation,
provision of arbitration and mediation
facilities, advisory mediation services for
preventing disputes and improving industrial
relations through the joint involvement of
employers and employees, and the provision
of a public enquiry service. ACAS also
conciliates in disputes on individual
employment rights.
In 1995 ACAS:
• received 1,321 requests for collective
conciliation, of which nearly half related
to pay or other terms and conditions of
employment;
• received nearly 91,600 individual
conciliation cases, 15 per cent more than
in 1994;
• assisted with 539 joint working exercises;
and
• dealt with almost 538,400 enquiries
through its public enquiry points.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Health and safety standards in Britain are
among the best in the world. Recent statistics
indicate a reduction in the rate of major and
other reported injuries to employees. In
1994-95 the number of deaths for employees
and the self-employed from accidents at work
fell to 263, the lowest figure recorded. The
200
EMPLOYMENT
decline reflects improvements in safety, together
with a change in industrial structure away from
old heavy industries which tend to have higher
risks. About 18 million working days a year are
lost as a result of work-related injuries and 13
million from work-related illnesses.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes general
duties on everyone concerned with work
activities, including employers, the
self-employed, employees, and manufacturers
and suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work. Employers
with five or more staff must prepare a written
statement of their health and safety policy and
bring it to the attention of their staff.
The Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations 1988 (which were revised
in 1994) constitute one of the most important
sets of regulations made under the 1974 Act.
They replaced a range of outdated legislation
by a comprehensive and systematic approach
to the control of exposure to virtually all
substances hazardous to health.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC)
has responsibility for developing policy on
health and safety at work, including proposals
for new or revised regulations and approved
codes of practice. Recent work has
concentrated on achieving a simpler and more
effective system of health and safety
regulation. This is expected to reduce the
volume of health and safety legislation by 40
per cent, primarily through repealing outdated
or unnecessary regulations.
The HSC has advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each of which deals with
a specific sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
the primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. Its field services
and inspections are carried out by the Field
Operations Division. This incorporates the
Factory, Agricultural and Quarries
inspectorates, together with the regional staff
of the Employment Medical Advisory
Service and the Field Consulting Groups,
which provide technical support to the
inspectorates.
In 1995 the HSE launched a major
campaign to reduce the number of people—2.2
million a year—who suffer work-related ill
health. The campaign is designed to raise
awareness of health risks at work, and to
persuade managers to ensure that working
conditions do not cause illness among their
employees.
The HSE’s Directorate of Science
and Technology provides technical advice
on industrial health and safety matters.
The Health and Safety Laboratory provides
scientific and medical support and testing
services, and carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health and
safety legislation is enforced by inspectors
appointed by local authorities, working under
guidance from the HSE. Some other official
bodies work under agency agreement with the
HSE.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of the Northern
Ireland health and safety legislation are
broadly similar to those for Great Britain.
They are enforced mainly by the
Department of Economic Development
and the Department of Agriculture through
their health and safety inspectorates,
although the district councils have an
enforcement role similar to that of local
authorities in Great Britain. There is a
Health and Safety Agency, roughly
corresponding to the HSC but without its
policy-making powers, and an Employment
Medical Advisory Service.

14 Industry and
Government
Structure and Organisation Government Policy 205
of Industry 203
The private sector is responsible for over three-quarters of total economic
activity. Since 1979 the Government has reduced the state-owned sector of
industry by about two-thirds under its privatisation programme. It believes that
economic decisions are best taken by those competing in the market place, and
that its primary roles are to help keep inflation low, maintain sound public
finances and create the right climate for markets to work better. Government
schemes do, however, provide direct assistance or advice, mainly to small and
medium-sized businesses without the resources of large companies.
STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
OF INDUSTRY
In some sectors a small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a substantial proportion of total
production, for instance in the chemical, motor
vehicle, aerospace and transport equipment
industries. Private enterprises account for by
far the greater part of activity in the
agricultural, manufacturing, construction,
distributive, financial and other service sectors.
The private sector contributed 78 per cent of
total domestic expenditure in 1995, general
government 21 per cent and public
corporations under 1 per cent.
About 250 British industrial companies
each have an annual turnover of over ^500
million. Eleven British firms are among the top
25 European companies in terms of capital
employed and 16 in terms of profitability.
Small businesses now contribute 40 per cent of
Britain’s business turnover, employing over 50
per cent of the private sector workforce.
Industries with the fastest growth rates in
recent years are in the services sector,
particularly finance, property, and professional
and business services.
Legal Framework
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies in Cardiff, Edinburgh
or Belfast. Companies with a place of business
or branch in Britain, but which are
incorporated overseas, are also required to
register.
Legislation deals with capital structure,
rights and duties of directors and members,
and the preparation and filing of accounts (see
p. 204). Most corporate businesses are ‘limited
liability’ companies. The liability of members
of a limited company is restricted to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding (or to their guarantee where
companies are limited by guarantee). In the
case of unincorporated businesses, such as sole
proprietorships or partnerships, individuals
are personally liable for any business debts,
except where a member of a partnership is a
203
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
limited liability company or a limited member
of a limited partnership.
Companies may be either public or private.
A company must satisfy certain conditions
before it can become a public limited company
(pic). It must:
• be limited by shares or guarantee and have
a share capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements; and
• have as the suffix to its name the words
‘public limited company’ or ‘pic’.
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes is generated internally.
Banks are the chief external source of finance,
but companies have increasingly turned to
equity finance. The main forms of short-term
finance in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit and factoring (making
cash available to a company in exchange for
debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, mortgaging of property
and the issue of shares and other securities to
the public through the London Stock
Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also
be regarded as a form of finance. Other sources
of funding for industry include government,
the European Union (EU) and specialist
financial institutions, such as financing and
leasing, factoring, and venture capital
companies.
Venture Capital
Venture capital, or private equity capital,
provides long-term unsecured capital for
companies which are starting up or expanding
as well as those undergoing management
buy-outs and buy-ins. It is available principally
from institutions, including independent funds
and wholly-owned subsidiaries or divisions of
financial institutions, such as banks. The
British Venture Capital Association has 108
full members, which represent every major
source of venture capital in Britain.
Nearly £14,100 million has been
invested by venture capital
companies in over 14,000 businesses
since 1984, with £2,535 million having
been invested in 1,163 businesses in
1995. In that year, 53 per cent of
venture capital deals were in
expansion stage companies. Some 73
per cent of the total amount was
invested in management buy-outs
and buy-ins.
‘Business angels’, or private investors, are
an increasingly important source of smaller
amounts of venture capital. The Government’s
Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and
Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) seek to
encourage private investment in smaller
unquoted trading companies by offering
individuals tax incentives. The EIS allows
business angels to take a position on the board
of the investee company, while VCTs are more
suited to less active investors. VCTs are
similar in structure to investment trusts: they
invest in unquoted trading companies and are
quoted on the Stock Exchange.
Taxation
Rates of corporate taxation have been
progressively reduced in recent years (see
p. 168). The main rate of corporation tax is 33
per cent, with a reduced rate of 24 per cent for
small firms (those with annual profits of less
than £300,000). For companies with profits of
between £300,000 and £1.5 million, the
overall corporation tax rate is between the
main rate and the rate for small firms.
Expenditure on business plant and machinery,
industrial building, and scientific research
qualifies for annual allowances against profit
for tax purposes.
Company Law
Laws relating to companies are designed to
meet the need for proper regulation of
204
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
business, maintain open markets and to create
safeguards for those wishing to invest in
companies or do business with them. They
take account of EC directives on company law,
and on company and group accounts and their
auditing. The Government’s aim is to achieve
these objectives while imposing as small a
burden as possible on business. Hence, it has
removed from certain types of small companies
the statutory obligation to have their accounts
audited, and has introduced a simple
procedure for dissolving private companies
that are no longer operational. Additionally, it
is taking steps to encourage the use of
summary financial statements and to simplify
statutory accounting requirements.
The 1992 Cadbury Committee Report on
the management of companies recommended
that company boards should comply with a
Code of Best Practice. This is underpinned by
a Stock Exchange requirement for firms to
state whether they are complying with the
Code and give reasons for areas of
non-compliance. Standards of disclosure have
improved since 1992 and they indicate a high
level of compliance with the Cadbury
recommendations, especially among larger
companies. Shareholders, including
institutional shareholders, are encouraged by
the Government to play a more active role in
overseeing management.
Insider dealing in shares is a criminal
offence and inspectors may be appointed to
investigate possible insider dealing. A licensing
procedure ensures the professional
competence, integrity and independence of
people acting as trustees of bankrupt
individuals, or as liquidators, receivers or
administrators of insolvent companies.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is
the largest employers’ organisation in Britain,
representing about 250,000 companies. Most
national employers’ organisations, trade
associations, and some chambers of commerce
are also members.
The CBI aims to ensure that the
Government, national and international
institutions and the public understand the
needs, intentions and problems of business, so
as to help create a climate of opinion in which
business can operate efficiently and profitably.
It campaigns to lessen the administrative and
regulatory burdens on business, tackle
handicaps on competition, and help improve
the performance of companies. It offers
members a forum, a lobby and a range of
advisory services. The CBI also conducts
surveys of activity in manufacturing,
distribution, financial services, the regions,
innovation, and pay and productivity. It has 12
regional offices and an office in Brussels. The
CBI is the British member of the Union of
Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of
Europe.
Chambers of commerce represent business
views to the Government at national and local
levels. They promote local economic
development—for example, through
regeneration projects, tourism, inward
investment promotion and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. Member firms are
also supplied with information about overseas
buyers and product sourcing. The Association
of British Chambers of Commerce represents
about 200,000 businesses in 196 chambers of
commerce and trade.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has 35,000
members in Britain, many of whom are from
small businesses. It provides business advisory
services on a range of matters affecting
company directors, such as corporate
management, insolvency and career
counselling, and represents the interests of
members to authorities in Britain and the EU.
Trade associations represent companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply-
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members to government
departments.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
is the department mainly responsible for the
Government’s relations with industry and
commerce. Specific areas of responsibility,
which are dealt with in this chapter, include
company law, small firms, competition policy
and consumer affairs, intellectual property,
205
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and regional industrial development and
inward investment. The Department of the
Environment oversees provision of regional
industrial aid through the Government Offices
for the Regions. The Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Offices are responsible for
industrial policies in their areas. Export
promotion and technology and innovation,
which are also part of DTPs remit, are dealt
with in Chapters 12 and 20 respectively. The
DTPs duties regarding industrial relations are
covered in Chapter 13.
The Department of Trade and Industry
seeks to help British industry to compete
successfully in domestic and overseas markets.
It has specified its objectives as:
• identifying business needs through close
contact with individual sectors;
• ensuring these needs are taken into
account by Government and the EU;
• identifying influences on competitiveness
at home and abroad;
• working for global trade liberalisation
worldwide and helping businesses take
advantage of market opportunities at
home and abroad;
• widening choice and stimulating
enterprise by promoting competition and
privatisation;
• maintaining confidence in markets and
protecting consumers through fair
regulation;
• reducing unnecessary regulatory and
administrative burdens on business;
• promoting innovation and best practice in
quality, design and management;
• fostering the creation and development of
small and medium-sized businesses;
• responding to the needs of different
regions and areas with special difficulties;
and
• taking account of environmental issues
when developing government policies and
stimulating an effective business response
to environmental developments.
Competitiveness White Papers
A White Paper on Competitiveness, issued by
the Government in 1994, contained a
programme of measures to help British
business compete effectively in world markets
(see p. 158). These were introduced to
improve education and training, help small
firms to be more innovative and to increase
exports, boost regional economies and attract
more inward investment. A follow-up White
Paper was published a year later, detailing
progress since 1994 and setting out new
policies and initiatives, in particular for smaller
companies. Some of the more important
measures are covered in this chapter and also
in Chapter 13.
Third Competitiveness White Paper
In June 1996 the Government published a
further White Paper in this series,
Competitiveness: Creating the Enterprise Centre
of Europe. This contains an analysis of British
industry’s competitiveness, focusing on
education and training as well as the
comparative performance of British companies
in both manufacturing and services. It outlines
a range of new measures to improve the
education and training framework, help attract
more inward investment, create new jobs and
raise living standards. There are also new
proposals for simplifying government support
for business and providing better assistance for
small businesses.
Review of Business Support
The Government is presently consulting
business and other interested parties on
proposals to reduce the number and
complexity of its business support services;
delegate more of the design and delivery of
these services to local level—principally
through Training and Enterprise Councils
(TECs) and Business Links; adopt challenge
funding for a proportion of locally delivered
support so that only the best projects are
financed; and extend challenge funding to
most sectoral support.
Small Firms
A small firms’ benchmarking service will be
made available locally. Measures to
encourage better payment practice towards
small businesses will include a new payment
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
performance league table for government
departments; local government will be
expected to operate a similar scheme. Payment
performance league tables are also being
considered for the private sector. Additionally,
the tax and National Insurance Contributions
(NICs) systems are to be further streamlined
(see pp. 165-171).
Single European Market
The Government believes that the single
European market (see p. 180) is beneficial to
the economy of each member state, and that
removal of trade barriers should lead to a
reduction in business costs and greater
competition and efficiency, aiding consumers
and job and wealth creation.
Specific advantages of the single market
include:
• wider consumer choice;
• removal of barriers to trade through
mutual recognition of standards and
harmonisation;
• liberalisation of public procurement;
• the right to trade financial services
throughout the EU on the basis of a single
authorisation ‘passport’ (see p. 222);
• mutual recognition of professional and
vocational qualifications; and
• a reduction in export business
bureaucracy.
Privatisation
The Government is of the view that the best
way to improve the performance of public
sector companies and nationalised industries is
to expose them to market forces, through
privatisation and the promotion of
competition. Privatisation has also provided an
opportunity to widen and deepen share
ownership by encouraging both employees and
the public to take a direct stake in industry. In
major flotations, employees in privatised
companies are normally given a preferential
right to buy shares in the new privatised
companies.
Since 1979 the Government has privatised
50 major businesses, with net proceeds to the
end of 1995-96 of about £64,000 million; more
than 950,000 jobs have been transferred to the
private sector. Recent privatisations include
British Coal, the electricity industry in
Northern Ireland, London’s buses and the
Government’s residual shareholdings in BT
(British Telecom), National Power and
PowerGen. The modern advanced gas-cooled
reactor nuclear power stations were privatised
in July 1996 (p. 273). Passenger services of
British Rail are being franchised to the private
sector; Railtrack was privatised in May 1996
(p. 310). Privatisation is also being extended to
non-core government activities (including a
number of research laboratories—p. 330) and
other public sector areas.
Benefits
The Government believes that the economy
has benefited through higher returns on capital
in the privatised industries, which now have to
compete for funds in the open capital markets.
It considers that the consumer has gained from
downward pressure on prices and from rising
standards of service.
The Government has established a system
of independent regulation for the privatised
utilities. In each of the privatised utility
sectors—telecommunications, electricity, gas
and so on—a regulatory body has been
appointed with a wide range of powers and
duties to promote competition and the
interests of consumers. These usually include
considering all complaints and representations
about the company’s services. Each privatised
utility operates under a pricing policy set by
the regulator, which often limits annual price
increases to significantly less than the rate of
inflation.
Nationalised Industries
The remaining major nationalised industries
are the Post Office, London Transport, and
the Civil Aviation Authority. Managing boards
are appointed by ministers, who have power to
give general directions but are not engaged in
day-to-day management. Managing boards and
staffs of nationalised industries are not civil
servants.
The Government considers that
nationalised industries should act as
207
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
commercial enterprises and has set guidelines
to which they are expected to conform.
These involve:
• clear government objectives;
• regular corporate plans and performance
reviews;
• agreed principles relating to investment
appraisal and pricing;
• financial targets and performance aims;
• external financing limits; and
• systematic monitoring.
Deregulation
The Government’s aim is to reduce or simplify
administrative and legislative ‘burdens’ on
business, particularly small businesses, where
the burden of compliance is most demanding,
given limited financial resources and staffing
levels. A small firms ‘litmus test’ is helping to
ensure that compliance costs for new
regulations are not unduly high. Deregulation
policies are designed to help businesses to
contain costs, operate more efficiently and
trade more competitively.
Under its Deregulation Initiative, the
Government is reducing burdens on business
by:
• achieving more efficient regulation, and
cutting unnecessary controls and the cost
of compliance with essential regulation;
• ensuring that the views of business, and
potential costs of compliance, are taken
into account in framing new regulations
and in negotiating EU proposals;
• increasing official awareness of the needs
of business through training and better
consultation and communication; and
• improving the quality of service to
business generally, whether provided by
central or local government.
Existing regulations affecting companies are
being reviewed by government departments
with the help of business people. The
Deregulation and Contracting Out Act enables
the Government to amend or repeal primary
legislation imposing unnecessary burdens on
business.
Regulation of Markets
The aim of Government competition policy is
to encourage and enhance the competitive
process. When the competitive process is
frustrated intervention may be justified. The
purpose is not to protect particular firms that
may be adversely affected by competition. The
law provides several ways in which market
situations can be examined and, if necessary,
altered.
Responsibility for competition policy lies
with the President of the Board of Trade.
Competition law is administered by the
Director General of Fair Trading, the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC)
and the Restrictive Practices Court. The main
legislation comprises:
• the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the
Competition Act 1980, which deal with
mergers and monopolies, and
anti-competitive practices respectively;
• the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976,
which regulates agreements between
people or companies that could limit their
freedom to operate independently; and
• the Resale Prices Act 1976, covering
attempts to impose minimum prices at
which goods can be sold.
Government proposals to reform
competition laws include plans to prohibit
cartels and restrictive trade agreements, and to
strengthen the powers of the Director General
of Fair Trading to deal with abuse of market
power.
Competition policy is also governed by
European Community rules. These apply only
where an agreement or practice has an effect
on trade between member states. Enforcement
of these rules is primarily the responsibility of
the European Commission, which has powers
to investigate and terminate alleged
infringements and to impose fines. The
Director General assists the European
Commission in the application of European
Community competition law.
Monopolies
A simple monopoly is defined as a situation
where a business supplies or purchases 25 per
208
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
cent or more of a particular product or service
in Britain, or a defined part of it. A complex
monopoly is a situation where a group of
companies or people together have 25 per cent
or more of the market and behave in a way that
adversely affects competition.
The Director General may enquire into
possible abuse of a monopoly position and take
various measures to remedy the situation. If
there is ‘prima facie’ evidence of such an
abuse, the matter can be referred for further
investigation by the independent Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, whose members
include businessmen and women, lawyers,
economists and trade unionists.
If the MMC finds that a monopoly situation
operates, or could be expected to operate,
against the public interest, the President of the
Board of Trade can either make an order to
prevent further harm or ask the Director
General to obtain undertakings from those
involved to remedy the situation.
Mergers
A merger is defined as occurring when two or
more enterprises come under common
ownership or control. It qualifies for
investigation by the MMC where a market
share—in Britain or a substantial part of
it—reaches 25 per cent or more, or is
increased, and the total value of gross assets to
be taken over exceeds £70 million.
Qualifying mergers are considered by the
Director General of Fair Trading, who then
advises the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry. There is a voluntary procedure for
pre-notification of proposed mergers which
offers prompt clearance of straightforward
cases. The majority of mergers are not found
to operate against the public interest and are
allowed to take place. However, under the Fair
Trading Act, the Secretary of State can refer a
merger for further investigation by the MMC
if such a merger could lead to a significant
reduction in competition or raise other matters
of public concern. Alternatively, the Director
General of Fair Trading may be asked to
obtain suitable undertakings from the
companies involved to remedy the adverse
effects identified. The Secretary of State may
accept undertakings by the parties concerned
to dispose of assets or to behave in a certain
way so that there is no need for a full
investigation by the MMC.
If a merger or proposed merger is referred
and the MMC finds that it could be expected
to operate against the public interest, the
Secretary of State can prohibit it or allow it
subject to certain conditions being met. Where
the merger has already taken place, action can
be taken to reverse it. There are special
provisions for newspaper and water company
mergers.
Certain mergers with an EC dimension,
assessed by reference to turnover, come under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the European
Commission. The Commission can ban
mergers if it concludes that they create or
strengthen a dominant position which would
significantly impede effective competition
within the EU or a substantial part of it;
alternatively, it may negotiate undertakings to
correct the adverse effect.
Anti-competitive Practices
The Director General of Fair Trading can
investigate any course of conduct by a business
which appears to be anti-competitive. If a
practice is found to be anti-competitive,
undertakings may be sought from the business
responsible for the conduct. In the event of a
suitable undertaking not being given, the
matter may be referred to the MMC. In the
case of an adverse finding by the MMC, the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has
powers to take remedial action. Companies are
not covered by the legislation if they have a
turnover of below £10 million, or have less
than 25 per cent of a relevant market in
Britain.
Restrictive Trade Practices
Most commercial agreements containing
restrictions on matters such as prices and other
conditions of sale and parties or areas to be
dealt with have to be submitted to the Director
General of Fair Trading for registration. Legal
proceedings are normally initiated by the
Director General against blatantly
anti-competitive agreements which have not
been notified.
209
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Once an agreement has been registered, the
Director General is under a general duty to
refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court. The
Court must declare the restrictions in the
agreement contrary to the public interest
unless the parties can satisfy it that the
restrictions fall within set public interest
criteria. Restrictions declared contrary to the
public interest by the Court are void, and the
Court has the power to order the parties not to
implement them.
In practice, however, the great majority of
agreements are never brought to court, because
the restrictions they contain are not significant
enough to warrant such action.
Resale Price Maintenance
It is in general unlawful for suppliers to
stipulate to dealers a minimum resale price for
their goods or to make it a condition of supply
that their goods be sold at a specified price. It
is also unlawful for suppliers to seek to impose
minimum resale prices by withholding
supplies of goods or by discriminating against
price-cutting dealers in other ways.
There is, however, the possibility of
exemption for particular classes of goods by
the Restrictive Practices Court on public
interest grounds. These exemptions remain in
force until it can be shown by the Director
General of Fair Trading, or third parties, to
the Court’s satisfaction that there has been a
material change in circumstances from the
time the exemptions were first granted. Two
exemptions are currently in force: on books
(Net Book Agreement) and in respect of
certain pharmaceuticals. The Net Book
Agreement is being reviewed by the Court,
though its publisher members have withdrawn
from the arrangement. The Office of Fair
Trading is considering the decision to exempt
pharmaceuticals.
Consumer Protection
Consumer protection is an integral element in
the fair and efficient operation of markets. The
Government believes that consumers’ interests
are best served by open and competitive
markets offering the widest choice of goods
and services. There are, however, laws to
ensure that consumers are adequately
protected.
Legislation covers the sale and supply of
goods and services. The Sale of Goods Act
1979 (as amended in 1994) ensures that
consumers are entitled to receive goods which
fit their description and are of satisfactory
quality. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968
prohibits misdescriptions of goods, services,
accommodation and facilities. False or
misleading indications about prices of goods
are covered by the Consumer Protection Act
1987. This Act also requires information or
instructions relating to goods to be marked on
or to accompany the goods or to be included in
advertisements. The marking and accuracy of
quantities are regulated by weights and
measures legislation. Another law provides for
the control of medical products, and certain
other substances and articles, through a system
of licences and certificates. Under EC
legislation, it is a criminal offence to supply
unsafe consumer products. A range of public
safety information for consumers is made
available by the DTI.
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractice. Under the Fair Trading
Act, the Director General can recommend
legislative or other changes to stop practices
adversely affecting consumers’ economic
interests; encourage trade associations to
develop codes of practice promoting
consumers’ interests; and disseminate
consumer information and guidance. The
Director General can also take assurances as to
future conduct from traders who persistently
breach the law to the detriment of consumers.
Other regulations empower the Director
General to act against traders using unfair
contract terms.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is intended
to protect consumers in their dealings with
credit businesses. Businesses connected with
the consumer credit or hire industry or which
supply ancillary credit services, for example,
credit brokers, debt collectors, debt
counsellors and credit reference agencies,
require a consumer credit licence. The
Director General is responsible for
administering the licensing system, including
revoking licences of those unfit to hold them.
210
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
Under other regulations, the Director General
also has powers to take court action to prevent
the publication of misleading advertisements
and powers to prohibit unfit people from
carrying out estate agency work.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety, protection
of the consumer’s economic interests,
promotion of consumer education and
strengthening the representation of consumers.
The views of British consumer organisations
on EU matters are represented by the
Consumers in Europe group (UK). British
consumer bodies also have a voice on the
European consumer ‘watchdog’ body, the
Bureau Europeen des Unions de
Consommateurs.
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
are given by Citizens Advice Bureaux, trading
standards and consumer protection
departments of local authorities (in Northern
Ireland the Department of Economic
Development), and, in some areas, by
specialist consumer advice centres.
The independent, non-statutory National
Consumer Council (and associated councils for
Scotland and Wales), which receives
government finance, presents the consumer’s
view to government, industry and others. The
General Consumer Council for Northern
Ireland has wide-ranging duties in consumer
affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the
consumer. Some trade associations in industry
and commerce have established codes of
practice. In addition, several private
organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, funded by the subscriptions of its
1 million members.
Education and Training
A well-educated and well-trained workforce is
essential for achieving economic prosperity,
especially at a time of intense international
competition and rapid technological advance.
The Government aims to ensure that
education and training are broadly based and
that people of all ages can acquire economically
relevant knowledge and skills.
New initiatives on education and training
outlined in the competitiveness White Papers
include:
• improved careers information, education
and guidance for young people;
• a strengthening of academic and
vocational qualifications;
• new modern and accelerated
apprenticeships;
• initiatives to help firms develop and
implement training plans;
• making training loans available to smaller
firms; and
• a competition open to small firms for the
best co-ordinated training projects.
A package of proposed measures for
Scotland was announced in 1995.
Training and Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies
The Government has set up a network of 81
business-led Training and Enterprise Councils
in England and Wales. Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see p. 216)
run 22 local enterprise companies (LECs) in
Scotland.
TECs and LECs are independent
companies managed by boards of directors, the
majority of whom are drawn from private
sector business. They provide training,
vocational education and enterprise
programmes on behalf of the Government and
encourage employers to develop the potential
of all their employees through, for instance,
the attainment of the Investors in People
standard (see p. 190). In addition, they offer
advisory and training services to businesses,
including schemes to enhance the expertise of
managers. In Scotland LECs supply the full
range of services offered by the Enterprise
bodies—support and advice to businesses,
environmental renewal, training programmes
for young and long-term unemployed people
and encouragement to businesses to invest in
management and skills. TECs and LECs also
211
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
have a key role in regeneration and economic
development activities locally and in setting up
Business Links and similar operations in
Scotland and Wales.
Management Education and Development
The DTI, in conjunction with the Department
for Education and Employment (DFEE),
works with industry, higher education
institutions and business schools to spread
awareness about best management practices
and to encourage continuous professional
development. Performance standards for all
levels of management have been devised.
The ‘Managing in the 90s’ programme aims
to improve the competitiveness of business by
promoting best management practice. It is
concerned with making businesses aware of the
need for change and providing them with
guidance on how to identify the changes
required. Delivered mainly through Business
Links and sectoral organisations, the
programme offers a range of material and
activities which are constantly being developed
in response to market needs. These include
help with networking (a scheme which
encourages businesses to share their costs or
capacity) and benchmarking (another
programme which assists firms to reach
international standards through objective
assessments of performances and comparisons
with leading companies).
Management education is available at many
universities and colleges of higher and further
education. Regional management centres have
been established in England and Wales by
associations of these colleges, and there are
several similar organisations in Scotland.
Universities run full-time postgraduate
programmes at business schools, such as those
of London, Manchester, Durham, Warwick
and Strathclyde universities.
The British Institute of Management
encourages excellence in management. Other
bodies are concerned with standards and
training in specialised branches of
management. The employer-led Management
Charter Initiative (MCI) is the operating arm
of the National Forum for Management
Education and Development and the leading
industrial body for management standards.
About 2,500 employers, representing a quarter
of the total workforce, are members of the
MCI, which has 82 local networks working
with local employers.
Business Support Services
To encourage the development of small firms,
the DTI has established a network of more
than 200 Business Links in England. This
programme is designed to bring together in a
single point of access organisations supporting
enterprise, such as local companies, Training
and Enterprise Councils, chambers of
commerce, local authorities and enterprise
agencies. Business Links are local, commercial
partnerships, in which larger firms can make
contacts and expertise available to smaller
firms. Some 600 personal business advisers
offer small firms a full range of business
consultancy and other services, calling on
specialist counsellors for, for example,
marketing, export development, design, and
innovation and technology. In addition, since
April 1996 regional staff from four government
departments (Environment, Trade and
Industry, Education and Employment, and
Transport) seconded to Business Links are
providing services to businesses. Business
Links are also the access point for a regional
supply network designed to help both
purchasers find competitive suppliers and
suppliers exploit new markets. Every company
in England now has easy access to a Business
Link. Further measures to help small firms,
available through Business Links, were
outlined in the 1995 competitiveness White
Paper:
• an extra ^lOO million over four years to
develop existing management initiatives
and make available locally designed
business development programmes;
• more advice on innovation and
technology, including overseas
development; and
• free export help to small firms through
export vouchers to develop and
implement their export strategies.
In Scotland Business Shops are run by local
partnerships between Local Enterprise
Companies, local authorities and business
212
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
support organisations; trained advisers provide
information and direct enquiries to the
business support services of local partners.
Similar arrangements have been set up in
Wales through Business Connect, which has a
network of business support centres. In
Northern Ireland small firms are helped by the
Local Enterprise Development Unit’s network
of regional offices, which provide co-ordinated
advice and support.
Consultancy
Business Links are responsible for supplying a
flexible consultancy and diagnostic service,
which gives assessments of smaller firms’
strengths and weaknesses and draws up plans
for their future development. A similar service
is available in Scotland through Business
Shops in lowland Scotland and Business
Information Source in the Highland and
Islands area. Since 1995 small and
medium-sized companies can also use a new
consultancy brokerage service to assist them in
selecting consultants.
Small Firms Schemes
The SPUR scheme offers grants of up to
£ 170,000 to businesses with no more than 250
employees for the development of new,
technologically advanced products and
processes. Under a new SPUR-PLUS scheme,
larger grants up to £450,000 are available for
exceptional projects.
SMART is an annual competition
providing grants to individuals and businesses
with up to 50 employees to support them in
innovative technological projects with
commercial potential. Firms which have
completed their SMART projects are eligible
for enhanced SPUR grants to develop their
product. In 1995 SMART grants were made to
over 220 new projects. In addition, levels of
funding for SPUR and SMART schemes in
designated eligible areas are increased by
contributions from the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF—p. 217).
Other government assistance to small
businesses includes:
• the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme,
which helps businesses with viable
proposals to obtain finance where
conventional loans are unavailable as a
result of a lack of financial security or
previous performance; redesigned and
extended in March 1996, the scheme gives
banks and other financial institutions a
government guarantee on a certain
percentage of the loan in return for a
premium payment; £275 million was
guaranteed in 1995-96;
• an initiative to encourage informal
investment for small firms from a wider
range of sources;
• a programme to encourage small and
medium-sized firms to make better use of
new information technology;
• the Business Start-Up scheme, enabling
unemployed people to claim an allowance
while establishing a new business; and
• an initiative which allows small firms to
develop key workers’ training skills
in-house.
Design, Quality and Standards
The effective use of design is fundamental in
the creation of innovative products, processes
and services. The British design consultancy
industry has an annual estimated turnover of
£1,000 million and employs around 18,000
people.
The DTI encourages firms to invest in
design which can contribute to international
competitiveness; it also supports the benefits of
good design through the independent Design
Council. The Council acts primarily as a
provider of analysis and advice on design
policy to government, business and education.
Design services for industry are supplied
through Business Links in England (and
equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales), with
financial support from the DTI (see p. 212).
The Government urges business to
consider quality at all stages of design,
production, marketing and delivery to
customers. Accreditation is a key method of
improving quality and competitiveness.
Through its support for consultancy projects,
the Government helps small and
medium-sized firms to learn about and apply
quality management techniques based on a
213
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
national standard—BS EN ISO 9000—
meeting international requirements. In
order to increase customer confidence,
companies are encouraged to obtain assessment
and certification to this standard. The
competence and performance of organisations
undertaking such certification are officially
accredited by the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service. Companies certified by
accredited bodies are permitted to use the
national ‘crown and tick’ accreditation mark.
The DTI is responsible for policy relating
to the National Measurement System. This
provides, through a number of DTI-funded
agencies, many of the physical measurement
standards and associated calibration facilities
necessary so that measurements in Britain are
made on a common basis and to the required
accuracy. Several of these agencies have been
privatised or contracted out.
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is
Britain’s national standards body and is the
British member of the European and
international standards organisations. It works
with industry, consumers and government to
produce standards relevant to the needs of the
market and suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes.
Government support for the BSI is directed
particularly towards European and
international standards work. Harmonised
standards contribute to the aim of removing
technical barriers to trade in the EU. Hence,
over 90 per cent of the BSPs work is
concentrated on European or international
standards. The Kitemark is the BSPs
registered product certification trade mark.
Awards
The Queen’s Awards for Export,
Technological and Environmental
Achievement recognise outstanding
performance in their respective fields.
Awarded annually, they are valid for five years
and are granted by the Queen on the advice of
the Prime Minister, assisted by an Advisory
Committee consisting of senior representatives
from business, trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in Britain is eligible to apply, regardless
of size, provided it meets the scheme’s criteria.
Other awards include the Export Award for
Smaller Businesses (for firms employing fewer
than 200 people) and the MacRobert Award
for engineering in Britain made by the
Fellowship of Engineering for successful
technological innovation.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation by
protecting the rights of the originators of
inventions, industrial designs and trade marks,
together with copyright in literary, artistic and
musical works. These matters are the
responsibility of the DTPs Patent Office,
which includes the Design Registry and the
Trade Marks Registry. Patent protection is
also available under the European Patent
Convention and the Patent Co-operation
Treaty. Benefits may be claimed in other
countries by virtue of separate conventions on
industrial property, literary and artistic work,
and music and broadcasting. Recent measures
giving greater protection to industrial and
intellectual property owners include:
• the adoption of EC directives on
copyright which harmonise rental and
lending rights of performers, record
producers and broadcasters, and legal
protection of computer programs; and
• a new EC regulation on counterfeit and
pirated goods.
Regional Industrial Development
Industrial policy is designed to encourage
enterprise and economic growth in all areas of
Britain. Where additional help is needed, it is
focused on the Assisted Areas (Development
Areas and Intermediate Areas), which cover
around 35 per cent of Britain’s working
population. The promotion of inward
investment is a key element in the
Government’s regional policy (see p. 217).
The main regional policy instruments are:
• Regional Selective Assistance, available in
the Assisted Areas, for investment

• Regional Innovation Grants, for firms
employing no more than 50 people in
Development, Intermediate, Task Force

as well as some other areas covered by EU
schemes; they are also available in certain
Scottish urban areas.
Regional Selective Assistance and Regional
Investment and Innovation Grants are
administered by the Government Offices for
the Regions in England, the Scottish Office
Industry Department and the Welsh Office
Industry and Training Department.
England
English Partnerships promotes job creation,
inward investment and environmental
improvement through reclamation and
development of vacant, derelict, under-used or
contaminated land and buildings. The Rural
Development Commission advises the
Government on economic and social
development in the countryside, promotes jobs
and supports essential services. The
Commission’s resources are concentrated in
areas of greatest need, known as priority areas
(see p. 379), covering about 35 per cent of the
area of England.
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise manage government and EU
support to industry and commerce, in lowland
and highland Scotland respectively, operating
mainly through the network of LECs (see
p. 211). The two bodies have a broad range of
duties, including:
• attracting inward investment and
encouraging exports;
• giving financial and management support
to new businesses and assisting existing
ones to expand;
• improving the environment by reclaiming
derelict and contaminated land; and
• increasing job opportunities and skills.
A major initiative was launched by Scottish
Enterprise in 1995 to increase the rate of
business start-ups, with the objective of
creating an additional 25,000 businesses in
Scotland by 2000.
Wales
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA),
with a budget of £120 million in 1996-97,
promotes industrial efficiency and seeks to
improve the environment. In conjunction with
the private sector, it provides affordable, high-
quality sites and premises for existing
businesses and inward investors, spending
£850 million on property development in the
last 20 years. Since 1990, it has attracted over
£240 million of private sector investments
through Welsh Property Venture. It tries to
attract investment into Wales and co-ordinates
the approach for responding to the needs of
investors. Over 1,500 projects—involving
£8,500 million of capital investment, creating
more than 90,000 jobs, and safeguarding
50,000 other jobs—have been generated since
1983.
The WDA’s land reclamation programme
is the largest and most sustained landscape
improvement project in Europe. It has spent
£314 million to bring 6,500 hectares of land
into productive use; the reclamation of a
further 1,250 hectares is currently in
progress. Since 1991 the Agency has spent
nearly £120 million on urban regeneration
and attracted over £225 million of private
sector investment.
The WDA’s Business Services focuses on
developing stronger regional clusters (such as
supply and services chains), improving
standards and efficiency, and helping Welsh
companies to exploit new technology. Since
1991 Source Wales has helped firms to secure
£21 million of business.
The Land Authority for Wales is a public
body with a fundamental role in economic
regeneration. It works with the private and
public sectors, providing land for industrial
and commercial projects that will create jobs
and facilities (see p. 379).
216
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
The Development Board for Rural Wales
promotes the economic and social well-being of
rural mid-Wales. It is concentrating investment
in market towns, especially those in the west, in
order to help stimulate business confidence and
prosperity. Priority is also being given to
activities in smaller communities.
Northern Ireland
Industrial development policy in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the Department
of Economic Development and is delivered
through various agencies:
• the Industrial Development Board, which
deals with overseas companies considering
Northern Ireland as an investment
location, as well as the development of
local companies with more than 50
employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, providing advice and assistance on
research and development, innovation and
technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which helps with in-company training and
management development.
A variety of schemes are on offer to help
companies with marketing, exporting, product
development and design, improved
productivity and quality, training, and
research and development. A full range of
assistance is made available to those companies
able to demonstrate development potential and
a prospect of long-term competitive growth.
This assistance includes capital grants, loans
and share capital investment.
European Union Regional Policy and Aid
The EU seeks to reduce disparities between
the different regions of the Union. The
principal responsibility for helping poorer
areas remains with national authorities, but the
EU complements schemes by awarding grants
and loans from various sources, including the
European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF).
The European Investment Bank
(see p. 128) offers loans for public and private
capital investment schemes. Assisted projects
typically include improvements to and
building of infrastructure projects;
construction of trans-European transport links
(like the Channel Tunnel); support for
business and tourism development; and capital
investment in industry, such as factory
construction.
EU Structural Funds, especially the
ERDF, play an important role in regional
development. Three areas—Northern
Ireland, the Highlands and Islands, and
Merseyside—are eligible for assistance; they
are receiving around £2,000 million of EU
funding over the period 1994-99. The
ERDF also provides finance for areas of
industrial decline and for rural development.
Structural Funds are made available to areas '
suffering from a decline in the coal, steel,
textile, fishing and defence industries.
Inward Investment
Inward investment is increasingly important to
Britain’s economy. It helps to develop and
modernise the industrial base by introducing
new products and processes, as well as
bringing in management expertise. It provides
new jobs and boosts output, exports and tax
revenues.
Overseas companies are responsible for 18
per cent of British manufacturing
employment, 32 per cent of capital investment,
24 per cent of output and 40 per cent of
exports. A total of £20,500 million was
invested in 1995, and, since 1979, inward
investment has accounted for over 700,000
jobs.
Britain is the EU’s major location for
inward investment from North America and
the Asia Pacific region, attracting about 40 per
cent of investment from these areas. For the
prospective inward investor Britain’s strengths
include its competitive costs, favourable
regulatory regime, open markets, skilled and
flexible workforce, and high quality
communications.
A growing proportion of inward investment
has been through expansion or reinvestment
by existing investors. This is likely to continue

Business Services 239
The service industries, which include finance, retailing, tourism and business
services, contribute about 65 per cent of gross domestic product and 75 per cent
of employment. Overseas earnings from services amounted to around 35 per
cent of the value of exports of manufactures in 1995. The number of employees
in services rose from over 13 million in 1983 to 16.8 million by June 1996, much
of the rise being accounted for by growth in part-time (principally female)
employment. London remains a world leader in the provision of financial and
business services, employing 850,000 people. Financial services make a
substantial contribution to Britain’s balance of payments.
Average real disposable income per head
increased by about three-quarters between
1971 and 1994 and this was reflected in a rise
in consumer spending on financial, personal
and leisure services. Demand for travel, hotel
and restaurant services has risen in Britain as
real incomes in Britain and other countries
have increased.
Britain is a major financial centre, housing
some of the world’s leading banking,
investment, insurance, futures and other
financial services, commodities and shipping
markets. Business services include advertising,
market research, management consultancy,
exhibition and conference facilities and
computing.
By the year 2000, tourism is expected to be
the world’s biggest industry, and Britain is one
of the world’s leading tourist destinations. The
industry is one of Britain’s largest, employing
about 7 per cent of the workforce. The
wholesaling, retailing and repairs sector is also
a major employer, employing 13 per cent of
the workforce.
Financial Services
Historically the heart of the financial services
industry in Britain has been located in the
famous ‘Square Mile’ in the City of London,
and this remains broadly the case. The markets
for financial and related services have grown
and diversified greatly during the last 25 years.
The City is the largest financial centre in
219
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Europe. Other financial centres are Edinburgh
(the fourth largest in Europe), Manchester,
Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds and Glasgow.
An important feature of the City of London
is the size of its international activities. It is
noted for having:
• more overseas banks than any other
financial centre;
• a banking sector that accounts for about a
fifth of total international bank lending;
• the world’s largest international insurance
market;
• the biggest market in the world for trading
overseas equities, accounting for 55 per
cent of their global turnover;
• the world’s largest foreign exchange
market, handling 30 per cent of worldwide
dealing in 1995;
• the world’s second largest fund
management centre, with over £490,000
million of institutional equity holdings;
• one of the world’s biggest financial
derivatives markets;
• the greatest concentration of international
bond dealers;
• important markets for transactions in
commodities; and
• a full range of ancillary and support
services—legal, accountancy and
management consultancy—which
contribute to London’s strength as a
financial centre.
British financial institutions’ net overseas
earnings amounted to £20,400 million in 1995,
8.5 per cent higher than in 1994.
DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL
SERVICES
The growth in international movements of
capital in the 1960s and 1970s mainly took the
form of increased bank lending and foreign
exchange trading. London became the
international centre of this activity,
particularly in the eurocurrency markets (see
p. 232). During the 1980s, with increasing
international competition in financial services
and developments in technology, London’s
securities markets grew rapidly. Edinburgh
also developed as a centre for fund
management.
Another feature has been a significant
deregulation of Britain’s financial services.
Major landmarks include:
• the abolition of exchange controls in 1979;
• the abolition in 1981 of the Reserve Asset
Ratio requirement, under which banks
had to hold 12.5 per cent of their deposits
as liquid assets with the Bank of England;
• ‘Big Bang’ in 1986 (see p. 231);
• the Building Societies Act 1986 and
subsequent proposals to further ease
controls on building societies (see p. 226);
and
• the Friendly Societies Act 1992 (see
p. 226).
Traditional distinctions between financial
institutions have been eroded, so that single
firms supply a broader range of services, in
both domestic and international markets. In
the British market recent developments have
included:
• new financial products, such as TESSAs
and Personal Equity Plans (see p. 230);
• growth in the use of debit and credit
cards;
• greater use in the delivery of services by
telephone, as in insurance, home banking
and mortgages;
• intense competition between financial
institutions in providing services to
personal customers; and
• changes in the structure of the banking
and building society sectors, with several
mergers or takeovers, while a number of
large building societies are in the process
of converting to banks.
In 1995 the Government set up the City
Promotion Panel. This is developing better
co-ordination of the international promotion of
financial services and considering the sector’s
response to changing products and technology.
SUPERVISION
The Government is committed to improving
market efficiency by providing a regulatory

regime in which free and fair competition can
take place. It keeps the regulatory system
under review to ensure that there is an
appropriate balance between facilitating
market developments and maintaining investor
protection.
HM Treasury is the government
department with responsibility for financial
services. In particular, it is responsible for
legislation covering the regulation of banks,
building societies, friendly societies and
investment businesses. It also oversees the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB—see
below).
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is responsible for company law and
insolvency matters, and for investigations and
prosecutions under the Financial Services,
Insolvency and Companies Acts. Investigations
are carried out with the Serious Fraud Office
(see p. 95). The DTPs duties include prudential
supervision of insurance undertakings,
supervision of European Community (EC)
insurance directives, and general questions
affecting the insurance industry. It also has
powers to investigate ‘insider dealing’
—securities trading carried out on the basis of
privileged access to relevant information.
Regulation of Investment Businesses
Under the Financial Services Act 1986,
investment businesses (those dealing in,
arranging, managing or giving advice on
investments or operating collective investment
schemes) require authorisation and are subject to
rules on the conduct of business. Most of the
powers in the Act have been transferred to the
SIB, which is responsible for recognising a
number of‘front-line’ regulators: self¬
regulating organisations (SROs) and recognised
professional bodies (RPBs). Most investment
businesses are authorised under the Act by virtue
of membership of one of these. The SROs are:
• the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (IMRO), which regulates
about 1,100 fund management firms—
221
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
IMRO has announced a pilot project to
test more targeted supervision and
monitoring of its member firms, involving
about 50 selected firms which meet certain
criteria relating to complying with its
standards;
• the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA), which has about 1,400 members,
including member firms of the London
Stock Exchange, as well as futures brokers
and dealers, and eurobond dealers; and
• the Personal Investment Authority (PIA),
which regulates about 4,000 firms,
including independent financial advisers,
which advise on or market retail
investment products (such as life
assurance, personal pensions and unit
trusts) or act for private investors in
relation to such products.
The Investors Compensation Scheme
provides for payments of up to £48,000 to
private investors if a firm regulated by an SRO
or by SIB cannot meet its investment business
liabilities. The funds for paying compensation
come from other investment firms. Since its
establishment in 1988 the scheme has helped
customers of over 250 firms, and paid out £103
million to 9,100 investors.
International Agreements
The Treasury negotiates and implements EC
directives relating to financial services and is
responsible for arrangements with overseas
regulators for exchanging information. Various
EC directives deliver a ‘passport’ to banking,
investment and insurance firms, allowing them
to operate throughout the European Union
(EU) on the basis of their home state
authorisation. As part of this process, two EC
directives entered into force in January 1996:
• the Investment Services Directive, which
allows investment services firms to offer
their services throughout the EU; and
• the Capital Adequacy Directive, which
sets minimum capital requirements for the
operations of banks and investment firms.
Britain plays a major role in encouraging
international regulatory co-operation,
particularly in the Bank for International
Settlements and the International Organisation
of Securities Commissions (IOSCO—the
primary international meeting place for
regulators of securities).
Britain is also at the forefront of action to
encourage international liberalisation in
financial services. It played a leading role in
negotiation of the General Agreement on
Trade in Services, part of the World Trade
Organisation series of agreements (see p. 179).
Britain is also involved in negotiations within
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, with the aim of reaching by
mid-1997 a Multilateral Agreement on
Investment that will set high standards of
liberalisation and investment protection.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its capital stock was acquired
by the Government in 1946. As Britain’s
central bank, the Bank of England’s overriding
objective is to maintain a stable and efficient
monetary and financial framework for the
effective operation of the economy. In
pursuing this goal, it has three main purposes:
• maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
• maintaining the stability of the financial
system, both in Britain and
internationally; and
• seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
The Bank’s primary objective is to support
the Government in achieving permanently low
inflation within the monetary policy
framework (see p. 157). Unlike some other
central banks, the Bank of England has no
statutory independence. Decisions on interest
rates are taken by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and the Bank’s role is to advise
him and implement his decisions.
Once policy is decided, the Bank
implements this through its operations,
primarily in the money market. In general, the
operation of the Government’s accounts
—including the weekly issue of Treasury
bills—tends to create a daily shortage
222
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
of funds in the banking system. The Bank acts
to relieve this shortage either by buy ing bills
from, or lending funds to, the discount houses
(see p. 227). Daily ‘open market operations’ are
supplemented by a fortnightly ‘gilt repo’
facility with banks, building societies and
gilt-edged market makers.
The Bank is also responsible for providing
advice on and implementing the Government’s
exchange rate policy. It acts as the Treasury’s
agent in managing the Government’s reserves
of gold and foreign exchange and its foreign
currency borrowing, and it undertakes foreign
exchange transactions on behalf of government
departments and other central banks. As the
Government’s debt management agent, it sells
gilt-edged stock through regular auctions
supplemented by occasional ‘tap’ issues (see
p. 171). The Bank also provides the principal
stock registration service for the Government.
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It plays
a key role in payment and settlement systems.
The Bank has sole right in England and Wales to
issue banknotes, which are backed by
government and other securities. The profit
from the note issue is paid directly to the
Government. Three Scottish and four Northern
Ireland banks also issue notes, which have to be
fully backed by Bank of England notes.
Supervision
The Bank has statutory responsibility for the
supervision of the banking system in Britain
within the framework of the Banking Act 1987
and legislation implementing EC directives.
The aim is to protect bank depositors. The Act
sets out a number of minimum standards
which banks are required to meet on the
integrity and competence of directors and
management, the adequacy of capital and of
cash flow, and the appropriateness of systems
and controls to deal with the various risks that
banks experience.
If a bank fails to meet the criteria, its
activities may be restricted or it may even be
closed. If a bank fails, there is a limited amount
of protection available to small depositors
financed by levies on the banking system. In
exceptional circumstances, the Bank may
organise financial support for a bank in
difficulty to prevent a loss of confidence
spreading to the banking system as a whole.
The Bank also has formal responsibility for
supervising firms in the wholesale markets for
sterling, foreign exchange and bullion, and
monitors links between the various financial
markets.
Financial Developments
The Bank works to ensure that London
maintains its position as a leading international
financial centre by monitoring its development
and identifying weaknesses and competitive
threats. It is also concerned that the financial
sector should provide efficient services to
industry in Britain. The Bank sometimes
facilitates collective initiatives where the
interests of the financial institutions differ.
The Bank is playing a full part in the
technical preparations for economic and
monetary union within the EU (see p. 126).
BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES
In addition to banks, other financial institutions
offer banking services, notably the building
societies and National Savings. Indeed, the
distinction between banks and building societies
in particular is becoming less clear, as both types
of institution diversify their services.
A distinction can still be made, however,
between ‘retail’ and ‘wholesale’ banking:
• Retail banking is primarily for personal
customers and small businesses. Its main
services are cash deposit and withdrawal
facilities, and money transmission systems.
• Wholesale business involves taking large
deposits at higher rates of interest,
deploying funds in money-market
instruments (see p. 232) and making large
loans and investments. Nearly all banks in
Britain engage in some wholesale activities
and some, such as the merchant and
overseas banks, centre their business on
them. Many of the dealings are conducted
on the inter-bank market—that is,
between banks themselves.
In 1996 there were 375 institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987,
223
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including clearing banks, investment banks,
branches of overseas banks from outside the
EU, discount houses, and banking subsidiaries
of both banking and non-banking institutions
from Britain and overseas. A further 103
branches of banks from other EU countries
were entitled to take deposits in Britain. Of the
total of 515 institutions permitted to take
deposits in Britain, 300 were members of the
British Bankers’ Association, the main
representative body for British banks.
Retail Banks
The major retail banks offer a full range of
financial services to both individuals and
companies. Services generally available include
interest-bearing current accounts, deposit
accounts, credit and debit cards, and various
kinds of loan arrangements. A growing range
of other facilities is offered by many banks,
such as mortgages, insurance, investment
advice, pensions products and share-dealing
services. Around three-quarters of adults in
Britain have a current account and over
one-third a deposit account.
HSBC (including its subsidiary Midland) is
the largest bank in Britain. Lloyds TSB Group
became the second biggest following the
merger in December 1995 of Lloyds and TSB.
The other major banks in England and Wales
are Barclays, National Westminster and Abbey
National; and in Scotland, the Bank of
Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Among the smaller retail banks are the
Clydesdale Bank, the Co-operative Bank, the
Yorkshire Bank and Alliance & Leicester Giro.
Northern Ireland is served by branch networks
of four major banking groups. During 1997
three of the largest building societies are due to
join the banking sector following their
flotations on the stock market (see p. 226).
The main retail banks operate through over
11,350 branches and sub-branches in Britain.
At the end of 1995 Lloyds TSB had the largest
number, with 2,858 branches, followed by
National Westminster (2,215), Barclays
(2,050), Midland (1,701), the Royal Bank of
Scotland (687), Abbey National (678) and the
Bank of Scotland (411).
With the growth of financial services and
fewer restrictions on competition among
financial institutions, the major banks have
diversified their operations. Most now own
finance houses, leasing and factoring companies,
merchant banks, securities dealers, insurance
companies and unit trust companies, and some
have set up subsidiaries to provide venture
capital for companies (see p. 230). Most retail
banks maintain overseas subsidiaries and are
active in eurocurrency markets (see p. 232).
The banks offer loan facilities to companies
and have become important suppliers of
finance for small firms. A loan guarantee
scheme is supported by the banks, under
which 70 per cent (85 per cent in certain cases)
of the value of bank loans to small companies is
guaranteed by the Government.
The total liabilities/assets of banks in Britain
amounted to over £1,476,000 million at the end
of 1995. Liabilities are made up of sterling
deposits, foreign currency deposits, items in
suspense or transmission, and capital and other
funds. The banks’ main liquid assets consist of
money at call (mainly short-term loans to
discount houses), their holdings of Treasury and
other bills, short-dated British government
securities and balances at the Bank of
England.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems are
run by three separate companies operating
under an umbrella organisation, the
Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS). One system covers bulk paper
clearings—cheques and credit transfers. A
second deals with high-value clearings for
same-day settlement, namely the nationwide
electronic transfer service Clearing House
Automated Payment System (CHAPS). A
third covers bulk electronic clearing for
standing orders and direct debits. Membership
of each company is open to any bank, building
society or other financial institution meeting the
criteria for appropriate supervision and volume
of transactions; 22 banks and building societies
are members of one or more clearing companies.
In May 1996 the Government issued
proposals to allow electronic clearing of
cheques. This is expected to lead to savings in
costs for the banks of around £30 million.
224
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Plastic Cards
The use of plastic cards has become very
widespread, and around 92 million are in
circulation. Among the main types are cheque
guarantee cards, debit cards, credit cards,
charge cards and cash cards. Cards frequently
combine functions. One of the most popular
uses is for obtaining cash from automated
teller machines (ATMs). All the major retail
banks and building societies participate in
nationwide networks of ATMs, which give
customers access to cash and other services for
up to 24 hours a day. About 21,000 ATMs
were in operation at the end of 1995.
According to a report by the Credit
Card Research Group, total spending
using credit cards rose by 15 per cent
in 1995 to £41,000 million, while
expenditure using debit cards grew
by 26 per cent to £28,000 million.
Cheque guarantee cards entitle holders to
cheque-cashing facilities in participating
institutions and guarantee retailers that
transactions up to the specified guarantee
limit—typically £50 or £100—will be
honoured. Eurocheques supported by a
eurocheque card are available from all major
banks. They may be used to obtain cash or
make payments in Britain, elsewhere in
Europe and in a few other overseas countries.
Cheques are made out in the currency of the
country in which they are being used.
Credit cards are mainly issued by banks.
Most cards are affiliated to one of the two major
international credit card organisations, Visa and
MasterCard. There are a growing number of
‘affinity’ cards, where the card is linked to an
organisation such as a charity or trade union.
Credit card users receive a statement each
month and must pay off a minimum of the
amount owed, interest then becoming
chargeable on the remainder. A majority of
users, though, choose to pay off the full amount
owed each month. Charge cards, like credit
cards, enable holders to make retail payments,
but often have no credit limit or a very high
limit. They are usually available only to those
with relatively high incomes or assets; the credit
/
balance must be settled in full each month.
Some of the major retailers issue credit cards or
charge cards for use within their own outlets.
More people are now paying for goods by
debit cards issued by the major banks and
building societies. Payments are deducted
directly from the purchaser’s current account.
There are two debit card schemes in operation:
Visa Delta and Switch.
Electronic Banking
Many banks and building societies offer home
banking services, under which customers use a
telephone to obtain account information, make
transfers and pay bills. One of the largest
operators is First Direct (a subsidiary of
Midland), with over 600,000 customers. Some
banks and building societies offer a home
banking service for customers with a personal
computer. Other innovations include banking
services over the Internet and self-service
kiosks containing ATMs and video links to
banks’ central facilities. The most recent
development has been the launch of a new type
of electronic card which is ‘charged’ with
money from the card holder’s bank account.
The cards can be used to purchase goods or
services at participating retailers through
electronic tills, while some can carry foreign
currency value for travelling overseas.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers, and are,
with the banks, the main source of housing
finance in Britain. They make long-term
mortgage loans, mostly at variable rates of
interest, against the security of property
—usually private dwellings purchased for
owner-occupation. Competition between
lenders for business intensified in the first half
of the 1990s when house prices fell and fewer
people moved house. Remortgaging, whereby
a borrower changes lender or switches to a
different mortgage from the same lender, has
become much more significant. In 1995
remortgaging accounted for around a quarter
by value of total mortgage loans.
Around 60 per cent of adults have building
society savings accounts. Societies are
extending their services, for example by
225
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
providing current account facilities such as
cheque books and ATMs.
Structure
There are 77 authorised building societies, of
which 76 are members of the Building
Societies’ Association. Building societies’
assets totalled approximately £300,000 million
at the end of 1995; they advanced about
£34,000 million in new mortgages in 1995.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders is a trade
body established in 1989 for all mortgage
lending institutions, including building
societies, insurance companies, finance houses
and banks. Its duties include representing
member institutions in discussions with the
Government on a broad range of issues.
The building society industry is
undergoing a period of considerable
change, which is particularly
affecting the biggest societies. Three
of the largest—the Halifax (which
merged with the Leeds Permanent in
August 1995), the Woolwich, and the
Alliance & Leicester—have
announced their intention to become
retail banks, with the aim of
facilitating expansion and offering a
wider range of financial services.
Subject to approval from their
members and the Building Societies
Commission (see below), all are
expected to become banks during
1997. The banks will be public limited
companies and will be responsible to
shareholders rather than to
members. Conversion to banks
normally involves bonus payments to
members, often in the form of free
shares in the new company.
Another society, the Northern Rock, also
plans to become a bank. Three others have
been or are being acquired by banks:
• the Cheltenham & Gloucester was taken
over by Lloyds in August 1995;
• the National & Provincial was acquired by
Abbey National in August 1996; and
• the Bristol & West is to be acquired by the
Bank of Ireland in 1997.
When all these changes have been
implemented, the largest society will be the
Nationwide.
Diversification
The Building Societies Act 1986 enabled
societies to diversify into banking and other
services and established the Building Societies
Commission to carry out the prudential
supervision of building societies.
Following a review of the 1986 Act, steps
have been taken to extend the powers of building
societies and remove or reduce certain statutory
burdens. For example, societies are now able to
raise up to 50 per cent (up from 40 per cent) of
their funds on the wholesale market, to make
unsecured loans to businesses, and, since July
1996, to wholly own insurance companies.
The Government is planning further
relaxations. Consultation has taken place on a
draft Building Societies Bill. Under the Bill,
societies would be able to undertake a wider
variety of services, subject to meeting certain
criteria. However, lending for home ownership
would remain the key business with:
• at least 75 per cent of a society’s assets
having to be loans secured on residential
property (although for the first time this
would include rented property); and
• a minimum of 50 per cent of funds in the
form of shares from members.
Other provisions of the Bill include proposals
to increase the accountability of societies to their
members, for example, by requiring societies to
get members’ permission if they wished to move
into a major new area of business.
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial services, particularly provision for
retirement and against loss of income through
sickness or unemployment. The Friendly
Societies Act 1992 enabled friendly societies to
incorporate, take on new powers and offer a
broader range of financial services through
226
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
subsidiaries. It also established a Friendly
Societies Commission to administer a system of
regulation and to promote the financial stability
of societies. Over 120 friendly societies are
authorised to accept new business.
Merchant Banks
Merchant banks have traditionally been
concerned primarily with accepting, or
guaranteeing, commercial bills and with
sponsoring capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they undertake a diversified
range of activities. After ‘Big Bang’ (see p. 231)
some merchant banks acquired securities
trading operations. Merchant banks have
important roles in equity and debt markets and
the provision of advice and financial services to
industrial companies, especially where
mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved.
Management of investment holdings,
including trusts, pensions and other funds, is
another important function. The sector is split
between independent houses and those which
are part of larger banking groups.
Overseas Banks
A total of 263 banks incorporated overseas
have branches in Britain, including 28 from
Japan and 23 from the United States; 80
institutions incorporated in Britain are
subsidiaries of overseas companies. They offer
a comprehensive banking service in many parts
of the world and engage in financing trade not
only between Britain and other countries but
also between third-party countries.
British-based Overseas Banks
A small number of banks have their head
offices in Britain, but operate mainly abroad,
often specialising in particular regions.
Standard Chartered, which is represented in
Asia, Africa and the Middle East, is the major
example of this type of bank. It has a network
of over 600 offices in more than 40 countries.
Discount Houses
There are seven discount houses authorised
under the Banking Act 1987. They act as
financial intermediaries between the Bank of
England and the rest of the banking sector,
promoting an orderly flow of short-term funds.
They guarantee to tender for the whole of the
weekly offer of the Government’s Treasury
bills, which are instruments to raise funds over
a period of up to three months. In return for
acting as intermediaries, the discount houses
have secured borrowing facilities at the Bank
of England, acting as ‘lender of last resort’.
Assets of the discount houses consist mainly of
Treasury and commercial bills, negotiable
certificates of deposit and short-term loans.
Their liabilities are for the most part
short-term deposits.
National Savings
National Savings, a government executive
agency, is a source of finance for government
borrowing and aims to encourage saving by
offering personal savers a range of investments.
Certain National Savings products offer tax
exempt returns. In September 1996 the total
amount invested in National Savings was
£61,657 million. Sales of National Savings
products totalled £11,597 million in 1995-96.
After allowing for repayments, the net
contribution to government funding was £5,123
million. The largest single contribution, of
£2,231 million, was from Pensioners Bonds,
whose contribution more than doubled,
reflecting decisions in the 1995 Budget to raise
the maximum holding and cut the eligible age
for the bonds from 65 to 60.
Another significant contribution from
National Savings in 1995-96, of £1,485
million, came from Premium Bonds,
where interest is in the form of prizes.
Each month there are 350,000 prizes.
Since their introduction in 1956,
Premium Bonds have paid out over 57
million prizes, worth £3,518 million.
The top prize in the monthly draw is
now £1 million. Over 23 million people
hold Premium Bonds.
Other important products include:
• Savings Certificates, which pay either a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower fixed
227
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
rate of interest combined with
index-linking (rising in line with the
Retail Prices Index);
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, which are
designed to accumulate capital sums for
those under 21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at post offices throughout Britain;
and
• FIRST Option Bonds, which offer a
guaranteed rate of interest that is fixed for
one year.
INSURANCE
London is the world’s leading centre for
insurance and for placing international
reinsurance. It handles an estimated 20 per
cent of the general insurance business placed
on the international market. EC directives to
create a single European market in insurance
came into force in 1994. As well as the British
companies and Lloyd’s (see below), a large
number of overseas firms are represented, with
which many British companies have formed
close relationships. Authorised insurance
companies are supervised by the Department
of Trade and Industry under the Insurance
Companies Act 1982.
Main Types of Insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance:
long-term life insurance, where contracts may
be for periods of many years; and general
insurance, including accident and short-term
health insurance, where contracts are for a year
or less.
Long-term Insurance
As well as providing life cover, life insurance is
a vehicle for saving and investment because
premiums are invested in securities and other
assets. About 65 per cent of households have
life assurance cover. Total long-term insurance
assets under management by companies in
1995 were £555,686 million on behalf of their
worldwide operations. Long-term insurance is
handled by around 200 companies.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, motor, marine, aviation and transport
risks. Total worldwide premium income of
members of the Association of British Insurers
(ABI) in 1995 was £36,800 million, of which
£21,200 million was earned in Britain.
Structure of the Industry
At the end of 1995, 826 companies were
authorised to carry on one or more classes of
insurance business in Britain. The industry
employs about 207,000 people directly, plus a
further 126,000 auxiliary staff. Around 450
companies belong to the ABI.
The industry includes both public limited
companies and mutual institutions—
companies owned by their policyholders. The
five largest life insurance companies are
Prudential, Standard Life (the largest mutual
life insurance company in Europe), Norwich
Union, Legal and General, and Scottish
Widows. Like the banking and building society
sectors, the industry is undergoing a period of
structural change. Norwich Union has
announced that it plans to become a public
limited company instead of a mutual insurer.
In 1996 Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance
merged to create Royal and Sun Alliance. This
is now Britain’s largest general insurance
company and the sixth largest life insurer.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
17th century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its
activities were originally confined to marine
insurance, it also engages in other classes of
insurance business, such as aviation and motor
insurance.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of
Lloyd’s and Lloyd’s Regulatory and Market
Boards. Business is carried out for individual
elected underwriting members, or ‘names’,
trading with unlimited liability in competition
with each other and with insurance companies.
Since 1994 corporate members with limited
228
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
liability have also traded in the market. Both
are required to satisfy certain financial
requirements and maintain set levels of
deposits at Lloyd’s.
Net premium income in 1995 was £5,700
million. For the 1996 year of account, there is
total market capacity of £9,993 million
provided by nearly 13,000 members grouped
into 167 syndicates. Each syndicate is managed
by an underwriting agent responsible for
appointing a professional underwriter to accept
insurance risks and settle claims on the
syndicate members’ behalf. With the exception
of motor insurance business, insurance may
only be placed through accredited Lloyd’s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s syndicates
on behalf of the insured. Reinsurance
constitutes a large part of Lloyd’s business.
Lloyd’s has suffered severe losses, partly
caused by a series of natural disasters and also
as a result of claims arising from asbestosis and
pollution. The Council is taking action to
reconstruct the market. This includes a £3,200
million offer to names (which was accepted in
August 1996) and proposals to deal with past
debts and outstanding liquidation. Liabilities
relating to the losses from 1992 and earlier
years will be reinsured through a new
company, Equitas.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters,
formed in 1884 as a trade association for
marine underwriters, provides a market where
member insurance companies transact marine,
energy, commercial transport and aviation
business. It issues combined policies in its own
name on risks which are underwritten by
member companies. The gross premium
income processed by the Institute for its
member companies in 1995 was £1,868
million. About half of the 58 member
companies are branches or subsidiaries of
overseas companies.
Insurance Brokers
Insurance brokers acting on behalf of the
insured are a valuable part of the company
market and play an essential role in the Lloyd’s
market. Smaller brokers mainly deal with the
general public or specialise in a particular
type of commercial insurance. Medium to
large brokers almost exclusively handle
commercial insurance, with the largest
dealing with risks worldwide. Some brokers
specialise in reinsurance business. The
Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977
makes provision for the voluntary
registration and regulation of insurance
brokers by the Insurance Brokers
Registration Council. Only those registered
with the Council can use the title ‘insurance
broker’. There are about 14,600 individuals
registered with the Council, the majority of
whom are employed by about 2,450 limited
companies. Just over 2,000 individuals carry
on business in their own right, trading as sole
proprietor, or in partnership.
Other independent intermediaries may also
arrange insurance, but are not allowed to use
the title ‘insurance broker’. There are about
7,000 independent intermediaries operating
under the ABI’s code of practice.
INVESTMENT
Britain has a great deal of expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on the investor’s behalf, or advising investors
on how to invest their funds. The main types
of investment fund include pension schemes,
life assurance, unit trusts and investment
trusts.
Pension Funds
Over 11 million people belong to occupational
pension schemes and more than 5 million to
personal pension schemes. Most occupational
pension schemes pay benefits related to final
salary, although a growing number are on a
‘money purchase’ basis where benefits depend
on the size of the accrued funds. Benefits are
normally funded in advance by employer and
employee contributions, which are held and
invested by trustees on behalf of beneficiaries.
Pension funds are major investors in securities
markets, holding around 30 per cent of
securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Total British pension fund net
assets were worth about £500,000 million at
the end of 1995.
229
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Unit Trusts
Authorised unit trusts are open-ended
collective funds which pool investors’ money,
and funds are divided into units of equal size.
People with relatively small amounts to invest
are able to benefit from diversified and expertly
managed portfolios. The industry has grown
rapidly during the last decade, and in 1996
there were over 1,660 authorised unit trusts.
By June 1996 total funds under management
were £126,000 million. Some are general
funds, investing in a wide variety of British or
international securities, while there are also
many specialist trusts. Unit trust management
groups are represented by the Association of
Unit Trusts and Investment Funds and
regulated by the PIA and IMRO. The trusts
themselves are authorised by the SIB.
Open-ended Investment Companies
From early 1997 a new type of scheme—
open-ended investment companies
(OEICs)—will be available. OEICs will be
similar to unit trusts, but an investor in an
OEIC will buy shares rather than units in the
company. The new schemes should enable
British companies to compete on an equal
footing with similar schemes operating
elsewhere in the EU.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies, which also offer
the opportunity to diversify risk on a
relatively small lump-sum investment or
through regular savings, are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares are
traded in the usual way. They must invest
mostly in securities, and the trusts
themselves are exempt from tax on gains
realised within the funds. Assets are
purchased mainly out of shareholders’ funds,
although investment trusts are also allowed
to borrow money for investment. There were
320 members of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies in June 1996,
with £56,000 million worth of assets under
management. The three largest trusts are the
venture capital company 3i Group, Foreign
and Colonial, and Alliance.
Growth in Share Ownership
Privatisation (see p. 207) and employee share
schemes (see p. 196) have both helped to
increase share ownership, in line with the
Government’s policy of encouraging wider
share ownership. About 10 million adults—22
per cent of the adult population in Great
Britain—hold shares.
The value of shares in Britain’s listed
companies in 1994 was £762,000
million, of which shares held by
individuals accounted for £155,000
million (20 per cent). Financial
institutions held £446,000 million (59
per cent), of which pension funds
accounted for £212,000 million. Most
of the remaining shares were in the
hands of overseas investors.
Another major stimulus to raising share
ownership by individuals has been the
introduction of Personal Equity Plans (PEPs),
which allow tax-free investment in shares,
including investment trust companies and in
unit trusts. In July 1995 PEPs were extended
to cover certain corporate bonds (except those
issued by financial services companies),
preference shares and ‘convertibles’ (bonds or
preference shares which can eventually be
converted into a company’s ordinary shares).
Up to £6,000 in a single tax year may be
invested in a general PEP and up to £3,000 in
a single company PEP. Dividends and capital
gains on assets held in a PEP are exempt from
income tax and capital gains tax, and
withdrawals from PEPs are normally tax
free.
Since their introduction in 1987, more than
£28,000 million had been invested in over 8
million PEPs by April 1996. In 1995-96, 1.5
million general PEPs and 220,000 single
company PEPs were opened.
SPECIAL FINANCING INSTITUTIONS
Several specialised institutions offer finance
and support to personal and corporate sector
borrowers. Among public sector agencies are
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
230
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Enterprise, the Welsh Development Agency,
the Industrial Development Board for
Northern Ireland (see pp. 216-217) and
ECGD (see p. 182). The main private sector
institutions are described below.
Finance and Leasing Companies
The Finance and Leasing Association
represents the interests of firms offering motor
finance, consumer credit, and business finance
and leasing. Its 158 full and associate members
undertook new business worth /32,000 million
in 1994.
Factoring Companies
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services allowing companies to obtain finance
in exchange for outstanding invoices due to
them. Factoring has developed as a major
financial service since the early 1960s. Member
companies of the Association of British Factors
and Discounters handled business worth
£30,400 million in 1995.
Venture Capital Companies
Venture capital companies offer medium- and
long-term equity financing for new and
developing businesses when such funds are not
readily available from traditional sources, such
as the London Stock Exchange or banks. The
British Venture Capital Association has 108
full members, which make up over 99 per cent
of the industry. A record amount—over
£2,500 million—was invested by these venture
capital firms in over 1,100 businesses in 1995.
To help encourage the availability of equity
and long-term finance for smaller ‘unlisted’
businesses, the Finance Act 1995 provided for
the establishment of venture capital trusts
(VCTs, see p. 204). By May 1996 the first 12
VCTs had raised over £160 million.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
The City of London’s financial markets
include the London Stock Exchange, the
foreign exchange market, the financial futures
and options market, eurobond and
eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s insurance
market (see p. 228), and bullion and
commodity markets. The securities markets
are supervised jointly by the Treasury, the
Bank of England, SIB and the London Stock
Exchange, among others.
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange plays a vital role
in maintaining London’s position as a major
financial centre. Its main administrative centre
is in London and there are regional offices in
Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and
Manchester. As a result of a set of legal
reforms implemented in 1986 and known as
‘Big Bang’, the Exchange has changed radically
over recent years. The most fundamental
change has been the move away from the
traditional market floor to screen-based
trading.
The Exchange provides a trading platform
for domestic equities with its automated price
information system, SEAC£, which
continuously updates share prices and can be
viewed on a wide range of information
systems. For trading in foreign equities,
London’s leading international equity market
is supported by the Exchange’s electronic price
quotation system, SEAQ_International.
About 2,600 British and overseas
companies, with a combined market
capitalisation of £3,370,000 million, are listed
on the Exchange. In 1995 turnover of British
and Irish equities reached £646,000 million,
while turnover of foreign equities amounted to
£791,000 million.
Changes now affecting the Stock Exchange
are among the most significant since ‘Big
Bang’. Among these is a new ‘order-driven’
system now being planned. Under this, share
transactions between buyers and sellers would
be dealt with directly by computer, rather than
being passed through market-making firms
under the current ‘quote-driven’ system. The
new system, with a public limit order book for
the top 100 stocks, is expected to begin
operating during 1997.
The London Stock Exchange’s new public
equity market, AIM, began operating in 1995,
mainly for small, newly established or
developing companies wishing to raise public
finance and to have their shares more widely
231
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
traded. By mid-1996 more than 150 companies
had raised over £120 million on the market.
Tradepoint, a computer-based, order-driven
share dealing system in competition with the
London Stock Exchange, also started
operation in 1995.
CREST, a new computerised
settlement system for shares and
other securities developed by a
project team from the Bank of
England, was inaugurated in July
1996. There will be a transitional
period, expected to last until April
1997, during which CREST will
gradually take on the settlement of
all securities traded in Britain.
Computerised settlement should
increase efficiency and lower the cost
by eliminating much of the
paperflow currently involved. It
should also assist in reducing
settlement risk. CREST is owned and
operated by CRESTCo, a private
sector consortium representing a
wide spread of City interests.
The gilt-edged market (see p. 171) allows
the Government to raise money by issuing loan
stock through the Bank of England. The
London Stock Exchange offers a secondary or
trading market where investors can buy or sell
gilts. Turnover in the market totalled
£1,576,000 million in 1995.
Money Markets
The London money markets comprise the
interbank deposit markets plus a range of other
instruments, usually short term in maturity.
Banks are the major participants in these
markets, and are supervised by the Bank of
England.
Euromarkets
Markets operate for currencies lent or
invested outside their domestic marketplace,
particularly as a means of financing
international trade and investment.
Transactions can thus be carried out in
eurodollars, eurodeutschemarks, euroyen and
so on. London is at the heart of the
euromarkets and houses most of the leading
international banks and securities firms.
Distinctions between markets have been
breaking down and euromarkets form a major
part of the wider international money and
capital markets. Participants include
multinational trading corporations, financial
companies, governments, and international
organisations like the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank.
The euro-securities markets have
grown considerably in recent years because
the instruments traded on them—
including eurobonds, euro-medium-term
notes (EMTNs) and euro-commercial
paper—are seen as flexible alternatives to
bank loans. British building societies are
prominent among EMTN issuers. There
is a growing private-sector market in
ECU-denominated deposits, securities and
eurobonds.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, accounting for
about 30 per cent of global net daily turnover
in foreign exchange. Average daily turnover
in London amounted to about £294,000
million in 1995, nearly 60 per cent higher
than in 1992.
The foreign exchange market consists of
telephone and electronic links between the
participants, which include banks, other
financial institutions and several foreign
exchange broking firms acting as
intermediaries. It provides those engaged in
international trade and investment with
foreign currencies for their transactions. The
banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying
and selling rates for both immediate (‘spot’)
and forward transactions in a range of
currencies and maturities. The forward
market enables traders and dealers who, at a
given date in the future, wish to receive or
make a specific foreign currency payment, to
contract in advance to sell or buy the foreign
currency involved for sterling at a fixed
exchange rate.
232
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Derivatives
Financial derivatives are contracts to buy or
sell, at a future date, financial instruments such
as equities, bonds or money-market
instruments. Their use has grown rapidly,
especially among companies and investment
institutions, and instruments have become
more complex, as advances have been made in
information technology. Derivatives offer a
means of protection against changes in prices,
exchange rates and interest rates. They
include:
• futures—agreements to buy or sell
financial instruments or physical
commodities at a future date;
• options—the right to buy or sell financial
instruments or physical commodities for a
stated period at a predetermined price;
and
• ‘over-the-counter’ products, including
swaps—a foreign exchange swap can
convert a money-market instrument in
one currency into a money-market
instrument in another.
Financial Futures and Options
Banks, other financial institutions, brokers and
individual traders are members of the London
International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange (LIFFE). Futures contracts cover
the purchase or sale of a fixed amount of a
commodity or financial instrument at a given
date in the future at a price agreed at the time
of trade. There is also dealing in options on the
equity of prominent British companies and in
stock index options. LIFFE has the most
internationally diverse range of financial
futures and options products of any exchange
in the world. Its turnover totalled nearly 133
million contracts in 1995, making it the world’s
third largest futures and options exchange. In
1995 LIFFE announced links with exchanges
in Chicago and Tokyo, and also a merger with
the London Commodity Exchange, which took
place in September 1996. At the London
Commodity Exchange, futures in grains and
potatoes are traded, as are futures and options
on ‘soft’ commodities (cocoa and coffee).
White sugar, raw sugar and dry freight index
futures contracts are also traded.
London Bullion Market
Around 60 banks and other financial trading
companies participate in the London gold
and silver markets, which, like the foreign
exchange market, trade by telephone or other
electronic means. Members of the London
Bullion Market Association meet twice daily
to establish a London fixing price for gold—a
reference point for worldwide dealings. The
silver fixing is held once a day. Although
much interest centres upon the fixings, active
dealing takes place throughout the day.
London is the hub of the international
bullion market.
Commodity, Shipping and Freight
Markets
Britain is a major international centre for
commodities trading and the home of many
related international trade organisations. The
London Metal Exchange is the primary base
metals market in the world, trading both spot
and forward contracts in aluminium,
aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin and
zinc. The International Petroleum Exchange is
Europe’s only energy futures exchange. The
Baltic Exchange, which finds ships for cargoes
and cargoes for ships throughout the world, is
the world’s leading international shipping
market.
Other Services
DISTRIBUTION AND SALES
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale by road, rail, air
and sea is a major economic activity. The large
retailers and wholesalers of food and drink and
clothing operate, either directly or through
contractors, extensive distribution networks.
Wholesaling
In 1994 there were 118,000 businesses, with a
workforce of 800,000 and a turnover of
£297,000 million (see Table 15.1), engaged in
wholesaling and dealing in Great Britain.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Elsewhere in the trade,

voluntary ‘symbol’ groups (for example, Spar
and VG) have been formed by wholesalers and
small independent retailers. This has helped
many smaller retail outlets, including
traditional ‘corner shops’ and village stores,
to stay in business, as it has given them the
benefits of bulk buying and co-ordinated
distribution.
London’s wholesale markets play a
significant part in the distribution of
foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main
market for fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for
meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society
(CWS) is the principal supplier of goods and
services to the Co-operative Movement and
was a founder member of the Co-operative
Retail Trading Group. Formed in 1993 to act
as a central marketing, buying and distribution
partnership for retail co-operative societies, the
Group now accounts for 65 per cent of Co-op
food trade. The CWS is also the largest
co-operative retailer in Europe, with 660 stores
located in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the east
and south Midlands, and south-east and
northern England.
Retailing
In 1994 there were 197,000 retail businesses,
with 290,000 outlets, employing 2.4 million
people in Great Britain (see Table 15.2). These
range from national supermarket chains to
corner grocery shops and newsagents. During
recent years the large multiple retailers have
grown considerably, tending to reduce
numbers of stores but increase outlet size and
diversify product ranges. Some, like Marks &
Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco, have
acquired retailers or made franchise
arrangements abroad. Small independent
businesses and retail co-operative societies
have declined markedly. The number of
grocery outlets, for instance, has fallen from
67,000 in the 1970s to the present-day total of
40,000. Sunday trading laws have been relaxed
to allow retailers to open for limited periods on
Sundays; smaller retailers are permitted to
open for longer hours than the larger
supermarkets and department stores in order
to help their competitive position.
The biggest supermarket groups are Tesco,
J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Asda, all of which
are among the ten largest food retailers in
Europe. These four have a market share of
around 40 per cent of all food and drink sold.
Other important retailers are Marks &
Spencer, Somerfield and Kwik Save—the
latter is the leading discount food retailer in
Britain. Since the early 1990s several overseas
discount food retailers, such as Aldi of
Germany and Denmark’s Netto, have entered
the British market.

Retail co-operative societies are voluntary
organisations controlled by their members,
membership being open to anyone paying a
small deposit on a minimum share. Of the
5,000 retail co-operative outlets, over half sell
food and groceries.
Alcoholic drinks are sold mainly in
specialist ‘off licences’ and supermarkets,
which have roughly equal sales. The principal
off-licence chains are Cellar Five, Oddbins,
Threshers and Victoria Wine.
The leading mixed retail businesses include
Marks & Spencer, Boots, Woolworth (part of
Kingfisher), Storehouse, W. H. Smith, Argos,
Littlewoods, Savacentre (J. Sainsbury), John
Menzies, Sears, Burton Group and House of
Fraser.
Several chains of DIY (Do-It-Yourself)
superstores cater for people wishing to carry
out their own repairs and improvements on
their homes and gardens; they stock a large
range of tools, decorating and building
materials, kitchen and bathroom fittings,
garden products and so on. The three biggest
are B&Q, Texas and Do It All, which together
have around 650 outlets.
About 18 million people regularly buy all
kinds of goods and services through mail order
catalogues like Freemans, Great Universal
Stores, Empire and Littlewoods. In 1994 sales
by general mail order totalled £6,000 million.
The largest selling items are clothing,
footwear, furniture, household textiles and
domestic electrical appliances.
Shopping Facilities
Britain has a wide range of complementary
shopping facilities inside and outside town and
city centres. Government policy is to
encourage a balanced mixture of facilities that
will satisfy the needs of all consumers, whether
they have access to a car or not, and enable
businesses of all sizes and types to prosper.
One of the most significant trends in
retailing has been the spread of superstores,
many of which have been built away from
urban centres in recent years. The
supermarket groups have around 1,000
superstores between them. While the 100
largest retailers account for about three-fifths
of retail sales, there continues to be a demand
235
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the products and services provided by
small, specialised shops. Encouraged by the
Government, the main multiple grocery
companies are turning their attention back to
town centres, redeveloping existing stores and
building smaller outlets. Examples include
Tesco’s ‘Metro’ format and J. Sainsbury’s
‘Capital’ stores.
Regional out-of-town shopping centres
have been established on sites offering good
access and parking facilities. One of the first
was the Metro Centre at Gateshead, which is
the largest of its kind in Europe. Other centres
include Merry Hill at Dudley in the West
Midlands, Meadowhall in Sheffield and the
Lakeside Centre at Thurrock in Essex. About
one-half of total food sales are accounted for by
superstores away from town centres, compared
with a fifth at the beginning of the 1980s.
Retailers of non-food goods, such as DIY
products, toys, furniture and electrical
appliances, sportswear, and office and
computer products, have also built outlets
away from urban centres. There is a strong
trend towards grouping retail warehouses into
retail parks, often with food and other
facilities.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local
government planning authority. These
authorities must consult central government
before granting permission for developments
of 20,000 sq m (215,000 sq ft) or more. The
Government’s policy is to encourage the
provision of a broad range of shopping
facilities to the public. At the same time, it
seeks to ensure that the effects of major new
retail developments, especially those outside
urban centres, do not undermine the viability
of existing town centres. It is intensifying
efforts to help revitalise shopping and other
facilities in town centres where this is needed.
Other Trends
Many of the large multiple groups sell a much
greater number of goods and services than
previously. For example, large food retailers
are increasing their range of foods. Increased
emphasis is also being placed on selling
own-label goods (which now account for up to
one-half of goods on sale) and environmentally
friendly products, including organic produce.
Most superstores and supermarkets offer fresh
food, such as meat, fish, vegetables and, in
many cases, bread baked on the premises, as
well as packaged foods. In-store pharmacies
and dry-cleaners are now a feature of many
large supermarkets, which have in recent years
also begun selling books, magazines,
newspapers and pre-recorded video cassettes.
The major supermarket chains have their own
petrol stations at some of their bigger outlets
(see p. 237).
‘Stores within stores’ are becoming more
common; for example, sportswear and sports
goods retailers are to be found in many of the
big mixed retail stores, while Laura Ashley,
the furnishings and fabrics retailer, has
facilities in Homebase (a DIY chain owned by
J. Sainsbury).
Several large retailers have issued their own
credit cards for regular customers in an
attempt to encourage sales, particularly of
high-value goods. ‘Loyalty’ cards have also
been introduced by some supermarket groups,
offering regular customers cash discounts
related to the size of their purchases. Marks &
Spencer offers financial services.
Franchising
About 470 franchisors operate in Britain, with
26,000 outlets and yearly sales of nearly £6,000
million. Franchising is a business in which a
company owning the rights to a particular
form of trading licenses them to franchisees,
usually by means of an initial payment with
continuing royalties. The main areas are
cleaning services, film processing, print shops,
hairdressing and cosmetics, fitness centres,
courier delivery, car rental, engine tuning and
servicing, and fast food retailing. Familiar high
street names include McDonalds, Body Shop
(environmentally friendly cosmetics and other
products) and Kail Kwik (fast printing).
Information Technology
Information technology is central to
distribution and retailing. Computers monitor
stock levels and record sales figures through
electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) systems.
EPOS systems read a bar-code printed on the
236
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
retail product that holds price and product
information and can be used to generate
orders for stock replenishment as well as
totalling up bills and providing a receipt for
customers.
Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which produce arrives at the
store at the last possible moment before sale,
have become widespread as a result. Most
large retailers have set up electronic data
interchange (EDI) systems; these enable their
computers to communicate with those of
their suppliers, and transmit orders and
invoices electronically, so reducing errors
and saving time.
EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point
of sale) systems enable customers to pay for
purchases using debit cards which
automatically transfer funds from their bank
account. Several major EFTPOS schemes are
in operation and the number of terminals is
growing rapidly.
‘Superscan’ technology—which involves
customers using an electronic scanning device
to work out their own bills, thus avoiding the
need to queue at a check-out—is undergoing
trials in a number of supermarkets. Electronic
home shopping, using a television and
telephone, and ‘online’ shopping, where
personal computers are linked to databases, are
also starting to be introduced.
Vchicle, Vehicle Parts and Petrol Retailing
In 1996 over 300,000 people were employed in
Great Britain in retailing motor vehicles and
parts, and in petrol stations. Many businesses
selling new vehicles are franchised by the
motor manufacturers. Drive-in fitting centres
sell tyres, exhaust systems, batteries, clutches
and other vehicle parts; the largest chains
include Kwik-Fit and ATS.
Over one-third of petrol stations are owned
by oil companies. The three companies with
the largest number of outlets are Shell, Esso
and BP. Unleaded petrol accounts for more
than half of petrol sold. The majority of petrol
stations are self-service.
The number of petrol stations has been
reduced by about a half in the last decade or so
as owners focus on larger sites that can
accommodate the broad range of retail
services, including food, that are now
commonly available at petrol stations. About
one-fifth of petrol sold in Britain comes from
supermarket forecourts.
Rental Services
A broad range of rental services, many
franchised, are on offer throughout Britain (see
p. 236). These include hire of cars and other
vehicles, televisions and video cassette
recorders, household appliances such as
washing machines and tumble dryers, tools
and heavy decorating equipment (ladders, floor
sanders and so on) and video films and
computer games. Retailing of many types of
service is dominated by chains, though
independent operators are still to be found in
most fields.
Auction Houses
Britain attracts buyers and sellers from around
the world and has a long tradition of expertise
and innovation in auctioneering. Its chief
auction houses are active in the international
auction markets for works of art, trading on
their acknowledged expertise. The two largest
houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, are
established worldwide. The former handled
sales valued at £1,050 million in 1995, while
Christie’s sales amounted to £931 million.
Phillips and Bonhams are also prominent
auctioneers.
HOTELS, HOLIDAY CENTRES,
PUBLIC HOUSES AND CATERING
The hotel and catering trades, which include
public houses (pubs) and licensed bars, employ
1.3 million people in Britain, including:
• 289,200 in hotels;
• 327,000 in pubs and bars;
• 295,500 in restaurants;
• 138,300 in clubs; and
• 115,700 in contract catering.
Around 165,000 self-employed people also
work in these sectors.
There are 52,000 hotels in Great Britain.
The largest hotel business is Forte Hotels Ltd,
237
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
now owned by Granada Group pic, with 260
hotels in Britain and overseas. At the other end
of the scale, numerous guest houses and hotels
(many individually owned) have fewer than 20
rooms. Holiday centres, including holiday
camps with full board, self-catering centres
and caravan parks, are run by Butlins, Holiday
Club, Center Parcs, Warner Holidays and
Pontin’s.
Britain’s 100,000 restaurants offer cuisine
from virtually every country in the world.
Chinese, Indian, Italian and Greek
restaurants are among the most popular.
‘Fast food’ restaurants, an area where
franchising plays a significant role, are
widespread. They specialise in selling
hamburgers, chicken, pizza and a variety of
other foods to be eaten on the premises or
taken away. The most well-known chains
include McDonalds (hamburgers), Burger
King (hamburgers), KFC (chicken) and
Pizza Hut. Traditional fish and chip shops
are the other main providers of cooked
take-away food. Sandwich bars are common
in towns and cities, typically in areas with
high concentrations of office workers.
About 77,100 pubs sell beer, wines, soft
drinks and spirits to adults for consumption on
the premises, and most also serve hot and cold
food. Many pubs are owned by the large
brewing companies, which either provide
managers to run them or offer tenancy
agreements; these pubs tend to sell just their
own brands of beer, although some also offer
‘guest’ beers. Others, called ‘free houses’, are
independently owned and managed and
frequently serve a variety of beers. Wine
bars are normally smaller than pubs and tend
to specialise in wine and food; they more
closely resemble bars in other parts of Europe.
Pubs and bars are permitted by law to open
from 11.00 to 23.00 from Monday to Saturday
(on Sunday they may open between 12.00 and
22.30). The introduction of liquor licences for
‘cafe-style’ premises allows children under 14
to accompany adults to selected places where
alcoholic drinks are served.
TOURISM, TRAVEL AND LEISURE
In the region of 1.7 million people are
employed in tourism and related activities; of
these, 188,000 are self-employed. About 8 per
cent of small businesses are engaged in
tourism. The industry contributed £37,000
million to the economy in 1995—5 per cent of
GDP. Britain is the world’s fifth largest tourist
destination in the world in terms of earnings
from visitors. Although its share of world
tourism earnings fell from 6 to 4.4 per cent in
the ten years to 1994, this rose again to 5 per
cent in 1995.
Britain’s tourist attractions include theatres,
museums, art galleries, and historic houses, as
well as shopping, sports and business facilities.
Domestic and foreign tourists play an ever
more important role in supporting Britain’s
national heritage, creative arts and, to a lesser
extent, sport.
The number of‘theme parks’ has
grown steadily in recent years and
they now attract more than 15
million visitors a year. Alton
Towers (Staffordshire), Chessington
World of Adventures and Thorpe
Park (both in Surrey) are three of
the biggest; 2.7 million people visit
Alton Towers annually, the largest
number of visitors for any paid-for
tourist attraction (see Table 2.3,
p. 10). As well as spectacular
‘white knuckle’ rides and attractions
and overhead cable cars and
railways, some parks also feature
displays of domesticated and wild
animals.
Domestic tourism was worth around
£12,800 million in 1995 (see p. 44). Of
British residents opting to take their main
holiday in Britain, around 40 per cent choose
a traditional seaside destination, such as
Blackpool (Lancashire), Bournemouth
(Dorset), Great Yarmouth (Norfolk) and
Torquay and other resorts in Devon and
Cornwall. Short holiday breaks (one to three
nights), valued at £2,500 million in 1995,
make up an increasingly significant part of
the market. Shopping accounts for about a
fifth of all expenditure on day trips. Scotland
has several skiing resorts.
238
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
The number of overseas visitors
coming to Britain has more than
doubled in the last 20 years. In 1995 a
record 23.7 million—13 per cent more
than in 1994—spent £11,885 million.
An estimated 63 per cent were from
Western Europe and 16 per cent from
North America, with the United
States supplying the largest number
of any single country. Business travel
accounts for £3,242 million, 27 per
cent of all overseas tourism revenue.
Most British holiday-makers wishing to go
overseas buy ‘package holidays’ from travel
agencies, where the cost covers both transport
and accommodation. The most popular
package holiday destinations are Spain, France
and Greece. Long-haul holidays to places like
the United States, the Caribbean and Australia
have become popular as air fares have come
down. Winter skiing holidays to resorts in
Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland and
other countries inside and outside Europe
continue to attract large numbers of Britons.
Britain has around 7,000 travel agencies,
nearly all of which belong to the Association of
British Travel Agents (ABTA). Although most
are small businesses, a few large firms, such as
Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook, have hundreds
of branches. Some 620 tour operators are
members of ABTA; about half are both retail
agents and tour operators. ABTA operates
financial protection schemes to safeguard its
members’ customers and maintains codes of
conduct drawn up with the Office of Fair
Trading, a government department. It also
offers a free consumer affairs service to help
resolve complaints against members and a
low-cost independent arbitration scheme for
members’ customers.
Tourism Promotion
The Department of National Heritage is
responsible for tourism in England, and the
Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland Offices
have responsibility for tourism in their
respective countries. The government-
supported British Tourist Authority (BTA)
promotes Britain overseas as a tourist
destination through 42 offices worldwide and
encourages the development of tourist facilities
in Britain to meet the needs of overseas
visitors. The tourist boards for England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which
also receive government finance, encourage the
development and promotion of domestic
tourism and work with the BTA to promote
Britain overseas.
In 1995 the Government published plans to
develop Britain’s tourism industry by:
• raising standards of hotel and other
accommodation;
• improving overseas marketing of Britain
as a tourist destination;
• promoting London more effectively; and
• making holiday booking arrangements
easier.
The BTA and the national tourist boards
inform and advise the Government on issues of
concern to the industry. They also help
businesses and other organisations to plan by
researching and publicising trends affecting
the industry. The national tourist boards work
closely with regional tourist boards, on which
local government and business interests are
represented. The national tourist boards offer
financial assistance to the industry. There are
over 800 local Tourist Information Centres in
Britain.
Accommodation classification and quality
grading schemes are operated by the national
tourist boards, including the Crown scheme
for hotels, guest houses, inns, bed and
breakfast and farmhouse holiday
accommodation. A new Lodge category has
been introduced for purpose-built
accommodation alongside motorways and
major roads. Common standards are applied
throughout Britain, and all participating
establishments are inspected every year.
BUSINESS SERVICES
Exhibition and Conference Centres
Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences—the
others being the United States and France.
239
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London and Paris are the two most popular
conference cities. A large number of other
towns and cities in Britain have facilities for
conferences and exhibitions. Total spending in
1994 on conferences, exhibitions and incentive
travel amounted to £604 million.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham; the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in London;
and Cardiff International Arena, a 5,000-seat
multi-purpose facility. Others are located in
Brighton (East Sussex), Harrogate (North
Yorkshire), Bournemouth (Dorset),
Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham and
Torquay (Devon). In Scotland both Glasgow
and Aberdeen have exhibition and conference
centres, and a new International Conference
Centre was opened in Edinburgh in September
1995.
Other large exhibition facilities are situated
in London at the Barbican, Earls Court,
Alexandra Palace and Wembley Arena. An
exhibition and conference facility is planned
for London Docklands, to be completed in
1998 at an estimated cost of £100 million. The
£29 million Belfast Waterfront Hall is due to
be opened in 1997.
Many of the larger sites belong to a
marketing group, Conventions Great Britain.
Advertising, Sponsorship and Public
Relations
Britain is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational corporations
often use advertising created in Britain for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
Spending on advertising in 1995 amounted
to £10,959 million, a rise of 4.5 per cent in real
terms on the previous year. The press
accounted for 55 per cent of the total,
television for 28 per cent, direct mail for 10 per
cent, and posters, transport, commercial radio
and cinema for the rest. The largest
advertising expenditure is on food, household
durables, cosmetics, office equipment, motor
vehicles and financial services. Among the
biggest spenders in 1996 are BT, Ford,
Dixons, McDonalds, Tesco, J. Sainsbury and
the National Lottery (see p. 42). British
television advertising receives many
international awards.
Campaigns are planned by around 2,000
advertising agencies. In addition to their
creative, production and media buying roles,
some agencies offer integrated marketing
services, such as consumer research and public
relations. Leading agencies include Abbott
Mead Vickers BBDO, J Walter Thompson,
Leo Burnett, and Ogilvy and Mather
Advertising.
Government advertising campaigns—crime
prevention, health promotion, road safety and
so on—are often organised by the Central
Office of Information, an executive agency of
the Government (see p. 545), which is able to
secure large discounts because of its centralised
buying power.
Many advertising agencies have
sponsorship departments, which arrange for
businesses to sponsor products and events,
including artistic, sporting and charitable
events. In return for financial or other support,
the sponsoring company is associated with a
worthy product or event, thereby raising its
profile with consumers.
Britain’s public relations industry has
grown rapidly over the past ten years and is
now the most developed in Europe. In 1994 it
had an estimated turnover of £1,000 million.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
software houses; production of packaged
software; consultancy; information technology
‘outsourcing’; processing services; and the
provision of complete computer systems. It
also includes companies that provide
information technology education and training;
independent maintenance; support,
contingency planning and recruitment; and
contract staff.
The turnover of companies in the
Computing Services & Software Association,
which represents about 75 per cent of the
industry in Britain, totalled £7,000 million in
1995. Important areas for software
development include data and word
processing, telecommunications, computer-
240
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
aided design and manufacturing, defence and
consumer electronics.
Management Consultancy
Management consultants provide advice and
technical assistance to business and
government clients. Typically, consultants
identify and investigate problems and
opportunities, recommend appropriate action
and help to implement recommendations.
Many British-based consultancies operate
internationally; the most recent trend has
been for the largest firms to set up offices in
Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim. The 30
member firms of the Management
Consultancies Association are among the
largest in the industry and account for more
than half of management consultancy work.
They range from Andersen Consulting and
CMG Management, with a strong technical
bias, to Coopers & Lybrand and PA
Consulting group, which specialise in
market/industry sectors. In 1995 member
firms earned over £1,000 million in Britain
and nearly £200 million overseas.
Market Research
The market research profession in Britain has
developed markedly in the past decade and
now accounts for 9 per cent of worldwide
market research spending. It has a wide range
of domestic and overseas clients, including
government bodies. The Association of Market
Survey Organisations is the main trade
organisation, with 33 member companies. In
1995 its members earned £380 million out of
an estimated total market research industry
turnover of over £600 million.

16 Manufacturing and
Construction Industries
Introduction 242 Construction 256
Sectors of Manufacturing 242
Britain became the world’s first industrialised country in the mid-19th century.
Wealth was based on manufacturing iron and steel, heavy machinery and cotton
textiles, and on coal mining, shipbuilding and trade. Manufacturing still plays
an important role and Britain excels in high-technology industries such as
pharmaceuticals, electronics (including computers), aerospace and offshore
equipment, where British companies are among the world’s largest and most
successful. The British construction industry has made its mark around the
world and continues to be involved in some of the most prestigious
international building projects.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for about a sixth of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 and for
about the same proportion of employment.
More than four-fifths of visible exports
consisted of manufactured or semi¬
manufactured goods. Almost all manufacturing
is carried out by private sector businesses.
Around one-fifth of manufacturing jobs are
provided by overseas companies.
Following the recession in the early 1990s,
which led to a decline in manufacturing
output, output rose by 4.2 per cent in 1994 and
by 2.2 per cent in 1995 (see Table 16.2).
Employment in manufacturing in 1995 was 4
million compared with 5 million in 1985. Total
capital investment in manufacturing rose by
nearly 13 per cent in 1995 to £15,237 million,
comprising £12,824 million in plant and
machinery, £1,610 million in new building
work and £803 million in vehicles.
The construction industry contributed 5
per cent of GDP and about 1.8 million people
worked in the industry in 1995, 7 per cent
of the total number of employees and
self-employed. Following a period of
marked decline as recession affected the
industry in the early 1990s, output has
remained below the 1990 level. Total
domestic fixed capital investment was
£770 million in 1995.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of enterprises and the main
sectors are shown in Tables 16.1 and 16.2.
Table 16.3 indicates output and investment. A
more detailed description of some of the main
sectors is given below.
Mineral and Metal Products
British producers delivered 16 million tonnes
of finished steel in 1995, of which just under
50 per cent was exported. Over the past ten
years annual steel industry exports have

tonnes, creating a favourable balance of trade
in steel products (£2,700 million in 1995).
The major areas of steel production are in
south Wales and northern England, with
substantial further processing in the Midlands.
Major restructuring in the steel industry took
place during the 1980s and early 1990s.
Productivity and efficiency have improved and
the industry is now one of the lowest-cost
producers in Europe.
British Steel is the fourth largest steel
company in the world, employing 41,000
people and producing about three-quarters of
Britain’s crude steel in 1995. The company’s
output is based on flat steel products, plate,
heavy sections and tubes. These are used
principally in the construction, automotive,

engineering, transport, metal goods, packaging
and energy industries. British Steel owns UES
-Holdings, Europe’s biggest producer of
engineering steels—these are specialist grades
used to make products such as forgings for the
automotive and aerospace industries.
Other important steel producers in Britain
include Caparo, Allied Steel and Wire,
Co-Steel Sheerness, the Glynwed Group and
the stainless steel producer Avesta Sheffield.
Products manufactured by these companies
include reinforcing bars for the construction
industry, wire rod, hot rolled and cold finished
bars and other special steels for the aerospace
and offshore oil and gas industries.
Output of non-ferrous metals and their
alloys includes primary and secondary
(recycled) aluminium and copper, as well as
aluminium and copper and copper alloy
semi-manufactures. The production of metal
relies mainly on imported ores and recycled
material of both domestic and overseas origin.
Copper and copper alloy semi-manufactures
are used in a wide variety of electrical
switchgear, wire and cable, tube and fittings
for plumbing, and valves and components for
the engineering and transport industries.
Britain is a major producer of specialised
alloys for high-technology requirements in the
aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and
nuclear and other fuel industries. Titanium
and titanium alloys, which are light, strong and
flexible, are used in aircraft manufacturing,
power generation and North Sea oil
production. Nickel alloys are utilised in
aero-engines for high-temperature
environments. In recent years considerable
progress has been made in producing
‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile
and elastic than conventional alloys. »
Aluminium alloys, including aluminium
lithium (developed by British Alcan
Aluminium), are ideal for use in aircraft, being
lighter, stronger and more rigid than normal
aluminium. Aluminium alloys typically make
up three-quarters of an airframe.
Ceramics
The ceramics industry manufactures clay
products, such as domestic pottery,
sanitaryware and tiles, and clay pipes for the
building trade. Domestic tableware production
includes fine china, earthenware and
244
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
stoneware. Tableware is produced
predominately in Stoke-on-Trent. Britain is
the world’s leading manufacturer and exporter
of fine bone china; Waterford Wedgwood,
Spode and Royal Doulton are among the more
famous names.
Research is being conducted into ceramics
for use in house building and diesel and jet
engines. Important industrial ceramics
invented in Britain include some forms of
silicon carbide and sialons, which can
withstand ultra-high temperatures.
Glass Products
Flat glass is manufactured through the float
glass process, which was developed by
Pilkington Brothers and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkington
has also produced an energy-saving window
glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility and an automotive glass
that prevents car interiors overheating and
being damaged by heat and sunlight. United
Glass is a leading manufacturer of bottles and
other glass containers. Glass-reinforced
cement composites for the construction
industry were invented in Britain in the early
1970s and are made under licence in over 40
countries.
China Clay
Britain is the world’s second biggest exporter
of china clay (kaolin), four-fifths of which is
used in paper-making. In 1995, 2.2 million
tonnes were sold overseas. The main company
is ECC International Europe, part of the
English China Clays Group.
Chemicals and Related Products
Pharmaceuticals and basic industrial chemicals
are the two biggest sectors of the chemical
industry, which is the third largest in Europe.
Its products underpin almost all other
industrial processes and products. The
industry is at the forefront of modern
technology, spending over 7 per cent of total
sales on research and development (R & D). It
provides direct employment for about 326,000
people. Over half of its output is exported,
making it British manufacturing’s greatest
single export earner. Exports in 1995 were
worth £21,300 million, while imports (mainly
consisting of plastics and organic chemicals)
were valued at £17,300 million.
Many major chemical companies in Britain
are multinationals; several are subsidiaries of
overseas companies and others are specialist
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, such as
Glaxo Wellcome (see p. 246). Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI), the sixth largest
chemical company in the world, manufactures
industrial chemicals, paints, materials and
explosives. Zeneca produces pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and seeds, and specialty
chemicals (see below). Teesside, which has
been particularly successful in attracting
investment from some of the largest domestic
and overseas chemical firms, now rivals
Rotterdam as Europe’s largest petrochemicals
zone.
Traditionally, Britain has been a major
producer of basic industrial chemicals, such as
basic organic and inorganic chemicals, plastics
and fertilisers, which together comprise
around two-fifths of output. The most rapid
growth in recent years has been in
pharmaceuticals.
Sales of basic organic chemicals amounted
to £4,600 million and those of other basic
industrial chemicals to £8,000 million in 1994.
The most important bulk products are
ethylene, propylene and benzene. Britain is the
world’s fourth biggest producer of specialised
organic chemicals, with over 7.5 per cent of the
world market.
Much inorganic chemical production
consists of relatively simple bulk chemicals,
such as sulphuric acid and metallic and
non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials
for industry. Specialty chemicals include
pharmaceutical ingredients, essential oils and
flavourings, adhesives and sealants, and
explosives, including those used for car safety
airbags. Investment in environmentally safe
products and processes, for example
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), is
increasing.
A sizeable proportion of world R & D in
agrochemicals is conducted in Britain. Notable
British discoveries include diquat and paraquat
245
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
herbicides, pyrethroid insecticides, systemic
fungicides and aphicides, genetically
engineered microbial pesticides and methods
of encouraging natural parasites to eradicate
common pests in horticulture.
Exports of soap and detergent preparations
in 1995 were valued at £570 million. This
sector is dominated by Lever Brothers (part of
Unilever) and the US-owned Procter and
Gamble.
Plastics
Around 230,000 people are employed by over
4,500 firms involved in the plastics industry.
Of this, plastic processing—the conversion of
plastics materials into finished or sub-
assemblies of final products—accounts for
170,000 people and about 400 firms. Total
turnover of the industry was £18,000 million
in 1995; exports reached £3,500 million that
year. Production includes packaging and
building, electrical, automotive, houseware and
clothing products. Britain’s plastic processing
industry continues to be a world leader in
material specification and design with new
processes allowing stronger plastics to replace
other materials or spread into new
applications.
Paints
Sales of paint, varnishes and painters’ fillings
were worth £2,700 million in 1994. ICI is the
world’s largest paint manufacturer. Among its
specialised products are new ranges of
synthetic resins and pigments, powder
coatings, non-drip and quick-drying paints
and paints needing only one top coat. Its
best-known consumer product is the ‘Dulux’
paint range. Two of the more significant
innovations have been solid emulsion paint and
a temporary water-based finish which can be
removed easily by chemical treatment, for
vehicle bodies and road markings.
Pharmaceuticals
The British pharmaceutical industry is the
world’s third biggest exporter of medicines,
accounting for around 11 per cent of the world
market. About 300 pharmaceutical
manufacturers and research organisations
operate in Britain, including several
multinational corporations. The British-owned
group Glaxo Wellcome became the largest
pharmaceutical company in the world when
Glaxo took over Wellcome in 1995. Zeneca is
the world’s second biggest manufacturer of
cancer therapies. There are also many
medium-sized and smaller specialist
companies. Total sales in 1995 were around
£10,000 million, of which £4,900 million was
accounted for by overseas sales. The main
overseas markets are Western Europe and
North America, with Japan an expanding
market.
Some 75,000 people work in the industry,
of whom more than a quarter are engaged in
R & D. The industry, which is largely based in
the South East and East Anglia, invested
£2,000 million in R & D in 1995. This sum
amounts to one-fifth of British industry’s
R & D and represents about a tenth of total
world expenditure on pharmaceuticals R & D.
Progress in devising vaccines has helped to
reduce dramatically the impact of infectious
diseases such as polio, whooping cough,
mumps and measles.
British firms discovered and developed five
of the world’s 20 best-selling medicines,
including Glaxo Wellcome’s ulcer treatment
Zantac, the best-selling medicine in the world,
and Zeneca’s beta-blocker Tenormin, for
treating high blood pressure. Among Zeneca’s
newer products are Zestril (for combating high
blood pressure), Zoladex (a prostate cancer
therapy) and Diprivan (an anaesthetic).
Other major developments pioneered in
Britain are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for asthma, arthritis, migraine
and coronary heart disease. The world’s ninth
largest pharmaceutical company, SmithKline
Beecham, manufactures four of the world’s
top-selling antibiotics; it also developed
Augmentin, used to treat a range of infections
that have become resistant to antibiotics. Glaxo
Wellcome’s drug zidovudine (AZT) is one of
the most widely used anti-viral agents for the
treatment of HIV infection. Zofran, an
anti-nausea drug for countering the unpleasant
side-effects of cancer treatments also produced
246
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
by Glaxo Wellcome, is one of the company’s
most successful new medicines.
British companies lead in the development
of molecular graphics. These contribute to the
rational design of new and improved medicines
through a computer-aided technique for
analysing the structures of complicated organic
molecules.
A growing trend is the production of
generic medicines. These are versions of
branded medicines whose patents have
expired. They are mostly unbranded and
cheaper than the branded originals. About 50
per cent of doctors’ prescriptions in Britain are
for generic medicines.
Biotechnology
The Government estimates that world markets
for biotechnology products could exceed
£70,000 million by the year 2000. The British
biotechnology industry is second only in
pre-eminence to that of the United States. As
well as Zeneca, Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham, around 30 smaller
independent firms, including British Biotech,
Celltech, Xenova and Cantab, contribute to
the sector.
Biotechnology has improved the specificity
of pharmaceuticals through greater
understanding of disease at the molecular
level. It has enabled companies to manufacture
products using genetic modification. British
Biotech is developing a potentially important
anti-cancer drug, Marimastat, which can be
taken orally and is claimed to have few serious
adverse side-effects. Among other major
advances in the development of drugs are
human insulin and interferons, genetically
engineered vaccines, antibiotics produced by
fermentation, and alternative bactericidal
drugs based on Nisin, a food preservative
made in Britain. Agricultural products include
infection-resistant crops. Medical diagnostic
devices are another strong sector and the
industry produces the world’s best-selling
biosensor.
A second generation of vaccines based on
recombinant DNA technology includes
SmithKline Beecham’s Engerix-B vaccine
against hepatitis. Therapies based on
correcting the function of defective genes are
under development. Diseases being targeted
include those where a single defective gene
needs correcting, such as in cystic fibrosis, and
those where there are genetic and environmental
components, like cardiovascular disease.
Specialist products of Britain’s small and
medium-sized biotechnology firms comprise,
among other items, medical diagnostics and
microbial pesticides. Celltech was the first
company licensed by the United States
Government for the large-scale production of
monoclonal antibodies, proteins which can
seek out a particular substance in the body.
They are used to diagnose diseases, identify
different blood types and can be employed in
the treatment of a range of conditions,
including cancer.
Fibres
The main types of synthetic fibre are still those
first developed in the 1940s: regenerated
cellulosic fibres such as viscose, and the major
synthetic fibres like nylon polyamide, polyester
and acrylics. Extensive research continues to
produce a wide variety of innovative products;
antistatic and flame-retardant fibres are
examples. More specialist products include the
aramids (with very high thermal stability and
strength), elastanes (giving very high stretch
and recovery) and melded fabrics (produced
without the need for knitting or weaving).
Courtaulds, one of Britain’s biggest
chemical companies, was responsible for
developing Tencel, a solvent-spun,
biodegradable fibre. This is twice as strong as
cotton while being soft enough to be used by
designers of luxury garments.
Mechanical Engineering
The mechanical engineering sector has about
28,000 firms employing over 440,000 people.
In 1995 exports totalled £14,600 million, with
a trade surplus of £2,300 million. Output
includes pressure vessels, heat exchangers and
storage tanks for chemical and oil-refining
plant, steam-raising boilers (including those
for power stations), nuclear reactors, water and
sewage treatment plant, and fabricated
steelwork for bridges, buildings and industrial
installations.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Machine-building is an area where British
firms excel, especially in construction and
earth-moving equipment, wheeled tractors,
internal combustion engines, textile
machinery, medical equipment, fork-lift
trucks, pumps and compressors. Britain is one
of the world’s major producers of tractors,
which make up around three-quarters of the
country’s total output of agricultural
equipment. Sales of wheeled tractors in 1994
were valued at £860 million. Among leading
tractor manufacturers are Massey Ferguson,
JCB, Case and New Holland.
Widely-used technical innovations include
computer-controlled tractors, a highly efficient
pesticide sprayer and combined mower/
conditioners that reduce the drying time for
grass. Much new machinery is designed for
use in a variety of conditions to meet the needs
of overseas farmers.
Britain is a leading producer of machine
tools. Almost all are purchased by the
engineering, aerospace, automotive and metal
goods industries. The machine tools sector
was badly affected by the recent recession,
but has now recovered strongly, with exports
doing especially well. Turnover of machine
tools was valued at £1,600 million in 1994,
15 per cent more than in 1993; exports
account for a third of turnover. British
manufacturers have made technological
advances in probes, sensors, co-ordinate
measuring devices, laser melting and the
installation of flexible manufacturing
systems. Computer numerical-controlled
machines account for an increasing
proportion of output. Of the top six machine
tool companies in Britain, five are
foreign-owned; the 600 Group is the biggest
British company.
Most sales of textile machinery are to
export markets. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms.
Britain’s mining and tunnelling
equipment industry leads in the production
of coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
JCB, Britain’s biggest construction
equipment manufacturer, is the world’s
leading manufacturer of backhoe loaders and
telescopic handlers. Sales of construction
equipment, such as excavators and backhoe
loaders, rose in 1994 to £569 million.
The mechanical lifting and handling
equipment industry produces cranes and
transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically controlled
and automatic handling systems. In 1994
sales in this sector were worth £2,300
million. Britain is also a major producer of
industrial engines, pumps, valves and
compressors, and of pneumatic and hydraulic
equipment. Companies like Babcock
manufacture steam generators and other
heavy equipment for power plants. Despite
an overall decline in the castings industry,
some foundries have invested in new
melting, moulding and quality control
equipment.
Electrical, Electronic and Instrument
Engineering
Making extensive use of the most advanced
technologies, the electrical engineering
industry manufactures a broad range of
products: power plant, cable, transformers and
switchgear, lighting, electrical installation
products, and heating, ventilating and air
conditioning equipment. GEC-Alsthom is one
of only a handful of firms in the world which
can supply the major components for a
complete power station project.
The domestic electrical appliance sector is
dominated by a few large firms. Britain has the
fifth largest electronics industry in the world.
Products include computers, communications
equipment and a large range of components.
Exports of computer hardware and software
increased by 27 per cent in 1995; sales of
telecommunications and sound equipment
overseas were up 33 per cent.
The major electronic consumer goods
produced are television sets and high-fidelity
audio and video equipment. Several leading
Japanese companies have established
248
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
manufacturing bases in Britain. British
manufacturers have a worldwide reputation for
high-quality goods aimed at the upper end of
the market.
Scotland’s ‘Silicon Glen’ employs
46,000 people in electronics. The
electronics industry in Scotland
currently produces 12 per cent of
Europe’s semiconductors, over 35 per
cent of its personal computers, about
45 per cent of its computer
workstations and over 50 per cent of
its automated cash dispensers. Major
Japanese, US and other overseas
companies located in the area include
IBM, NEC, Compaq and Digital,
which are supplied by a strong
indigenous electronic components
sector.
Computers
This sector produces an extensive range of
systems, central processors and peripheral
equipment, from large computers for
large-scale data-processing and scientific work
to mini- and microcomputers for control and
automation systems and for home, educational
and office use. Between 1994 and 1995
turnover of electronic data processing
equipment rose from £13,250 million to
£14,900 million.
Britain’s biggest computer manufacturer is
the largely Japanese-owned ICL. Other
companies, such as Psion, have concentrated on
developing new products for specialised markets.
These include hand-held, pocket-sized
computers, increasingly used by company sales
forces, and notebook and pen computers.
British firms make computer applications
software, and are particularly strong in specialist
markets such as artificial intelligence,
computer-aided design, mathematical software,
geographical information systems and data
visualisation. The world’s first modem
(computer telephone link) for portable
computers was designed in Britain. Psion is a
pioneer of the ‘palmtop’ computer, which has
the equivalent power of a desktop machine.
All-Voice Computing is a market leader in
devising software for voice-activated word
processing.
British firms and research organisations, with
government support, have been involved in the
development and application of the family of
‘three-five’ semiconductor materials, such as
gallium arsenide; these are used in a number of
microwave devices and in the production of
faster-working computers. Major advances are
being made by British firms and academic
institutions in the field of‘virtual reality’, a
three-dimensional computer simulation
technique with a host of industrial and other
applications. It is being used to design buildings
and a range of products, including cars,
pharmaceuticals and machine tools.
Communications Equipment
Britain’s main communications products are
switching and transmission equipment,
telephones and terminals. As the
telecommunications market has become fully
liberalised (see p. 319), there has been a
growing demand for equipment and services.
GPT is Britain’s foremost telecommunications
manufacturer; its product range includes PBXs
(private branch exchanges), transmission
systems and videoconferencing equipment.
Innovative work is being stimulated by the
expansion of cable television and the growth in
value added network services. There has been
rapid expansion in the market for cellular
telephones since the second half of the 1980s.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables. Supported by a technically
advanced cable industry, BT has led in the
development of optical fibre communications
systems. It has paved the way for simpler and
cheaper optical cables by laying the first
non-repeatered cable over 100 km (62 miles)
long, and by developing the first all-optical
repeater.
More than half of the world’s undersea
communications cables have been made and laid
by STC Submarine Systems, which, with its US
and French partners, completed the laying of the
first transatlantic optical fibre cable in 1988. Now
part of Canada’s Northern Telecom, STC is
building the first fibre-optic cable linking Canada
249
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and Europe. The cable, which is being made in
Britain and the United States, will carry up to
30,000 telephone calls simultaneously down each
of two pairs of optical fibres.
Britain also has a world lead in the
transmission of computerised data along
telephone lines for reproduction on television
screens.
Another sector of the industry manufactures
radio communications equipment, radar, radio
and sonar navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and signalling
equipment, public broadcasting equipment and
other capital goods. Radar was invented in
Britain and British firms are still in the forefront
of technological advances. Racal Avionics’
X-band radar for aircraft ground movement
control is in use at airports in several overseas
countries. Solid-state secondary surveillance
radar, manufactured by Cossor Electronics, is
being supplied to 50 overseas civil aviation
operators. Cable and Wireless’s submarine
cable-laying robot ‘CIRRUS’, which can work at
depths of up to 1 km (3,280 ft), is controlled
entirely by a computer on its mother ship.
Medical and Other Electronic Equipment
A range of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in Britain, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication equipment for use in machine tools.
Companies such as GEC and Oxford
Instruments produce electronic medical
equipment, including ultrasound scanners,
electromyography systems and patient
monitoring systems for intensive and coronary
care and other uses. Britain pioneered
magnetic resonance imaging.
The indigenous electronics components
industry is supplemented by subsidiaries of
leading overseas companies. An area of rapid
change in which Britain is particularly strong
is the manufacture of advanced components,
such as integrated circuits.
The instrument engineering industry makes
measuring, photographic, cinematographic and
reprographic equipment; watches, clocks and
other timing devices; and medical and surgical
instruments. Total turnover of this sector
amounted to £9,000 million in 1995.
Overseas sales of scientific and
photographic equipment were worth £6,000
million in 1995.
Motor Vehicles
Around 800,000 people are employed by
vehicle and automotive components
manufacturers. Car output is dominated by
seven groups, accounting for 99 per cent of
the total: Rover (a subsidiary of BMW), Ford
(including Jaguar), Vauxhall, Peugeot-
Talbot, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. The
remainder is in the hands of smaller,
specialist producers such as Rolls-Royce,
whose cars are renowned for their quality
and durability. Rover’s production includes
the highly successful Land Rover four-wheel
drive vehicles and a full range of family cars.
Investment continues on a large scale: nearly
£4,000 million in the past five years by Ford;
around £500 million a year by Rover with the
backing of BMW; and since their arrival in
the mid-1980s, Nissan, Toyota and Honda
have invested more than £3,000 million.
A period of major change has accompanied
the arrival of these three Japanese
manufacturers. Their management approach,
high productivity, quality, workforce
commitment and co-operative partnerships
have had a positive effect on established car
and component manufacturers alike.
Car production has recovered
strongly following the recession: in
1995, 1.5 million cars were
manufactured, the highest figure
since 1974, due in large part to a
strong export performance.
A total of 745,000 passenger cars
were exported in 1995, almost three
and a half times as many as in 1988.
The motor components industry consists of
up to 6,000 companies, including large
conglomerates such as Lucas, GKN and T&N,
and is ranked as one of Britain’s major
industries. Lucas is merging its business with
that of Varity of the United States, becoming
one of the top ten automotive components
suppliers in the world.

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
Order books of British merchant shipbuilders
for new building were estimated to be worth
£200 million at the end of 1995; merchant ship
repairers had a turnover of £300 million in
1995. The marine equipment industry is a
major contributor to the shipbuilding industry,
as equipment installed in a ship’s hull accounts
for about 50 per cent of its total cost. Some 800
firms offer a complete range of products, from
diving equipment to sophisticated navigational
systems, 75 per cent of which is exported.
More than two decades of oil and gas
exploitation in the North Sea have generated a
major offshore industry (see p. 267).
Shipbuilders and fabricators build floating
production units and semi-submersible units
for drilling, production and emergency/
maintenance support, drill ships, jack-up rigs,
modules and offshore loading systems. UIE
Scotland, Highlands Fabricators, John Brown
and McDermott Scotland are among the larger
manufacturers and designers. In 1996 Harland
and Wolff of Belfast was awarded a £70
million contract by BP to build the hull for the
world’s largest newly constructed floating oil
production vessel.
Several thousand firms supply other
products needed by the offshore industry
—such as diving equipment and helicopters—
as well as services, including consultancy,
design, project management and R & D. Their
experience of North Sea projects has enabled
them to establish themselves in oil and gas
markets throughout the world.
Aerospace
Britain’s aerospace industry is the third largest
in the Western world, after the United States
and France. Only nine firms employ 2,500
people or more, and two-thirds of the 540 core
aerospace companies have fewer than 50
employees. Around 200 companies, employing
over 130,000 people, belong to the Society of
British Aerospace Companies. Total sales of
the industry amounted to £12,000 million in
1994, with exports contributing £7,500
million. Aircraft and parts account for around
two-fifths of overseas sales, with engines and
parts, missiles and aerospace equipment
(including satellite equipment) making up the
rest.
Reductions in defence orders following the
end of the Cold War, accompanied by fierce
international competition in the defence
products market, have forced the aerospace
industry to contract and to improve its
efficiency and competitiveness. An increase in
the amount of collaborative development of
civil and military aircraft and engines, as well
as aviation equipment and satellites, is leading
to significant savings on the costs of long-term
programmes.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons, simulators and space
satellites, flight controls including ‘fly-by-wire’
and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see p. 327),
avionics and complex components, with their
associated services. In order to improve fuel
economy, engine and airframe manufacturers
have been using lighter materials such as
titanium and carbon-fibre composites (see p.
244), combined with advanced avionics and
improved aerodynamic techniques.
Civil Aircraft
As one of the leading British exporters of
manufactured goods, British Aerospace (BAe)
produces both civil and military aircraft, as
well as guided weapons and aircraft
components.
BAe has a 20 per cent share of the European
consortium Airbus Industrie. It designs and
supplies the wings for the whole family of
Airbus airliners, from the short- to
medium-haul A320 series (the first civil
airliner to use fly-by-wire controls—see p.
327) to the large long-range four-engined
A340.
With Aerospatiale of France and Italy’s
Alenia, BAe has formed a new regional aircraft
alliance which jointly markets turboprops and
jet aircraft with between 29 and 115 seats;
these include BAe’s Avro RJ family of regional
‘quiet jet’ airliners and the 29-seat Jetstream 41
turboprop airliner.
The Canadian-owned Short Brothers of
Belfast, with 9,000 employees, is engaged in
the design and production of major civil
aircraft sub-assemblies, advanced engine
251
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nacelles and components for aerospace
manufacturers as well as in the provision of
aviation support services. It is a leading
supplier to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
among others. Shorts is a partner in
manufacturing the 50-seat Canadair Regional
Jet airliner; the Learjet 45, a small business jet
aircraft; and the Bombardier Global Express
long-range business jet.
Pilatus Britten-Norman manufactures the
Islander light utility aircraft, which has had
sales in over 100 countries. Slingsby Aviation
produces several versions of the T67 Firefly
two-seater training and acrobatic aircraft for
customers around the world (see below).
Military Aircraft and Missiles
British Aerospace is one of the world’s top
defence companies, with more than four-fifths
of its military production having been
exported in 1995. Among its military aircraft is
the Harrier, a unique vertical/short take-off
and landing (V/STOL) military combat
aircraft. BAe also produces the Hawk fast-jet
trainer and, with McDonnell Douglas, the
Goshawk T45 carrier jet trainer. It has a 33 per
cent share in the development of the
Eurofighter 2000, which had its maiden flight
in 1994. This collaborative programme
involves companies from Britain, Germany,
Italy and Spain.
The Tornado combat aircraft is built by a
company set up jointly by BAe, Alenia and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace. A £5,000 million
order for 48 Tornado bombers for Saudi
Arabia was confirmed in 1993, making it one of
Britain’s biggest ever export deals. Together
with Alenia, Daimler-Benz and Aerospatiale,
BAe has formed a new company, a military
subsidiary of Airbus Industrie, to manage the
Future Large Aircraft military transport
programme. The United States Air Force has
chosen Slingsby Aviation’s T67 Firefly
training aircraft as its new basic trainer and
113 aircraft are being built. Slingsby also
designs and makes composite components for
the aviation and other industries.
BAe is a major supplier of tactical guided
weapon systems for use on land, at sea and in
the air. BAe is merging its missile business
with that of France’s Matra corporation to
form Europe’s largest guided weapons
concern. Shorts Missile Systems Ltd (SMS) is
a joint venture between Shorts and
Thomson-CSF of France in the area of very
short range air defence systems.
Helicopters
Westland Helicopters (part of the GKN
group) manufactures the Sea King, Lynx and
Apache military helicopters, and, in
partnership with Agusta of Italy, the
multi-role EH101 medium-lift helicopter.
Over 1,000 Westland helicopters are in
service in 19 countries. Orders currently
being fulfilled include ones for the Royal
Navy (for the EH101), Royal Air Force
(EH101 and Sea King), and the British Army
(Apache), and customers from Brazil (Lynx),
Norway (Sea King) and Italy (EH101). Major
Sea King upgrading programmes are being
undertaken for Australia, Belgium and
Norway.
Aero-engines
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three prime
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a turnover
in 1995 of £2,400 million for its aerospace
division. The Group’s commercial aero-engine
company makes engines for airliners and
regional, executive and corporate jets. Over
50,000 Rolls-Royce engines are in service with
more than 300 airlines in over 100 countries.
More than 80 per cent of Boeing 757 operators
have selected RB211-535 engines.
The company’s latest large engine, the
Trent, powers the new generation of
wide-body twin-engined airliners, such as
Boeing’s 777 and the Airbus A330. The Trent
800 has run at over 100,000 lb thrust.
Rolls-Royce is a partner in the five-nation
International Aero Engine consortium, which
manufactures the low-emission V2500
aero-engine, now in service on the Airbus
A320 and A321 as well as the McDonnell
Douglas MD90. It is also in partnership with
BMW, producing engines for large corporate
jets and regional aircraft.
Rolls-Royce produces military engines for
both aircraft and helicopters, and is a partner
in the EJ200 engine project for the Eurofighter
252
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
2000. It also owns the Allison Engine
Company of the United States, which is a
world leader in helicopter and large turboprop
engines.
The company also manufactures gas
turbines for power generation, for oil and gas
pumping and marine propulsion. Turnover of
Rolls-Royce’s industrial power group
amounted to £1,200 million in 1995, of which
70 per cent came from overseas sales.
Aviation Equipment
Around one-third of the aerospace industry
is devoted to designing and manufacturing
aviation equipment. British firms have made
significant technological advances.
Manufacturers like Dowty, GEC-Marconi,
Lucas, Smiths Industries, Racal,
Normalair-Garrett and BAe provide
equipment and systems for engines and
aircraft propellers, navigation and landing
systems, engine and flight controls,
environmental controls and oxygen breathing
and regulation systems, electrical generation,
mechanical and hydraulic power systems,
cabin furnishings, flight-deck controls and
information displays. GEC-Marconi is the
world’s largest manufacturer of head-up
displays (HUDs).
British firms have made important advances
in developing ejection seats, firefighting
equipment and flight simulators, as well as
fly-by-wire and fly-by-light technology, where
control surfaces on the wings and elsewhere
are moved by means of automatic electronic
signalling and fibre optics respectively, rather
than by mechanical means. GEC-Marconi
supplies the fly-by-wire system for the Boeing
777. Britain’s aerospace companies provide
radar and air traffic control equipment and
ground power supplies to airports and airlines
worldwide.
Space Equipment and Services
Over 400 companies employing almost 6,500
people are engaged in industrial space
activities. The industry is strong in the
development and manufacture of civil and
military communications satellites and
associated Earth stations and ground
infrastructure equipment. In the field of Earth
observation, it plays a leading role in
manufacturing platforms, space radar and
meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
Through its participation in the Intelsat,
Inmarsat, Eutelsat and Astra European space
projects, Britain has become Europe’s biggest
user of space. The British Government is the
fourth largest contributor to the European
Space Agency (ESA).
The largest British space company is Matra
Marconi Space UK, which, with its French
partner, is one of the world’s leading space
companies. Its current major activities include
manufacture of the Skynet 4 military
communications satellites, payloads for the
Koreasat and Inmarsat 3 communications
spacecraft and the European Polar Platform
and space radar systems. The company carried
out instrumentation work on the SOHO
scientific satellite launched in 1995 to study the
Sun.
The National Remote Sensing Centre has a
major role in developing the market for Earth
observation data, an area in which other British
firms—notably Logica, Vega, Science Systems
and Cray—have major interests. SERCO is
Europe’s biggest supplier of technical services
in space.
GEC-Marconi produces inertial guidance
systems as well as electronics components;
Pilkington dominates the world market in solar
array cover glasses. '
Food and Drink
Britain has a large food and drink
manufacturing industry, which has accounted
for a growing proportion of total domestic food
supply in recent decades. In the last few years,
it has increased productivity and undergone
restructuring, partly in order to take advantage
of the single European market. Approximately
450,000 people are employed in the industry.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience
foods, such as ready-prepared meals, salads
and pasta, together with yogurts, dairy desserts
and ‘instant snacks’, have formed some of the
fastest-growing sectors of the food market in
recent years. Companies have introduced new
253
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
low-fat and fat-free products such as spreads
and ice creams to meet growing consumer
demand. There has also been a rise in sales of
products for vegetarians.
Around one-half of liquid milk in Britain is
distributed through a doorstep delivery system
employing about 28,500 people; the proportion
is, however, declining. Household milk
consumption per head—2.1 litres (3.6 pints) a
week—is among the highest in the world.
Consumption of skimmed and semi-skimmed
milk continues to rise as people seek to reduce
the fat content in their diet.
Milk for manufacturing purposes goes
principally into butter, cheese, condensed
milk, dried whole and skimmed milk powder,
cream and other products like yogurt. The
British dairy industry accounted for 60 per
cent of butter supplies to the domestic market
in 1995 and 72 per cent of cheese supplies.
Butter exports in 1995 were worth £117
million. The other main exports are skimmed
milk powder and whole milk powder, valued at
£233 million in total, and cheese at £140
million.
About three-quarters of bread is produced
in large bakeries. Household expenditure on
bread amounts to about £2,000 million a
year. A significant increase in the varieties
available, greater awareness of the nutritional
value of bread and the growth of the
sandwich market have helped stabilise
consumption in the last few years. Sales of
ready-made sandwiches are now an estimated
£6,000 million a year. Exports of biscuits
were valued at £370 million in 1995 and
those of chocolate and sugar confectionery at
£350 million.
Of major significance among the alcoholic
drinks produced in Britain is Scotch whisky,
which is one of Britain’s top export earners.
There are about 100 distilleries in Scotland.
Each of these produces either malt whisky or
grain whisky. The raw material of the former
is malt (that is, malted barley) and the latter
other grain mixed with malt. Most Scotch
whisky consumed is a blend of malt and grain
whisky. Examples of well known brands of
such blended Scotch whisky are as J & B,
Johnnie Walker, Famous Grouse, Bell’s and
Teacher’s. Some 13,000 people work in the
industry and a further 45,000 are employed in
supplying ingredients and materials used by
the industry. Almost 90 per cent of Scotch
whisky production is exported, to over 200
countries. The value of whisky exports was
£2,300 million in 1995, Europe taking 42 per
cent and the United States 13 per cent by
volume.
In 1995 purchases of beer in Britain
amounted to £14,000 million, about 3 per cent
of consumers’ expenditure. The brewing
industry has four major national brewery
groups—Scottish Courage, Bass, Whitbread
and Carlsberg-Tetley—and about 480 regional
and local brewers. British malt, which is made
almost entirely from home-grown barley, is
used by brewers throughout the world.
Demand for traditional cask-conditioned ales
(‘real ale’) remains buoyant, while lager now
accounts for just over half of all beer sales. In
recent years there has been a shift towards
stronger bottled beers, a significant proportion
of which are imported.
Cider is made primarily in south-west
England, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and
Worcestershire.
Some 420 vineyards and 120 wineries in
Britain (mainly in southern England) produce
an average of 1.8 million litres of wine a year,
most of which is white wine. Quality is
improving rapidly through use of the latest
wine-making technology.
The soft drinks industry, which had a
turnover of £2,300 million in 1994, produces
carbonated drinks, concentrates, fruit juices,
and natural mineral and bottled waters. A
highly competitive industry, it is the fastest
growing sector of the grocery trade,
introducing many innovative products.
Tobacco
The British tobacco industry manufactures
nearly all cigarettes and tobacco goods sold in
Britain. Almost all domestic output is provided
by three major manufacturers (Imperial
Tobacco, Gallaher and Carreras Rothmans).
The industry specialises in the production of
high-quality cigarettes made from flue-cured
tobacco and achieves significant exports.
Europe, the Middle East and Africa are
important markets.
254
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
Textiles and Clothing
These products make a substantial
contribution to the British economy in terms
of employment, exports and turnover.
Together with the footwear and leather
industries, they employ around 420,000
people. For textiles, there is a high degree of
regional concentration, particularly in North
West England, West Yorkshire (mainly wool),
the East Midlands (knitwear), Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The clothing industry is
scattered throughout Britain, with significant
concentrations in Manchester, Leicester and
London. The principal products are spun
yarns, woven and knitted fabrics, apparel,
industrial and household textiles, and carpets
based chiefly on wool, cotton and synthetic
fibres. Exports of textiles, clothing and
footwear totalled more than £6,000 million in
1995.
The textile and clothing industry has
around 14,000 firms, comprising a few large
multi-process companies and two of the
world’s largest firms—Coats Viyella and
Courtaulds Textiles—as well as a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
The international Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA—see p. 179) has allowed
a measure of restraint on imports into the
European Union from low-cost countries;
however, the MFA is being phased out over
ten years to the year 2005. Increased
investment in new machinery and greater
attention to design, training and marketing
have helped the industry to raise its
competitiveness. New technologies, largely
designed to improve response times and give
greater flexibility in production, are being used
throughout the industry.
Britain’s wool textile industry is one of the
most important in the world. West Yorkshire
is the main producing area, but Scotland is also
famous as a specialist producer of high-quality
yarns and tweeds. Raw wool is scoured and
cleaned in Britain in preparation for woollen
and worsted spinning and weaving (worsted is
fine wool fabric often used for making suits).
British mills also process rare fibres such as
cashmere and angora. Sales of the wool textile
industry amounted to £1,200 million in 1995.
Low-cost competition has cut progressively
into British markets for cotton and allied
products. Production includes yarn and fabrics
of cotton, synthetic fibres and cotton-synthetic
mixes, with large-scale dyeing and printing of
cotton and synthetic fibre fabric. The linen
industry is centred in Northern Ireland.
The high quality and variety of design make
Britain one of the world’s leading producers of
woven carpets. Over half the value of carpet
and rug output is made up of tufted carpets.
Woven carpets, mainly Axminster, account for
most of the remaining sales. There is a higher
wool content in woven types, although in
these, too, considerable use is being made of
synthetic fibres.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of textile industry output, covering
products such as conveyor belting and
geotextiles used in civil engineering. Many of
these are non-woven. Synthetic polypropylene
yarn is used in the manufacture of carpet
backing and ropes, and woven into fabrics for a
wide range of applications in the packaging,
upholstery, building and motor vehicle
industries.
The clothing industry is more labour
intensive than textiles, with about 7,700
companies. While a broad range of clothing is
imported from Europe and Asia, British
industry supplies about one-half of domestic
demand. Exports have risen since the British
fashion designer industry regained prominence
during the 1980s, and traditional British
tailoring enables branded clothing companies
such as Burberry’s to compete successfully
overseas. The hosiery and knitwear industry
comprises about 1,500 companies, mainly in
the East Midlands and Scotland.
Paper, Printing and Publishing
There are 108 paper and board mills
employing 20,500 people. Among the largest
British groups are Shotton, St Regis and
Bridgewater. Production has been
concentrated in large-scale units to enable the
industry to compete more effectively within
the single European market. Between 1985 and
1995 output increased by two-thirds. Over half
the industry is made up of forestry product
companies from Scandinavia, North America,
Australia and elsewhere. There has been a
255
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
significant trend towards waste-based
packaging grades. Usage of recycled waste
paper is increasing and research is helping to
extend it. In 1995 the total amount of waste
paper used in British newspapers accounted
for four-fifths of newsprint produced. Waste
paper provides over half of the industry’s fibre
needs.
Employment in the paper products,
printing and publishing industries is 450,000.
Much printing and publishing employment
and output is in firms based in south-east
England. Mergers have led to the formation of
large groups in newspaper, magazine and book
publishing. More than £2,800 million worth of
books were sold in Britain in 1994. The
book-publishing industry is a major exporter,
selling one-third of production in overseas
markets. Security printers (of, for example,
banknotes and postage stamps) are also
important exporters, the major company being
De La Rue.
Construction
Annual output of the construction industry is
around £50,000 million. Most construction
work is done by private firms, 98 per cent of
which employ fewer than 25 people. While
only 84 out of a total of nearly 195,000 firms
employ more than 600 people directly, these
companies undertake about 20 per cent of all
construction in Britain. Some larger firms own
quarries and factories for materials
manufacture, and sophisticated plant. Some
undertake responsibility for all stages of
projects from initial design to final
construction.
Efficiency and productivity in construction
have benefited from greater off-site fabrication
of standardised components and from
computerised techniques such as
computer-aided design, computerised stock
ordering and job costing, electronic load safety
measures for cranes, and distance measuring
equipment.
Building Materials and Products
A vast range of products is used in the
construction process, from structural steel,
glass and bricks to tiles and bathroom fittings.
These materials are estimated to make up
around 40 per cent of the value of construction
output. In 1995 sales of construction materials
were worth about £20,000 million, with
exports amounting to £3,500 million.
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel that is
quarried by the aggregates industry is used in
construction. The brick industry, one of
Britain’s oldest, is regarded as the world’s most
technically advanced. Portland cement, a
19th-century British innovation, is the most
widely used chemical compound in the world.
Britain is also a world leader in the
manufacture of glass used in windows, doors
and cladding. Pilkington developed the float
process for manufacturing distortion-free flat
glass (see p. 245), which is licensed throughout
the world. Substantially more energy-efficient,
flat glass is used to allow more light into
buildings and to provide insulation against
heat loss in winter. The manufacture and
supply of windows and doors is carried out by
a large number of companies operating in one
of three product sectors—timber, metal
(aluminium and steel) and UPVC.
Project Procurement, Management and
Financing
The most common basis of procurement for
construction projects is a lump-sum contract
with provision for variation. The largest
projects are often carried out under the
direction of construction managers or
management contractors. Clients generally
employ architects, project managers or civil
engineers to advise on the feasibility of
projects, draw up plans, and inspect and
supervise the construction work.
Private and public sector projects are
managed in a variety of ways. Most clients
invite construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Alternative methods of contracting are
becoming more common: for example,
contracts might include subsequent provision
of building maintenance or a comprehensive
‘design-and-build’ service, where a single

THE ENVIRONMENT
Reducing Pollution
The Institute of Arable Crops Research,
Bristol, has found that using less
intensive, more sustainable, systems of
production can mean less reliance
on agrochemicals. This reduces
environmental risk, while maintaining
profitable production.
The Coal Clough Wind Farm, near Burnley, Lancashire, has 24 turbines with a capacity of 9.6 megawatts,
and serves about 7,500 homes. It saves 36,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions and 165 tons of sulphur dioxide
emissions each year.

Build, Finance and Operate’) road
contracts.
The Government provides substantial work
for the construction industry. Recently, several
projects have been built and paid for by private
consortia, which then charge the public for
their use for a fixed period of time before
transferring ownership back to the public
sector; these are known as ‘BOOT’ (‘Build,
Own, Operate and Transfer’) schemes. Two
examples are the toll bridge over the River
Thames at Dartford, Kent, and the second
River Severn toll bridge, which opened in June
1996 (see p. 305).
Major Construction Projects in Britain
The most important recent construction
project is the Channel Tunnel, the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe (see p. 311). Completed
in 1993, its estimated cost was £10,000 million.
Building work was carried out by a consortium
of ten French and British contractors working
together as Transmanche Link (TML). The
tunnel is nearly 50 km (31 miles) long and is
70 m (230 ft) below sea level at its deepest.
Associated projects included new international
stations at Waterloo in London and Ashford,
Kent, and an international terminal at
Folkestone.
Other major building projects in hand or
recently completed are the M25 motorway
widening scheme, the M74 in Scotland, the
A50/A564 in Derbyshire, the extensive
development in London’s Docklands, and the
Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk.
Both Stansted and Manchester airports have
been substantially redeveloped. There has also
been large-scale redevelopment of sports
stadiums, including Twickenham and
Murrayfield (in Edinburgh) rugby grounds,
and Manchester United and Arsenal football
grounds. A new £16 million football stadium
has been built to house Middlesbrough football
club. Major redevelopment work is taking
place at the Wimbledon lawn tennis complex.
Housing
During 1995 construction of 170,000 dwellings
was started in Great Britain. Starts by private
enterprise were 136,000, by housing
associations 33,000 and in the public sector
1,100. Around 188,000 dwellings were
completed: 148,000 by the private sector,
38,000 by housing associations and 2,000 by
the public sector. The total value of new
housing orders was over £5,600 million.
Building Regulations
The Department of the Environment’s
building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and
Wales. Administered and enforced by local
government, the regulations apply to new
building, the installation or replacement of
fittings, alterations and extensions to existing
buildings, and certain changes of use of
existing buildings. Similar controls apply in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. An alternative
to local authority building control involves
private certification of compliance with
building regulations. The British Standards
Institution is providing much of Britain’s
contribution to the drafting of European
standards, which are increasingly replacing
national construction standards.

Research and Advisory Services
The Building Research Establishment, a
government executive agency which is to be
privatised in 1997, provides advice and
research services to Government and industry
on the design, construction and performance
of buildings, together with the health and
safety of people in and around buildings. Its
areas of expertise include prevention and
control of fires and protection of the
environment. It actively supports the
development of European codes and standards,
and has strong links with a variety of
international organisations. Major construction
and materials firms, universities, colleges and
research associations, as well as the British
Board of Agrement, carry out research and
provide advisory services. The Building
Centre supplies exhibition and information
services on materials, products, techniques and
building services.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
British companies are engaged in many major
projects throughout the world and have been
in the forefront of management contracting
and of‘design and construct’ operations. They
are increasingly engaged in developing
privately financed projects. Contractors and
consultants undertake the supervision and all
or part of the construction of a project.
Consultants are engaged in the planning,
design and supervision of construction
projects. British companies have a reputation
for integrity and independence.
British contractors are currently active in
over 100 countries, and have a permanent
presence in 98 of them. In 1995 they secured
new international business valued at £5,500
million, 45 per cent more than in 1994, with
the main increases reported in Europe and
Asia; about 35 per cent of all new contracts
came from North America. Important
international contracts won in 1995-96
included:
• various joint ventures connected with the
new Hong Kong airport—landslide
infrastructure, an air cargo complex and
bridges;
• an office complex and shopping mall in
Accra, Ghana;
• a joint venture in connection with the
Oresund Crossing between Sweden and
Denmark;
• a new headquarters building for the
National Bank of Bahrain; and
• Phase 2 of the Ashgabat airport,
Turkmenistan.
British engineering consultants are engaged
in projects in 140 countries, having offices in
most of those countries. In 1995 members of
the Association of Consulting Engineers were
engaged in new work overseas valued at
£28,100 million. The capital value of projects
under way at the end of 1995 was £82,000
million. British consulting engineers had
estimated gross earnings in 1995 of £730
million from overseas commissions. The three
largest categories of work covered roads,
bridges and tunnels; thermal power stations;
and water supply. The largest markets were
the Far East, Africa, India and the Middle
East. Major international projects include:
• airports in Israel and Hong Kong;
• land planning and development in the
People’s Republic of China;
• railways in Thailand and Malaysia;
• water works in Turkey; and
• harbours in Russia.

In 1995 offshore oil and gas production reached record levels. Cumulative
production of oil (1,835 million tonnes since 1975) is about one-fifth of
maximum estimated recoverable reserves. Coal output from deep mines
increased by 10 per cent. Parts of the nuclear electricity supply industry have
been privatised.
Energy production directly employs about 200,000 people—5 per cent of
industrial employees. The energy sector accounts for 5 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP), 8 per cent of total investment, 30 per cent of industrial
investment, and 6 per cent of all expenditure by the production industries on
research and development. It also includes three of Britain’s 15 largest
companies, both for profitability and for capital employed—Shell, BP and
British Gas. Greater competition in energy markets has meant a continuing fall
in real prices to virtually all consumers. The value of non-fuel minerals output
exceeded £2,000 million in 1994. Water company investment of £400 million
aims to ensure uninterrupted water supplies in 1996-97.
Energy Resources
Britain has the largest energy resources in
the European Union (EU) and is a major
world producer of oil and natural
gas—known as primary sources. The other
main primary sources are coal, nuclear power
and some water power; secondary sources
(derived from primary sources) are
electricity, coke and smokeless fuels, and
petroleum products.
In the early 1970s imports accounted for
over 50 per cent of Britain’s fuel
consumption. In 1995, however, Britain was
again a net exporter of fuels—40 million
tonnes of oil equivalent—representing a
surplus of £3,695 million, £514 million
higher than in 1994.
Coal still supplies a significant proportion
of the country’s primary energy needs—23 per
cent of total home consumption in 1995.
Nuclear power provided about 27 per cent of
electricity generated by the British electricity
companies in 1995.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ownership and Extraction
Gold, silver, oil, unworked coal and natural gas
in Great Britain are owned by the Crown.
Other minerals are mainly privately owned.
Ownership of minerals normally belongs to the
owner of the land surface, but not always in
areas with a long history of mining. Mining
and quarrying are usually carried out by
privately owned companies.
In Northern Ireland the Crown owns gold
and silver, while rights to exploit petroleum and
other minerals (except ‘common substances’,
such as sand and gravel, and crushed rock) are
vested in the Department of Economic
Development. On the United Kingdom
Continental Shelf (UKCS; see map, p. 263) the
right to work all minerals except coal is vested in
the Crown. The Coal Authority owns almost all
the unworked coal in Great Britain and has
exclusive rights to work coal, or license others to
do so, both on land and under the sea.
ENERGY POLICY
The Government’s energy policy aims to
ensure secure, diverse and sustainable supplies
of energy in the forms that people and
businesses want, and at competitive prices.
Health, safety and environmental policies, as
well as EU and other international
commitments, have also to be borne in mind.
Key objectives are to:
• encourage competition among producers
and choice for consumers, with a legal and
regulatory framework to enable markets to
work well;
• ensure service in a commercial
environment, with customers paying the
full cost of energy resources they
consume;
• privatise state-owned industries where
possible;
• take care that the energy sector does not
have an adverse impact on the
environment; and
• promote energy efficiency and renewable
sources.
The independent regulators (see pp. 269
and 271) encourage the development of
competition and protect the interests of
consumers by administering price controls and
enforcing standards of service in remaining
areas of monopoly.
International Developments
Britain’s membership of the EU and of the
International Energy Agency (IEA: an
autonomous part of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development,
with 23 member countries) enables it to
collaborate on international energy matters.
The EU’s Energy Policy White Paper,
published at the end of 1995, stresses
competitiveness, security of supply, the
environment, and particularly the need
for market integration—beyond the
completion of the internal market in
electricity and gas.
Energy Report
The Government’s third annual Energy
Report, published (in two volumes) for the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in
April-May 1996, is an essential source of
information about Britain’s energy
industries. Volume 1 surveys the year’s
progress in all of them and describes, for
example, further changes in the structure and
ownership of the energy sector, and Britain’s
export potential in energy-related
equipment. Volume 2 is a detailed survey of
UKCS oil and gas resources in 1995, and
includes outline reviews of each offshore and
onshore oil and gas field.
The independent Energy Advisory Panel
has assisted in the report’s preparation.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
During 1984—95, when Britain’s GDP rose by
about 30 per cent, final energy consumption on
an ‘energy supplied’ basis increased by only 11
per cent. Since 1970, despite a 65 per cent rise
in GDP, primary energy consumption has
remained fairly constant, although, after
temperature correction, it has risen for the last
four years in succession. Energy consumption
by final users in 1995 amounted to 150.9

34 per cent, industrial users 24 per cent,

agriculture and public services 14 per cent.
Warmer weather in 1995 helped bring final
consumption as a whole down by 0.5 per cent
from the 1994 figure.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
In 1994 energy consumption in Britain’s
housing, offices and industrial buildings was
worth about £17,500 million. The
Environmental and Energy Management
Directorate (EEMD) of the Department of the
Environment estimates that 20 per cent—or
£3,500 million—could be saved through
investment in cost-effective energy efficiency
measures. Such improvements offer a fast
means of reducing carbon dioxide (C02)
emissions. The EEMD encourages investment
in these improvements through various
programmes (see below). Its budget for
1996-97 has been increased to £131 million.
The Energy Efficiency Best Practice
programme prepares and promotes
authoritative information, guides and case
studies on energy efficiency techniques and
technologies in industry and buildings. The
programme has an overall target of stimulating
annual energy savings worth £800 million by
the year 2000.
’l tonne of oil equivalent = 41.868 gigajoules.
Combined Heat and Power
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is the
simultaneous generation of electricity and
usable heat from the same plant. It harnesses
the heat usually discarded during power
generation. CHP can increase overall efficiency
to as much as 70-90 per cent, compared with
30-50 per cent for conventional electricity
generation. This also benefits the environment
by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. In
summer 1996 total installed capacity of CHP
in Britain was approximately 3,500 megawatts
(MW)—about 5 per cent of Britain’s
generating capacity—on nearly 1,300 sites,
with another 200 MW in construction or
committed.2
Environmental and Energy Management
Schemes
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme is the
Government’s major domestic energy
efficiency programme. It offers grants for loft
insulation, tank and pipe lagging,
draught-proofing, and energy advice to the
neediest and most vulnerable households.
Almost 2 million homes have been insulated
since the scheme started in January 1991.
Since 1 April 1996 householders aged over
60 who qualify only on grounds of age (that is,
they do not receive a qualifying benefit) have
been asked to pay a contribution towards the
cost of work carried out in their homes. This
21 MW = 1,000 kilowatts (kW).

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
will help maintain the level of assistance given
to low-income and disabled householders
while saving some £31 million on the cost of
the scheme. About 642,000 grants were paid in
1995-96.
The Small Company Environmental and
Energy Management Assistance Scheme
(SCEEMAS) meets up to 50 per cent of
consultancy costs w hen small manufacturing
businesses (less than 250 employees) set up an
environmental management system, which has
been validated by an external verifier, in
support of the EU Eco-Management and
Audit Scheme (see p. 252) in Britain.
The Energy Design Advice Scheme,
funded by the DTI, makes low-energy
building design expertise more accessible for
all those working on the design of new and
restored buildings.
About 90 per cent of signatories to the
EEMD’s Making a Corporate
Commitment campaign, which
underlines good energy management
on business premises, planned
further investment in 1996. Over 1,900
organisations have joined the
campaign.
Publicity campaigns (the latest being
‘Wasting Energy Costs the Earth’), which
include extensive media coverage, tell
householders how they can combat global
warming by improving the energy efficiency of
their homes. Light-bulbs which carry EU
ecolabels and produce a threefold (and more)
reduction in total ecosystem mercury are one
way of doing this.
Every new home in England and Wales now
carries the Standard Assessment Procedure
(SAP) for home energy rating, which
demonstrates energy efficiency and impact on
the environment.
The Energy Saving Trust is an independent
organisation which aims to stimulate investment
in energy efficiency and the development of
appropriate goods and services. Its new £3
million campaign shows energy saving in a
fashionable light. Government funding is £50
million in 1996-99.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION
For centuries small quantities of oil have been
produced in mainland Britain. The first
onshore oil, in the 1820s, came from the Tar
Tunnel at Ironbridge (Shropshire).
Production, mostly from Lanarkshire shales,
reached 3.25 million tonnes in 1913. The first
onshore production well was at Hardstoft
(Derbyshire) after the First World War. Some
250 onshore wells came into operation in
1939-40, though by the early 1960s they were
producing only 150,000 tonnes a year—about
0.3 per cent of refinery output. Britain was
almost wholly dependent for its oil supplies on
imports. However, the first notable offshore
discovery of oil in the UKCS (the Arbroath
field) was made in 1969 and the first oil
brought ashore, from the Argyll field, in 1975.
In 1995, output of crude oil and natural gas
liquids (NGLs) in Britain averaged 2.70
million barrels (about 357,000 tonnes) a day,
making Britain the world’s ninth largest
producer.
Structure of the Industry
Exploration and production are carried out
under licence by the private sector. The two
leading British oil companies are British
Petroleum (BP) and Shell Transport and
Trading, which has a 40 per cent interest in
the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.
BP and Shell retain their position as the two
largest industrial companies in Britain in terms
of turnover.
The Government’s main sources of revenue
from oil and gas activities are Petroleum
Revenue Tax, which was levied on all fields
approved between 1975 and March 1993;
Corporation Tax, which is charged on the
profits of oil and gas companies in much the
same way as any other industry and is the only
tax on profits of fields approved after March
1993; and royalty, which applies only to fields
approved before April 1982.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In 1995 UKCS oil and gas production
accounted for some 2 per cent of Britain’s

gross national product. Total revenues from
the sale of oil and gas produced from the
UKCS in 1995 are estimated at £10,550
million and £4,160 million respectively. Taxes
and royalty receipts attributable to UKCS oil
and gas came to about £2,350 million in
1995-96.
Since 1965 the industry has generated
trading profits of some £175,000
million, of which £64,000 million
have been reinvested in the industry,
£79,000 million paid to the
Exchequer, and £33,000 million left
for disposal by the companies. Total
company income was £18,000 million
in 1995, including £4,000 million, its
highest ever, from the gas production
sector.
Proceeds from the sale of oil in
1995 were up 11 per cent on 1994;
those from the sale of gas were up 8
per cent. Total value of oil and gas
produced onshore is estimated at
£490 million in 1995, compared with
£385 million in 1994.
Gross capital investment from British
sources in the oil and gas extraction industry
recovered to some £4,200 million in 1995,
compared with £3,500 million in 1994. This
was about 18 per cent of British industrial
investment and 4 per cent of gross domestic
fixed capital formation. Some 29,000 people
were employed offshore in September 1995, of
whom 93 per cent were British nationals. In
addition, oil and gas provide employment for
270,000 in support industries.
Licensing
The Government grants licences which allow
the holders to explore for and produce oil and
gas from specific offshore or onshore areas. In
addition to awarding these licences, the
Government must approve all proposed wells
and field development plans.
Since 1964, 16 offshore licensing rounds
have been held, and by the end of 1995, 5,848
wells had been or were being drilled in the
UKCS: 1,878 exploration wells, 1,131
appraisal wells and 2,839 development wells.
The record number of licences awarded in the
early 1990s confirms companies’ confidence in
the British industry.
The 16th offshore round, which closed in
March 1995, invited applications for 164
blocks in lightly explored areas around the
British coast and West of Shetland. Awards for
26 blocks West of Shetland were made on 18
May 1995 and for 53 blocks in the remaining
areas on 4 July, bringing the total number of
blocks licensed in the round to 79. Some of
these blocks are in environmentally sensitive
areas; the licences are subject to strict
conditions to ensure no adverse effects on
wildlife or their habitats. A further 275 blocks
264
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
have been offered for licence in the 17th
offshore round, which closes in November
1996. These are in frontier areas, such as west
of the Hebrides and the South West
Approaches, and again will be subject to
conditions designed to protect the
environment.
Britain’s largest onshore oilfield, at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), produced 90 per cent of the
total of just over 5 million tonnes of crude oils
and NGLs originating onshore in 1995, up 8.5
per cent on 1994. In addition to minor
production from various mining licensees,
there are 19 other onshore fields in
Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and
Leicestershire. At the end of 1995, 149
landward licences were in force, covering an
area of 20,078 sq km (7,752 sq miles). A
further 22 licences were awarded in March
1996 under the seventh onshore licensing
round, which closed in November 1995.
North Sea Fields
There were 143 offshore fields producing at
the end of March 1996 (72 oil, 62 gas and 9
condensate). Nearly all of the fields discovered
in the North Sea during 1965-75 have been
developed and expansion of more recent finds
is also in progress. A total of 26 new offshore
development projects (16 of them for oil) were
approved during 1995.
The fields with the largest cumulative
production totals are Forties, Brent, Ninian
and Piper. Remaining recoverable reserves of
UKCS oil in the ‘proven’ plus ‘probable’
categories amount to 3,285 million tonnes,
while the total remaining potential of the
UKCS could be in the range of 3,640 to 8,630
million tonnes on current estimates.
Offshore Gas
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain
began in the early 19th century in central
London. Gas used to be produced from coal,
but during the 1960s growing imports of oil
made possible town gas from oil-based
feedstocks. After the first commercial natural
gas discovery in the West Sole field in 1965
and the start of its exploitation in 1967,
supplies of offshore natural gas grew rapidly
and by 1977 natural gas had replaced town gas
in the public supply system in Great Britain.
Natural gas accounts for 70.6 per cent of
total inland primary fuel consumption in
Britain. In 1995 indigenous production of
natural gas amounted to 75,404 million cubic
metres. This included 4,881 million cubic
metres of gas used for drilling, production and
piping operations on North Sea platforms and
at terminals. Total availability of UKCS gas
amounted to 75,081 million cubic metres. Just
under 1,000 million cubic metres of UKCS gas
were exported and about 1,500 million cubic
metres were imported from Norway.
Up to the end of 1995 some £16,300
million had been spent on developing
natural gas resources on the UKCS
and 1,106,743 million cubic metres
had been produced. Britain is the
world’s fifth largest gas producer—
after Russia, the United States,
Canada and the Netherlands.
Production from the three most prolific of
the 67 offshore gasfields—Leman,
Indefatigable (South) and the Hewett
area—has accounted for over half the total gas
produced so far in the UKCS. Associated gas,3
delivered to land via the Far North Liquids
and Associated Gas System (FLAGS) and
from the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation System
(SAGE), makes additional significant
contributions. The south basin fields and the
South Morecambe field in the Irish Sea
produce more gas in winter. Gas from the twin
North Sean and South Sean fields augments
supplies to meet peak demand on very cold
days in winter.
The partially depleted Rough field is used
as a major gas store. Gas is drawn from the
national transmission system in summer and
injected into the Rough reservoir for rapid
recovery during peak winter periods.
Remaining recoverable gas reserves in
present discoveries are estimated at between

700,000 million and 1.92 million million cubic
metres. If possible gas from existing
discoveries and potential future discoveries are
added, the remaining total reserves are
estimated to be in the range of 1.233 million
million to 3.7 million million cubic metres.
Britain’s offshore natural gas reserves are likely
to meet most of home demand well into the
next century.
Pipelines
Some 8,300 km (5,188 miles) of major
submarine pipeline transports hydrocarbons
from one field to another and to shore. Major
crude oil onshore pipelines (from harbours,
land terminals or offshore moorings to
refineries) include those connecting
Grangemouth to Finnart, Cruden Bay to
Grangemouth, and Purbeck to Southampton.
Onshore pipelines also carry refined
products to major marketing areas; for
example, a 423-km (263-mile) pipeline
runs from Milford Haven to the Midlands
and Manchester, while similar pipelines run
from Fawley to Wolverhampton and from
Lindsey to north London. Chemical
pipelines include one from Mossmorran
to Grangemouth and another (405 km;
252 miles) from Grangemouth to
Stanlow.
Five pipeline terminals on the North Sea
coast—Bacton (Norfolk), Theddlethorpe
(Lincolnshire), Easington and Dimlington
(Yorkshire) and St Fergus (Grampian), and
one in Barrow in Furness (Cumbria)—supply
a national and regional high- and low-pressure
pipeline system some 267,300 km (167,060
miles) long, which transports natural gas
around Great Britain. A pipeline taking natural
gas from Scotland to Northern Ireland carried
its first gas in autumn 1996. Other recently
built onshore natural gas pipelines run by
independent operators run from Horndon to
Barking (Essex), and Point of Ayr to Connah’s
Quay (Clwyd).
The national and regional pipeline network
is owned by TransCo, the transportation and
storage business of the privatised British Gas.
A network code between British Gas and its
competitors allows open access to the national
network of gas pipelines and storage systems.
Decommissioning
The Petroleum Act 1987 provides for the
decommissioning of redundant offshore oil
and gas installations and pipelines on the
UKCS. Government consent is required and
each application is examined on an individual
basis. Although sea disposal is consistent
with Britain’s international obligations,
abandonment of the Brent Spar storage and
loading buoy was postponed in summer 1995
while Shell assessed alternative solutions.
The Government has appointed an
independent and international group of
experts to examine the scientific evidence on
deep-sea disposal, with special reference to
the Brent Spar.
Offshore Safety
Offshore health and safety are the
responsibility of the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE; see p. 201). Government
funding for the HSE’s Offshore Safety
Division reached £23 million in 1995-96.
Offshore Supplies
The Oil, Gas and Petrochemicals Supplies
Office (OSO) of the DTI assists British
companies in supplying goods and services to
oil and gas projects, including petrochemicals,
in a world market worth over £210,000
million. It helps, for example, to develop new
technologies through R&D, and advises
companies taking part in promotional events,
such as ministerial visits, missions, exhibitions
and conferences.
The lEA’s latest forecasts attribute most of
the recent rise in North Sea output to new
medium-size fields coming on stream, a
process made possible by the British industry’s
Cost Reduction in the New Era initiative,
which has led to substantial falls in project
costs.
Research
The DTFs oil and gas division funds an
improved oil recovery programme and a
reservoir programme. These provide technical
support and expertise to ensure maximum
267
A
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
recovery of hydrocarbons from British fields,
for example, by achieving economic
production of viscous crude oil.
The DTI also takes part in R&D clubs.
These have undertaken work on horizontal and
multilateral wells, gas condensate reservoir
management, and fluid behaviour, at
universities such as Heriot-Watt, Exeter, and
Liverpool, and at Imperial College London.
Oil Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery consumption)
in 1995 included just under 22 million tonnes
of motor spirit, 13.4 million tonnes of DERY
fuel, 7.7 million tonnes of aviation turbine fuel,
7.2 million tonnes of gas oil and 8 million
tonnes of fuel oils.
Gas Consumption
Demand for gas has risen markedly since 1991.
In 1993 consumption grew by 12 per cent,
with a further 6 per cent each in 1994 and
1995. Sales of natural gas in Britain totalled
804 terawatt4 hours (TWh) in 1995. About 35
per cent (282 TWh) of this is for industrial and
commercial purposes (172 TWh and 110 TWh
respectively); 326 TWh were sold to domestic
users.
Industrial gas prices have fallen by 48 per
cent in real terms since privatisation in 1986,
and domestic prices by 24 per cent. Natural
gas accounted for about a third of final
consumption of energy in 1995.
Oil Refineries
In 1995 Britain’s 14 refineries processed 92.7
million tonnes of crude and process oils (a
fraction down on 1994). About 80 per cent of
output (by weight) is in the form of lighter,
higher-value products such as gasoline, DERV
and jet kerosene. By comparison, the
proportion of Western European refinery
output accounted for by these higher-value
products (including orimulsion) is about 70
per cent.
41 TW = 1,000 gigawatts. 1 GW = 1,000 MW.
Trade
In 1995, Britain’s refinery sector exported 26.2
million tonnes of refined petroleum products
and NGLs (separated at North Sea terminals),
30 per cent of its output (worth £1,133 million
to the balance of payments). Virtually all exports
went to Britain’s partners in the EU and the
IE A, the largest markets being France, the Irish
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany,
and, outside the EU, the United States.
GAS SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Industry
The Government has progressively introduced
competition in gas supply since 1986 and there
is now an open supply market above the 2,500-
therm threshold, with all companies using
British Gas’s pipeline network.
The Gas Act 1995 creates a new regulatory
framework extending competition to
residential consumers throughout Great
Britain. This is to take place in three stages:
• From 1996 in south-west England, in an
area covering 500,000 consumers;
• From 1997 in south-east England,
enlarging the market to 2 million; and
• From 1998 throughout England and
Scotland to 18 million consumers.
Three separate classes of licence will be
issued to:
• Public Gas Transporters (PGTs), firms
operating a pipeline system and
contracting with gas shippers to transport
gas;
• Gas Shippers, who arrange with a PGT for
gas to be conveyed through its pipeline
system; and
• Gas Suppliers, companies which sell gas to
consumers and are also the consumers’
point of contact.
The Network Code (see above) defines the
rights and responsibilities of all users of the gas
transportation system. The Gas Act 1995
required British Gas to separate its activities
between the parent and a subsidiary company,
British Gas Trading Ltd, because the same
268
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
corporate entity is not permitted to hold both a
PGT licence and a supplier’s licence. British
Gas has announced plans to take the company
separation further and demerge, in 1997, into
two separately listed companies: British Gas
Energy and TransCo International.
Competition
Some ten suppliers (including British Gas)
competed at the launch of the pilot project in
south-west England at the end of April 1996.
New suppliers have been offering price savings
of 15 per cent and above over British Gas’s
tariffs. At the end of 1995 British Gas’s share
of the commercial and industrial markets in
Britain was some 35 per cent.
An excess of supply over demand in 1995 (a
‘gas bubble’) has depressed the spot price of
gas below levels previously considered
possible. British Gas and other competitors are
now contracted to buy gas at prices
substantially above the present market level.
British Gas has been discussing a possible
renegotiation of contracts with producers.
In May 1996 the Office of Gas Supply
(Ofgas) published its initial proposals for the
TransCo price review, which would lead to a
significant reduction in TransCo’s prices and
in consumers’ bills. Ofgas announced its final
plans in August.
COAL
The size of the British coal industry has
reduced drastically since the 1960s. Yet coal
mining in Britain can be traced back to Roman
times. Taxes raised on its sale helped pay for
rebuilding London, and St Paul’s Cathedral,
after the Great Fire of 1666. Coal played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the
18th and 19th centuries. In its peak year, 1913,
the industry produced 292 million tonnes of
coal, exported 74 million tonnes and employed
over a million workers. In 1947 (when 200
million tonnes were produced) the coal mines
passed into public ownership, and the National
Coal Board (now British Coal) was set up.5 In
’British Coal continues to have residual functions in
1996-97.
1955 there were 850 British Coal collieries in
operation. Its mining activities were privatised
at the end of 1994. At the end of 1995, 32 large
deep mines were operating in the private
sector, employing about 13,500 mineworkers.
Coal Authority
Set up under the Coal Industry Act 1994, the
Coal Authority took over ownership of coal
reserves from British Coal. It licenses
coal-mining; holds, manages and disposes of
interests in unworked coal and coal mines;
provides information about mining plans and
geological data; and deals with subsidence and
damage claims in former mining areas.
Market for Coal
In 1995 inland consumption of coal was 77
million tonnes, of which about 78 per cent was
by electricity generators, 11 per cent by coke
ovens and 3.7 per cent by domestic users.
Exports were 0.9 million tonnes, while imports
amounted to 15.9 million tonnes.
Production
Total production from deep mines rose from
31.9 million tonnes in 1994 to 35.1 million
tonnes in 1995, thus reversing the decline of
deep-mine production.
At the end of 1995, 91 opencast sites were
in operation. Total opencast output fell from
16.8 million tonnes in 1994 to 16.4 million in
1995.
Coal Research
The Government aims to secure a strong
industrial base to commercialise clean coal
technologies by encouraging collaboration
between industry, universities and
organisations overseas. It has allotted some
£5.7 million to research in 1996-97.

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
below), sell electricity to suppliers through a
market known as the pool. The National Grid
(NGC) owns and operates the transmission
system, transferring electricity in bulk across
the national grid.
Distribution—the transfer of electricity
from the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs). Supply is the
purchase of electricity from generators and its
sale to customers. Until 1998 RECs have a
monopoly of all franchise sales (to consumers
taking 100 kW or less) in their regions. These
RECs are known as first-tier suppliers. Above
100 kW the market is already open to
competition, and consumers may have
contracts with a second-tier supplier, who
could be one of the generators, an REC from a
different region, or an independent supplier.
With the expiry in March 1995 of the
Government’s special shares in the English
and Welsh RECs, take-overs within the
electricity market became possible. Ownership
of seven of the 12 RECs has now changed.
After the disposal of 6,000 MW of their
coal-fired plant by National Power and
PowerGen, Eastern Group is also a significant
generator, with some 8 per cent of the market.
In April 1996, however, the Government
disallowed National Power’s bid for Southern
Electric and PowerGen’s for Midlands
Electricity on the grounds that they would be
detrimental to competition, given the current
state of the electricity market.
Scotland
ScottishPower pic and Scottish Hydro-Electric
pic generate, transmit, distribute and supply
electricity. They are also contracted to buy all
the output from Scottish Nuclear Ltd.
Associated Functions
The Electricity Association is the main trade
association for the electricity industry. It
carries out certain service and co-ordinating
functions for its members, which include the
transmission, supply and main generator
companies in Britain. Regulation of the
industry is primarily the responsibility of the
Office of Electricity Regulation, headed by the
L
Director General of Electricity Supply
(DGES), whose duties include the promotion
of competition and the protection of consumer
interests.
Northern Ireland
Responsibility for transmission, distribution
and supply of electricity lies with Northern
Ireland Electricity (NIE) pic, privatised in
1993. Three private companies generate
electricity from four power stations. The
largest power station, Ballylumford, is being
converted from oil to gas firing and accounts
for almost half Northern Ireland’s generating
capacity (2,243 MW). Regulation of the
industry is the responsibility of the Office of
Electricity Regulation (NI), headed by the
DGES (NI).
Consumption
In 1995 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in Britain amounted to
290.76 TWh. Domestic users took 35 per cent
of the total, industry 33 per cent, and
commercial and other users the remainder.
Generation
Since 1989, 15 new companies have entered
electricity generation in Britain, bringing the
total number in this field to 27.
According to the NGC’s Seven Year
Statement, National Power’s 28 fossil-fuelled
power stations, together with its five hydro
schemes, generate about 35 per cent of the
electricity supplied to the transmission and
distribution networks in England and Wales.
PowerGen’s 17 fossil-fuelled power stations
and other, renewable, schemes together
generate about 26 per cent. The nuclear
stations in Great Britain generate almost 27
per cent. The NGC’s pumped-storage
business, now known as First Hydro, has been
sold to Mission Energy, subsidiary of a US
electricity producer.
In 1995-96, 44 per cent of electricity
generated in Scotland was produced by
Scottish Nuclear’s two stations. In addition to
nuclear generation, Scotland’s electricity needs
are met from hydro, coal, and gas—a total

Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
output capacity of approximately 9,700 MW.
Scottish Nuclear sells 74.9 per cent of its
output to ScottishPower and the rest to
Hydro-Electric.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by
Britain’s major power producers consumed 50
million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1995, of
which coal accounted for 70 per cent, natural
gas 23 per cent and oil 6 per cent.
Other power producers, and an increasing
number of small ‘autogenerators’ (who
produce power for their own use), have equal
access with the major generators to the grid
transmission and local distribution systems.
In 1995 installation and commissioning of
flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment, to
control acid emissions, were completed at
PowerGen’s 2 GW Ratcliffe station
(Leicestershire). Early in 1996 all six
generating units at National Power’s Drax
station (North Yorkshire) operated with FGD.
A ten-year programme to control emissions of
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) through the
installation of low-NOx burners at 12 major
power stations in England and Wales is in
progress. ScottishPower is fitting low-NOx
burners at Longannet and Cockenzie.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines
In 1995, CCGTs accounted for about 16 per
cent of the electricity generated by major
power producers, compared with 8 per cent in
1993. This increase has been balanced by a fall
in coal- and oil-fired generation.
CCGTs tend to be quicker and cheaper to
build and operate than conventional plant, and
the fuel efficiency of CCGT technology
continues to improve. They use natural gas, at
present a cheaper fuel, and give out almost no
sulphur dioxide and some 55 per cent less C02
than coal-fired plant. In England and Wales,
16 such stations (total declared net capacity
9.05 GW) are generating electricity. About 5
GW of CCGT capacity is under construction.
(Between the winters of 1994-95 and 1995-96
National Power and PowerGen mothballed 2.3
GW of coal- and oil-fired capacity.)
Exports
The NGC and Electricite de France run a
2,000-MW cross-Channel cable link,
providing for the transmission of electricity
between the two countries. The link has
generally been used to supply baseload
electricity—power that needs to be generated
and available round the clock—from France to
England. Imports met about 5 per cent of
Britain’s electricity needs in 1995.
Some of Scotland’s capacity is exported to
England and Wales. Transmission lines linking
the Scottish and English grid systems enable
cross-border trading. This interconnector’s
272
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
capacity is now 1,600 MW and there are plans
to increase it to 2,200 MW in 1997. The
Government will decide about a 250-MW
undersea-cable interconnector between
Scotland and Northern Ireland when it has
considered the reports of two public inquiries.
Nuclear Power
After the Government’s Nuclear Review in
1995, the nuclear industry in Britain was
substantially restructured in preparation for
privatisation in July 1996. Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear became wholly owned
subsidiaries of British Energy. Nuclear
Electric operates the five Advanced Gas-cooled
Reactor stations (AGRs) in England and
Britain’s first pressurised water reactor (PWR)
at Sizewell (Suffolk). They have an aggregate
capacity of 7,200 MW and in 1995-96 an
output of over 43 TWh—equivalent to about
15 per cent of current sales demand in England
and Wales. Scottish Nuclear operates two
AGR stations with an aggregate capacity of
about 2,400 MW and output of 17.6 TWh in
1995-96—about 55 per cent of Scottish
electricity sales. A third nuclear generator,
Magnox Electric, will remain in the public
sector and own the older Magnox stations. Six
of these are operational and three others have
closed and are being decommissioned.
Factors influencing privatisation were:
reduced uncertainties about the costs of
managing spent nuclear fuel, waste, and
decommissioning plant; considerably
improved AGR performance; and the start of
operations at Sizewell B PWR in January 1995.
The review also concluded that while nuclear
power has diversity of supply and
environmental advantages, there is no wider
economic case for funding new nuclear
stations. British Energy will be responsible for
the liabilities associated with its assets. Station
decommissioning costs will be met through a
segregated fund, with a ^230 million initial
endowment from the companies and further
annual payments set independently.
The Government concluded that premium
payments to Nuclear Electric under the
non-fossil fuel levy should end on
privatisation, except to allow Magnox Electric
to collect sums due to it but unpaid before
privatisation. This enabled the levy rate to
reduce from 10 per cent to 3.7 per cent. The
levy will continue to cover British Nuclear
Fuels (BNFL) and renewables. It does not
apply in Scotland, where, under the Nuclear
Energy Agreement (NEA), ScottishPower and
Hydro-Electric have contracted to take all of
the electricity generated by Scottish Nuclear
Ltd until 2005. With privatisation the
premium element of the NEA has ceased.
Scottish Nuclear’s income under the NEA
now depends on the market rate in England
and Wales.
British Nuclear Fuels
BNFL, owned by the Government, provides
nuclear fuel cycle services both in Britain and
overseas. In 1995-96 BNFL sheared and
dissolved over 200 tonnes of spent fuel at its
thermal oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) at
Sellafield (Cumbria). THORP’s first ten years
are fully committed, with orders from Britain
and overseas. Some 40 per cent of the second
ten years’ capacity has also been sold. The
Sellafield Mixed Oxide Fuel plant, due to
become operational in late 1997, will blend
plutonium recovered from reprocessing with
uranium, to make mixed oxide fuel for use in
reactors. A subsidiary company, BNFL Inc,
continues to win contracts for restoring
redundant facilities and dealing with
radioactive material from the United States
defence programme.
AEA Technology
AEA Technology pic is an international
business which provides science and
engineering services to the worldwide nuclear
industry and to other industrial sectors. In
1994-95 its turnover was £257 million. The
Government privatised AEA Technology pic
in 1996.
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
UKAEA is responsible for the safe and
cost-effective maintenance and
decommissioning of its redundant nuclear
facilities used for Britain’s nuclear R&D
programme. UKAEA owns sites from
273
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Caithness to Dorset and is also responsible for
Britain’s fusion programme (see below).
Nuclear Research
The Government plans to spend £14.6 million
in 1996—97 on fusion research. About half of
this is Britain’s contribution to the EU Joint
European Torus nuclear project at Culham
(Oxfordshire). EU member states have agreed
in principle to extend it to the end of 1999.
The DTI also funds assessments of
advanced reactor safety and of international
safety standards, and the transfer of technology
to help improve nuclear safety in the former
Soviet Union, and in central and eastern
Europe.
Nuclear Safety
In Britain responsibility for ensuring the safety
of nuclear installations falls to nuclear
operators and is assured through a rigorous
system of regulatory control enforced by the
nuclear industry’s independent regulator, the
HSE’s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
(Nil).
Through the licensing regime, the Nil has
extensive powers to ensure that operators
apply high standards of safety in the design,
construction, operation and eventual
decommissioning of nuclear installations. This
includes constant monitoring and assessment
of plant and the power to require
improvements and ultimately to close an
installation if not satisfied with its safety.
Monitoring ensures that any potential
safety problems are avoided or dealt with at an
early stage. In order to take account of
privatisation, the Nil has now issued all
nuclear sites in Britain with replacement site
licences. The process of relicensing the sites
involved Nil’s detailed scrutiny of the
proposed new arrangements for managing
safety at each site. It concluded that all
licensees had adequate resources, experience
and arrangements to ensure safety at nuclear
sites.
Discharges of radioactive waste have to be
kept within the limits and conditions set by
authorisations granted under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993. Within maximum dose
limits, operators of nuclear facilities have to
keep discharges as low as reasonably achievable
and failure to do so makes them liable to
prosecution.
Britain is one of 62 signatories to the
Nuclear Safety Convention agreed in Vienna
in 1994. Each signatory will produce a national
report on its performance against a range of
nuclear safety obligations set out in the
Convention.
Britain’s main contribution to the
international effort to improve safety in central
and eastern Europe and in the former Soviet
Union is channelled through EU assistance
programmes. In addition, Britain has
contributed £18.25 million to the Nuclear
Safety Account managed by the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which is funding urgent improvements to
higher-risk plants in Bulgaria, Lithuania and
Russia. (A project for Chernobyl in Ukraine is
currently being finalised.)
International attention focuses on
implementing the G7/Ukraine Memorandum
of Understanding, signed on 20 December
1995, on the closure of Chernobyl by 2000.
Emergency Plans
The precautions taken in the design and
construction of nuclear installations in Britain,
and the care taken in their operation and
maintenance, reduce the chance of accidents
which might affect the public to an extremely
low level. However, all operators are required,
as a condition of their site licences, to prepare
emergency plans, including those for dealing
with an accidental release of radioactivity.
These are regularly tested in exercises
witnessed by the NIL
International conventions exist for early
notification of a nuclear accident which may
have possible transboundary effects, and on
the mutual provision of assistance in the event
of a nuclear accident or radiological
emergency.

they have prospects of being economically
attractive and environmentally acceptable. It is
working towards 1,500 MW (3 per cent of
Britain’s current requirements) of new
electricity generating capacity from renewable
energy sources, for Britain as a whole, by 2000.
The non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO) is
used to provide a guaranteed market for the
most promising forms of renewable generation.
NFFO Orders place a legal obligation on the
RECs to contract for specified amounts of
electricity from specified non-fossil sources.
The extra costs to the RECs of paying above
the pool price are met from the fossil fuel levy
paid by licensed electricity suppliers.
Three renewables Orders have been made
for England and Wales and one each (in 1994)
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. At the end
of March 1996, 151 projects contracted in
England and Wales under the first three
Orders (NFFO-1-3) were operating, with a
declared net capacity of 335 MW. The first
Scottish Renewables Order (SRO) was for 76
MW capacity. Proposals for NFFO-4 (some
400-500 MW of contracted capacity) and
SRO-2 (70-80 MW of contracted capacity),
and a second Northern Ireland Order (45 MW
of contracted capacity), are due to be made
Orders in early 1997.
The NFFO has encouraged the best
wind resource in Europe (66 MW
operating capacity in Britain), with
turbines (average capacity
300-400 kW) in small clusters, and in
wind farms of up to 100 machines.
Capacity provided by energy from
waste exceeds 100 MW, while 119 MW
of sewage gas and landfill gas plant is
currently generating. In the energy
crop sector, the development of
agricultural waste and forestry waste
is making progress, with 25 MW of
plant in operation.
Some 21 MW of hydro capacity, a proved
and commercial technology, operates under
NFFO arrangements. However, there is little
scope for further development of large-scale
hydro in Britain. The greatest potential use for
photovoltaics (PV) within Britain is for
building-integrated systems, in which energy
generated can supplement mains supplies. The
Government has supported the installation of
PV cladding at the University of Northumbria
at Newcastle.
International collaboration is undertaken
through multilateral and bilateral
arrangements within the IEA and the EU.
JOULE-THERMIE is an EU programme
which aims to reduce harmful emissions
through the introduction of renewables into
Europe’s energy systems, and the improved
conversion and use of energy. Its budget is
1,000 million ECU (£750 million) over four
years. Many British companies receive funding
from this source.
Non-energy Minerals
Output of non-energy minerals in 1994
totalled 353 million tonnes, valued at £2,010
million. Construction raw materials, in
particular aggregates, form the bulk, but their

production declined in 1995. The total number
of employees in the extractive industry was
some 30,000 in 1994.
Exploration and Development
The Environment Act 1995 provides for a
review of mineral sites with planning
permissions in England and Wales granted
between 1948 and 1982. No minerals
development may be carried out on a dormant
site (as distinct from an active site) until a new
scheme of conditions has been approved by the
local minerals planning authority.
Development of minerals planning policy is
supported across the whole of Britain by
research carried out under the Department of
the Environment’s Geological and Minerals
planning research programme.
In June 1996 revised Minerals Planning
Guidance for England was issued which will
help industry to bring forward development
proposals which satisfy the environmental
concerns of site operation and restoration, and
accord with the principles of sustainable
development. English Guidance for the
provision of aggregates is looking for less
reliance on traditional land-won sources, with
a doubling of recycled and secondary material
by the year 2006. Where environmentally
acceptable, coastal superquarries may make an
increased contribution to English aggregate
supplies. Scottish Office Guidance sets limits
of no more than four superquarries in Scotland
over the period to 2009.
The British Geological Survey’s long-term
minerals reconnaissance programme for the
DTI described six new areas with mineral
potential in Britain in 1995.
In Wales some 2,000 tonnes of gold ore a
year come from the Gwynfynydd mine, and
the nearby Clogau mine has been reopened.
Production at the underground gold mine at
Cononish, near Tyndrum (Perthshire), is
expected to start in 1997. Published plans for
the open pit mine at Cavanacaw in Northern
Ireland suggest an annual production of 12,000
oz (373 kg) of gold and 15,000 oz (466 kg) of
silver.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1994, sand and gravel £489 million, clays £298
million (with china clay valued at £220
million), igneous rock £248 million, sandstone
£91 million, potash £83 million, salt £62
million, chalk £44 million, silica sands £40
million, gypsum and anhydrite £18 million,
fluorspar £7 million and tin £6 million. In
1994 the production of metals in non-ferrous
ores totalled 3,900 tonnes, mainly lead, and tin
from Cornwall. In 1995 South Crofty, the one
remaining Cornish tin mine and one of the
very few sources of tin in the EU, produced
1,971 tonnes of tin-in-concentrate, a 2 per cent
increase on 1994 and equivalent to about 20
per cent of Britain’s demand.
Water
About 75 per cent of Britain’s water supplies
are obtained from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, reservoirs and river intakes;
and about 25 per cent from groundwater. In
spring 1995 reservoirs were more than 95 per
cent full after one of the wettest winters on
record. By contrast summer 1995 and winter
1995-96 were exceptionally dry, and some
reservoirs in north and south-west England
were less than half full in spring 1996.
Scotland has a relative abundance of
unpolluted water from upland sources, and
Northern Ireland also has abundant supplies
for domestic use and for industry.
About 99 per cent of the population in
Great Britain and 97 per cent in Northern
Ireland are served by the public water supply
system. Water put into this system (including
industrial and other uses) in England and
Wales amounted to 17,087 megalitres (Ml) a
day in 1994-95, of which average domestic
daily consumption per household was
estimated at 380 litres. An average of 2,263 Ml
a day was supplied in Scotland in 1994-95. In
Northern Ireland the figure was 686 Ml a day. ,
Some 53,648 Ml a day were abstracted in
England and Wales in 1994, of which public
water supplies accounted for 16,735 Ml a day.
The electricity generating companies and other
industry took 27,732 Ml a day; fish farming,
cress growing and amenity ponds 3,983 Ml a
day; and agriculture 119 Ml a day, with spray
irrigation accounting for a further 285 Ml a day.
England and Wales
The Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Wales are responsible for the statutory
structure under which the Director General of
Water Services and the Environment Agency
are the principal regulators of the water
industry in England and Wales. The Director
General is responsible for the economic
regulations of the water industry. The
Environment Agency is responsible for the
regulation of the water environment. The
Drinking Water Inspectorate regulates
drinking water quality. The Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
Secretary of State for Wales are responsible for
policy relating to land drainage, flood
protection, sea defence, and the protection and
development of inland and coastal fisheries.
Water Companies
The ten water service companies have
statutory responsibilities for water supply, its
quality and sufficiency, and for sewerage and
sewage treatment. The supply-only
companies, of which there were 29 in the
private sector in 1989, now, after various
mergers, number 19. They supply water to
nearly a quarter of the population.
The companies determine their own
methods of charging—usually on the basis of
the former rateable value of the property to
which water is supplied. In the Government’s
view, metering is the fairest way of paying for
water. In general, companies require new
properties and those substantially converted to
have metered supplies. Most commercial and
industrial concerns are now metered.
A system of economic regulation and
guaranteed standards of service is overseen by
Ofwat, the Office of Water Services. The
Director General has a duty to ensure that
water companies are able to finance the
carrying-out of their statutory obligations; to
promote economy and efficiency within the
water industry and, where appropriate,
competition (see below); to protect the
interests of customers; and to ensure that there
is no undue preference or discrimination in the
fixing of charges. The Director General also
sets limits to the rate at which water companies
can increase their prices.
278
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Over 99 per cent of the population is
connected to mains drinking water supplies.
These supplies are of high quality and all are
safe to drink. In 1994 (the latest year for which
data have been collated) over 99 per cent of the
nearly 3.5 million tests carried out showed
compliance with the relevant drinking water
quality standards. In Britain some of these
standards are stricter than those in the EC
drinking water directive, and have been set to
provide additional protection for public health.
The remaining standards are in line with what
the directive requires.
Environment Agency
The statutory duties and powers of the
Environment Agency (see p. 355), which took
over the functions of the National Rivers
Authority (NRA) on 1 April 1996, include
regulation of the water environment—for
example, management of water resources and
pollution control; flood defence, fisheries,
recreation, and conservation; and some
navigation duties and operations in England
and Wales. Its responsibilities extend to all
rivers, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, coastal
waters and water stored naturally
underground. Its consent is needed for the
abstraction of water and the discharge of
effluent.
During 1994—95 the NRA (with an
estimated expenditure of £438.7 million)
investigated 35,000 pollution incidents,
successfully prosecuted 316 polluters (with
fines totalling nearly £1 million) and inspected
and monitored 19,000 abstraction licences and
14,000 discharge consents.
Ensuring Supplies
Since 1990-91, the water companies have
invested over £17,000 million in improving
their operations, efficiency and service. In
1995-96 they announced planned investment
of over £400 million to ensure supplies in the
event of further drought during 1996-97.
Ofwat has set the water companies a one-year
deadline to bring down leakage levels or face
the prospect of mandatory targets.
Husbanding of precious resources and
difficulties in meeting peak demand have
emphasised the need for a proper framework
for water management—balancing customers’
expectations, the cost of providing the service,
and protecting the environment. In a period of
changing patterns of, and demand for, water
use, the Government points to the need for
water companies to:
• understand better the present and likely
future demands for water;
• introduce selective metering and
appropriate tariff structures to influence
demand, particularly for inessential uses
of water; and
• promote the efficient use of water by
customers, as required in a new statutory
duty.
Competition
In April 1996 a government consultation
document outlined proposals for competition
in the water supply industry. These include:
• introduction of ‘common carriage’
arrangements, whereby suppliers compete
for customers through the shared use of
water mains;
• extending the scope for ‘inset
appointments’ to allow a new water or
waste water undertaker to supply an area
within an existing undertaker’s area; and
• removing the restrictions on cross border
supply to enable a water undertaker to
provide water for non-domestic purposes
to customers within another undertaker’s
area.
Scotland
In Scotland, since April 1996, responsibility
for public water supply, sewerage and sewage
disposal rests with three public water
authorities, North, West and East of Scotland
Water Authorities. The Scottish Water and
Sewerage Customers Council, a body set up in
1995 to protect and represent all customers of
the new water authorities, is financed by an
annual levy on the authorities.
The Secretary of State for Scotland and the
water authorities are responsible for promoting
conservation and effective use of water
279
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
resources and provision of adequate water
supplies. He has a duty to promote the
cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters,
and the tidal waters of Scotland. Also from
April 1996, the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency took over statutory
responsibility for water pollution control from
the Scottish river purification authorities.
Charging for water supply accords with
type of consumer: domestic consumers pay
water charges based on their council tax band
or metered charges; non-domestic consumers
pay non-domestic water rates, or metered
charges. For sewerage services, domestic
consumers pay a sewerage charge based on
their council tax band, and non-domestic
consumers pay non-domestic sewerage rates
and, where appropriate, trade effluent charges.
Charges and rates are decided by each water
authority with the agreement and approval of
the Customers Council.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout
Northern Ireland. It is also responsible for the
conservation and cleanliness of water resources
and, with the Department of Agriculture, may
prepare a water management programme with
respect to water resources in any area. A
domestic water charge is contained in the
regional rate, while agriculture, commerce and
industry pay metered charges.
Research
Several organisations and centres of expertise
provide water research services to government,
the Environment Agency, water undertakers
and the Scottish Environment Protection
Agency.
Research carried out by institutes of the
Natural Environment Research Council (see p.
333) embraces river modelling, water quality,
climate change, effects on resources and the
impact of pollution on freshwater.
Among its various roles the Institute of
Hydrology studies the statistics of floods and
droughts.

Total income from farming in Britain is estimated to have risen 22 per cent
in real terms between 1994 and 1995. The Government has continued to
expand the role of incentive schemes which can be used to secure
environmentally beneficial management of agricultural land. In particular,
there will be a major expansion of the Countryside Stewardship scheme.
Britain has sustained pressure to apply improved animal welfare standards
throughout Europe. In response to concerns over BSE (a fatal disease in cattle
that may be transmissible to humans), Britain is taking a number of
measures with the aim of resuming exports of British beef and beef
products.
In response to the need to conserve fish stocks, £26 million was spent on the
decommissioning of fishing boats between 1993 and 1995. Scotland has
maintained its place as the largest producer of farmed salmon in the EU.
Agriculture
In 1995 British agriculture employed 2.1 per
cent of the total workforce. Food, feed and
beverages again accounted for about 10 per
cent of Britain’s imports by value. The
agricultural contribution to gross domestic
product (GDP) was £9,000 million in 1995,
1.5 per cent of the total. Britain is a major
agricultural exporter—of livestock, food
products, agrochemicals and agricultural
machinery.
In October 1995 the Government published
a White Paper, Rural England: a Nation
Committed to a Living Countryside, jointly
produced by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the
Department of the Environment. The White
Paper comprehensively reviews rural policies
and covers economic, social and environmental
issues affecting today’s countryside. It sets out
objectives for the countryside and actions to
support them.
The White Paper also makes clear its
overall objective for agriculture: an efficient,
prosperous and outward-looking industry able
to operate in increasingly open world markets,
providing high-quality raw materials at
competitive prices for the domestic food
industry and paying due regard to public
health and the environment. The key to this,
the Government believes, lies with progressive
281
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reductions in production-related support and
the eventual abolition of supply controls,
within the competing framework of a common
European Union (EU) agricultural policy
avoiding national subsidies.
The White Paper announced the transfer of
the Countryside Stewardship scheme from the
Countryside Commission to MAFF. It also
highlighted government progress with
innovative projects for improving the economy
of the most disadvantaged rural areas under
Objective 5b of the European Structures
Initiative.
The Government published a progress
report in October 1996, on how Rural
England commitments have developed over
the year.
In Rural Scotland: People, Prosperity and
Partnership, published in December 1995, the
Government also recognises that agricultural
and other traditional land uses still have great
importance in rural communities. While
changes in support arrangements are essential,
that support should be better targeted to meet
the needs of such communities.
MAFF has published 21 customer service
standards in accordance with the principles
of the Citizen’s Charter (see pp. 69-70).
MAFF’s regional administrative structure
consists of nine Regional Service Centres
(RSCs), at Bristol, Cambridge, Carlisle,
Crewe, Exeter, Northallerton, Nottingham,
Reading and Worcester. Their work relates
to payments under domestic and EU
schemes, licensing and various other services
provided to farmers and growers. Within
available resources, the Centres aim to
administer the schemes efficiently, providing
the best possible service consistent with the
need to prevent fraud and to avoid
EU-imposed penalties. An independent
survey in 1995 showed that nearly 90 per
cent of customers rated RSC service as good
or better.
The ten MAFF Inspectorates (such as the
Fatstock Inspectorate, the Sea Fisheries
Inspectorate, or the Plant Health and Seeds
Inspectorate) enforce quality and health
standards in animals, fish, and crops. Six
MAFF executive agencies conduct regular
customer satisfaction surveys. The Scottish
Office Agriculture, Environment and
Fisheries Department (SOAEFD) sets out its
standards of service and performance targets
in charter standard statements called Serving
Scottish Farmers and Serving-Crofting.
Land Use
In 1995, as in 1994, there were 11.3 hectares
(27.9 million acres) under crops and grass. A
further 5.8 million hectares (14.3 million
acres) were used for rough grazing, most of it
in hilly areas. Soils vary from the thin poor
ones of highland Britain to the rich fertile
soils of low-lying areas, such as the fenlands
of eastern England. The climate is generally
temperate, though rainfall distribution over
Britain is uneven. The South East receives
only about 600 mm (24 inches) a year,
compared with over 1,500 mm (59 inches)
in parts of west Scotland, Cumbria and
Wales.
Land Use in Britain
Farming
In 1995 there were some 234,900 farm
holdings in Britain (excluding minor holdings
too small to be surveyed on a regular basis),
with an average area of 72.4 hectares (178.9
acres)—again excluding minor holdings.
About two-thirds of all agricultural land is

owner-occupied. Some 44 per cent of holdings
are smaller than 8 European size units (ESU).1
Labour productivity increased by 25.9 per
cent during 1985-95. Total income from
farming (that of farmers, partners, directors
and their spouses, and family workers—see
Table 18.1) was estimated at £5,044 million in
1995, 25.6 per cent more (at current prices)
than in 1994. In real terms this measure of
income is about 49 per cent higher than in the
mid-1980s. Conditions contributing to this
increase include:
• favourable weather;
• high world prices for some basic
commodities, including cereals; and
• the increasing value of EU payments to
farmers in respect of, for example, setting
land aside.
At the end of 1994 the industry’s gross
capital stock, valued at 1990 prices, amounted
to nearly £34,000 million, of which buildings
and works made up just under two-thirds. The
level of capital stock is now estimated to be
some 1.3 per cent below the 1984-86 average.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 18.2 as a percentage by weight
of total supplies. Total new supply is home
production plus imports less exports. It may be
augmented (or reduced) by a decrease (or
increase) in stocks. The result is described as
‘total domestic uses’.
Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairy farming or to beef cattle and
sheep. The majority of sheep and cattle are
reared in the hill and moorland areas of
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
northern and south-western England. British
livestock breeders have developed many of the
cattle, sheep and pig breeds with worldwide
reputations, for example, the Hereford and
Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey,
Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large
White pigs and a number of sheep breeds.
Britain is an exporter of semen and embryos
from high-quality donor animals, but has been
forced to stop sales abroad because of the EU
ban on beef products (see below). Livestock
totals are given in Table 18.3.
'ESUs measure the financial potential of the holding in
terms of the margins which might be expected from stock
and crops. 8 ESU is judged the minimum for full-time
holdings.

the sector, followed by cattle and calves, and
then fat sheep and lambs. Most dairy cattle in

litres (1,180 gallons). Average household
consumption of liquid (including low-fat) milk
per head in 1995 was 1,881 millilitres (3.31
pints) a week.
More than half of home-fed beef
production originates from the national
dairy herd, in which the Holstein Friesian
breed is predominant. The remainder is
derived from suckler herds producing
high-quality beef calves, mostly in the hills
and uplands. The traditional British beef
breeds (see above) and, increasingly,
imported breeds such as Charolais,
Limousin, Simmental and Belgian Blue, are
used for beef production. In 1995 the size of

the beef-breeding herd continued to
expand—by 2 per cent. The dairy herd
decreased by 4 per cent.
In spring 1996 the announcement of a
possible link between Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in humans caused considerable damage
to the beef market in Britain and resulted in an
EU worldwide ban on British beef and beef
products. Among government measures to
protect public and animal health, restore
confidence and maintain the stability of the
beef supply chain were:
• a ban on the sale of meat from cattle over
30 months old (subsequently amended to
allow meat from herds with a very low risk
of BSE to be sold up to the age of 42
months;
• a ban on the removal of any meat from the
head except for the tongue;
• the recall of all meat and bone feed from
farms, manufacturers and merchants;
• the prohibition of the sale and use of meat
and bone meal in all animal feed and as
fertiliser on agricultural land;
• aid schemes for the slaughtering and
rendering sectors; and
• voluntary schemes for the disposal of
unsaleable beef stocks.
Britain has a tradition of sheep production,
with more than 60 native breeds and many

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cross-bred varieties. Sheepmeat production is
the main source of income for sheep farmers,
and wool provides additional return.
Grass (including silage) covers most
British agricultural land and supplies 60-80
per cent of the feed for cattle and sheep.
Grass production has been enhanced by the
increased use of fertilisers, methods of
grazing control, and improved herbage
conservation for winter feed. Certain sheep
and cattle feed extensively on rough grazings,
producing young animals for fattening
elsewhere.
The Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS), an EU-wide anti-fraud
measure, requires farmers to submit an annual
application giving field-by-field details of their
farmed land. This serves as a basis for
administrative and on-farm checks on their
entitlement to aid under area-based Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) schemes. Essential
features of the IACS are systems for uniquely
identifying farmers’ fields and animals. Details
of farmers’ IACS applications and the results
of checks are stored in a computerised
database.
Pigs
Pig production occurs in most areas but is
particularly important in East Anglia and
Yorkshire. There is an increasing
concentration into larger breeding
units—about 20 per cent of holdings with
breeding sows account for 80 per cent of the
national breeding herd, which comprises
some 750,000 sows. Britain is broadly
self-sufficient in pork and exports to such
destinations as Germany, Italy, France,
Japan and Korea. However, bacon is
imported from Denmark, the Netherlands
and the Irish Republic. Pig breeding
companies in Britain supply about 8 per cent
of the genetically improved pigs and sows
bought by the world’s pig farmers.
Poultry
Britain’s more efficient poultry industry owes
much to high husbandry standards and the use
of improved genetic stock. The increase in
demand is partly satisfied by imports. Poultry
production in 1995 was 1.22 million tonnes—a
small increase on 1994. Broiler production, at
948,000 tonnes, was 54,000 tonnes above the
level for 1994. Broilers from the 9 per cent of
holdings with over 100,000 table birds account
for well over a half of the total flock. Hen eggs
went up from 885 million dozen in 1994 to 887
million dozen in 1995. Britain remains almost
self-sufficient in poultry meat and eggs (see
Table 18.2).
Animal Welfare
Public interest in farm animal welfare in
Britain is traditionally high. During 1995,
MAFF ministers answered 209 parliamentary
questions on the subject and 23,000
letters^—20 per cent of the Ministry’s
correspondence. The Government expects
high welfare standards on farms, during
transport and at abattoirs. It receives advice
from the Farm Animal Welfare Council and
from government animal welfare research
programmes.
In 1995 public awareness and concern
focused on the welfare of animals in transit.
The Government applies tight welfare controls
to alternative export routes set up after the
decision of the major ferry companies in 1994
to stop carrying live food animals from Britain.
In June 1995 the EU adopted new rules, to be
implemented by 31 December 1996, on animal
welfare in transit. These set:
• maximum journey times;
• feeding and watering intervals; and
• new enforcement measures, including a
system of licensing for transporters of
livestock.
Britain has also been pressing for the
welfare standards for rearing calves across
Europe to be brought up to the level which
applies here. Pressure from Britain resulted in
new EU proposals (January 1996) for a ban on
veal crates and for calves to be housed in
groups.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and
central-southern England and eastern
286
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
Scotland. The main crops are shown in Table
18.4. In Britain in 1995 the area planted to
cereals totalled 3.2 million hectares (7.9 million
acres), an increase of 4.5 per cent on 1994,
largely as a result of a further reduction in the
set-aside rate (see p. 290). High cereals market
prices coupled with the arable area payments
contributed to a 20 per cent increase (£484
million) in the value of output. Production of
wheat, barley and oats was up on 1994,
reflecting the near ideal growing conditions in
many regions.
Large-scale potato and vegetable cultivation
can be found on the fertile soils throughout
Britain, often with irrigation. Principal areas
are the peat and silt fens of Cambridgeshire,
Lincolnshire and Norfolk; the sandy loams of
Norfolk, Suffolk, West Midlands,
Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire; the peat soils of South
Lancashire; and the alluvial silts of parts of the
Thames and Humber valleys. Early potatoes
are produced in Shropshire, Pembrokeshire,
Cornwall, Devon, Essex, Kent and Cheshire.
Production of high-grade seed potatoes is
confined to Scotland, Northern Ireland and
the Welsh borders.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides 67 per cent of home needs, most of
the remainder being refined from raw cane
sugar imported under the Lome Convention
(see p. 180).
Horticulture
In 1995 the land utilised for horticulture
(excluding potatoes and peas for harvesting dry)
was about 187,000 hectares (462,000 acres).

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Vegetables grown in the open accounted for
69 per cent of this, orchards for 15 per cent,
soft fruit for 6 per cent and ornamentals
(including hardy nursery stock, bulbs and
flowers grown in the open) for 7 per cent.
More than one vegetable crop is, in some
cases, taken from the same area of land in a
year, so that the estimated area actually
cropped for horticulture in 1995 was 233,000
hectares (577,000 acres).
Mushrooms, carrots and lettuces are the
single most valuable horticultural crops, with
farm gate values of £166 million, £120 million
and £108 million respectively in 1995.
Apple output was valued at £80 million;
those of strawberries and raspberries at £58
million and £33 million respectively.
Field vegetables account for 55 per cent of
the value of horticultural output and are
widely grown throughout the country. Some
are raised in blocks of compressed peat or
loose-filled cells, a technique which reduces
root damage and allows plants to establish
themselves more reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing tomatoes,
cucumbers, sweet peppers, lettuces, flowers,
pot plants and nursery stock. Widespread use
is made of automatic control of heating and
ventilation, and semi-automatic control of
watering. Low-cost plastic tunnels extend the
season for certain crops previously grown in
the open.
Alternative Crops
The Government supports R&D into crops for
renewable raw materials for industrial and
energy uses. MAFF funding alone is £1.47
million in 1996—97.
FOOD SAFETY
EU food law harmonisation covers food safety,
fair trading and informative labelling. The
Government’s system for identifying food
safety risks involves food surveys,
investigations and research, the results of
which are published. Food law enforcement
falls mainly to local authorities.
The Government relies on expert
independent advisory committees, such as the
Advisory Committee on the Microbiological
Safety of Food and the Food Advisory
Committee, which provide systematic
assessments of risk.
Following the concern about BSE in 1996
(see p. 285) the Government further reinforced
measures to prevent potentially infected
material from entering the food chain.
EXPORTS
Provisional data for 1995 suggest that the value
of exports related to agriculture (food, feed and
drink), at some £9,896 million, was about 9 per
cent greater than in 1994. The main markets
are France (£1,600 million), the Irish Republic
(£1,000 million) and Spain (£700 million).
Exports to the EU are worth £6,400 million.
Other key markets are the United States (£600
million) and Japan (£200 million).
Cereals and cereal dried products are the
largest category of British food exports, worth
£1,322 million in 1995. Exports include
specialities such as fresh salmon, biscuits, jams
and conserves, soft drinks and tea, as well as
beef and lamb carcasses, and cheese.
Worldwide sales of Scotch whisky
increased by 6 per cent in 1995. Over
90 per cent of whisky production is
exported. Exports to the EU alone
were worth £880 million; to the
Americas £663 million, to Japan £121
million, and worldwide £2,319
million. Certain markets grew
markedly: for example, Brazil by 43
per cent and Korea by 24 per cent.
The Scotch whisky industry
employs some 13,000 people directly.
Because of strong local linkages a
total of 61,000 jobs in Scotland are
dependent on the industry.
The export trade in beef and beef products,
which reached 291,000 tonnes in 1995 (worth
about £616 million), compared with about
250,000 tonnes in 1994, was hit by the BSE
crisis.
Export promotion for food and drink is
headed by Food From Britain, an organisation
funded by MAFF (£5.3 million in 1995-96)
and industry. For agricultural products and
288
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
machinery, and food processing equipment,
MAFF co-ordinates export promotion and
organises trade fairs and ministerial visits to
other countries. Its presence at overseas trade
fairs during 1995 attracted close on 2,000
serious enquiries for British agricultural
products.
One of the world’s largest agricultural
events, the annual Royal Agricultural Show,
held at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, enables
visitors to see the latest techniques and
improvements in British agriculture. Some
200,000 visitors attended in 1996, of whom
20,000 were from overseas. Other major
agricultural displays include the Royal
Smithfield Show, held every other year in
London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcasses; the Royal
Highland Show (June); the Royal Welsh Show
(July); and the Royal Ulster Agricultural
Show.
The horticulture industry set up a
Horticultural Export Bureau in 1996, to link
producers, exporters and overseas buyers by
means of a database; provide market
intelligence; and direct overseas enquiries to
appropriate suppliers.
MARKETING
There were 163 applications for grants in
England and Wales under the Marketing
Development Scheme in 1995 and 94 were
approved, representing £5.\ million in
payments. In Scotland, 22 out of 28
applications, representing £800,000, were
approved; and in Northern Ireland 4 out of 12
(£112,000). The scheme, directed at
non-capital expenditure, aims to help industry
develop the management skills to improve its
marketing performance.
Agricultural goods are sold by individuals,
private traders, and producers’ co-operatives and
special boards. The four statutory milk
marketing schemes in Great Britain came to an
end in November 1994. Producers are now free
to sell their milk to whomever they wish. Dairy
companies are now free to buy direct from
producers. The Milk Marketing Boards
(MMBs) no longer buy and sell milk, but exist in
residuary form in order to deal with outstanding
liabilities and dispose of retained assets.
Deregulation of the milk market in Britain,
which frees a market worth over £3,000
million a year, was complete by March 1995,
with the revocation of the Northern Ireland
Milk Marketing Scheme. The Milk
Development Council (MDC) was formed in
1995 to continue funding near-market R&D
and other priority areas, such as enhancing the
public image of milk, after the MMBs’
abolition in 1994. Dairy farmers supported its
formation in a referendum and its funding by a
statutory levy on all milk production in Great
Britain. Currently the levy is set at 0.04 pence
a litre. The MDC also helps to fund the
National Dairy Council, which provides
nutritional guidance on milk and dairy
products.
In 1995 awards totalling £20 million under
the EU’s Processing and Marketing grant
covered some 90 projects throughout Britain.
This scheme was discontinued in England
after March 1996.
The Potato Marketing Scheme, and the
Potato Marketing Board which administers it,
will come to an end after the 1996-97 crop
season. The non-regulatory functions of the
Board (statistics, marketing and R&D) may be
continued by a development council.
The British Wool Marketing Board retains
its statutory powers to collect and sell Britain’s
wool clip (48 million kilograms in 1995) on
behalf of 56,000 registered producers.
Co-operatives and other farmers’ businesses
handle much of the marketing of agricultural
and horticultural produce, such as grain, fruit
and vegetables; the Plunkett Foundation
estimates that these had a turnover of some
£2,400 million in 1995.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility for agriculture and fisheries
matters—MAFF; the SOAEFD; the Welsh
Office; and the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland.
Common Agricultural Policy
The original aims of the CAP were to increase
agricultural productivity and efficiency, thus
to ensure a fair standard of living for
289
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
producers, to stabilise markets and to ensure
supplies to consumers at reasonable prices.
The main mechanisms for achieving this
were a combination of support prices, import
duties and market intervention. When prices
of the main commodities fell below certain
agreed levels, intervention authorities (in
Britain the Intervention Board executive
agency) bought the goods and stored them
for later resale. Intervention stocks were
exported or disposed of within the EU,
where this could be done without disrupting
internal markets. The market support system
not only raised food prices for consumers but
encouraged surplus production. Exports,
either from the market or from intervention
stocks, attracted export refunds (or an export
tax) to fill the gap between EU and world
prices.

Although these price support mechanisms
are still part of the CAP, the reforms of 1992
moved it away from supporting price levels
and intervention arrangements were made
less attractive. As a result, farmers now
receive the most of their financial support in
the form of direct payments from the
Exchequer under various arable and livestock
schemes (see pp. 291-4) and much less now
comes from the consumer through increased
food prices. Certain conditions, in the form
of quotas or obligations to ‘set-aside’ land,
are placed on the producers who receive
these payments, in order to control
production. The Government funds
expenditure in Britain on CAP measures and
later claims reimbursement from the EU.
Britain contributes to this reimbursement
through payments to the EU budget, to
which it is a net contributor.
All CAP support prices and direct subsidy
payments are set in European Currency
Units and are then converted into the
currencies of the member states at special
rates of exchange—so-called ‘green rates’.
These green rates are kept broadly in line
with market rates in accordance with agreed
rules. Partly as a result of sterling’s
depreciation, devaluations of the green
pound during 1995 increased CAP support
prices by 8.5 per cent. After the revaluation
of Britain’s green rate in June 1996, prices
remained 5.6 per cent higher than in early
1995.
Nearly all the EU’s expenditure on
agricultural support is channelled through
the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). The Fund’s
guarantee section (with a budget of £34,300
million in 1996) finances market support
arrangements, including direct payments
made under the CAP, while the guidance
section (budget of £3,300 million in 1996)
provides funds for structural reform—
for example, farm modernisation and
investment—and payments to assist
certain farmers to change to alternative
enterprises.
The Government has made clear its view
that the CAP is too costly for consumers and
taxpayers, and too restrictive for enterprising
producers. It believes that radical reform of the
CAP is necessary, involving progressive
reductions in support prices and other
production-related payments. The aim is the
phasing-out of the artificial production
controls like quotas and set-aside, which
currently lead to bureaucratic burdens on

producers. Removing these burdens would
leave producers free to meet customers’
demands. Not only is such reform desirable,
the Government says, but it is inevitable if
food mountains are not to reappear and grow
rapidly as a result of surplus production.
GATT restrictions on the levels of
subsidised exports, which are likely to
become tighter after the next World Trade
Organisation (WTO) round of talks, will
prevent these surpluses being sold on the
world market. Future enlargement of the EU
to the East will also be a significant pressure
for change.
CAP Expenditure on Livestock in Britain
Beef Special Premium is paid up to twice in the
life of male beef animals. In 1995, premium
was worth £85.82 a head (before regional
scale-back); this has risen to £93.11 a head in
1996. Estimated expenditure in respect of the
1996 scheme, including Extensification
Premium, is £169 million in England and
£328 million in Britain as a whole.
Stickler Com Premium is paid on suckler
cows rearing beef calves. In 1995, premium
was worth £114.43 a head, which has risen to
£124.12 a head in 1996. Estimated expenditure
in respect of the 1996 scheme, including
Extensification Premium, is £101 million in
England and £258 million in Britain. Total
suckler cow quota in England is some 710,000
head of cattle.
There was also support for beef prices
through EU beef intervention and export
subsidy schemes. The latter came to about
£94 million in 1995-96; and intervention
storage and other costs to about £2.2
million—a drop of 32 per cent on 1994-95.
There was no intervention buying in 1995
and there were further reductions in British
and EU intervention stocks, which stood at
5,072 and 5,524 tonnes respectively at the
end of the year—down to about 4 per cent of
1993 levels.
Sheep Annual Premium. Producers
received a payment of £21.26 a ewe on
eligible sheep under the 1995 Sheep Annual
Premium Scheme. A supplement of £5.69 a
ewe was paid in Less Favoured Areas
(LFAs). Total payments in Britain in
1995-96 were £425 million, with a total
quota of 19.62 million units.2
GATT Uruguay Round
On 1 July 1996 the EU implemented the
second of the annual reductions in import
protection and subsidised exports which are to
happen each year until 2000 under the
commitments which it made under the GATT
Uruguay Round Agriculture Agreement.
Britain participates in the WTO’s Agriculture
Committee and Committee on Sanitary and
Phytosanitary [plant health] Measures, which
monitor the implementation of the Uruguay
Round commitments. The next round of
multilateral negotiations on liberalising
agricultural trade will start in 1999.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in Britain in 1995-96 on CAP
market regulation and on price guarantees,
grants and subsidies was estimated at £2,753
million and £280 million respectively.
Farmers are eligible for grants aimed at
environmental enhancement of their farms (see
p.292).
2Quota is the number of cattle eligible for payments under
a scheme.
291
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In LFAs, where land quality is poor, farmers
benefit from higher rates of grant and hill
livestock compensatory allowances (HLCAs).
These are headage payments on breeding cattle
and sheep, and their purpose is to support the
continuation of livestock farming in hills and
uplands, thus conserving the countryside and
encouraging people to remain in the LFAs.
In 1996 producers in the LFA (United
Kingdom)3 will receive direct livestock subsidy
payments of £650 million, of which some
£108 million comes from HLCAs (see Table
18.5).
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want
to farm on their own account. Councils may
lend working capital to them. At 31 March
1995 there were approximately 4,700
smallholdings in England and 840 in Wales.
Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Government, which, while seeking
to dispose of holdings to its sitting tenants, still
owns and maintains 105,677 hectares (260,977
acres) of land settlement estates, comprising
1,415 crofts and holdings.
In the crofting areas of Scotland—
Highland, parts of Strathclyde, Western
Isles, Orkney and Shetland—much of the
land is tenanted by crofters (smallholders).
They enjoy the statutory protection provided
by crofting legislation and can benefit from
government agriculture and livestock
improvement schemes. Most crofters are
part-time or spare-time agriculturalists,
using croft income to supplement income
from other activities. The Crofters
Commission has a statutory duty to promote
the interests of crofters and to keep all
crofting matters under review. The
Government, which owns over 100,000
hectares (247,000 acres) of crofting land, has
proposed to transfer them to trusts which
would give crofters more effective control
over their land.
3Designation of LFA status is decided by the EU. The
case for LFAs in Britain was submitted to the EU as
covering all of Britain.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About one-third of agricultural land in
England and Wales is rented. The Agricultural
Tenancies Act 1995 gives landlords and
tenants in England and Wales greater freedom
to decide the terms of new tenancy agreements
taken up from September 1995. Full relief
from inheritance tax on new tenancies from
that date will also encourage landowners to
offer tenancies.
In Scotland about 40 per cent of farmland is
rented, partly reflecting the relatively large
areas of land in crofting tenure, including
common grazings.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are
owner-occupied, but a practice known as
‘conacre’ allows occupiers not wishing to farm
all their land to let it annually to others. Land
let in this way—about one-fifth of agricultural
land—is used mainly for grazing.
Agriculture and Protection of the
Countryside
The White Papers on rural England and
Scotland (see p. 281) set out new initiatives.
The EU has agreed that land withdrawn from
agricultural production under certain forestry
or agri-environment schemes (where
agriculture plays its part in protecting the
countryside) can count towards a farmer’s
set-aside (arable land deliberately not used for
agricultural purposes) obligation.
Since the mid-1980s the Government and
its agencies have developed environmental
land management schemes for the countryside
which now make up Britain’s programme
under EC ‘agri-environment’ regulation
2078/92.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
The ESA scheme (see Table 18.6) remains
Britain’s largest environmental scheme.
Among the newest areas, designated in 1994,
are the Shropshire Hills and Essex Coast in
England, the Cairngorms Straths of Scotland
and the Sperrins and Slieve Gullion in
Northern Ireland. Farmers within the areas
receive annual payments for carrying out
farming practices which benefit nature

conservation, the landscape and conservation
of historic features.
Participation in the scheme is voluntary.
Farmers enter into 10-year agreements with
the relevant agriculture department. An
agreement specifies the agricultural
management practices they will carry out.
Each ESA has varying tiers of such practices,
from basic care and maintenance to more
extensive forms of management and
environmental restoration. Details also vary,
but participants may not convert grassland to
arable and are subject to restrictions on
fertiliser and chemical usage.
Most ESAs also restrict or control the
numbers of stock on the land as well as the
timing of cultivation. The annual payments
(between £8 and £415 a hectare, depending
on the needs of each tier) are designed to
compensate for reduced profitability because
of these less intensive production methods,
and for the further work some management
practices need. Additional payments are
made for specific items, such as hedgerows
and stone wall renewal, set out in
conservation plans, and for allowing public
access to suitable farmland.
Countryside Stewardship
Countryside Stewardship is to develop as the
main government incentive scheme in
England, with payments of £5 million a year in
1996 and 1997 (added to a current budget of
£11.6 million), for the wider English
countryside outside the ESAs. The scheme
offers payments to farmers and landowners to
improve the natural heritage under 10-year
agreements. It targets chalk and limestone
grassland, lowland heath, waterside land, coast,
uplands, historic landscapes, old orchards, and
countryside around towns. Three new
categories have been added:
• traditional field boundaries around farms,
such as walls, ditches and hedgerows;
• old meadows and pastures—to maintain
and increase biodiversity; and
• wildlife corridors created by uncropped
margins in arable fields, and wild flowers
and birds native to arable areas.
Other Schemes
In 1995 a further 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres),
including 4,000 hectares (9,800 acres) of
former pilot scheme land, entered the Nitrate
Sensitive Areas (NSA; 32 areas in England).
Annual payments, under five-year agreements,
range from £65 a hectare for restrictions on
nitrogen fertilisers to £590 a hectare for
conversion of arable land to native species
grassland. Total payments in 1995-96 were
£3.6 million. Covering over 600,000 hectares
(1,480,000 acres) in England and Wales, 68
Nitrate Vulnerable Zones have been designated
in which farmers will in due course have to
comply with mandatory rules relating to their
farming practices.
There are four Organic Aid Schemes
covering England, Northern Ireland, Scotland
and Wales. These offer support for the
conversion of land to organic production
methods. In 1995-96, 4,015 hectares (9,920
acres) were entered into conversion under
these schemes and payments totalling
293
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£300,560 made. Land thus entered attracts
payments for five years from the start of
conversion. Payments are on a reducing scale
starting at up to £70 a hectare. An additional
£30 a hectare is payable on the first 5 hectares
entered into a scheme.
In 1996 an Organic Conversion
Information Service was launched in
England. This provides free Helpline
information and advisory visits to
prospective organic farmers.
A programme of R&D worth about £1
million a year is also undertaken and support is
given for the UK Register of Organic Food
Standards, charged with overseeing standards
of organic food production.
The Arable Area Payments Scheme, which
gives area-based payments on cereals,
oilseeds, protein and linseed crops, attracted
62,937 claims for 4.45 million hectares (11
million acres) in 1995. For the main scheme,
growers must set aside part of the area on
which they claim payment; for the simplified
scheme, no set-aside is required, but the
claim must not exceed 15.6 hectares (39.7
acres) in England or the equivalent elsewhere
in Britain.
By the end of 1995 about 450 farmers had
entered or applied to enter about 6,800
hectares (16,800 acres) in the four British
Habitat Schemes. These aim to create, protect
or enhance valuable wildlife habitats.
Farmers, with management agreements for
10 or 20 years, earn from £125 to £525 a
hectare.
To qualify for the Moorland Schemes
farmers or crofters must enter at least 10
hectares (25 acres) in Wales or 20 hectares (49
acres) in England and Scotland, of heather
moorland. Successful applicants must also
reduce their sheep numbers, by at least ten
animals (£25 a ewe), to specified densities for a
five-year period. By the end of 1995, 6,358
hectares (15,710 acres) had come into the
schemes.
Farmers made significantly fewer
applications than expected under the
Countryside Access Scheme for England and
Wales—80 in 1994-95 and 50 in 1995-96.
Agreements started in January 1995 have
provided 60 km (37 miles) and 1,000 hectares
(2,470 acres) of open space, with 29 per cent of
guaranteed set-aside land accessible to the
general public.
The Farm Woodland Premium Scheme
encourages farmers to convert productive
agricultural land to woodland by providing
annual payments for 10 or 15 years to help
offset agricultural income foregone. Payments
are under review but currently go up to £250 a
hectare and are in addition to the
establishment grants available under the
Woodland Grant Scheme (see p. 300). In 1995
over 1,100 applications for 6,600 hectares
(16,300 acres) were approved for the whole of
Britain.
Rural Economy
Eleven areas in Great Britain (including South
West England, the English Northern Uplands,
70 per cent of the landmass of Wales and
Dumfries and Galloway) have been designated
eligible to receive funds under Objective 5b of
the EU Structural Funds. Objective 5b aims to
promote the welfare of rural areas by providing
business advice, helping to develop
infrastructure and environmental and
conservation measures, and marketing local
and regional products. Areas must have a low
level of socio-economic development (assessed
on the basis of GDP per inhabitant) and
normally have a high share of agricultural
employment in total employment, a low level
of agricultural income and a low population
density.
The EU has allocated £376 million in
England for farm diversification, tourism and
environmental management over the six years
1994-99. Of this, 15 per cent (£56 million) is
to come from the EAGGF. With EU money to
be match-funded (there must be an equal
contribution from public funds), total EU and
public expenditure specifically targeted at
agriculture will be about £112 million.
Linked to Objective 5b is the LEADER II
initiative, designed to help small-scale,
innovative measures of benefit to local areas.
The Commission has allocated almost £20
million to England for LEADER II measures.
With matching national public funds, nearly
£6 million is available to give direct support to
agriculture. Other initiatives include Farmlink
(to promote an understanding of agriculture by
294
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
establishing links between farms and schools)
and the Rural Stress Working Group.
Agricultural Training
ATB-Landbase Limited provides Industry
Training Organisation (see p. 189) and other
services for agriculture and commercial
horticulture, as well as resources for the supply
of instructors through local training, under
contract to MAFF. The contract for 1996—97
is worth nearly £2 million. The agricultural
colleges and other independent organisations
also provide training.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales ADAS, an executive
agency of MAFF and the Welsh Office,
provides professional, business, scientific and
technical services in the agriculture, food and
drink, and environmental markets. Most
advice and servicing are on a fee-paying
basis. The Government gives free initial
advice on conservation and the prevention of
pollution. In England this advice is provided
through ADAS and, in the case of
conservation, also through the Farming and
Wildlife Advisory Group. Similar services in
Scotland come from the SOAEFD through
the Scottish Agricultural College. In
Northern Ireland they are available from the
Department of Agriculture’s agriculture and
science services.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain maintains its animal health status by
enforcement of controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including
checks on all individual consignments
originating from outside the EU and
frequent checks on those from other EU
member states at destination points.
Measures can be taken to prevent the
importation of diseased animals and genetic
material from regions or countries affected
by disease. Veterinary checks also include
unannounced periods of surveillance at
ports.
The number of new cases of BSE
continues to decline—from a peak of
36,000 in 1992 to 15,600 in 1995. In
spring 1996 suspect cases, at 2,998,
were at the lowest level for five years.
The total for 1995 was 41 per cent
lower than in 1994.
A cattle passport system was introduced in
Great Britain for all cattle born or imported
from 1 July 1996. The Government is working
on a computerised cattle recording and
movement system for Great Britain. In
Northern Ireland, the Department of
Agriculture already operates such a system.
Computerised cattle traceability will assist the
control of BSE and other cattle diseases.
Professional advice and action on the
statutory control of animal disease and the
welfare of farm livestock are the responsibility
of the State Veterinary Service. It is supported
by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, a
primary supplier of specialist veterinary advice
to MAFF, which offers its services to the
private sector on a commercial basis. A similar
service is provided in Scotland by the Scottish
Agricultural College and in Northern Ireland
by the Department of Agriculture’s Veterinary
Science Laboratories.
Rabies
Dogs, cats and certain other mammals are
subject to import licence and six months’
quarantine. Commercially traded dogs and cats
from other EU countries which satisfy strict
conditions are allowed entry without
quarantine. There are severe penalties for
breaking the law. No cases of rabies outside
quarantine have occurred in Northern Ireland
since 1923 and in Britain as a whole since 1970,
except for an isolated stray insectivorous bat,
which seemed to have come from continental
Europe in 1996.
Fish
Controls to prevent the introduction and
spread of serious diseases of fish and shellfish
include restrictions on live fish imports and on
295
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the deposit of shellfish on the seabed, and
movement restrictions on sites where
outbreaks of notifiable diseases have been
confirmed.
Plants
The agriculture departments apply statutory
controls to implement the EU plant health
regime, which is designed to prevent the
introduction or spread of particularly harmful
plant pests and disease. They also provide
non-statutory services, including certification
of exports to third countries and schemes for
maintaining the health status of plant
propagating material in Britain.
Pesticides
British legislation comprehensively controls
pesticides so as to protect the health of
humans, creatures and plants, safeguard the
environment, and secure safe, efficient and
humane methods of pest control. The
Pesticides Safety Directorate, an executive
agency of MAFF, is responsible for the
evaluation and approval of agricultural
pesticides in Great Britain. It also provides
policy advice to MAFF in respect of the safety
and effectiveness of pesticides and monitors
pesticide usage, residues and wildlife incidents.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate is
responsible to agriculture and health ministers
for ensuring that authorised veterinary
medicines meet standards of safety, quality and
efficacy. Users of medicines, the health and
welfare of treated animals, safety of consumers
of food from treated animals, and the
environment are all matters of concern. The
independent Scientific Veterinary Products
Committee advises the Government.
The Fishing Industry
The fishing industry provides 59 per cent by
quantity of British fish supplies.
The fisheries departments are responsible
for the administration of legislation concerning
the fishing industry, including fish and
shellfish farming, and for fisheries research.
The safety and welfare of crews of fishing
vessels are provided for under legislation
administered by the Department of Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority (SFIA) is
an industry financed body. It undertakes R&D,
provides training and encourages quality
awareness. It also acts as an agent to pay
government grants (£2.3 million in 1995-96)
towards the cost of work necessary to obtain a
Department of Transport vessel safety
certificate.
Fish Caught
In 1995 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 46 per cent by
weight of total landings by British fishing
vessels, pelagic fish (caught near the surface)
for 40 per cent and shellfish for 15 per cent.
Landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon
and trout) by British fishing vessels totalled
704,000 tonnes compared with 669,000 tonnes
in 1994. Cod and haddock represented 20 and
16 per cent respectively of the total value of
demersal and pelagic fish landed, while
anglerfish (8 per cent), mackerel and whiting
(each with 6 per cent), plaice (5 per cent) and
sole (4 per cent) were the other most important
sources of earnings to the industry. The
quayside value of landings of all sea fish,
including shellfish, by British vessels in 1995
was £462 million.
Total allowable catches (TACs) for 1996
(see below) produced British quotas of 512,000
tonnes (expressed as cod equivalent),
compared with 535,000 tonnes in 1993,
582,000 tonnes in 1994 and 547,000 tonnes in
1995. In addition British vessels have access to
stocks where no allocation is made between
member states.
The Fishing Fleet
The poor state of fish stocks, the severe
pressure they are under and the size of fishing
fleets have meant that fishing capacity has to be
reduced. The pace at which it is done is
limited not only by budgets but also by the
impact on coastal communities and their
economies. Under the EU’s Multi-Annual
Guidance Programme all member states have
296
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
been set targets for reducing their fleets.
Britain intended to achieve this objective
through a combination of decommissioning
and restrictions on time spent at sea. Although
a legal challenge to restrictions has been
dismissed by the European Court of Justice,
the Government has not pursued restrictions.
Some 7 per cent of tonnage has been removed
in three tendering rounds: 4,755 gross
registered tonnes (GRT) in 1993, 5,270 GRT
in 1994—297 registered vessels for
1993-94—and 5,326 GRT in 1995, at a cost of
some £28 million. At the end of 1995 the
British fleet consisted of 9,313 registered
vessels, including 454 deep-sea vessels longer
than 24.4 m (80 ft). All commercial fishing
vessels have to be licensed.
Fish Farming and Shellfish Production
Production of salmon and trout has grown
from less than 1,000 tonnes in the early 1970s
to 70,600 tonnes of salmon in Scotland and
about 16,000 tonnes of trout in 1995. Scotland
produces the largest amount of farmed salmon
(with a first-sale value of £220 million) in the
EU. Shellfish farming concentrates on
molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams and
scallops, producing an estimated 4,500 tonnes
a year.
The fish and shellfish farming industries,
predominantly in the Highlands and Islands of
Scotland, were estimated to have a combined
wholesale turnover of some £254 million in
1995. Production in Great Britain is based on
932 businesses operating from 1,674 sites and
employing more than 3,300 people.
Fishery Limits
British fishery- limits extend to 200 miles or the
median line (broadly halfway between the
British coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from baselines
on or near the coast of Britain.
Common Fisheries Policy
The EU’s CFP system for the conservation
and management of fishing resources means
that TACs are set each year in order to
conserve stocks. TACs are then allocated
between member states on a fixed percentage
basis, taking account of traditional fishing
patterns.
British vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the British coast. Certain
other EU member states have historic rights in
British waters between 6 and 12 miles. British
vessels have similar rights in other member
states’ 6 to 12 mile belts. Between 12 and 200
miles EU vessels may fish wherever they have
been allocated a share of the EU’s TAC against
agreed EU quotas. Non-EU countries’ vessels
may fish in these waters if they negotiate
reciprocal fisheries agreements. Currently the
only countries are Norway and the Faroes.
Technical conservation measures, crucial to
the TAC regime, include minimum mesh sizes
for nets and net configuration restrictions,

minimum landing sizes and closed areas
designed mainly to protect young fish.
Each member state is responsible for
enforcement of CFP rules on its own
fishermen and those of other member states in
its own waters. EU inspectors monitor
compliance.
After the full integration of Spain and
Portugal into the CFP on 1 January 1996, new
measures took effect to control fishing by all
member states in Western waters. At the same
time Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels
continue to be excluded from the North Sea,
the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel.
Quota Hoppers
Quota hoppers are British registered fishing
vessels which are partly or wholly owned by
foreign interests; which fish against British
quotas; and land most of their catch abroad.
There are more than 150 such vessels,
accounting for some 22 per cent of the
tonnage of Britain’s offshore fishing fleet and
10 per cent of the catch of whitefish quota
stocks. The Government is actively seeking
EU Treaty changes through the Inter
Governmental Conference that will allow
individual member states to take appropriate
action to ensure that their fishing
communities and related industries derive
real economic benefit from national quotas
allocated under the CFP.
Fisheries Conservation Group
A review of the bass fishery has concluded that
MAFF’s conservation measures have increased
stocks. MAFF has also published proposals to
conserve scallops and considered provisions to
conserve other shellfish. Of the stocks
representing 85 per cent of British catches,
only about 40 per cent are above the critical
minimum stock size. Most stocks are at
historically low levels, including some of the
most important (for example, five different cod
stocks and four plaice stocks).
MAFF and the agriculture departments set
up the Fisheries Conservation Group in
December 1995 to bring together
representatives of the British industry,
fisheries scientists and government experts. It
has reappraised:
• types and mesh sizes of nets;
• areas for closure to protect juvenile fish;
and
• minimum landing sizes for fish.
It has also looked into more selective
catching techniques to conserve stocks. This
work aims to help British negotiators when
they deal with the EU technical conservation
measures due to be adopted by the end of
1996.
Grant Schemes
In early 1996 the Government announced new
grant schemes which will provide up to £27.8
million and attract between 5 and 30 per cent
aid from the EU:
• the Vessel Safety Improvement Scheme—to
improve safety on vessels and to cover
projects costing £3,000 and over;
• the Processing and Marketing Scheme—for
processing and marketing fisheries and
aquaculture products;
• up to £6.1 million under the Port Facilities
Scheme over three years for improvements
to fishing ports;
• the Freshwater Aquaculture Promotion
Scheme—grants to the freshwater
industry; and
• up to £18 million under the PESCA
Scheme—to help areas hitherto dependent
on fishing to diversify into non-fishing
activities.
Fisheries Agreements
CFP provisions are supplemented by a number
of fisheries agreements between the EU and
third countries, the most important for Britain
being the agreements with Norway, Greenland
and the Faroe Islands. EU catch quotas have
also been established around Spitzbergen
(Svalbard).
Fish and Shellfish Hygiene
Community legislation sets minimum hygiene
standards for the production and placing on
the market of fish and shellfish. All commercial
shellfish beds producing bivalve molluscs are
298
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
monitored for microbial contamination.
Samples of water and shellfish flesh are
tested for the presence of algal toxins.
Periodic monitoring of fish and shellfish is
carried out to check for the presence of
contaminants. Other projects monitor
shellfish and seawater for biotoxins and
chemical contaminants.
Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Salmon and sea-trout are fished
commercially in inshore waters around the
British coast. Eels and elvers are also taken
commercially in both estuaries and fresh
water. Angling for salmon and sea-trout
(game fishing) and for freshwater species
(coarse fishing) is popular throughout
Britain. There is no public right to fish in
freshwater lakes and non-tidal rivers in Great
Britain. In England and Wales those wishing
to fish such waters must first obtain
permission from the owner of the fishing
rights and a licence from the Environment
Agency. In Scotland salmon fisheries are
managed locally by district salmon fishery
boards. In Northern Ireland fishing is
licensed by the Fisheries Conservancy
Board for Northern Ireland and the Foyle
Fisheries Commission in their respective
areas, and 65 public angling waters,
including salmon, trout and coarse fisheries,
are accessible to Department of Agriculture
permit holders.
Fisheries and Aquatic Environment
MAFF laboratories deal with marine and
freshwater fisheries, shellfish, marine
pollution, fish farming and disease. MAFF
also commissions research work from the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC), the SFIA and a number of
universities. It has two seagoing research
vessels.
In Scotland the SOAEFD undertakes
similar, and complementary, research, and also
has two seagoing vessels.
The Department of Agriculture laboratories
in Northern Ireland undertake research on
marine and freshwater fisheries, and also have
a seagoing research vessel.
Research
Departmental funding of R&D in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1996-97 amounts to about
£181.7 million. This includes funding by
MAFF, the SOAEFD, and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
Agriculture and Food
Food safety research contributes to protecting
the public, as do investigation of animal diseases,
particularly those that may be transmitted to
man, and flood and coastal defence. R&D also
contributes to improving animal welfare,
increasing the competitiveness of the agriculture,
fishing and food industries, and protecting and
enhancing the agricultural and marine
environment. MAFF funding for research into
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies has
been increased to £10.4 million.
Research Bodies
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC; see p. 332) is
responsible for research in biological sciences
that are vital for food and agriculture. The
NERC is responsible for research on the
environment, including agricultural aspects.
These councils receive funds from the science
budget through the Office of Science and
Technology, and income from work
commissioned by MAFF, by industry and by
other bodies. They carry out research at
research council sponsored institutes and in
higher education institutions through their
grant schemes.
ADAS carries out R&D, through regional
centres and on clients’ premises, under
commission from MAFF and under contract
for other bodies. There are research centres
across England and Wales. MAFF receives
scientific expertise and technical support from
its other agencies, the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency and the Central Science Laboratory,
commissioning research from them as well as
through open competition.
The five Scottish Agricultural and Biological
Research Institutes, funded by the SOAEFD,
cover areas of research complementary to those
of the BBSRC institutes, while including work

relevant to the conditions of northern Britain.
The SOAEFD also funds agricultural research,
education and advisory services at the Scottish
Agricultural College, which operates from three
centres. In Northern Ireland the Department of
Agriculture does basic strategic and applied
research in its specialist research divisions. It
also has links with the Queen’s University of
Belfast and the Agricultural Research Institute
of Northern Ireland.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.4 million
hectares (5.9 million acres) in Britain: about 7
per cent of England, 15 per cent of Scotland,
12 per cent of Wales and 6 per cent of
Northern Ireland. This is about 10 per cent of
the total land area and well below the 25 per
cent average for the whole of Europe.
Britain’s forestry programme protects forest
resources and conserves woodland as a home
for wildlife and for public recreation. It also
promotes the market for home-grown timber.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.18 million hectares (5.39 million
acres), 37 per cent of which is managed by the
Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting in 1995-96 was 400 hectares (988
acres) by the Commission and 15,000 hectares
(37,065 acres) by other woodland owners, with
the help of grants from the Commission,
mainly in Scotland. In 1995—96, 8,400 hectares
(20,576 acres) of broadleaved trees were
planted, a practice encouraged on suitable
sites.
The forest area has doubled since 1919.
Since 1987 nearly 170,000 hectares (420,070
acres) of new woodland have been created.
(Over 7 million trees a year have been planted
in Wales over the last five years.) Forestry
employs more than 34,000 people. Britain’s
woodlands produce about 8 million cubic
metres (282 million cubic feet) of timber a
year—about 15 per cent of total consumption.
The Government is spending £242 million to
support the management of state and private
forests and their expansion in the three years
1994-95 to 1996-97.
The volume of timber harvested on
Commission lands in 1995-96 is estimated at 4
million cubic metres (141 million cubic feet).
The Commission’s Woodland Grant
Scheme pays grants to help create new
woodlands and forests, and regenerate existing
ones. Approval was given for 18,000 hectares
(44,478 acres) of new planting in 1995-96,
including 4,106 hectares (10,146 acres) of new
natural regeneration. Three activities are
eligible for woodland improvement grant
under the scheme: helping to provide for
public access to woodlands; restorative work
on undermanaged woodlands; and supporting
efforts in woodlands to conserve rare species
such as the red squirrel, dormouse,
capercaillie, and various bats and butterflies.
Annual payments to compensate farmers for
agricultural income foregone are also available
under the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme,
administered by agriculture departments.
The Forestry Commission and Forestry
Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in 1919,
is the government department responsible for
forestry in Great Britain. The Commissioners
advise on forestry matters and are responsible to
the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the
Secretary of State for Wales.
Within the Commission, the Forestry
Authority provides grants to private woodland
owners for tree planting and woodland
management, controls tree felling, and sets
standards for the forestry industry as a whole.
Forest Enterprise, a Next Steps agency of the
Commission, develops and manages the
Commission’s forests and forestry estate,
supplying timber and opportunities for
recreation, and enhancing nature conservation
and the forest environment.
With over a million hectares of land
(2.5 million acres) the Forestry
Commission is Britain’s largest land
manager and the biggest single
provider of countryside recreation.
The Commission is financed partly by the
Government and partly by receipts from sales
of timber and other produce, and from rents.

AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
Forestry Initiatives
Plans for 12 Community Forests4 in
England—for example, Thames Chase (east of
London), Mercia (Staffordshire), Great North
(Tyne and Wear), Mersey (close to Liverpool)
and Bristol/Avon—have been approved. A new
national forest in the English Midlands (500 sq
km; 200 sq miles) is being established. In Wales,
the Valleys Forest Initiative encourages local
communities to participate in the development
of 350 sq km (135 sq miles) of existing forest in
the valleys of south Wales—about 20 per cent of
the land area—which is owned by the Forestry
Commission. Community forests are also being
promoted and developed in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
Forestry Research
The Forestry Commission maintains two
principal research stations, at Alice Holt
Lodge, near Farnham (Surrey), and at Bush
Estate, near Edinburgh, for basic and applied
research into all aspects of forestry, on which it
4The Forestry and Countryside Commissions and local
authorities plan to create Community Forests near certain
towns as recreational and productive woodlands in areas
that at present do not have them.
spends about £9 million a year. Aid is also
given for research work in universities and
other institutions.
The 1995 Forest Condition Survey showed
that the overall condition of oak, Scots pine,
Sitka spruce and Norway spruce has sustained
an improvement since 1993. There was,
however, a deterioration in the crown density
of beech owing to a heavy nut crop.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
Woodland and forest cover about 80,000
hectares (197,500 acres) of Northern Ireland.
State-owned forest constitutes 61,000 hectares
(150,700 acres).
The Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland is responsible for forestry
through its Forest Service. It administers grant
aid for private planting and woodland
management, and spent £15 million during
1993-96 on private and state forest expansion.
Additional supplements are available where the
land is coming out of agriculture or provides
recreation. Annual timber production is about
250,000 cubic metres (8.8 million cubic feet),
90 per cent from state forests. Receipts from
sales of timber totalled £5 million in 1995-96.
Forestry and timber processing employ 1,100
people.

Britain’s transport and communications infrastructure is developing rapidly.
The Channel Tunnel (see p. 311) has linked the rail transport system of Great
Britain to that of the European mainland. Britain’s road network is being
improved, with the emphasis on upgrading existing routes rather than building
new motorways. Investment at seaports and airports and in air traffic control
equipment is expanding capacity and easing the international movement of
people and goods. Britain’s telecommunications infrastructure continues to
develop, with several new entrants to the market since 1991.
Transport
There has been a considerable increase in
passenger travel in recent years—in Great
Britain it rose by 26 per cent between 1985 and
1995. Travel by car and van rose by 35 per
cent and air travel rose substantially. However,
travel by train remained much the same over
the period and travel by motorcycle, pedal
cycle and by bus and coach declined. In all, car
and van travel accounts for 86 per cent of
passenger mileage within Great Britain, buses
and coaches for about 6 per cent, rail for 5 per
cent and air 1 per cent. The amount of freight
moved by road increased by 45 per cent
between 1985 and 1995. Total motor traffic for
1995 is estimated at 430,900 million
vehicle-km, up 2 per cent on 1994.
Car ownership has also risen substantially.
In all, 69 per cent of households in Great
Britain had the regular use of one or more cars
in 1994; 24 per cent had the use of two or more
cars. At the end of 1995 there were 25.4
million vehicles licensed for use on the roads of
Great Britain, of which 21.4 million were cars;
2.2 million light goods vehicles; 421,000 other
goods vehicles; 594,000 motorcycles, scooters
and mopeds; and 74,000 buses and coaches.
Research on transport issues is undertaken
by a number of public sector bodies and by
industry, especially the motor, aviation, marine
and oil industries. Research is also
commissioned by the Department of
Transport, the Civil Aviation Authority
(CAA—see p. 317) and London Transport
(LT—see p. 308). The Department of
Transport commissions research from
contractors, including the recently privatised
Transport Research Laboratory, which was
transferred to a non-profit-distributing
302
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
foundation in March 1996. Other contractors
include consulting engineers, universities, and
institutes and laboratories of the research
councils (see pp. 330-4). A £4 million
initiative to encourage research on inland
surface transport was launched by the
Government in January 1996.
The central message of a government
Green Paper on transport in England,
Transport: the Way Forward,
published in April 1996, is that traffic
growth is an issue that must be
addressed in a more strategic way
than in the past. It proposes more
than 20 specific areas for action,
including a new system of planning
trunk roads and new powers for local
authorities to manage traffic demand
in their areas. Tougher emissions
standards for new vehicles are also
proposed.
ROADS
The total road network in Britain in 1994 was
389,200 km (241,800 miles). Trunk
motorways1 accounted for 3,200 km (2,000
miles) of this, less than 1 per cent, and other
trunk roads for 14,400 km (9,000 miles), or 3.7
'That is, those motorways that are the direct responsibility
of central government rather than of the local authority.
per cent. However, motorways carry 16 per
cent of all traffic and trunk roads another 16
per cent. Combined, they carry over half of all
goods vehicle traffic in Great Britain.
Management
Responsibility for trunk roads, including most
motorways, rests in England with the
Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland
with the Secretary of State for Scotland and in
Wales with the Secretary of State for Wales.
Central government meets most of the costs of
construction and maintenance. The Highways
Agency, an executive agency of the
Department of Transport, is responsible for
building, improving and maintaining
motorways and trunk roads in England. Its
total budget is £1,568 million in 1996-97.
A Road User’s Charter, the second edition
of which was published in March 1996, sets
out the standards expected of the Highways
Agency on motorways and trunk roads.
In Northern Ireland the Roads Service, an
agency of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland, is responsible for the
construction, improvement and maintenance
of all public roads.
The main highway authorities for
non-trunk roads in England are at present the
county councils, the metropolitan district
councils, the new unitary authorities (see pp.
75-6) and the London borough councils. In
Wales and Scotland, the highway authorities
are the unitary authorities (see p. 76).

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Road Programme
The recent transport Green Paper proposes a
new system for trunk road planning which
would bring it within the regional planning
guidance system. This would give local
authorities the chance to become involved at
an early stage of the planning process. On
present plans, Highways Agency capital
spending on new roads will fall from £1,169
million in 1995-96 to £696 million in 1998-99,
while spending on maintenance is expected to
rise from £434 million to £490 million. In
spring 1995, 53 motorway and trunk road
schemes were under construction in England
and 271 further schemes were in preparation.
A total of 62 projects to encourage
cycling are being promoted under the
Government’s Cycle Challenge
scheme, at a cost of £2 million. The
projects range from a £267,000
initiative to encourage people to cycle
to work in York to a £1,250 scheme to
promote bike trailer use in Devon.
Support for local authority road schemes is
approved on a package basis, with local
authorities being encouraged to submit bids
for a package of measures covering both roads
and public transport. For 1996-97, the
Department of Transport has approved 53
package bids totalling £79 million, a £15
million increase over 1995-96 levels. A total of
£236 million of government grant is available
to support local authority spending on
transport in England in 1996—97.
Road communications in Wales are
benefiting from the second Severn Bridge,
which opened in June 1996, the completion of
the M4 motorway and improvements to the
A55 and A465 roads. The A55 is now a dual
carriageway across the Welsh mainland, and it
is planned to extend this to Anglesey as soon as
possible. The Welsh Office’s trunk road and
transport programme for 1996-97 will cost
£155 million. A total of £100 million is also
being made available in 1996-97 for local
authority expenditure on roads and transport.
This includes about £73 million under the
transport grant arrangements.
The Government has committed £378
million between 1996-97 and 1998-99 to trunk
road construction and improvement in
Scotland. The main priorities within the trunk
road programme are the upgrading to
motorway standard of the Glasgow to Carlisle
route, and the completion of the motorway
network in central Scotland. These routes
provide important links for commerce and
industry to the south and to mainland Europe.
The Government’s strategy also includes a
series of‘route action plans’ designed to make
significant improvements to safety and journey
times on specific major routes. A total of £242
million was made available in 1995-96 for local
authority capital expenditure on roads and
transport schemes in Scotland; from April
1996 local authorities will receive a block
capital allocation for all non-housing functions,
giving them greater flexibility in the level of
spending on transport.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on
improving key strategic routes, constructing
more bypasses, and improving roads in the
Belfast area. There are plans to spend about
£63 million in a five-year major works
programme up to the year 2000.
A pilot scheme to reduce congestion
on part of the M25 London orbital
motorway was introduced in August
1995. Overhead signs show lower
speed limits when the road is heavily
congested; by reducing ‘stop-start’
driving conditions, it is expected that
average speeds will actually increase.
Private Finance
The Government is encouraging greater
private sector involvement in the design,
construction, operation and funding of roads.
Privately funded schemes completed in recent
years, being built or undergoing planning
procedures include:
• a crossing of the River Thames at
Dartford, which opened to traffic in 1991
and links into the M25;
• a bridge between the mainland of Scotland
and Skye, which opened in 1995;
304
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
• a second crossing of the River Severn,
which opened in June 1996; and
• a relief road north of Birmingham, a
motorway which would be the first
overland toll route in Britain, on which
the report of a public inquiry is expected
in mid-1997.
The Government is assessing the
technology for the introduction of electronic
tolls on the motorway network, which at
present has no tolls except at a few river
crossings. The Department of Transport has
launched a series of competitions for
contracts where private sector companies are
invited to design, build, finance and operate
roads (‘DBFO’ contracts), with remuneration
from the Government principally related to
usage (‘shadow tolls’). Five contracts, with
an estimated capital construction value of
over £400 million, were awarded between
January and May 1996, with three other
projects under negotiation. A further tranche
of five more DBFO projects was announced
in 1995.
Licensing and Standards
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
(DVLA) maintains official records of drivers
and vehicles in Great Britain. At the end of
1995 it held records on 36.4 million drivers
and 25.5 million licensed vehicles. New drivers
of motor vehicles must pass a driving test
before getting a full licence to drive; a written
theory test on matters such as traffic signs and
safety aspects of vehicles and driver attitude is
being phased in, from July 1996 for new car
drivers. The records for Northern Ireland are
maintained by Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Northern Ireland.
The Driving Standards Agency is the
national driver testing authority in Great
Britain. It also supervises professional driving
instructors and the compulsory basic training
scheme for learner motorcyclists. Minimum
ages are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds, drivers of small
tractors, and disabled people receiving a
mobility allowance;
• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver), motorcycles
and goods vehicles not over 3.5 tonnes
permissible maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,
but not over 7.5, tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with more than
nine seats and goods vehicles over 7.5
tonnes.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles are
allowed on the roads, they must meet certain
safety and environmental requirements, based
primarily on standards drawn up by the EU.
The Vehicle Certification Agency is responsible
for ensuring these requirements are met through
a process known as ‘type approval’. It also
provides a service to manufacturers wishing to
obtain international vehicle system and
component type approval in Great Britain.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles. It does
this through the annual testing of vehicles,
including heavy goods vehicles, light goods
vehicles, public service vehicles, cars and
motorcycles. It also ensures the compliance of
drivers and vehicle operators with legislation
through roadside and other enforcement checks.
In Northern Ireland the Driver and Vehicle
Testing Agency (DVTA) is responsible for
testing drivers and vehicles under statutory
schemes broadly similar to those in Great
Britain. Private cars four or more years old are
tested at DVTA centres.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest
road accident death rate in the EU. Figures for
1995 show that 3,621 people were killed on the
roads (down 0.8 per cent on 1994 and the
lowest annual figure since records began),
45,500 seriously injured (down 2.2 per cent)
and 261,400 slightly injured (down 1.4 per
cent). This compares with nearly 8,000 deaths
a year in the mid-1960s. Several factors, such
as developments in vehicle safety standards,
improvements in roads, and the introduction
of legislation on seat-belt wearing and drinking
and driving, have contributed to the long-term
decline in deaths and serious casualties.
305
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Deaths on Britain’s Roads 1926-1995
Source: Department of Transport
The Government’s aim is to reduce road
casualties by one-third by the end of the
century, compared with the 1981-85 average.
Priority is given to reducing casualties among
vulnerable road-users (children, pedestrians,
cyclists, motorcyclists and elderly people),
particularly in urban areas, where about 75 per
cent of road accidents occur. Strategies for
reducing casualties focus on measures to
combat speeding and drinking and driving,
improvements in highway design, better
protection for vehicle occupants and
encouraging the use of cycle helmets. A study
in west London has shown that automatic
speed cameras have reduced road deaths in the
area being studied by 70 per cent in two years.
A total of £55 million has been set aside for
spending on local road safety schemes in
1996-97, up by £5 million over 1995-96.
Gloucester has been chosen in a Department
of Transport competition as the site of the first
‘Safe Town’ initiative. It will receive £5
million over five years to implement a
co-ordinated package of road safety measures.
In Northern Ireland the target reduction
relates to fatal and serious casualties only; a
plan to achieve it was published in 1995.
Traffic in Towns
Traffic management schemes are used in many
urban areas to reduce congestion, create a
better environment and improve road safety.
They include bus lanes, facilities for
pedestrians and cyclists, and traffic-calming
measures such as road humps to constrain
traffic speeds in residential areas. Local
authorities can introduce 20 mph (32 km/h)
zones, subject to central government consent;
monitoring has shown that on average these
zones reduce accident casualties by 61 per cent
and child pedestrian casualties by 67 per cent.
306
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
More than 270 had been authorised by Tune
1996.
Many towns have shopping precincts
designed for the convenience of pedestrians,
from which motor vehicles are excluded for all
or part of the day. Controls over on-street
parking are enforced through excess charges and
fixed penalty fines, supported where appropriate
by powers to clamp or remove vehicles.
Implementation is well under way on a
505-km (315-mile) network of priority ‘red
routes’ in London. Marked by special signs
and red lines at the kerb, these routes are
subject to special stopping controls and other
traffic management measures, strictly enforced
with penalties higher than elsewhere. The
Traffic Director for London is co-ordinating
the introduction and operation of red routes
throughout London, and the aim is to have the
network fully operational by the year 2000. A
pilot scheme in north and east London,
introduced in 1991, led to significant falls in
bus journey times and a more dependable
service, with a consequent rise in passenger
numbers. The Department of Transport is
supporting the development of the London
cycle network to make travel by bicycle much
easier and safer.
In the Government’s transport
strategy for London, published
in May 1996, plans for future
projects are presented as a rolling
programme, including a package of
possible new river crossings in east
London.
ROAD HAULAGE
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 144,000 million tonne-km2 in
Great Britain in 1995, 4 per cent more than in
1994. There has been a move towards larger
and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier
loads—about 80 per cent of the traffic,
measured in tonne-km, is now carried by
vehicles of over 25 tonnes gross weight.
2A tonne-km is equivalent to 1 tonne transported for 1 km.
Journey lengths are increasing, with the
average haul now being 89 km (55 miles), 31
per cent longer than in 1980. Hauliers licensed
to carry other firms’ goods account for 74 per
cent of freight carried in terms of tonne-km.
There were about 120,000 holders of an
operator’s licence in January 1996, with
432,000 large goods vehicles. Nearly 90 per
cent of operators have fleets of five or fewer
vehicles. The biggest in Great Britain are NFC
pic, P & O Industrial Services Division, Ocean
Group pic and Tibbet & Britten Group pic.
Licensing and Other Controls
In general, those operating goods vehicles or
trailer combinations over 3.5 tonnes gross weight
require a goods vehicle operator’s licence.
Licences are divided into restricted licences for
own-account operators carrying goods
connected with their own business, and standard
licences for hauliers operating for hire or reward.
Proof of professional competence, financial
standing and good repute is needed to obtain a
standard licence. In Northern Ireland
own-account operators do not require a licence,
although this is under consideration.
EC regulations prescribe maximum limits
on driving times and minimum requirements
for breaks and rest periods for most drivers of
heavy goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. Drivers’
activities are monitored automatically by a
tachograph—a recording device in the cab.
Separate British domestic rules govern the
remainder. Under these, drivers are normally
required to keep a written record of their
activities. Speed limiters must also be fitted to
heavy lorries. Large goods vehicles of over 12
tonnes maximum gross weight first used after
January 1988 must have maximum powered
speed limited to 56 mph (90 km/h).
International Road Haulage
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1995 about 950,000 road goods vehicles
were ferried to mainland Europe. Of these,
486,000 were powered vehicles registered in
Britain. In 1995 British vehicles carried
almost 14 million tonnes internationally,
about three times the amount for 1985.
About 95 per cent of this traffic was with the
307
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
European Union. The largest commodity
group carried is agricultural produce and
foodstuffs, which accounted for 34 per cent
of inward tonnage and 27 per cent of outward
tonnage in 1995.
International road haulage within the EU
was fully liberalised in 1993. ‘Cabotage’ (the
operation of domestic road haulage within a
member state by a non-resident) will be fully
liberalised in 1998. Until then, quotas of
permits are available which allow cabotage in
most parts of western Europe. Haulage
elsewhere takes place under bilateral
agreements, most of which allow unrestricted
numbers of British lorries into the country
concerned, although some require permits.
The European Conference of Transport
Ministers issues a limited but increasing
number of permits giving free access to, and
transit across, several countries in Central and
Eastern Europe.
PASSENGER SERVICES
Buses
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by companies in the private sector,
ranging from the three major groups with
over 5,000 buses to small operators with
fewer than five. The largest operators are
Cowie British Bus, FirstBus and Stagecoach
Holdings. Outside London, operators may
provide services without restriction, although
controls may be imposed on the number of
vehicles operating if this would otherwise
cause congestion or danger to other road
users. While most local bus services are
provided commercially, local authorities may
subsidise the provision of services which are
not commercially viable but which are
considered to be socially necessary, after
competitive tender. Local bus mileage
outside London in 1994-95 was up 29 per
cent on its 1985-86 pre-deregulation
level.
The Government supports the privatisation
of the remaining council-owned bus
companies, of which there were 19 in England
and Wales in March 1996. To encourage this,
councils which sell shareholdings in bus
companies before April 1997 will be able to
spend three-quarters of the proceeds rather
than being forced to keep back at least half to
repay debt.
London Transport (LT) is a statutory
corporation responsible for providing public
transport in London. It no longer has its own
buses, but organises about 700 bus routes
through private sector companies operating
under contract. LT completed the
privatisation of its bus operating subsidiaries
by the end of 1994. In the longer term
deregulation of bus services in London is
proposed. Provision would be made for
operating socially necessary but uneconomic
services and the continuation of a London¬
wide concessionary travel scheme. A London
Bus Passenger’s Charter sets service standards.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes
and traffic light priority signalling, form an
important element in many local authorities’
package bids to the Department of Transport
(see p. 304). The Department of Transport
has been working with local authorities on
developing an 800-km (500-mile) London
bus priority network. This covers all
heavily-used bus routes in London which are
not covered by the red route network. It will
give them priority at junctions, making buses
quicker and more reliable. A further £9
million has been allocated in 1996-97 to
continue development of the London bus
priority network. New information systems
are being provided to assist bus passengers in
a number of cities.
In Northern Ireland subsidiaries of the
publicly owned Northern Ireland Transport
Holding Company supply almost all road
passenger services. Citybus Ltd operates
services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd runs
most of the services in the rest of Northern
Ireland. These companies have about 280 and
1,220 vehicles respectively. As well as the two
major operators, there are about 75 small
privately owned undertakings, often operating
fewer than five vehicles.
Coaches
In Britain long-distance coach services are
provided by companies in the private sector.
There are no restrictions on routes served or
308
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
the number of vehicles operated. A national
network of routes is run by the National
Express company, largely through franchised
operations. Passenger comfort in coaches has
improved in recent years, with, for example,
the provision of refreshment facilities on some
services.
Coaches and minibuses carrying three
or more children will have to be fitted
with seatbelts on all seats from 1997.
Regulations to fit seatbelts to all new
coaches and minibuses will be
introduced when the necessary
agreement has been reached in the EU.
While all regular, and some shuttle,
overseas coach services still require
authorisation or permission from the
authorities of the countries to or through
which they travel, most tourist services within
the EU have been liberalised. Operators no
longer need prior permission to run either
holiday shuttle services, where accommodation
is included as part of the package, or occasional
coach tours to, from or within another member
state. In 1993 passenger cabotage was
introduced for tours where a single vehicle
carries the same group of passengers
throughout a journey. Since January 1996, this
has been extended to all non-regular services.
Taxis
There are about 58,000 licensed taxis in Great
Britain, mainly in urban areas; London has
about 18,000. In London and several other
major cities taxis must be purpose-built to
conform to strict requirements and new ones
have to provide for people in wheelchairs. In
many urban districts drivers must have passed
a test of their knowledge of the area. At
present, a local authority can only limit the
number of licensed taxis if it is satisfied that
there is no unfulfilled demand for taxis in its
area. Private hire vehicles with drivers
(‘minicabs’) may be booked only through the
operator and not hired on the street. In most
areas outside London private hire vehicles are
licensed; there are about 52,000 in England
and Wales outside London. It is estimated that
at least 40,000 minicabs operate in London.
Having reviewed the taxi licensing regime
in England and Wales, in 1995 the
Government announced that it intends to
maintain the distinction between taxis and
minicabs. It will introduce a licensing system
for minicabs in London when legislative time
permits. The power of local authorities to
control numbers of taxis would be phased out.
There are about 4,000 licensed taxis in
Northern Ireland. Licences are issued by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland on a broadly similar basis to that in
Great Britain.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway in
the world to be worked by steam power. The
main railway companies in Great Britain were
nationalised in 1948, coming under the control
of the British Railways Board (BR). This rail
network—consisting of track, stations, other
infrastructure, locomotives and rolling
stock—is now being privatised.
Privatisation
The Government’s approach, enshrined in the
Railways Act 1993, includes:
• the franchising of all BR’s existing
passenger services to the private sector;
• the transfer of BR’s freight and parcels
operations to the private sector;
• the creation of a new right of access to the
rail network for private operators of both
passenger and freight services;
• the separation of track from train
operations, under which Railtrack is
responsible for operating all track and
infrastructure, with passenger services
being run by BR until they are franchised;
• the privatisation of Railtrack;
• the appointment of a Rail Regulator to
oversee the fair application of
arrangements for track access and
309
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
charging, and a Franchising Director
responsible for negotiating, awarding and
monitoring franchises;
• opportunities for the private sector to
lease stations; and
• improved grant arrangements for
individual rail services or groups of
services.
Railtrack was privatised in May 1996.
Besides projects to maintain and renew the
network, it expects to carry out improvements
such as Thameslink 2000 (see below). Railtrack
has also begun to let contracts for the
modernisation of the West Coast Main Line.
BR has restructured its passenger services
into 25 train operating units as a basis for the
privatised railway network. The first two
franchised services, South West Trains and
Great Western, came into operation in
February 1996. By June 1996 seven of the 25
franchises had been awarded, with all of the
others advertised. The Franchising Director
has announced that overall fare levels will not
be allowed to rise above the rate of inflation for
three years from January 1996. For the four
years after that, they will be limited to the rate
of inflation less 1 per cent. Key network
benefits—such as through ticketing and
discount cards—have been legally safeguarded
as part of the franchising.
In all, by July 1996 some 60 former BR
businesses had been sold. For example:
• BR’s trainload freight companies,
Transrail, Mainline and Loadhaul, were
sold in February 1996 to North and South
Railways, a consortium led by Wisconsin
Central Ltd, and due to start operating
under the name of English, Welsh and
Scottish Railways;
• Red Star, the parcels business, was sold in
September 1995;
• Rail Express Systems, the BR business
which operates trains for the Royal Mail,
including 22 Travelling Post Offices on
which mail is sorted overnight by Post
Office staff, was sold in December 1995;
and
• Freightliner, which carries containers
between major ports and inland terminals,
was sold in May 1996.
In addition, a large number of
infrastructure and maintenance businesses
have been sold.
New regulations require rail operators to
prepare a ‘safety case’ to demonstrate that safe
practices will be followed at all times; these
cases are validated by Railtrack. Railway
employees who undertake work with safety
implications are required to be fit and
competent. The Railway Inspectorate, part of
the Health and Safety Executive (see p. 201), is
responsible for validating Railtrack’s own
safety case.
Operations
As part of the Citizen’s Charter initiative, BR
published a Passenger’s Charter.
Compensation is payable to passengers if
performance falls by more than a small margin
below the standards set in the Charter. Under
the privatisation arrangements, franchisees are
required to produce their own charters, which
will include targets at least as demanding as
BR’s previous ones.
Investment
There has been substantial investment in
Britain’s railways in recent years. Railtrack
expects to spend £8,125 million a year over
five years maintaining and improving the
network. Recent developments include a rail
link serving Prestwick Airport near Glasgow,
opened in 1994. Future improvements include
the Thameslink 2000 project to increase
greatly the capacity of the existing Thameslink
service between north and south London. The
government contribution is likely to be in
excess of £100 million out of the total cost of
£650 million.
Some of the passenger franchises have been
let for longer than the usual seven-year period
on condition that the franchisee provides new
rolling stock. For example, the operator of the
Gatwick Express service has been awarded a
15-year franchise, and plans to introduce
completely new stock by 1999.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city network,
310
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
linking the main centres of Great Britain; local
stopping services; and commuter services in
and around the large conurbations, especially
London and south-east England. InterCity 125
trains, travelling at maximum sustained speeds
of 125 mph (201 km/h), are the world’s fastest
diesel trains.
About 30 per cent of route-mileage is
electrified, including the East Coast Main Line
linking London and Edinburgh. A new
generation of diesel multiple-unit trains has
been introduced on regional services. The first
of a new generation of electric trains entered
service in Kent in 1992.
Freight
Nearly 90 per cent of rail freight traffic by
volume is of bulk commodities, mainly coal,
coke, iron and steel, building materials and
petroleum. The opening of the Channel
Tunnel has presented an important
opportunity for non-bulk freight movement.
The Government makes grants available to
encourage companies to move goods by rail or
water rather than road; over 150 schemes have
benefited from freight facilities grant. The
Department of Transport budget for such
grants in 1996-97 is about £13 million. New
freight operators have had rights of open
access to the rail network since 1994, allowing
services to be set up in competition with
existing hauliers. National Power (see p. 269)
and Direct Rail recently started services on
their own account.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the
Northern Ireland Transport Holding
Company, operates the railway service on
about 336 km (210 miles) of track. Its
passenger charter includes a compensation
scheme that operates if targets for punctuality
and reliability are not met.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe to be financed
by the private sector, was opened to traffic in
1994. The project, which is estimated to have
cost about £10,000 million, was undertaken by
Eurotunnel, a British—French group which has
a 65-year operating concession from the
British and French governments.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel operates shuttle trains through
twin one-way rail tunnels between the
terminals near Folkestone and Calais, with the
journey taking about 35 minutes from platform
to platform. These trains provide a drive-on,
drive-off service, with separate shuttle trains
for passenger and freight vehicles. Car and
coach passengers stay with their vehicles
during the journey. Lorry drivers travel
separately from their vehicles, in a carriage at
the front of the shuttle. Eurotunnel runs
passenger shuttle services every 15 minutes
and freight shuttle services every 20 minutes at
peak periods. In 1995, 391,000 trucks, 23,500
coaches and 1.2 million cars and other vehicles
were carried through the tunnel.
Railway Services
About £1,400 million has been invested in new
passenger and freight rolling stock and
infrastructure improvements for Channel
Tunnel services. More than 20 Eurostar
high-speed trains run each day between the
London terminal at Waterloo and Paris or
Brussels. Daytime passenger services from the
Midlands, northern England and Scotland to
Paris and Brussels should begin operating in
1997. Overnight services from London and
other parts of the country to continental
Europe are also planned to start in 1997. A
part-privately funded international station at
Ashford in Kent opened in February 1996.
Freight services through the Channel
Tunnel operate from a network of regional
terminals to major industrial centres on the
Continent. Four terminals—in London,
Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham
—started operations when the tunnel opened.
Because of infrastructure improvements and
advanced wagon designs, over 90 per cent of
standard continental ‘swap-bodies’ are able to
travel over the lines between the tunnel and
the British terminal network, even though the
311
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British loading gauge is smaller than the
continental gauge. The terminal facilities allow
freight to be transferred easily between road
and rail.
The Channel Tunnel Rail Link is a
proposed private sector 108-km (67-mile)
high-speed railway between London and the
Channel Tunnel. Its London terminal will be
at St Pancras, with intermediate stations at
Stratford in east London, and Ebbsfleet and
Ashford in Kent. The Government announced
in February 1996 that London and Continental
Railways, a private sector consortium, had won
the competition to carry forward the £3,000
million scheme, scheduled for completion in
2003. The transfer to London and Continental
of European Passenger Services, the operator
of the British arm of the existing Eurostar
services, took place in May 1996.
Other Railways in London
London Underground Ltd (LUL), a
subsidiary of LT, operates services on 388 km
(243 miles) of railway, of which about 170 km
(106 miles) are underground. The system has
268 stations, with 468 trains running in the
peak period. About 784 million passenger
journeys were made on London Underground
trains in 1995-96. LUL has a charter
committing it to provide a certain level of
service to passengers. It includes a
compensation scheme that applies when delays
of 15 minutes or more occur within LUL’s
control. In March 1996 LUL was set more
demanding performance targets for the period
to 1998-99, the first time it has had targets for
a three-year period. Targets cover matters
such as train reliability, escalators and lifts
working, and station cleanliness.
Major investment in the Underground is
under way or planned. Work started in 1993
on an extension of the Jubilee Line to Stratford
(east London) via Docklands and the north
Greenwich peninsula. The extension is
scheduled to open in 1998. Total LUL
investment in new lines will be £568 million in
1996—97, of which most will be spent on the
Jubilee Line. LUL has also sought approval to
build a northern extension to the East London
Line to Dalston, where it would link with BR’s
North London Line.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), a
22-km (14-mile) route with 28 stations,
connects the City of London with Docklands,
Beckton and Stratford. An extension under the
River Thames is planned to Greenwich and
Lewisham, to be built by a private sector
consortium. The DLR’s operations will be
franchised to the private sector for seven years
from April 1997, the eventual aim being the
sale of the railway to the private sector.
The Government has set aside funding for
the Croydon Tramlink, a 28-km (18-mile)
light rail network which would connect
Croydon with Wimbledon, Beckenham and
New Addington. This project would be a joint
venture between LT and the private sector.
Government financial support would be
subject to satisfactory private sector bids; a
preferred bidder was announced in April 1996.
\
Other Urban Railways
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 10-km (6-mile)
loop in central Glasgow. The Tyne and Wear
Metro is a 59-km (37-mile) light rail system
connecting Newcastle upon Tyne with
Gateshead, North and South Shields, Heworth
and Jarrow. An extension to Sunderland is
currently proposed by the Tyne and Wear
Passenger Transport Executive. Two light
railway systems have been constructed in
recent years and are now in operation:
• the Greater Manchester Metrolink,
connecting Altrincham and Bury with
Manchester city centre on a 31-km
(19-mile) route, to which further
extensions are planned; and
• the South Yorkshire Supertram, which is
a 29-km (18-mile) system connecting
Meadowhall, Hillsborough and Halfway
to Sheffield City Centre.
Construction work has now started on
Midland Metro Line One in Birmingham. It is
hoped that the system will commence operation
in the summer of 1998. Other schemes with
parliamentary approval include the Leeds
Supertram and the Greater Nottingham Light
Rapid Transit. There are also plans for a
privately financed and run light railway between
Caernarfon and Porthmadog in north Wales.
312
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Traditional tramcars still operate in
Blackpool, the Isle of Man and Llandudno.
Private Railways
There are over 100 small, privately owned
passenger-carrying railways in Great Britain,
mostly operated on a voluntary basis and
providing limited services for tourists and
railway enthusiasts. The prime aim of most is
the preservation of steam locomotives. They
generally run on old BR branch lines, but there
are also several narrow-gauge lines, mainly in
north Wales.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for leisure and
recreation and make a valuable contribution to
the quality of Britain’s environment. They also
play an important part in land drainage and
water supply, and some are used for carrying
freight. The greatest amounts of seagoing
freight are carried on the Rivers Thames,
Forth, Humber and Mersey and the
Manchester Ship Canal; the most important
waterways for internal traffic are the Thames,
the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Mersey
and the Manchester Ship Canal.
British Waterways is responsible for 3,200
km (2,000 miles) of waterways in Great
Britain, making up the greater part of the canal
system. The majority of its waterways are
primarily for leisure use, but about 620 km
(385 miles) are maintained as commercial
waterways. It is developing its built and
natural heritage for tourism and recreational
and commercial use, often in conjunction with
the private sector. In 1995-96 British
Waterways’ revenue amounted to j£92.9
million, including a government grant of £54.4
million to maintain its waterways to statutory
standards.
SHIPPING AND PORTS
In March 1996 British companies owned 664
trading vessels of 100 gross tonnes or more,
with a combined 12.5 million deadweight
tonnes. Among the ships were 167 vessels
totalling 6.6 million deadweight tonnes used as
oil, chemical or gas carriers and 464 vessels
totalling 5.8 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships
or other types of cargo ship. In all, 71 per cent
of British-owned vessels are registered in
Britain or British dependent territories such as
Bermuda.
The tonnage of the British-registered
trading fleet has been declining. In recognition
of this, measures have been introduced to
encourage British shipowners to register their
vessels in Britain. These include the relaxation
of officer nationality rules, which came into

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
force in 1995. Except on ‘strategic’ ships, this
opens positions to officers of any nation
provided they hold British certificates of
competency or equivalents. Fiscal changes
announced in 1994 enable shipowners to carry
forward tax charges resulting from ship sales to
set against further investment within a six-year
period. Assistance is also provided for seafarer
training.
Cargo Services
About 95 per cent by weight (77 per cent by
value) of Britain’s foreign trade is carried by
sea. In 1994 British seaborne trade amounted
to 352 million tonnes (valued at £217,000
million). Tanker cargo accounted for 45 per
cent of this trade by weight, but only 6 per
cent by value.
Nearly all scheduled cargo-liner services
from Britain are containerised. British tonnage
serving these trades is dominated by a
relatively small number of private sector
companies. In deep-sea trades these usually
operate in conjunction with other companies
on the same routes in organisations known as
‘conferences’. The object of these groupings is
to ensure regular and efficient services with
stable freight rates, to the benefit of both
shipper and shipowner. Besides the carriage of
freight by liner and bulk services between
Britain and the rest of Europe, many roll-on
roll-off services carry cars, passengers and
commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
In 1995 35 million international sea passenger
movements took place between Britain and the
rest of the world, compared with about 101
million international air passenger movements.
Almost all passengers who arrived at or
departed from British ports travelled to or
from the continent of Europe or the Irish
Republic. In 1995 about 207,000 people
embarked on pleasure cruises from British
ports. Traffic from southern and south-eastern
ports accounts for a substantial proportion of
traffic to the continent of Europe. The main
British operators are Stena Sealink Line, P &
O European Ferries and Hoverspeed, although
not all their vessels are under the British flag.
Services are provided by roll-on roll-off
ferries, hovercraft, hydrofoils and high-speed
catamarans. There has been a trend towards
using larger vessels, including new large
high-speed vessels, in recent years as the ferry
companies face competition from the Channel
Tunnel.
Domestic passenger and freight ferry
services also run to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, the Orkney
and Shetland islands, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland. It is estimated that in
1994 there were about 39 million passengers on
such internal services.
Merchant Shipping Legislation and
Policy
The Government’s policy is to promote open
and competitive shipping markets. Regulations
administered by agencies of the Department of
Transport provide for marine safety and
welfare, investigation of accidents and
prevention and cleaning up of pollution from
ships.
Britain plays a significant role in the
formulation of shipping policy within the EU.
All international services and most cabotage
services within the EU have been liberalised.
Full cabotage liberalisation will be achieved
over the next ten years. Work is progressing to
introduce a European programme to improve
maritime safety and prevent pollution.
Ports
The Government’s policy has been to:
• remove constraints preventing ports from
operating efficiently;
• enable them to compete more fully on an
equal footing; and
• expose the ports industry as a whole to the
market.
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, and in addition
several hundred small harbours cater for local
cargo, fishing vessels, island ferries or
recreation. There are three broad types of
port—trust ports owned and run by boards
constituted as trusts, those owned by local
314
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
authorities and company-owned ports. Most
operate with statutory powers under private
Acts of Parliament. Major ports controlled by
trusts include Aberdeen, Dover, Ipswich,
Milford Haven and Tyne. Local authorities
own many small ports and a few much larger
ports, including Portsmouth and the oil ports
in Orkney and Shetland. The Ports Act 1991
facilitates the transfer of trust ports fully to
the private sector; Clyde, Dundee, Forth,
Medway, Tees and Hartlepool and the
former Port of London Authority dock at
Tilbury have already moved to the private
sector. The Government has announced that
the ports of Ipswich and Tyne will also be
privatised.
Associated British Ports (ABP), Britain’s,
largest port owner and operator, operates 22
ports, including Cardiff, Grimsby and
Immingham, Hull, Newport, Southampton
and Swansea. Together its ports handled 114
million tonnes of cargo in 1995. Other major
ports owned by companies include Felixstowe,
Liverpool, Manchester and a group of ferry
ports, including Harwich (Parkeston Quay)
and Stranraer.
Port Traffic
In 1995 traffic through major British ports
amounted to 509 million tonnes. This
comprised 171 million tonnes of exports, 179
million tonnes of imports and 159 million
tonnes of domestic traffic (which included
offshore traffic and landings of sea-dredged
aggregates). The smaller ports handled an
additional 39 million tonnes.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are shown in Table 19.2.
Forth, Milford Haven and Sullom Voe
(Shetland) mostly handle oil, while the main
ports for non-fuel traffic are Dover,
Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham,
Liverpool, London, and Tees and Hartlepool.
Container and roll-on roll-off traffic in
Britain has increased sixfold since 1970 to 108
million tonnes in 1994 and now accounts for 78
per cent of non-bulk traffic. The leading ports
for container traffic are Felixstowe, London
and Southampton. Those for roll-on roll-off
traffic are Dover (Britain’s leading seaport in
terms of the value of trade handled),
Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham,
Portsmouth and Ramsgate.
Northern Ireland has four fully-equipped
ports, at Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
Warrenpoint, which handle worldwide trade.
Belfast is the principal freight port, handling
over half of all cargo through its modern
roll-on roll-off facilities. It handled 12.3
million tonnes in 1995.
Development
Most recent major port developments have
been at east- and south-coast ports. For
example, at Felixstowe a £50 million extension
to the terminal was completed in 1990; a new
£100 million terminal on the River Medway
caters for deep-sea container traffic; and Dover
has started on a £100 million programme to
develop its western docks to meet competition
from the Channel Tunnel. A new cool store
has been opened at Tees and Hartlepool, and
there are plans for a new grain terminal. A
16-hectare (40-acre) car terminal has been
built at Tyne. ABP invests about £50 million a
year in developing its port facilities. Recent
investments or development projects currently
under way at ABP’s ports include:
• deepening the main channel at
Southampton, at a cost of £27 million, to
allow better access by large container ships;
• the development of a new berth at
Southampton’s container port;
• the Nordic Terminal, a new £13.5 million
four-berth roll-on roll-off facility at
Immingham; and
• a £3 million animal feed terminal at
Newport.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the
British sector of the North Sea have been built
at Hound Point on the Forth, on the Tees, at
Flotta and at Sullom Voe (one of the largest oil
terminals in the world). Supply bases for
offshore oil and gas installations have been
constructed at several ports, notably Aberdeen,
Great Yarmouth and Heysham.
Safety at Sea
The Department of Transport has two
executive agencies concerned with safety
315
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
at sea—the Coastguard Agency and the
Marine Safety Agency (MSA). The former
is responsible for HM Coastguard and
the Marine Pollution Control Unit (see
pp. 357-8). The MSA is responsible for
marine safety and the prevention of pollution
from ships. It carries out inspections on
British and foreign ships using British ports
to ensure that they comply with international
safety, pollution prevention and operational
standards. In 1995-96, 204 foreign-registered
ships were detained by the MSA in British
ports.
HM Coastguard is responsible for
co-ordinating civil maritime search and
rescue operations around the coastline of
Britain. In a maritime emergency the
coastguard calls on and co-ordinates facilities
such as:
• Coastguard helicopters and cliff rescue
companies;
• lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body);
• aeroplanes, helicopters and ships from the
armed forces; and
• merchant shipping and commercial
aircraft.
In 1995 HM Coastguard co-ordinated
action in 12,220 incidents (including cliff
rescues), in which 19,384 people were
helped.
Some locations around Britain are
hazardous for shipping. Measures are taken to
reduce the risk of collision, including the
separation of ships into internationally agreed
shipping lanes. The traffic separation scheme
in the Dover Strait, one of the busiest seaways
in the world, is one such scheme. It is
monitored by radar from the Channel
Navigation Information Service near Dover.
Ships are encouraged to report their
movements and these are tracked. Those
found contravening the regulations are
identified and action is taken.
The number of British-registered merchant
vessels involved in accidents has fallen in
recent years—102 accidents involving vessels
over 100 gross registered tonnage in 1994,
compared with 183 in 1990.
Following pressure from Britain,
international agreement was reached
in February 1996 to improve safety
regulations for roll-on roll-off ferries
operating in north-west Europe and
the Baltic. By October 2002 all ferries
operating to and from Britain will
have to meet the new standard for
staying afloat even with water on the
car deck.
The lighthouse authorities, which control
about 370 lighthouses and other lights and
buoys, are:
• the Corporation of Trinity House, which
covers England, Wales and the Channel
Islands;
• the Northern Lighthouse Board, for
Scotland and the Isle of Man; and
• the Commissioners of Irish Lights for
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
They are funded mainly by light dues
levied on shipping in Britain and Ireland. The
Ports Act 1991 provided for the transfer of
certain lights and buoys to harbour authorities
where these are used mainly for local rather
than general navigation. Responsibility for
pilotage within harbours rests with harbour
authorities under the Pilotage Act 1987.
CIVIL AVIATION
British aviation authorities are negotiating new
international rights and improving facilities
such as air traffic control. British airlines are
entirely in the private sector, as are a number
of the major airports.
Air Traffic
Total capacity offered on all services by British
airlines amounted to 29,905 million tonne-km
in 1995: 22,016 million tonne-km on scheduled
services and 7,889 million tonne-km on
non-scheduled services. British airlines carried
47.4 million passengers on scheduled services
and 27.4 million on charter flights; 101 million
316
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) to or from Britain, a 5 per
cent increase on 1994.
The value of Britain’s overseas trade carried
by air in 1995 was about £65,300 million. Air
freight is important for the carriage of goods
with a high value-to-weight ratio, especially
where speed is essential.
British Airways
British Airways pic is one of the world’s
leading airlines. In terms of international
scheduled services it is the largest in the world.
During 1995-96 its turnover from airline
operations was £7,760 million. The British
Airways group carried 36.1 million passengers
on scheduled and charter flights both within
Britain and internationally.
British Airways’ scheduled route network
serves more than 300 destinations in 88
countries. Its main operating base is London’s
Heathrow airport, but services from Gatwick
and regional centres such as Birmingham,
Glasgow and Manchester have been
expanding. Scheduled Concorde supersonic
services operate from London Heathrow to
New York and to Barbados, crossing the
Atlantic in about half the time taken by
subsonic aircraft. British Airways has a fleet of
almost 300 aircraft, the largest in Western
Europe, including seven Concordes, almost 70
Boeing 747s and four of the new Boeing 777s.
Other Airlines
Other major British airlines operating
internationally include:
• Air UK;
• Britannia Airways, the world’s biggest
charter airline, which carried 8.0 million
passengers in 1995 and has 29 aircraft;
• British Midland, which operates a large
network of scheduled services and has 37
aircraft;
• Monarch Airlines; and
• Virgin Atlantic, which operates scheduled
services between Britain, eight North
American destinations, Athens, Dublin,
Hong Kong, Johannesburg and Tokyo,
with 18 aircraft.
Helicopters and Other Aerial Work
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work,
especially operations connected with Britain’s
offshore oil and gas industry. The main
offshore operators in Britain are Bond
Helicopters, British International Helicopters
and Bristow Helicopters, with 43, 25 and 56
helicopters respectively in 1993. Light aircraft
and helicopters are also used in other
important commercial activities, such as
charters, search and rescue services,
load-lifting, aerial surveying and photography,
and police and air ambulance operations.
Aviation Policy
The Government’s civil aviation policy aims to
maintain high standards of safety and security
and to achieve environmental improvements
by reducing noise and emissions from aircraft
through international standards. It seeks to
promote the interests of travellers by
encouraging a competitive British industry,
and is committed to encouraging more
international services to and from regional
airports. The Government has taken the lead
in the EU and with bilateral partners in
negotiating freer arrangements within which
airline competition can flourish; arrangements
within the European Economic Area (see p.
33) are now almost fully liberalised. New
arrangements with an increasing number of
countries are resulting in better provision of
services at more competitive fares. The
liberalisation of air services within the EU has
seen the emergence of a number of low-cost
airlines in Britain, such as Debonair and
Easyjet.
Civil Aviation Authority
The CAA is an independent statutory body
responsible for the economic and safety
regulation of the industry and, through a
wholly-owned subsidiary, National Air Traffic
Services Ltd (NATS), for the provision of air
navigation services. Its board members are
appointed by the Secretary of State for
Transport. The CAA’s primary objectives are
to ensure that British airlines provide air
services to satisfy all substantial categories of
317
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
public demand at the lowest charges consistent
with a high standard of safety, and to further
the reasonable interests of air transport users.
Air Safety
British airlines have a good safety record. In all
but two of the 14 years to 1996, there were no
passenger fatalities in accidents involving large
commercially registered British aircraft in
British airspace. During this period no crew or
passenger fatalities associated with British-
registered aircraft occurred in foreign airspace.
Every company operating aircraft used for
commercial air transport purposes must
possess an Air Operator’s Certificate, which
the CAA grants when it is satisfied that the
company is competent to operate its aircraft
safely. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors,
who are experienced civilian pilots, together
with airworthiness surveyors, check that
satisfactory standards are maintained. All
aircraft registered in Britain must be granted a
certificate of airworthiness by the CAA before
being flown. In this and many other aspects of
its work, the CAA is increasingly working to
standards developed with its European
partners in the Joint Airworthiness
Authorities. New measures to increase
inspections of foreign aircraft operating to
Britain were announced by the Government in
January 1996.
Each member of the flight crew of a
British-registered aircraft, every ground
engineer who certifies an aircraft fit to fly, and
every air traffic controller must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA.
To qualify for a first professional licence, a
pilot must undertake a full-time course of
instruction approved by the CAA—or have
acceptable military or civilian flying
experience—and pass ground examinations
and flight tests.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation Services
Civil and military air traffic control over
Britain and the surrounding seas, including a
large part of the North Atlantic, is carried out
by NATS, working in collaboration with
military controllers. NATS also provides air
traffic control at most major British airports.
Air traffic delays in Europe halved
between 1992 and 1995. Average
delays for flights from Britain were
reduced from 14 to 4 minutes,
despite a 5 per cent annual increase
in traffic.
Britain plays a major role in European air
traffic control developments through
participation in a number of international
forums. It has supported several European
initiatives, including the establishment of a
unit to manage traffic flows throughout
Europe centrally, and a programme to
harmonise and integrate European air traffic
control. Within Britain, NATS has an
investment programme running at around £75
million a year, which includes the construction
near Southampton of a new air traffic control
centre for England and Wales, due to become
operational at the end of 1997. The
Government has also approved a new air
traffic control centre for Scotland at Prestwick
to be designed, financed, built and maintained
by the private sector.
Airports
Of the 142 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain,
about one-fifth handle more than 100,000
passengers a year each. In 1995 Britain’s civil
airports handled a total of 130.9 million
passengers (129.4 million terminal passengers
and 1.5 million in transit), and 1.7 million
tonnes of freight.
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international passengers and is Britain’s most
important airport for passengers and air
freight, handling 54 million passengers
(including transit passengers) and 1 million
tonnes of freight in 1995. Proposals have
been put forward for a fifth terminal at
Heathrow, which could eventually cater for
30 million passengers a year. Gatwick is also
one of the world’s busiest international
airports. The Government accepts Jhat there
is a strong case for further runway capacity
in the south-east, but options for new
runways at Heathrow or Gatwick will not be
considered further.

Ownership and Control
Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted
and Southampton in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in
Scotland—are owned and operated by BAA
pic. Together they handle about 72 per cent of
air passengers and 82 per cent of air cargo
traffic in Britain.
Many of the other airports are controlled
by local authorities, including Manchester,
which is the third largest airport in Britain. A
total of 12 major local authority airports now
operate as companies. The Government is
encouraging their privatisation. For example,
East Midlands International Airport was sold
by its local authority shareholders in 1993
and Cardiff Airport was sold in 1995.
Councils which sell shareholdings in airports
before April 1997 will be able to spend
three-quarters of the proceeds on other
capital projects.
The CAA has responsibility for the
economic regulation of the larger airports. It
has powers to take action to remedy practices
considered to be unreasonable or unfair, in
particular any abuse of an airport’s monopoly
position, and also to limit increases in charges
to airlines at certain airports. All airports used
for public transport and training flights must
also be licensed by the CAA for reasons of
safety. Stringent requirements, such as the
provision of adequate fire-fighting, medical
and rescue services, must be satisfied before a
licence is granted.
Strict security measures are in force at
Britain’s airports; these were tightened in 1994
with the introduction of regulations requiring
airlines to account for, and authorise for
carriage, every item of hold baggage placed on
board international flights originating in
Britain. This has not only improved security
but should also help reduce misrouted
baggage.
Communications
The telecommunications industry is one of the
most rapidly expanding sectors of the British
economy. Despite the growth in electronic
means of communication in recent years,
postal services continue to be important. The
volume of mail in Britain is increasing, with 14
per cent more letters delivered than five years
ago.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
In telecommunications, Britain has one of the
most up-to-date networks in the world, with a
great many recently licensed companies
competing for business and investing heavily
319
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in digital fibre optic networks, radio-based
networks and digital switching. The
Government has sought to introduce
competition into the market since 1981; it
privatised the former monopoly operator
British Telecommunications pic (BT) in 1984
and has encouraged the entry of many new
companies providing a variety of
telecommunications services.
In 1991 a major review of government
telecommunications policy ended the
‘duopoly’ policy, under which only two
companies, BT and Mercury
Communications, were permitted to run
nationwide fixed-link telecommunications
systems. Other important points from the
review were:
• greater freedom for existing mobile
telecommunications operators and
permission for cable television operators
to provide telephone services in their own
right;
• the introduction of ‘international simple
resale’3 to destinations with equivalent
freedom to Britain; and
• the establishment of a new regime for
administering numbering, run by the
Office of Telecommunications
(OFTEL—see below), and the
modification of operators’ licences to
allow for the introduction of number
portability, whereby customers could
retain the same number if they changed
phone companies.
There is now already effective
competition in most larger urban areas of
Britain, especially in commercial centres
such as the City of London, as new fixed link
operators extend their networks.
International calls have also opened up to
competition as new operators offer cut-price
services over lines leased from BT and
Mercury. Many residential customers now
have a choice of three fixed link operators:
BT, Mercury or their local cable television
operator (see p. 322). Total investment in the
3The use of international leased circuits connected with
the public switched network at both ends.
telecommunications industry is expected to
exceed £5,500 million in 1996.
Britain is pressing strongly for greater
liberalisation in the world telecommunications
market. Talks being held under the auspices of
the World Trade Organisation (see p. 179) are
due to be concluded by February 1997. Britain
announced in June 1996 the liberalisation of
the provision of international services by
companies over their own facilities.
i
Office of Telecommunications
OFTEL, a non-ministerial government
department, is the independent regulatory
body for the telecommunications industry. It is
headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, whose functions
include:
• ensuring that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• initiating the modification of licence
conditions by agreement or a referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
(see p. 208);
• promoting effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• providing advice to the President of the
Board of Trade on telecommunications
matters; and
• investigating complaints against public
telecommunications operators.
In seeking to promote the interests of
consumers, and to promote and maintain
competition in the market, OFTEL is seeking
to move away from regulation through detailed
licence obligations towards acting as the
telecommunications industry competition
authority. OFTEL’s proposal to make the
1997 price cap on some of BT’s main services
the last one (see p. 322) demonstrates its move
towards less detailed regulation.
It is also looking towards the convergence of
traditional telephone-based telecommunications
with computer-based applications such as
multimedia. In 1995 it published a consultative
document which considered some of the
published involved in the convergence of
broadcasting, information technology and
telecommunications.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Public Telecommunications Operators
There are about 150 licensed telecommunications
operators in Britain. They include 125 licensed
cable operators, 19 other regional and national
public telecommunications operators (PTOs),
and four mobile operators.
BT
BT runs one of the world’s largest public
telecommunications networks, including:
• 20.5 million residential lines;
• 6.5 million business lines;
• telex connections to about 20,000 British
companies;
• over 132,000 public payphones; and
• a wide range of specialised voice, data, text
and visual services.
BT handles an average of 103 million
local, national and international telephone
calls a day. The inland telephone and telex
networks are fully automatic. International
direct dialling is available from Britain to
more than 200 countries, representing 99
per cent of the world’s telephones. Following
the sale of its shares in three tranches
between 1984 and 1993, the Government has
only a residual stake in BT to enable it to
meet outstanding commitments under the
bonus scheme which accompanied the
privatisation.
BT has invested over £20,000 million
since 1984 in the modernisation and
expansion of its network to meet increasing
demand and to introduce specialised services.
The company has almost 3 million km (1.8
million miles) of optical fibre laid in its
network in Britain. Modern digital electronic
exchanges now serve nearly all telephone
lines. The combination of digital exchange
switching and digital transmission
techniques, using optical-fibre cable and
microwave radio links, is improving the
quality of telephone services substantially. It
also makes possible the provision of a wider
range of services through the company’s
main network.
Fibre optics can transform the
capacity of a telephone network.
According to BT Laboratories, an
optical fibre has the capacity, in
theory, to carry at one time all the
conversations going on in the world
twice over.
BT’s services include:
• a free facility for emergency calls to the
police, fire, ambulance, coastguard,
lifeboat and air-sea rescue services;
• directory enquiries;
• various chargeable operator-connected
services, such as reversed-charge
(‘collect’) calls;
• an operator-handled ‘Freefone’ service
and automatic Freefone and ‘Lo-calP
facilities that enable callers to contact
organisations anywhere in Britain, either
free or at local call rates;
• premium-rate services which allow callers
to obtain information from independent
providers; and
• select network services such as caller
display, reminder calls, three-way calling,
call waiting and call diversion, which are
available to customers on digital
exchanges.
Public payphone modernisation has
included additional provision on sites
convenient for travellers, such as train
carriages, London Underground platforms and
motorway service areas. Many BT public
payphones now offer a choice of four methods
of payment—coins, BT phonecards, BT
chargecards and commercial credit or debit
cards.
BT is the second largest shareholder in the
International Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation (INTELSAT), of which 125
countries are members, and is the largest
investor in the European Telecommunications
Satellite Organisation (EUTELSAT). It is also
the second largest shareholder in the
International Maritime Satellite Organisation
(INMARSAT), with interests in a number of
other consortia.
321
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
BT operates satellite earth stations in the
London Docklands and at Goonhilly Downs
(Cornwall), Madley (near Hereford),
Aberdeen, and Mormond Hill (Grampian).
In-flight operator-controlled telephone call
facilities for passengers are provided via
Portishead radio station near Bristol. Digital
transmission techniques have been introduced
for services to the United States, Japan, Hong
Kong and Australia via the Madley and
Goonhilly stations.
To increase its presence in the world
market, BT has entered into several joint
ventures with overseas firms: for example,
MCI in the United States; the German
industrial group VIAG; and Grupo Santander
in Spain.
Under the regulatory regime, BT’s prices are
capped by OFTEL. What is intended to be the
last cap, covering the period 1997 to 2001, will
restrict the bills of low- to medium- spending
residential customers and small businesses to
rises in line with the Retail Prices Index minus
4.5 percentage points. This will only cover a
quarter of BT’s revenues; owing to the rapid
development of competition in business and
international calls OFTEL feels that regulation
is no longer necessary in those areas.
Mercury Communications
Mercury Communications Ltd, which is part
of the Cable & Wireless group and is 20 per
cent owned by Bell Canada Enterprises, has
constructed its own long-distance all-digital
network. The network runs from the north of
Scotland to the south coast, linking 90 cities
and towns across Britain. Mercury now offers
a service to all the population, both business
and residential customers.
Major customers can have a direct digital
link between their premises and the Mercury
network. Routeing devices have also been
developed to enable customers to use Mercury
indirectly via their existing exchange lines.
Businesses can take advantage of savings plans
and automatic discounts as well. There are
Mercury-compatible phones which connect
the caller to the network at the push of a
button. In addition, many customers are now
able to use the Mercury network by dialling an
access code.
International services are provided by
satellite communications centres in London’s
Docklands, in Oxfordshire and at Brechin in
Scotland, as well as by submarine cable links to
continental Europe and the United States.
Other Operators
Other operators include Kingston
Communications, which is the
long-established network operator for the
Kingston upon Hull area in the East Riding of
Yorkshire. The 19 regional and national PTOs
include:
• COLT, which focuses on business
customers in the Greater London area;
• Energis, which is using the electricity
infrastructure as a platform for installing
new optical fibre networks;
• lonica, which in May 1996 launched its
service using radio to provide the final
connection to customers, initially in East
Anglia;
• Sprint, the third-largest long-distance
telephone company in the United States,
which is seeking to expand its domestic
and international services in Britain; and
• Vodafone, the well-established mobile
operator, which was granted a licence for
fixed services in 1993.
Cable Television Franchises
Cable operators are now able to offer telephone
services in their own right. In all, 102 of the
108 local cable television franchises in
operation by April 1996 also offered voice
telephony services. By then, the cable
operators had installed 1.6 million telephone
lines in Britain, compared with 2,200 lines in
January 1991, and 5 million homes were passed
by cable television networks.
Mobile Communications
The Government has encouraged the
expansion of mobile telecommunications
services, resulting in one of the most extensive
networks in the world. Vodafone and Telecom
Securicor Cellular Radio (Cellnet) run
322
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
competing national cellular radio systems.
Considerable investment has been made in
establishing their networks to provide
increased capacity for the growing numbers of
mobile phone users (5.7 million by April
1996). The two companies also run the
pan-European mobile system, known as GSM,
in Britain.
Britain was the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
services, which are intended to allow the same
telephone to be used at home, at work and as a
portable within the network’s coverage. PCNs
operate in the frequency range around 1.9
gigahertz. The Mercury One-2-One service
started in 1993, and Hutchison Microtel’s
Orange service was launched in 1994.
National Band Three Ltd is licensed to
offer a nationwide trunked radio service, while
33 licences have been awarded for London and
regional services. Five licences to operate
mobile data networks and another five to run
nationwide paging networks have also been
granted. Following a competition in 1995,
licences are being awarded for two services
serving remote rural areas and three national
digital ‘ISDN’4 services.
Cable & Wireless
Cable and Wireless pic supplies a wide range
of telecommunications services in over 50
countries worldwide. Its main business is the
provision and operation, through the
companies of the Cable & Wireless federation,
of public telecommunications services in over
30 countries and territories, including Hong
Kong, the United States and Japan, under
franchises and licences granted by the
governments concerned. It also supplies and
manages telecommunications services and
facilities for public and private sector
customers, and undertakes consultancy work
worldwide. It operates a fleet of ships and
submersible vehicle systems for laying and
maintaining submarine telecommunications
cables. Its strategy is to build on its regional
hubs in Asia, Western Europe and the
Caribbean. It links these hubs through its
integrated services digital network.
worldwide network of cable and satellite
communications.
Information Society Initiative
The Information Society initiative, launched
in February 1996, seeks to increase awareness
of the opportunities the ‘information society’
presents. A range of operators, including BT,
are participating. Its comprehensive package of
activities is designed to:
• bring forward the technologies and
applications needed to service an
information society;
• speed the development of creative
programmes and ideas; and
• raise awareness among British companies
of the business benefits of electronic
working through local support centres
aimed at business users.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail.
The Royal Mail delivers to 26 million
addresses, handling nearly 70 million letters
and parcels each working day. This comes to
more than 18,300 million items a year. Mail is
collected from over 110,000 posting boxes, as
well as from post offices and large postal users.
The Royal Mail has invested substantially
in the latest mail-sorting technology, and
mechanisation has been introduced at all stages
of the sorting process. Automatic sorting
utilises the information contained in the
postcode; the British postcode system is one of
the most sophisticated in the world, allowing
mechanised sorting down to part of a street on
a postman’s round and, in some cases, to an
individual address.
Britain has good international postal services,
with prices among the cheapest. Royal Mail
International dispatches 790 million items a year,
including over 600 million by air. It has its own
mail-handling centre at Heathrow, which
handles about four-fifths of outward airmail. It
uses 1,400 flights a week to send mail direct to
over 300 destinations worldwide.
323
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions; it acts as an agent for the
letters and parcels businesses, government
departments, local authorities and Alliance &
Leicester Giro—formerly Girobank, which
was transferred to the private sector in 1990.
In response to the government decision to
grant it more commercial freedom, a number
of new services have been developed, such as
bureaux de change. There are just under
20,000 post offices, of which 700 are operated
directly by the Post Office. The remainder are
franchise offices or are operated on an agency
basis by sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a range of specialist
services. Parcelforce ‘Datapost’, a
door-to-door delivery service, provides
overnight delivery throughout Britain and an
international service to over 160 countries.
‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid delivery
within or between major cities in Britain. The
Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh is an important
outlet for the Post Office’s philatelic business,
including sales to overseas collectors or
dealers. The British Postal Consultancy
Service offers advice and assistance on all
aspects of postal business to overseas postal
administrations, and over 50 countries have
used its services since 1965.
Competition in Postal Services
The Post Office has a monopoly on the
conveyance of letters within Britain. However,
the Government has the power to suspend the
monopoly in certain areas or for certain
categories of mail and to license others to
provide competing services. It has suspended
the monopoly on letters subject to a minimum
fee of £1.
In 1995 the Government announced a new
business regime, which involves:
• removing existing capital financing limits;
• turning the main operating units into
separate subsidiary limited companies;
• making full use of the Private Finance
Initiative (see p. 162) to support moves
into new markets; and
• allowing Post Office Counters to extend
the range of services it provides.
The Government has made clear its
commitment to:
• a universal letter and parcel service with a
delivery to every address in Britain;
• a uniform and affordable tariff structure;
and
• a nationwide network of post offices.
Private Courier and Express Service
Operators
Private-sector couriers and express operators
are allowed to handle time-sensitive
door-to-door deliveries, subject to a minimum
fee of j£L The courier/express service
industry has grown rapidly and the revenue
created by the carriage of these items is
estimated at over £3>000 million a year. Britain
is one of the main providers of monitored
express deliveries in Europe, with London an
important centre for air courier/express
traffic.

Britain has a long tradition of research and innovation in science, technology
and engineering in universities, research institutes and industry. Science and
technology are critical elements in the innovation process, which is essential for
competing successfully in domestic and international markets.
INTRODUCTION
British achievements in science and technology
in the 20th century include fundamental
contributions to modern molecular genetics
through the discovery of the three-dimensional
molecular structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) by Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins,
James Watson and Rosalind Franklin in 1953
and of cholesterol, vitamin D, penicillin and
insulin by Dorothy Hodgkin.
Notable contributions in other areas over
the past 25 years have been made by Stephen
Hawking in improving the understanding of
the nature and origin of the universe; Brian
Josephson in superconductivity (abnormally
high electrical conductivity at low
temperatures); Martin Ryle and Antony
Hewish in radio astrophysics; and Godfrey
Hounsfield in computer-assisted tomography
(a form of radiography) for medical diagnosis.
Other pioneering work includes the
discovery in 1985 by British Antarctic Survey
scientists of the hole in the ozone layer over
the Antarctic. Researchers at the Laboratory of
Molecular Biology, Cambridge, produced the
first monoclonal antibodies, proteins produced
by genetic engineering with enormous
potential in the diagnosis and treatment of
disease. More recently there have been several
British breakthroughs in genetics research,
including the identification of the gene in the
Y chromosome responsible for determining
sex, and the identification of other genes linked
to diseases such as cystic fibrosis and a form of
breast cancer. The world’s first pig with a
genetically modified heart has been bred by
scientists at Cambridge University, an
important milestone in breeding animals as
organ donors for people.
With only 1 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain carries out 6 per cent of its
total research and development (R & D).
Britain has won more Nobel Prizes for
Science—over 70—than any country except
the United States. The most recent British
winner is Professor Sir Harold Kroto of Sussex
University, who shared the 1996 Chemistry
prize with two US scientists for discovering
the fullerene molecule.
Research and Development Expenditure
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific
R & D in 1994 was £14,600 million, 2.2 per

cent of gross domestic product. About 50 per
cent of the funding was provided by industry
and around 32 per cent by government.
Significant contributions were made by private
endowments, trusts and charities. Industry
also funds university research and finances
contract research at government
establishments. Some charities have their own
laboratories and offer grants for outside
research. Contract research organisations carry
out R & D for companies and are playing an
increasingly important role in the transfer of
technology to British industry.
Total spending on R & D in industry
amounted to £9,500 million in 1994. Of this
total, British industry’s own contribution was
72 per cent, with 12 per cent from
government and the rest from overseas. Since
the ending of the Cold War, there has been a
marked shift in the balance between civil and
defence-related R&D, reflected, for
example, in a reduction in real terms in
aerospace R&D.
According to reports by listed British
companies, there was a rise of 4.2 per cent in
investment in R & D in 1995-96. The
chemistry and biotechnology-based
sectors—chemicals, pharmaceuticals and
healthcare—account for 36 per cent of R & D
spending by listed companies. Three of the
four companies with the largest investment in
R & D—Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline
Beecham and Zeneca—are in these sectors (see
Table 20.1). Electronics and aerospace are also
areas of R & D strength. Some examples of
recent notable R&D projects in these areas
are given below.
Chemicals
Research carried out by the chemicals industry
over the past few years has led to significant
technological and commercial breakthroughs.
Pharmaceuticals is the most research-intensive
sector of the chemicals industry. British firms
have been responsible for discovering and
developing five of the world’s 20 best-selling
drugs (see p. 246). Research conducted by ICI,
Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and
Fisons led to the development of the first
successful beta blockers, drugs used in the
treatment of cardiovascular conditions;
semi-synthetic penicillins; vaccines; and
treatments for cancer, asthma, migraine and
arthritis. More than 200 potential new
medicines are currently under development in
British laboratories.
Among a host of other research projects are
the application of biotechnology to
pharmaceuticals, disease resistant crops, new
forms of food, plant science, and the
development of advanced materials such as
engineering plastics. The biotechnology sector
continues to grow, with an increasing number
of companies engaged in the development and
manufacture of products using genetic
modification techniques.
Electronics
British firms and research organisations, with
government support, are leading in the
development and application of the family of
‘three-five’ semiconductor materials (such as
gallium arsenide). These materials have many
uses, including lasers for optical fibre
communications, microwave devices for
satellite communications, and high efficiency
solar cells.
BT (British Telecom) is in the forefront of
the development of optical fibre cable and
developed the first all-optical repeater. BT
engineers are developing virtual reality
techniques to transmit 3-D images on a
326
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
television screen. Eventually, viewers will be
able to experience, for example, the sensation
of trying on clothes in a virtual shopping
centre. In 1995-96 BT spent £271 million on
R & D; up to 800 projects are being carried out
at any one time, of which two-thirds are in
software engineering.
Aerospace
Britain has led the world in many aspects of
aerospace R & D over the past 80 years.
Pioneering achievements include radar, jet
engines, Concorde, automatic landing, vertical
take-off and landing, flight simulators and
ejector seats. British Aerospace, with Marconi
and Dowty Boulton Paul, developed a system
known as ‘fly-by-wire’, in which flying control
surfaces are moved by electronic rather than
mechanical means. British Aerospace is
currently working with government and
academic laboratories on the use of ‘smart
materials’ in aircraft. These are structures within
the aircraft which can continuously monitor for
signs of damage or wear and communicate with
the pilot via fibre optic cables. The technology
will have applications in both military and civil
aircraft, and is expected to improve safety and
reduce maintenance costs.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science and technology issues as a whole are
the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister, the
President of the Board of Trade, acting on
behalf of the Prime Minister. The Minister is
supported by the Office of Science and
Technology (OST)—which became part of the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in
1995. The OST is headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser. It
provides a central focus for the development of
government policy on science and technology,
both nationally and internationally, including
strengthening the science base and maximising
its contribution to economic performance and
the quality of life. It co-ordinates science and
technology policy across government
departments.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in
establishments operated by the research
councils and government departments,
together with the national and international
central facilities (such as CERN—see p. 343)
supported by the councils and available for use
by British scientists and engineers. There are
also important contributions from some
private institutions, mainly those funded by
charities. Universities and other institutions of
the science and engineering base are the main
providers of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to become
applicable) carried out in Britain. They also
increasingly collaborate with the private sector
in the conduct of specific applied research.
Nearly two-thirds of the Government’s
spending on civil R & D supports basic and
strategic research carried out in the science and
engineering base.
The OST has specific responsibility for the
Science Budget and seven government-
financed research councils (see pp. 330—4): the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council (EPSRC), the Medical Research
Council (MRC), the Particle Physics and
Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC), the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC) and the Council for the Central
Laboratory of the Research Councils
(CCLRC). OST funding provides assistance
for research, through the research councils, in
the following ways:
• by awarding grants and contracts to
universities and other higher education
establishments and to research units;
• by funding research council
establishments;
• by supporting postgraduate study; and
• by subscribing to international scientific
organisations.
The OST also supports universities (whose
other main source of funding is the appropriate
higher education funding council) through
programmes administered through the Royal
Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering
(see p. 340).

Finance
Government finance goes to research
establishments, higher education institutions
and private industry, as well as collaborative
research programmes. Total net government
expenditure on science and technology (both
civil and defence) in 1995-96 was £6,069
million, of which £3,883 million was devoted
to civil science. The Science Budget (see
Table 20.2) totals £1,312 million for
1996-97. Government funding for the
science and engineering base has increased
by over 10 per cent in real terms over the
past ten years.
Among government departments, the
Ministry of Defence (MoD—see p. 336) has
the largest research budget. The main civil
departments involved are the Department of
Trade and Industry (see p.’ 334), the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF—see p. 336) and the Department of
the Environment (see p. 337).
Strategy
The funding and organisation of British
science and technology have changed
considerably in recent years, in accordance
with the principles set out in the White Paper,
Realising Our Potential: A Strategy for Science,
Engineering and Technology. Published in 1993,
this was the first major review of science for
over 20 years.
The White Paper aimed to create a closer
partnership between government, industry and
the scientific community in developing
strengths in areas of importance to the future
economic well-being of Britain. In particular,
it established the Foresight Programme for the
public and private sectors to work together to
identify opportunities in markets and
technologies likely to emerge over the next 10
to 20 years, and the actions which should be
taken now to exploit them.
The programme is co-ordinated by a joint
industry/academic steering group under the
chairmanship of the Government’s Chief
Scientific Adviser. The steering group has
identified seven cross-sectoral themes or
priority areas:
• communications and computing power
(with applications in all economic sectors);
• new organisms, products and processes
from genetics (with applications in health,
agriculture, food and environmental
protection);
• materials science, engineering and
technology;
• production processes and services;
• pollution monitoring and control
technologies, and technologies for
conserving energy and other resources;
• social trends (improving understanding of
human factors involved in markets and
scientific advance); and
• extending quality life (EQUAL) by
examining the effects of lifestyle and diet
on health and developing technologies to
enhance the quality of life of an ageing
population.
In March 1996 the Government published a
further report which highlighted the
considerable progress made under the
328
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Foresight Programme. The report
recommended some reorganisation of the 15
sector panels examining the opportunities in
specific branches of science and technology;
the number of panels has been increased to 16
with the addition of a panel for the marine
sector.
The reports of the steering group and
sector panels are being disseminated widely in
order to:
• ensure that scientific excellence is
sustained;
• increase collaboration between industry
and academic institutions in areas of
economic importance by building on links
already forged;
• influence government priorities in science,
engineering and technology programmes
and in government regulation and training
responsibilities; and
• help industry to develop more informed
business and investment strategies.
Government departments, the universities
and higher education funding councils, and the
research councils are reflecting Foresight
priorities in their research spending allocations.
The private sector will be encouraged to take
account of the priorities both in its participation
in collaborative research programmes and in its
strategic planning.
The Government is providing up to £30
million over four years for the first round of
the Foresight Challenge Competition, to fund
collaborative R & D projects to address
priorities identified by the Foresight panels.
Over 500 outline bids were received and some
60 consortia were then invited to submit full
bids. The 24 projects selected directly address
priorities in almost all the Foresight sectors.
Funding from industry is contributing £62
million towards the total project costs of £92
million.
The 1993 White Paper also introduced the
Realising Our Potential Award (ROPA)
scheme, which focuses on researchers already
working closely with industry and provides
funding for separate ‘curiosity-driven’ research
of their own choosing. Following a successful
pilot project the scheme was extended to
involve all the research councils. About 250
ROPAs, with a total value of £18 million, were
awarded in 1996. In 1996-97 the expected
funding for the scheme will be about £32
million. The Government also makes funds
available through the research councils for the
Co-operative Awards in Science and
Engineering (CASE) scheme, which supports
students on research projects jointly
supervised with industry.
LINK
The LINK scheme provides a government¬
wide framework for collaborative research in
support of wealth creation and improvement of
the quality of life. LINK aims to promote
partnerships in high-quality, commercially
relevant research projects between industry
and higher education institutions and other
research base organisations. Under the
scheme, government departments and research
councils fund up to 50 per cent of the cost of
research projects, with industry providing the
balance. LINK is now operating through 54
programmes. More than 700 projects worth
over £400 million have been started, involving
over 1,100 companies and 130 research base
institutions. The Government relaunched
LINK in 1995, following a review which
recommended improvements to make the
scheme more flexible and effective in
responding to the needs of industry and the
research base. Since then 15 new programmes
have been announced in response to priorities
identified by the Foresight Programme.
Forward Look
The third Forward Look of Government-funded
Science, Engineering and Technology was
published in May 1996. It sets out the
Government’s policy and plans for publicly
funded science, engineering and technology,
presenting an overview of the programmes of
individual government departments and
research councils. It also describes measures
being taken to achieve the objectives set out in
the 1993 White Paper.
Public Awareness Campaign
A major policy initiative in the White Paper
was the announcement of a campaign to
329
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
promote the public awareness of science,
engineering and technology. This seeks to:
• increase public awareness and
appreciation of the contribution that
science, engineering and technology make
to Britain’s economic wealth and quality
of life; and
• raise levels of understanding of scientific
terms, concepts and issues, so that public
debate on controversial scientific and
technological issues becomes better
informed.
The Government also supports a number of
programmes and events, such as the British
Association’s annual science festival and the
National Science, Engineering and Technology
Week. The third of these Weeks, held in March
1996, consisted of over 5,000 events in all parts
of Britain. The year 1997 has been designated
the Year of Engineering Success (YES). This
initiative is intended to raise public awareness of
the role of engineers in wealth creation and life
enhancement and is supported by the
engineering profession and industry.
Prior Options Review
The Government is conducting a programme
of ‘prior options’ reviews of public sector
research establishments. Each review examines
whether the functions of the establishment are
needed, the scope for greater involvement by
the private sector (including the university
sector) through privatisation or contracting out
of work, and possibilities for rationalisation.
The reviews are being conducted in three
rounds, with the aim of completing the major
part of the work by the end of 1996. The
results of some of the reviews have been
announced. In a number of cases the
Government has decided that a move away
from the public sector is appropriate.
Career Development Initiatives
The 1993 White Paper recommended that
postgraduate training should include broader
skills and experience relevant to the needs of
employers. Pilot schemes for two new
qualifications, the engineering doctorate
(EngDoc) and the research masters degree,
have been introduced to give this development
further impetus.
A Development Unit was established in the
OST in 1994 to promote the role of women in
science, engineering and technology. It was set
up in response to an independent report which
found that women were under-represented in
these sectors, and that there were too few
women at senior levels; many women drop out
of a science career after completing a PhD.
From the experience of six major employers,
the Unit has highlighted the economic and
other benefits to business of measures which
enable women scientists and engineers to
combine a career and bringing up a family.
The research councils, the Royal Society
and universities reached a formal agreement in
1996 on improving the career framework for
research staff on short-term contracts.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each research council is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and
government. Councils support research, study
and training in universities and other higher
education institutions, through their own
institutes, and international research centres.
They provide awards to about 15,000
postgraduate students in science, social
sciences, engineering and technology. In
addition to funding from the OST, the
research councils receive income for research
commissioned by government departments
and from the private sector. Income from
commissioned research is particularly
important for the BBSRC and NERC.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council
The EPSRC, the research council with the
largest budget—about £376 million in
1996-97—has responsibility both for
sustaining particular disciplines (chemistry,
mathematics, physics and all branches of
engineering) and for developing close links
with the industries underpinned by these
disciplines. The EPSRC has 14 programmes
supporting research into core disciplines in the
330
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
physical sciences and engineering, and in
‘generic technologies’. These generic
technologies and various sector-based initiatives
are relevant to a wide range of industrial
activities. Many of the generic technologies were
a key concern of the Foresight panels. The work
includes projects on information technology and
computing science, engineering materials and
design, and integrated production.
The EPSRC is a major participant in an
industry-led collaborative programme with the
ESRC, BBSRC and government departments.
The Innovative Manufacturing Initiative is
aimed at encouraging innovative business
processes and technology in manufacturing
industry, and focuses on specific sectors of
industry. One key area for research highlighted
by the Foresight Programme is in developing
sophisticated new sensors for monitoring
industrial processes.
The Council’s environmental interests
include its clean technology programme: the
programme is co-ordinated with related
activities in the DTI, the Department of the
Environment, the BBSRC, NERC and ESRC.
The programme aims to find ways of
forestalling pollution in industrial processes
rather than removing it at the ‘end of the pipe’.
Priority areas include cleaner synthesis,
recycling and recovery, and sustainable cities.
A collaboration between EPSRC and
the electronics company Sharp has
produced a revolutionary new
microwave oven that can choose the
cooking times for different foods.
Based on work by Dr Lionel
Tarassenko at Oxford University’s
Department of Engineering, the oven
contains sensors which detect the
characteristic steam ‘signature’
produced by different foods when
heated. The oven is the first of the
company’s products to be developed
and manufactured outside Japan.
The EPSRC is also engaged in:
• supporting training in core disciplines at
higher education institutions (involving
some 8,000 students);
• encouraging technology transfer through
collaboration between universities and
industrial companies (for example,
through the Teaching Company
Scheme—see p. 335);
• providing access for British researchers to
high-quality national and international
facilities; and
• managing high-performance computer
facilities for use by all the research councils.
Medical Research Council
The MRC, with a budget of £282 million in
1996-97, is the main source of public funds for
medical research. It promotes and supports
research and training aimed at maintaining and
improving human health, advancing
knowledge and technology, and providing
well-trained staff to meet the needs of user
communities, including the providers of
healthcare and the biotechnology, food,
healthcare, medical instrumentation,
pharmaceutical and other biomedical-related
industries.
About half the MRC’s expenditure is made
through its own institutes and units, which
have close links with universities and medical
schools, the rest going mainly on grant support
of research in universities. The Council has
two large institutes—the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill in London and
the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge; it also runs the Clinical Sciences
Centre at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School, London. It has about 40 research units
and a number of smaller teams, and funds
about 1,500 research grants.
Research funded by the MRC is conducted
in the following broad areas:
• work on molecular structure and
properties, cell biochemistry and
physiology, and developmental biology;
• genetic blueprint and health—focusing on
genome mapping and the study of the
structure and functions of genes, this is
looking at the enormous potential
represented by genetics for the detection,
prevention and treatment of disease;
• research examining interactions between
the environment and the human body,
331
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including early childhood origins of
adult disease, the consequences of
clinical interventions, the health
consequences of environmental
pollution, and the effects on health of
factors such as nutrition;
• basic and clinical research into viral,
bacterial and parasitic diseases, and into
the function and development of the
immune system, and into allergy and the
autoimmune system. This includes a
significant research programme into
HIV/AIDS;
• research aimed at improving the
understanding of the central nervous
system, covering the study of a wide
range of mental diseases—including
psychoses, dementia and addiction—and
the development of better methods for
their diagnosis, prevention and
treatment;
• work on organ systems and cancer—the
latter aiming to increase understanding
of tumour biology and to develop
methods of detecting cancers (including
better methods of early detection and
treatment); and
• research related to examining and testing
the effectiveness of medical practice and
healthcare—involving close liaison with
the government health departments and
the National Health Service.
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council
The main task of the PPARC, with a budget of
£207 million in 1996-97, is to sustain and
develop Britain’s long tradition of excellence in
research into fundamental physical processes.
The PPARC maintains four research
establishments: the Royal Greenwich
Observatory at Cambridge, the Royal
Observatory at Edinburgh and overseas
observatories on La Palma in the Canary
Islands and on Hawaii. The PPARC is a major
source of funding for many leading university
physics departments in Britain.
The PPARC supports research in three
main areas:
• particle physics—theoretical and
experimental research into elementary
particles and the fundamental forces of
nature;
• astronomy (including astrophysics and
cosmology)—studying the origin,
structure and evolution of the universe,
and the life cycle and properties of stars;
and
• planetary science (including solar
terrestrial physics)—studying the origin
and evolution of the solar system and the
influence of the Sun on planetary bodies,
particularly Earth.
The Council’s work is in fields where
international co-operation is particularly
important: it makes substantial contributions
to the European Space Agency (ESA) and the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics
(CERN—see p. 343), where the proposed
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is due to be
completed by 2008.
Through the PPARC, Britain is
taking a leading role in the current
largest international project in
ground-based astronomy. The
Gemini project involves building
two 8m telescopes at Mauna Kea
(Hawaii) and Cerro Pachon (Chile).
These are due to be completed in
1999 and 2001 respectively . The
other partners are the United States,
Canada, Argentina, Brazil and
Chile. Britain has a 25 per cent stake
in the work, with major
responsibility for the primary
mirror support system and much of
the control software.
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council
BBSRC, with a Science Budget allocation of
£175 million in 1996-97, sustains a broad base
of interdisciplinary research and training to
underpin the biology-based industries,
including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals,
agriculture, agrochemicals and food.
332
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Two potent naturally occurring
insecticides have been isolated from
calceolaria andina, a Chilean plant, by
researchers at the Institute of Arable
Crops Research in Rothamsted
(Hertfordshire). The compounds,
naphthoquinones, are effective
against important insect pests such
as whitefly, aphids and mites,
including those resistant to many of
the current commercial insecticides.
Recently developed synthetic
equivalents are particularly
promising.
The research was part of an
international project which also
involved researchers at the
University of Chile-Probio Ltd, the
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the
University of Southampton.
BBSRC operates programmes in both
fundamental and strategic research. The
scientific themes are biomolecular sciences, in
conjunction with the EPSRC; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences and psychology; and engineering and
physical sciences. BBSRC has also developed a
number of directed programmes in agricultural
systems, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and
food to meet the needs of its principal
industrial users. BBSRC supports research in
eight research institutes and in universities.
BBSRC has an important role in training
scientists and engineers; it has over 2,000
research studentships, including 600 funded
through the CASE scheme (see p. 329), as well
as an expanding postdoctoral fellowship scheme.
Natural Environment Research
Council
In 1996—97 NERC will spend most of its
Science Budget allocation of £165 million in
the following areas:
• understanding and protecting
biodiversity;
• environmental risks and hazards,
including the release of genetically
modified organisms, prediction of extreme
events and rapid environmental
assessments for operational needs;
• global change, including predictions on a
range of time and space scales;
• natural resources—management of land,
water and the coastal zone, the
identification and exploitation of land, and
freshwater- and marine-based resources
and their sustainability;
• waste management, bioremediation
(biological treatment of pollution), and
land restoration; and
• pollution of air, land, sea and freshwater
in relation to environmental and human
health.
The Council supports research in its own
and other research establishments as well as
research and training in universities. It also
provides a range of facilities for use by the
environmental science community, including a
marine research fleet. NERC establishments
include the British Geological Survey, the
British Antarctic Survey, the Centre for
Coastal and Marine Sciences and the Centre
for Ecology and Hydrology, together with a
number of university-based units.
A new national centre for oceanographic
science and technology, the Southampton
Oceanography Centre, was officially opened in
1996. It is a national centre for research,
training and support in oceanography, geology
and aspects of marine technology and
engineering. The Centre is a joint venture with
Southampton University and incorporates the
former NERC Institute of Oceanographic
Sciences Deacon Laboratory, as well as some
departments of the university. The NERC’s
Research Vessel Services are also located at the
Centre.
NERC has a substantial external income
from collaborative and contract research
—about £40 million a year—and its staff
provide a range of expert services. Many
NERC programmes have important
implications for sustainable development and
environmental protection, and issues
concerning the quality of life.
In March 1996 a NERC group completed
333
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
an investigation into the scientific aspects of
the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas
platforms. This independent international
group of experts was established by NERC at
the request of the Government following
controversy over the planned disposal at sea of
the Brent Spar platform in 1995. The report
concluded that the global impact of deep sea
disposal of a single large structure was likely to
be small, similar to a large shipwreck.
However, the cumulative effect of continued
disposals should also be taken into
consideration.
Economic and Social Research Council
ESRC, with an R & D provision of £63 million
for 1996-97, supports high-quality research
and training to meet the needs of its users and
enhance Britain’s economic competitiveness,
the quality of life, and the effectiveness of
public services and policy. All research funded
by ESRC is conducted in higher education
institutions or independent research institutes.
The Council has eight priority themes:
• economic performance and development;
• environment and sustainability;
• governance and regulation;
• human communication and the social
shaping of technology;
• innovation and business processes;
• knowledge and skill;
• lifespan, lifestyles and health; and
• social integration and exclusion.
The Council has already made significant
investments in the area of innovation,
organisations and business processes,
launching three new centres in 1996—97:
• the Centre for Research on Innovation
and Competitive Environments, in
Manchester;
• the Centre for Organisation and
Innovation in Manufacturing at the
University of Sheffield; and
• the Complex Product Systems Innovation
Research Centre at the Universities of
Sussex and Brighton.
A Business Process Resource Centre has also
been set up as part of the joint Innovative
Manufacturing Initiative (see p. 331).
The Council devotes a substantial part of its
expenditure to training that will develop and
maintain a first-class research base in the social
sciences. Over 1,000 postgraduate students are
supported through research training awards,
advanced course awards and fellowships.
Through its participation in the Teaching
Company Scheme (see p. 335), ESRC
promotes partnerships between social
scientists and business by placing graduates in
companies for short-term projects.
Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils
The CCLRC was established as an
independent body with effect from April 1995.
It promotes scientific and engineering research
by providing facilities and technical expertise
to meet the needs of the other research
councils and their users. Its R & D budget for
1996-97 is £104.2 million, of which £82.4
million comes through agreements with the
other research councils and the rest from
contracts and agreements with other industries
and organisations.
The CCLRC is responsible for two research
establishments which were formerly part of the
EPSRC: the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
at Chilton in Oxfordshire and the Daresbury
Laboratory near Warrington in Cheshire.
These centres provide facilities too large or
complex to be housed by individual academic
institutions. Among the facilities are the
world’s leading source of pulsed neutrons and
muons, some of the world’s brightest lasers
and Britain’s only source of synchrotron light
(X-rays).
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
Although most industrial R & D is financed
by industry, the DTI gives assistance where
there is a case for doing so. In 1995-96 its net
expenditure on science and technology was
estimated at £362 million, covering
innovation and technology, aeronautics,
334
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
space (see p. 338), and nuclear and
non-nuclear energy.
In supporting these activities, the
DTI’s overall aim is to help companies to
compete more effectively in global markets
through improved innovation performance. It
seeks to achieve this, in particular, by helping
to improve the climate for business innovation,
by encouraging industry to invest more in
R & D, and by helping to develop partnerships
between the academic base and industrial
sectors in order to enhance the commercial
exploitation of basic science.
Innovation and Technology
Innovation—-the successful exploitation of new
ideas—is vital in maintaining an economy
based on competitive wealth creation.
Through its Innovation Unit, which includes
15 seconded industrialists, the DTI seeks to
influence the thinking of business, education,
the media and government, as well as the
public, towards innovation.
In Northern Ireland the Industrial Research
and Technology Unit has a similar role to that
of the DTPs Innovation Unit.
The DTPs innovation and technology
programmes have shifted away from
supporting technology generation towards
concentrating on the exploitation and transfer
of technology and the promotion of
innovation. In particular, the DTI is:
• improving companies’ access to local
innovation services through Business
Links (see p. 212);
• encouraging industry to collaborate with
the science base in R & D and technology
transfer projects under the LINK and
Teaching Company schemes;
• putting more effort into helping firms
of all sizes work together to undertake
R & D projects, including those under the
EUREKA initiative (see p. 343); and
• facilitating companies’ access to
best practice and technology from
overseas and helping companies,
especially small and medium-sized
concerns, to identify technological
opportunities and potential partners, both
in Britain and overseas.
Academic—Business Partnerships
The Government supports the transfer of
technology, knowledge and skills through
partnerships between universities and
business.
The Teaching Company Scheme (TCS)
enables young graduates to work in industry
for two years on technology transfer projects
under the joint supervision of academic and
company staff. In addition, there are 19 TCS
Centres for Small Firms at selected
universities. These help smaller businesses to
obtain access to the technology and knowledge
within the universities.
The Postgraduate Training Partnerships
(PTP) scheme enables postgraduate students
to undertake practical research in research and
technology organisations under the joint
guidance of academics and industrialists.
There are eight PTPs, each recruiting up to
ten PhD students a year.
The DTI recently funded a national
technology transfer competition to
reward effective partnerships
between academic researchers and
industry. In 1996 the £35,000 prize
was won by UMIST Ventures Ltd, the
technology transfer arm of the
University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology. The group
developed Aromascan, an ‘artificial
nose’ sensor for use in the food and
drink industry. The technology has
been shown to be more sensitive than
expert wine tasters in recognising
vintages and better than pigs at
detecting truffles.
Aeronautics
The DTFs Civil Aircraft Research and
Demonstration Programme (CARAD)
supports research and technology
demonstration in the aircraft and aero-engine
industry, helping it to compete effectively in
world markets. In 1996—97 the provision for
aeronautics is about £20 million. The
programme is part of a national aeronautics
research effort, with over half of the research
335
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
work supported being conducted in industry
and the universities, and the remainder at the
Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (see
below). CARAD and earlier programmes have
supported projects across the range of aero¬
engine technologies, including compressors,
turbines, noise, nacelles and materials. These
have helped Rolls-Royce to increase its share
of the large civil engine market with its Trent
700 and 800 range of engines (see p. 252).
Launch Aid is a means of providing government
assistance for specific development projects in
the aerospace industry.
Industrial Research Establishments
The DTI acts as the main customer, on behalf of
all users of measurement (especially industry),
for the development of new measurement
standards under the National Measurement
System (NMS—see p. 214) and materials
metrology programmes. Most of the work of the
National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is in
support of these programmes; part of the work
of the Laboratory of the Government Chemist
(LGC) and the National Engineering
Laboratory (NEL) also supports the NMS.
In common with other departments, the
DTI reviewed the future of its laboratories,
having previously established them as
executive agencies, and in 1994 decided that
their future would be in the private sector. In
July 1995 a private sector contractor was
appointed to run NPL for five years; NEL was
sold to a private sector firm in October 1995;
and LGC was established as an independent
private sector company in March 1996.
Ministry of Defence
Ministry of Defence provision for R & D in
1996-97 is £2,188 million, of which about
£595 million is for medium- and long-term
applied research relevant to military needs.
With the ending of the Cold War, the
Government is committed to achieving a
gradual reduction in real terms in spending on
defence R & D.
The Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA) is the largest single scientific
employer in Britain. It was formed through a
merger of the MoD’s Defence Research
Agency with most of the Ministry’s other
non-nuclear science and technology
establishments in 1995. Its role is to supply
scientific and technical services primarily to
the Ministry but also to other government
departments. DERA has set up four dual-use
technology centres in subjects ranging from
structural materials to high-performance
computing, to enhance the degree of
collaboration between DERA, industry and the
academic science base.
DERA subcontracts research to industry
and universities, ensuring that their know-how
is harnessed to meeting military requirements.
It also works closely with industry in order to
see that scientific and technological advances
are taken forward at an early stage into
development and production. This technology
transfer is not just confined to the defence
industry but has also led to important ‘spin
offs’ into civil markets, in fields ranging from
new materials and electronic devices to
advanced aerodynamics. The latter in
particular has been instrumental in giving
Britain a leading role in civil aircraft design.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with The Scottish Office Agriculture,
Environment and Fisheries Department, the
Department of Agriculture for Northern
Ireland and the research councils, particularly
BBSRC. It also covers the research interests of
the Welsh Office Agriculture Department.
The research programme reflects the
Ministry’s wide-ranging responsibilities for
protecting and enhancing the rural and marine
environment; protecting the public, especially
in food safety and quality, flooding and coastal
defence, and animal health and welfare; and
improving the economic performance of the
agriculture, fishing and food industries.
The budget for research expenditure in
1996-97 is £136 million, including support for
the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (see p. 341).
Research is contracted increasingly through
open competition with research councils, the
Ministry’s agencies, non-departmental public
bodies, higher education institutions and other
organisations.
336
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Department of the Environment
The Department of the Environment funds
research in several policy areas: environmental
protection, including radioactive substances;
water; the countryside; planning and inner
cities; local government; housing; building and
construction; energy efficiency and
environmental technology. The largest
programmes are those on pollution-related
climate change, regional and urban air quality,
the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and best
practice in energy efficiency. Total
expenditure in 1996-97 is estimated at £114
million.
British scientific expertise is being made
available in developing countries to protect
threatened species of plants and animals as part
of the Darwin Initiative (see p. 370). The
Department has committed £12 million to 116
projects in more than 60 countries.
The new Environment Agency (see p. 355)
has an R & D programme of £13.5 million in
1996-97.
Department of Health
The Department of Health’s R & D strategy
comprises two complementary programmes:
the Policy Research Programme and the
National Health Service R & D Programme.
The Department also oversees the research
programmes of the health-related
non-departmental public bodies. Total
expenditure on research in 1995-96, including
expenditure by the non-departmental public
bodies, was estimated at £69 million.
The strategy promotes strong links with the
science base and with research councils,
charities, industry and the European Union.
The Department, together with the Medical
Research Council, has helped to shape the
EU’s Biomedicine and Health Research
Programme within the Fourth Framework
Programme (see p. 342).
Overseas Development Administration
The Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) commissions and sponsors technology
development and research on topics relevant to
those geographical regions designated as the
primary targets of the aid programme and of
benefit to the poorest people in those
countries. Provision for R & D in 1996-97 is
£81.4 million.
The ODA’s support for R & D is organised
into five main programmes, covering
renewable natural resources and environment;
engineering-related sectors (water and
sanitation, energy efficiency and geoscience,
urbanisation and transport); health and
population; economic and social development;
and education. R & D is also carried out as part
of Britain’s bilateral aid to particular countries.
The ODA draws on a range of professional
expertise in research councils, universities and
the private sector.
The ODA also contributes to international
centres and programmes undertaking R & D
aimed at solving problems faced by developing
countries. These contributions include support
for the European Union’s Science and
Technology for Development programme,
which sponsors research in renewable natural
resources, agriculture, health and nutrition.
The Scottish Office
The Scottish Office both contracts and itself
undertakes a wide range of R & D
commissions. Total R & D planned
expenditure in 1996-97 is £78.3 million in
support of its policy responsibilities, which
include agriculture, fisheries, health, the
environment, education and home affairs. In
many areas—medicine, agriculture and
biological sciences, fisheries and marine
science—public sector research in Scotland
has an international reputation.
The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department encourages the
development of science-based industry in a
number of ways, for example, by promoting
and administering government industrial
R & D schemes, and promoting participation
in, and dissemination of results from, EU
R & D programmes.
The enterprise network in Scotland
—Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise and LECs (see Chapter 14)—is
addressing the need for innovation and
technology transfer, both through grant
support for product and process innovation
and a wide range of initiatives. Scottish
337
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Enterprise, together with the Royal Society of
Edinburgh (see p. 341), has looked at how to
improve the wealth-creating potential of
academic research in universities and research
institutes in Scotland, in particular by
identifying practical means of converting
research into wealth-creating products and
processes. A strategy to achieve this was
published in August 1996.
Space Activities
Britain’s civil space programme is co-ordinated
by the British National Space Centre (BNSC),
a partnership between government
departments and research councils. BNSC
encourages the competitiveness of the space
industry and the exploitation of opportunities
in space, based on appraisal of project costs
and potential technological and commercial
benefits. Through BNSC, Britain spent over
£200 million on space activities in 1995-96,
with funding mainly from the DTI, the
research councils, the Department of the
Environment and the Meteorological Office.
Around two-thirds of Britain’s space
expenditure was devoted to programmes
shared with the European Space Agency
(ESA). The remainder supported a
programme of R & D in higher education
institutions, government establishments and
industry.
Around half of Britain’s space programme
is concerned with satellite-based Earth
observation (remote sensing) for commercial
and environmental applications. Britain has
committed around £115 million to ESA’s
ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites, which were
launched in 1991 and 1995 respectively. It
provided two of the instruments on both
satellites: a Synthetic Aperture Radar and an
Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR).
The radar is capable of supplying high
resolution images of the Earth with 24-hour
coverage irrespective of cloud cover
conditions. The ATSR measures global sea
surface temperature to a very high degree of
accuracy. British-built remote sensing
instruments are also at work on a number of
other satellites, and BNSC promotes the
commercial and scientific values of Earth
observation data.
Britain is contributing £284 million to an
important new Earth observation mission due
to be launched in 1999 and known as
ENVISAT-1. ENVISAT, carrying a new
generation of ESA environmental instruments,
including a new radar, will fly on the
British-led Polar Platform. Britain is leading
the development of ENVISAT’s advanced
radar, and an advanced version of the ATSR
instrument that will measure infra-red
emissions over land and sea.
The Earth Observation Data Centre at
Farnborough (Hampshire), operated by the
National Remote Sensing Centre, is one of
ESA’s four main processing and archiving
facilities for storing and distributing ERS data
for both scientific and commercial purposes.
Britain has a world-class reputation for its
space science. A quarter of Britain’s space
budget is devoted to science, including
astronomy, planetary science and geophysics.
Science contributions have been made to
missions ranging from the Hubble Space
Telescope to the Ulysses solar space probe.
Britain is contributing substantially to the
SOHO mission to study the Sun, and to the
Infrared Space Observatory. It is also
participating in XMM, the ESA’s X-ray
spectroscopy mission, due to be launched in
1999.
There are bilateral agreements for scientific
research between Britain and other countries,
such as the United States through its National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), Russia and Japan. British scientists
developed, for example, the widefield camera
for ROSAT (the German, British and US
X-ray satellite), and a spectrometer for the
Japanese-built Yohkoh satellite. They are also
providing an X-ray telescope for the Russian
Spectrum-X mission, expected to be launched
in 1998.
A major area of British space expertise is
satellite communications and navigation. In
Europe, Britain is both a leading producer and
user of satellite communications technology
(see p. 253). It is contributing to preparations
for future ESA satellite communications
missions, including ARTEMIS, which will
provide important communications links for
the ENVISAT programme. Britain is also
contributing to the development of a global
338
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
navigation satellite system within Europe
which will augment the United States GPS
system to provide increased accuracy and
reliability required for civil aviation global
navigation.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
Universities carry out most of Britain’s
long-term strategic and basic research in
science and technology. The higher education
funding councils in England, Scotland and
Wales (see p. 460) provide the main general
funds to support research in universities and
other higher education institutions in Great
Britain. These funds pay for the salaries of
permanent academic staff, who usually teach as
well as undertake research, and contribute to
the infrastructure for research. In Northern
Ireland academic institutions are funded by the
Department of Education for Northern
Ireland. The quality of research performance
of departments is a key element in the
allocation of funding. In 1996 the funding
councils carried out a research assessment
exercise to assess the quality of research in
each subject across all higher education
institutions in Britain.
Basic and strategic research in higher
education institutions are also supported by
the research councils. Institutions undertaking
research with the support of research council
grants have the rights over the commercial
exploitation of their research, subject to the
prior agreement of the sponsoring research
council. They may make use of technology
transfer experts and other specialists, such as
BTG (see below), to help to exploit and license
commercially the results of their research.
The other main channels of support for
scientific research in higher education
institutions are industry, charities,
government departments and the European
Union. Institutions are expected to recover
the full cost of commissioned research.
The high quality of research in higher
education institutions, and their marketing
skills, have enabled them to attract more
funding from a larger range of external
sources, especially in contract income from
industry and charities.
Science Parks
Science parks are partnerships between higher
education or research centres and industry to
promote commercially focused research and
advanced technology. There are around 50
such parks in operation, and they are host to
more than 1,200 companies. Most of these are
engaged in computing, biotechnology,
chemicals, electrical engineering and robotics.
Technology transfer and R & D are the most
common activities, rather than large-scale
manufacturing.
A growing number of universities offer
industry interdisciplinary research centres
with exploitable resources. These include
access to analytical equipment, library facilities
and worldwide databases as well as academic
expertise.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Industrial Research and Technology
Organisations
Research and Technology Organisations
(RTOs) are independent organisations
carrying out commercially relevant research
and other services on behalf of industry, often
relating to a specific industrial sector. Britain
has the largest RTO sector in Europe,
consisting of around 70 organisations, which
together employ over 10,000 people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source
of funds for biomedical research in Britain.
Their combined contribution in 1996-97 will
be about £342 million. The three largest
contributors are the Wellcome Trust—the
world’s largest medical charity—with a
contribution of £133 million, the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund (£57 million) and the
Cancer Research Campaign (£43 million).
BTG
BTG is among the World’s leading technology
transfer companies. It identifies commercially
promising technology from universities,
research institutions and companies
worldwide; protects these technologies
339
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
through patents; negotiates licences with
industrial partners on a worldwide basis; and
shares the net revenues with the sources of the
inventions.
BTG holds over 9,000 patents and patent
applications, covering more than 1,300
inventions with 478 current licence
agreements. Its areas of activity include
pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, automotive
engineering, medical technology, electronics
and telecommunications.
Professional Institutions and Learned
Societies
There are numerous technical institutions and
professional associations in Britain, many of
which promote their own disciplines or the
education and professional well-being of their
members.
The Council of Science and Technology
Institutes has seven member institutes
representing biology, chemical engineering,
chemistry, food science and technology,
geology, hospital physics and physics.
The Engineering Council promotes the
study of all types of engineering in schools and
other organisations, in co-operation with its
200 industry affdiates, which include large
private sector companies and government
departments. Together with 39 professional
engineering institutions, the Council accredits
courses in higher education institutions. It also
advises the Government on academic,
industrial and professional issues.
More than 300 learned societies play an
important role in advancing science and
technology through meetings, publications and
sponsorship.
Royal Society
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, is
Britain’s academy of science and has over
1,100 Fellows and more than 100 Foreign
Members. Many of its Fellows serve on
governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research. The
Society’s estimated net expenditure on science
and technology in 1996-97 is more than £29
million. Almost 80 per cent of the money
which it distributes is derived from a grant
from the Government, the remainder coming
from private sources.
The Society has a dual role, as the national
academy of science and as the provider of a
broad range of services for the scientific
community in the national interest. Its
activities are:
• recognising excellence in science and its
application, for example, through election
to the Fellowship and awarding medals
and prizes;
• promoting independent advice, notably to
government, on science and
engineering-related matters;
• encouraging research and its application
through research fellowships and grants to
individual scientists, and disseminating
the results of research through meetings,
lectures, exhibitions and publications;
• fostering public understanding and
awareness of science, and promoting
science education;
• supporting international scientific
relations, including exchange of scientists;
• providing resources for, and encouraging,
research into the history of science; and
• acting as a forum for discussion of
scientific issues.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in Britain
is the Royal Academy of Engineering, founded
in 1976. The Academy has 1,036 Fellows, 68
Foreign Members and 14 Honorary Fellows. It
promotes excellence in engineering for the
benefit of society. In 1996-97 it is receiving a
grant of £3.1 million from the OST and plans
to raise over £6.5 million from other sources.
The Academy’s programmes are aimed at
attracting first-class students into engineering,
raising awareness of the importance of
engineering design among undergraduates,
developing links between industry and higher
education, and increasing industrial
investment in engineering research in higher
education institutions.
In 1996 the Academy launched the
Engineering Foresight Awards Scheme to
enable British engineers to take part in
340
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
short-term R & D projects overseas on subjects
identified in the Foresight Programme.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
running postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and
publishing journals. It has been involved with
Scottish Enterprise in developing a strategy to
increase the extent of commercial use of the
products of the Scottish research base (see p.
338) and has been active in the Foresight
process. It also acts as a source of independent
scientific advice to the Government and
others.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
(BAAS), founded in 1831, is mainly concerned
with science, while the Royal Society of Arts,
dating from 1754, deals with the arts and
commerce as well as science. The Royal
Institution, which was founded in 1799, also
performs these functions and runs its own
research laboratories.
The Committee on the Public
Understanding of Science (COPUS), set up in
1986 by the Royal Society, the BAAS and the
Royal Institution, acts as a focus for a
wide-ranging programme to improve public
awareness of science and technology.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London, an
independent conservation, science and
education body founded in 1826, runs London
Zoo, which occupies about 15 hectares (36
acres) of Regent’s Park, London. The Society
is responsible for the Institute of Zoology,
which carries out research in support of
conservation. The Institute’s work covers a
broad range of topics, including ecology,
behaviour, reproductive biology and
conservation genetics. The Society also
operates in field conservation and consultancy,
and is concerned with practical field
conservation, primarily in East and Southern
Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia.
Whipsnade Wild Animal Park near
Dunstable (Bedfordshire) is also owned by the
Society. Other well-known zoos include those
in Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley and
Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in
1759, covers 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew in
west London and a 187-hectare (462-acre)
estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, in West
Sussex. They contain the largest collections of
living and dried plants in the world. Research
is conducted into all aspects of plant life,
including physiology, biochemistry, genetics,
economic botany and the conservation of
habitats and species. Kew is to build a seed
bank containing the world’s most
comprehensive collection of plants at
Wakehurst Place. In 1996 it was allocated
jf21 million by the Millennium Commission
towards the estimated £76 million cost of the
project. Staff are also active in programmes to
return endangered plant species to the wild.
Kew participates in joint research programmes
in more than 50 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh,
founded in 1670, is a centre for research into
taxonomy (classification of species), for the
conservation and study of living plants and for
horticultural education.
A national botanic garden and research
centre for Wales is to be developed on a
230-hectare (570-acre) site on the Middleton
Hall estate at Llandeilo, near Swansea. The
£43 million project is backed by a
consortium of public and private
organisations and individuals. The project
has been awarded £21.7 million by the
Millenium Commission.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum has 68 million
specimens, ranging from a blue whale skeleton
to minute insects. It is one of the world’s
principal centres for research into natural
history, offering an advisory service to
institutions all over the world.
341
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Science Museum promotes
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. Its
extensive collection of scientific instruments
and machinery is complemented by
interactive computer games and audio-visual
equipment for visitors to use. In this way, the
museum explains scientific principles to the
general public and documents the history of
science, from early discoveries to space age
technology. These two museums are in
South Kensington, London. Other important
collections include those at the Museum of
Science and Industry in Birmingham, the
Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of
Science in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish
Museum, Edinburgh.
Science Festivals
Science festivals are a growing feature of local
co-operative efforts to further understanding
of the contribution made by science to
everyday life. Schools, museums, laboratories,
higher education institutions and industry
contribute to a large range of special events.
The oldest and most widely publicised
science festival is the British Association
Annual Festival of Science, held at a British
university. The BAAS is also involved in
organising the National Science, Engineering
and Technology Week (see p. 330). The
largest science festival in one place is the
annual Edinburgh International Science
Festival; in 1996 it included 265 events and
attracted about 155,000 visitors. A centre
housing a permanent exhibition is due to open
in 1998. The £1.2 million project is backed by
the City of Edinburgh, the Millennium
Commission and a group of private sponsors.
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
Britain has a key role in a wide variety of major
international scientific facilities and research
programmes.
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has run a series of R & D
framework programmes in several strategic
sectors, with the aim of strengthening the
scientific and technological basis of European
industry and supporting the development of
EU policies more broadly.
The Fourth Framework Programme runs
from 1994 to 1998. It has a budget of 13,000
million ECUs (about £10,900 million) and
provides funds for international collaborative
research in fields such as biotechnology,
industrial materials and information
technology. Britain played a significant role in
shaping its structure and priorities. It also
helped secure agreement that the EU should
develop ‘generic’ technologies with a broad
range of industrial applications, rather than
funding research projects to meet the needs of
specific industrial sectors. The EU has also
agreed that more resources should be devoted
to disseminating technology from research
projects to small and medium-sized
enterprises.
Two examples of the many EU research
activities involving British organisations, both
of which are part of the Fourth Framework
Programme, are:
• the EU’s Information Technology
Programme, which is a shared cost
collaborative programme designed to help
build the services and technologies that
underpin the information society. The
programme is open to companies,
academic institutions and research bodies.
Britain is currently participating in 369
projects in the programme; and
• the Training and Mobility of Researchers
(TMR) programme, which aims to
develop human resources for science and
technology through promoting high-level
training for researchers and encouraging
their mobility across the community.
Britain is the most popular destination
under the programme, with over 30 per
cent of TMR fellows opting to train in
British laboratories.
Other International Activities
Over 700 British organisations have taken part
in EUREKA, an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in
developing and producing advanced products
342
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
and processes with worldwide sales potential.
Britain is involved in 300 projects, including
research into the factory of the future and a
sub-programme to generate projects with an
environmental theme. There are 25 members
of EUREKA, including the 15 EU countries
and the European Commission. Britain
currently holds the Presidency of EUREKA
until June 1997.
The COST (European Co-operation in the
field of Science and Technical research)
programme encourages co-operation in
national research activities across Europe, with
participants from industry, academia and
research laboratories. Transport,
telecommunications and materials have
traditionally been the largest areas supported.
New areas include physics, chemistry,
neuroscience and the application of
biotechnology to agriculture, including
forestry. There are currently 25 member states
and Britain takes part in almost all of about 125
current COST actions.
Other examples of international
collaboration include the European Space
Agency (see p. 338) and CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics, based in
Geneva. Scientific programmes at CERN aim
to test, verify and develop the ‘standard model’
of the origins and structure of the universe.
There are 19 member states. Britain’s
programme is co-ordinated through the
CCLRC and the subscription is paid by the
PPARC.
Contributions to the high-flux neutron
source at the Institut Laue-Langevin and the
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility,
both in Grenoble, are paid by the EPSRC. The
PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the
Arctic Circle, which conducts research on the
ionosphere.
Through the MRC, Britain participates in
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL), based in Heidelberg, Germany.
Britain was chosen as the location for the
European Bioinformatics Institute, an
outstation of the EMBL. The Institute, based
in Cambridge, provides up-to-date
information on molecular biology and genome
sequencing for researchers throughout Europe.
It became fully operational in 1995.
The MRC pays Britain’s contribution to
the Human Frontier Science programme,
which supports international collaborative
research into brain function and biological
function through molecular level approaches.
It also pays Britain’s subscription to the
International Agency for Cancer Research.
NERC has a major involvement in
international programmes of research into
global change organised through the World
Climate Research Programme and the
International Geosphere—Biosphere
Programme. NERC also supports Britain’s
subscription to the Ocean Drilling Program
and is involved in a wide range of other
international activities.
Britain is a member of the science and
technology committees of international
organisations such as the OECD and NATO,
and of various specialised agencies of the
United Nations. Among non-governmental
organisations, the research councils, the Royal
Society and the British Academy are members
of the European Science Foundation, and a
number of British scientists are involved in its
initiatives.
The British Government also enters into
bilateral agreements with other governments
to encourage closer collaboration on science,
engineering and technology. Such
agreements were signed, for example, with
South Africa in 1995 and with India and the
Russian Federation in 1996. Staff in British
Embassies and High Commissions conduct
government business on, and promote
contacts in, science, engineering and
technology between Britain and overseas
countries; and help to inform a large number
of organisations in Britain about science,
engineering and technology developments
and initiatives overseas. There are science
and technology sections in British Embassies
in Paris, Bonn, Washington, Tokyo, Moscow
and Peking. A number of other posts have
officers whose responsibilities include
science, engineering and technology.
The British Council (see p. 140) promotes
better understanding and knowledge of Britain
and its scientific and technological
achievements. It encourages exchange of
specialists, supplies specialised information,
and fosters co-operation in research, training
343

and education. The Council also identifies and The research councils maintain, with the
manages technological, scientific and British Council, a joint office in Brussels to
educational projects in developing countries. promote European co-operation in research.

Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs. The Government’s strategy on sustainable development was
published in 1994, as one of the documents that arose from the Rio de Janeiro
‘earth summit’. A further major report setting out key indicators of progress
towards sustainable development in Britain was published in March 1996. The
most recent edition of This Common Inheritance, the Government’s annual White
Paper on the environment, was published in March 1996.
Government Strategy
The Government published its national
strategy on sustainable development in 1994. It
was one of the doeuments that came out in
response to the agreements signed at the 1992
Rio de Janeiro ‘earth summit’, the United
Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED). The other
documents, published at the same time, cover
biodiversity (see p. 370), climate change (see
pp. 359-60), and forestry.
The national strategy included the
establishment of three bodies to assist policy
on sustainable development:
• an independent panel, which advises on
issues of major strategic importance to
sustainable development;
• a round table, which brings together
interests such as business, local
government and academics to discuss
these matters with ministers; and
• ‘Going for Green’, an independent
committee which seeks to persuade
individuals and groups to commit
themselves to sustainable development.
In January 1996 the Government Panel on
Sustainable Development produced its second
annual report, which concentrated on
environmental accounting, biotechnology,
forestry and the disposal of radioactive waste.
The Government published its response in
March 1996. The Panel is currently looking at
biodiversity and agriculture in Britain;
government procurement; carbon dioxide
emissions and energy; and subsidies. Its next
report is due to be published in January 1997.
The UK Round Table on Sustainable
Development consists of about 30 members,
drawn from central and local government,
business, environmental organisations and
other sectors of the community. It published
its first report in April 1996, detailing its work
in the preceding year. Its priorities in that year
included transport and energy, although it also
made recommendations on the new landfill tax
(see p. 166) and environmental trusts. The
347
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government has welcomed the report. The
Round Table also keeps in close touch with
similar bodies promoting sustainable
development in other countries.
In March 1996 the Government published
This Common Inheritance: UK Annual Report
1996, which sets out progress during 1995 on
the commitments in the strategy and in
previous White Papers. It also highlights
quantified targets and spells out government
priorities for the year ahead.
The Environment Act 1995 set up the
Environment Agency (see p. 355), covering
England and Wales, and the Scottish
Environment Protection Agency. The
Government is giving the Environment
Agency statutory guidance on the contribution
it can make to sustainable development.
Indicators of Sustainable Development
The Government’s report on indicators of
sustainable development was published in
March 1996. It lists 118 indicators, grouped into
21 broad headings. The broad headings are:
• the economy;
• transport use;
• leisure and tourism;
• overseas trade;
• energy;
• land use;
• water resources;
• forestry;
• fish resources;
• climate change;
• ozone layer depletion;
• acid deposition;
• air;
• freshwater quality;
• marine;
• wildlife and habitats;
• land cover and landscape;.
• soil;
• minerals extraction;
• waste; and
• radioactivity.
Where possible, the indicators track trends
over the last 20 to 25 years. Their publication
makes Britain one of the first countries in the
world to construct indicators which explicitly
try to link environmental and development
concerns.
The Economy
One of the key aims of sustainable
development is to promote a healthy economy
in order to generate the resources needed to
meet people’s needs and improve
environmental quality. This in turn can
further the protection of human health and the
natural environment. Britain’s economy is
extensively described in the Economic Affairs
section of Britain 1997, the chapters of which
between them cover a number of different
aspects of the economy. The key sustainable
development indicators chosen for tracking the
economy include gross domestic product,
consumer spending, inflation and employment.
Also under this heading are two indicators that
look at human health in Britain: infant
mortality and life expectancy.
Transport Use
Transport has an important bearing on the
environment, and a key aim of sustainable
development is therefore to strike a balance
between the ability of transport to serve
economic development and the need to protect
the environment and sustain the quality of life,
both now and in the future. A broad picture of
Britain’s transport infrastructure and policies
is given in Chapter 19; policies to reduce
transport-related pollution are looked at on
pp. 361—2. The key sustainable development
indicators which the Government has
selected on transport use include total
passenger miles travelled, numbers of short
journeys, the volume of freight traffic, and
real change in the cost of different modes of
transport.
Leisure and Tourism
The growth of leisure and tourism in recent
decades has put some stress on the
348
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
environment, especially where large numbers
of people wish to visit wild places (see the
special Introduction, pp. vii—xv). The aim is to
maintain the quality of the environment in
which leisure takes place. If the environment
were allowed to deteriorate, an essential part of
Britain’s attractiveness to tourists would be
lost. A number of initiatives have been taken to
help reconcile the needs of tourism and leisure
with those of the environment: for example, in
1994 the English Tourist Board published
Getting it Right—A Guide to Visitor
Management. This booklet, produced jointly
with the English Historic Towns Forum and a
firm of chartered surveyors, is a guide to the
management of visitors in historic towns and
draws on the experiences of 12 towns that have
drawn up such plans. The key indicators for
this sector include the number of leisure
journeys and air travel to and from Britain.
Overseas Trade
The aim is to ensure that Britain’s trading
activities contribute to sustainable
development, both at home and abroad.
Britain’s overseas trading patterns are covered
in detail in Chapter 12. The indicators that
have been chosen are imports and exports in
certain categories, including food, basic
materials including fuel, and manufactured
goods.
Energy
Energy is vital to a developed economy such as
Britain’s. The key objectives are to ensure the
supply of energy at competitive prices, reduce
adverse consequences of energy use and
encourage consumers to meet their needs with
less energy through energy efficiency. Energy
conservation is also closely linked to the
prevention of global climate change, as the
consumption of fossil fuels can lead to the
emission of greenhouse gases (see pp. 359—60).
Energy use in Britain is covered in Chapter 17;
this includes energy efficiency measures (see
pp. 261-2) and new and renewable sources of
energy (see pp. 274—5). Key indicators selected
for energy include primary and final energy
consumption for Britain, fuel prices, the
depletion of fossil fuels, nuclear and renewable
fuel capacities and energy consumption by
various key sectors.
Land Use
A key objective is to balance the competing
demands for the finite amount of land
available. The main issues are to minimise the
loss of rural land to development and to
maintain the viability of town centres, with
people living near where they work. The
Government has taken various steps to
promote this—for example, strengthening
planning controls so as to promote the viability
of town centres (see p. 383), as well as
spending heavily over many years on urban
regeneration (see pp. 375—81). The key
indicators selected here include the percentage
of Britain’s land area covered by urban
development, the reclamation of derelict land,
the re-use of urban land for development, the
amount of land taken for new roads,
out-of-town retail floorspace, average journey
lengths, and spending on regeneration.
Water Resources
The aim is to ensure that there is sufficient
water to meet consumers’ needs, including
those of agriculture and industry, while
protecting the aquatic environment from
damage caused by over-abstraction. Britain’s
water industry is covered in pp. 278—80. Key
indicators include licensed abstractions
compared with rainfall levels in drought years,
abstractions for irrigation, and the level of
public water supply.
Forestry
Forests play a vital role in the world’s
ecosystem, and were another of the areas
selected for special attention at the UNCED
conference. Britain produced its forestry
programme in 1994, following on from the
conference. Britain’s forestry industry is
covered in Chapter 18; for information on the
programme for the new National Forest and 12
community forests see p. 367. Key indicators
for forestry include forest cover, the amount of
ancient semi-natural woodland, and tree health.
349
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fish Resources
In order to sustain the fishing industry, it is
necessary to protect fish stocks in British
waters. This is being done in the context of the
EU Common Fisheries Policy—see pp. 297-8
for the conservation measures being used to
protect fish stocks. Key indicators include fish
stocks and catches.
Climate Change
Man-made emissions of‘greenhouse gases’ are
believed to be changing the world’s climate,
with potentially very serious consequences for
the future habitability of large parts of the
world. Climate change was therefore one of the
areas to be tackled at the UNCED conference,
and Britain has developed an action plan to
meets its commitments. This is covered on
pp. 359-60. Key indicators include British
emissions of greenhouse gases and global
temperature change.
Ozone Layer Depletion
Scientists have discovered thinning of the
stratospheric ozone layer, caused by various
ozone-depleting chemicals released into the
atmosphere by human activities. International
action has been taken to phase out the main
substances causing the problem and replace
them with less harmful alternatives. These
measures are described in more detail on
p. 360. Indicators include the atmospheric
loading of chlorine, the observed depletion of
ozone over Britain and the consumption of
chlorofluorocarbons.
Acid Deposition
Britain has accepted very challenging targets to
reduce acidifying emissions, principally
sulphur dioxide (S02) and oxides of nitrogen
(NOx). There have already been significant
reductions in some acidifying emissions, and
benefits from this have been observed in lower
acidity levels in some Scottish lochs (see
pp. 360-1). Key indicators in this sector include
the extent to which ‘critical loads’ in soils and
freshwaters are being exceeded, emissions of
S02 and NOx from power stations, and
emissions of NOx from road transport.
Air
The key aim is to control air pollution in order
to reduce the risks of adverse effects on natural
ecosystems, human health and the quality of
life. The reduction of emissions, especially in
urban areas, is very important. Legislation has
made important strides in recent decades in
the control of air pollution (see pp. 358-62),
while the Government has introduced
extensive monitoring of pollution levels. Key
indicators include emissions and
concentrations of various pollutants and
expenditure on air pollution abatement.
Freshwater Qiiality
The quality of Britain’s freshwaters is
generally good, especially in Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The aim is to maintain and
improve that record in order to sustain the
aquatic environment. Large-scale investment
is being made by the water companies to
improve standards at water treatment plants,
and the Government is introducing a system of
statutory water quality objectives (see
pp. 356-7). Key indicators include chemical
and biological river quality, the levels of
nitrates and phosphorus in rivers, pesticides in
rivers and groundwaters, the number of
pollution incidents, the proportion of
discharge consents that are being complied
with, and expenditure on water abstraction,
treatment and distribution.
Marine
The key issue is to prevent pollution from
human activities reaching the sea, especially
pollution from toxic substances that persist
in the marine environment. Britain has made
considerable progress on reducing the input
of dangerous substances into its coastal
waters, and there have been significant
improvements in the quality of its bathing
waters (see p. 357). Important indicators here
include estuarial water quality,
concentrations of key pollutants, bathing
water quality, the concentration of
contaminants in fish, and the amount of oil
spilled or discharged into the sea.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Wildlife and Habitats
It is important that the variety of wildlife in
Britain is conserved as far as possible, and that
commercially exploited species are managed in
a sustainable way. Many species of plant and
animal wildlife in Britain are protected by law,
and there are active programmes to support or
reintroduce certain species (see p. 366). Key
indicators include the number of native species
at risk in Britain, plant diversity, and the
number of lakes and ponds.
Land Cover and Landscape
A key sustainable development issue is to
balance the protection of the countryside’s
landscape and habitats of value for wildlife
with the maintenance of an efficient food
supply. Programmes such as the
Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme (see
pp. 292-3) help ensure that farming is carried
out in an environmentally acceptable way,
while various designations and other schemes
assist the protection of important habitats (see
pp. 365-6). Key indicators include rural land
cover, nitrogen and pesticide usage,
agricultural productivity, the number of sites
covered by important designations and length
of linear landscape features.
Soil
Soil is a limited resource, vital both for the
production of food and as an ecosystem for
various organisms. Problems can include the
acidification of soils as alkaline nutrients leach
out, and contamination with heavy metals. The
key indicators for sustainability in this area
include soil quality and concentrations of
heavy metals in soils.
Minerals Extraction
Britain has many mineral resources (see
Chapter 17). However, increasingly there are
limitations on sources of supply which are free
from environmental constraints. The key aims
for sustainable development are to conserve
minerals as far as possible while ensuring an
adequate supply, to minimise waste production
and to encourage the efficient use of materials.
The key indicators for this sector include the
output of aggregates, the area of land worked
for minerals, and the reclamation of mineral
workings.
Waste
Britain is seeking to reduce the amount of
waste produced, to make best use of waste
which is produced, and to minimise pollution
from waste. Recycling schemes are important
in this, and the Government has set some
ambitious targets in its recent waste strategy
(see p. 356). Key indicators include the
quantities of household, industrial and
commercial waste created, the recycling of
household waste and materials, and the
amount of energy produced from waste.
Radioactivity
Radioactive materials, used properly, can bring
many benefits in a wide range of fields.
However, care must be taken to ensure that
exposure of the public to radiation is
minimised and that radioactive wastes are
properly treated. Britain’s nuclear power
programme is covered on pp. 273-4; the
tackling of waste and other problems, such as
naturally occurring radon gas, is looked at on
pp. 363-4. The key indicators include
radiation exposure, discharges from nuclear
power stations and the quantities of radioactive
waste created.
Business and Consumer Involvement
The Government has launched a number of
initiatives to help business improve its
environmental performance, ensure business
concerns are taken into account when policy is
made, and help consumers assess firms’
environmental credentials. For example, the
Environmental Technology Best Practice
Programme promotes better environmental
practices that reduce business costs for all areas
of industry and commerce, with information
and advice on environmental techniques. It
also provides an environmental helpline. In
1995 the Government announced the
establishment of the Small Company
Environmental and Energy Management
351
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Assistance Scheme (SCEEMAS), which makes
grants to small companies to improve their
environmental performance.
Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment
The Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment is made up of 26 business
leaders, appointed by the Government and
serving in a personal capacity. Its roles are:
• advising the Government on environmental
issues of concern to business;
• providing a link with international business
initiatives on the environment; and
• helping to mobilise the business
community through demonstrating good
environmental practice.
Much of the Committee’s work is carried
out through working groups which concentrate
on a particular area.
British Standard on Environmental Management
In 1994 the British Standards Institution (see
p. 214) published BS7750, the world’s first
standard for environmental management
systems. Having been tested in a wide range of
businesses and other bodies, the standard can
be used by any organisation. BS7750 shares
many features of the widely used BS EN ISO
9000—formerly BS5750—quality
management standard. The first BS7750
certificates were awarded in 1995.
Eco-management and Audit
In 1993 the European Union adopted a
regulation setting up a voluntary
eco-management and audit scheme, which
became operational throughout the EU in
1995. Although it is intended primarily for the
manufacturing, power and waste disposal
sectors, its use can be extended to other sectors
on an experimental basis. The first such
adaptation was the British scheme for local
government. Registration covers individual
sites1 rather than companies’ entire operations.
'Or ‘operational units’, in the case of local authorities.
An essential component is an environmental
management system, such as one certified
under BS7750. Applicants must also prepare
and publish an environmental statement
which, together with the management system,
needs to be verified by an accredited
independent body. A full cycle of review and
verification has to be conducted at least once
every three years.
In 1995 five companies in Britain—Akzo
Nobel, Ciba Clayton, Design to Distribution,
National Power and NOR Systems—became
the first in Europe to register sites under the
scheme. Government grants are available to
help small businesses meet the cost of
employing environmental experts to assist with
registration.
Ecolabelling
Increasingly consumers wish to take
environmental considerations into account
when buying goods. Britain has played a
leading role in developing the EC ecolabelling
scheme. This voluntary scheme aims to help
consumers identify those products which are
less harmful to the environment over their
whole lifecycle. In 1993 Britain awarded the
The European Ecolabel
352
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
first European ecolabels to Hoover Ltd for
washing machines in its ‘New Wave’ range.
Since then, other products have started to
carry the labels, including brands of kitchen
towels, toilet paper and paints.
Environmental Research
Research into environmental protection is
essential to the formulation of the
Government’s environmental policies. Total
spending on environmental research and
development in 1995-96 was substantial,
running into hundreds of millions of pounds.
The Department of the Environment alone
commissioned research worth a total of £25
million in 1995-96, looking into subjects
such as:
• climate change;
• atmospheric pollution and its monitoring;
• toxic chemicals and genetically modified
organisms;
• waste disposal; and
• water quality and health.
Other departments have substantial
programmes, notably the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, The Scottish
Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department
and other official bodies such as the
Environment Agency and the Meteorological
Office, including the Hadley Centre (see p. 359).
The Natural Resources Institute (see p. 140) also
has an important role in environmental research,
as do many of Britain’s universities. For
example, the Climatic Research Unit at the
University of East Anglia is regarded as the most
important of its kind in the world. Nearly 100
British universities and colleges now run courses
on environmental studies or natural resource
management.
Research Councils
Basic and strategic research is carried out by
government-funded research councils (see
pp. 330-4). Most have a role in environmental
protection research, but particularly important
is the Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC), which had a Science Budget
allocation of £165 million in 1996-97, plus
contracts of £40 million. NERC undertakes
and supports research in the environmental
sciences and funds postgraduate training. Its
programmes encompass the marine, earth,
terrestrial, freshwater, polar and atmospheric
sciences. NERC puts particular emphasis on
international collaborative work on global
environmental issues. For example, it is
helping to develop global atmospheric climate
models and strengthening atmospheric
research in the Arctic. A major research
programme, the Terrestrial Initiative in Global
Environmental Research, aims to assess the
likely impact of climate change on Britain and
elsewhere and was scheduled to be completed
in 1996. NERC also co-ordinates the
development and operation of the
Environmental Change Network.

Britain engages fully in international co-operation on matters of
environmental protection. It develops much of its legislation on pollution
control and the conservation of wildlife in collaboration with its partners in
the European Union (EU) and organisations such as the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations (UN). The
built environment is also protected by the designation of conservation areas
and the listing of buildings of interest. Several important agreements were
reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED), popularly known as the ‘earth summit’, held in Rdo de Janeiro in
1992.
Pollution Control
The Government’s commitment to pollution
control is demonstrated by the important role
it plays in the regulation of industry. The
production industries are estimated to have
spent £2,300 million on protecting the
environment in 1994, while large sums were
spent by local authorities on the proper
disposal of household waste.
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. Central
government makes policy, promotes
legislation and advises pollution control
authorities on policy implementation. The
Secretary of State for the Environment has
general responsibility for co-ordinating the
work of the Government on environmental
protection. In Scotland and Wales the
respective Secretaries of State are responsible
for co-ordinating pollution control within
their countries. In Northern Ireland, this
responsibility rests with the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland. Local
authorities also have important duties and
powers. They are responsible for such
matters as:
• collection and disposal of domestic wastes;
• keeping the streets clear of litter;
354
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
• control of air pollution from domestic and
from many industrial premises; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The Environment Agency (EA), a new
non-departmental public body combining the
functions of the former National Rivers
Authority, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of
Pollution and the waste regulation authorities,
began operation in England and Wales in April
1996. Through the mechanism of‘integrated
pollution control’ (IPC—see below), it has a
central role in the control of particular
industrial emissions to land, air and water.
Other discharges to water are subject to
discharge consents (see p. 356).
The Scottish Environment Protection
Agency (SEPA) was set up at the same time to
combine the functions formerly carried out by
Her Majesty’s Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate and the Scottish river purification
authorities. The waste regulation and some of
the air pollution functions of the district and
islands councils also were taken over by the
SEPA.
In Northern Ireland, water quality is
monitored by the Environment and Heritage
Service of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland.
An independent standing body, the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution,
advises the Government. It has produced 19
reports on a variety of topics, the latest being
on the sustainable use of soil.
Integrated Pollution Control
Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990,
a system of ‘integrated pollution control’ (IPC)
has been phased in to control certain categories
of industrial pollution. The potentially most
harmful processes are specified for IPC, and
require authorisation, in England and Wales
from the EA. Emissions to air from more
minor processes are controlled by local
authorities under a parallel system of local air
pollution control (EAPC). In granting
authorisation for releases under IPC, the EA
requires the use of the best available
techniques not entailing excessive cost to
prevent or minimise polluting emissions and to
ensure that any releases are made harmless.
In Scotland, IPC and EAPC are
administered by the SEPA. In Northern
Ireland broadly similar controls are exercised
by the Environment and Heritage Service, and
proposals are being formulated for the
introduction of a system of pollution control
similar to IPC. The Government has secured
agreement to the introduction of IPC on the
British model within the European
Community (EC), where a directive on
integrated pollution prevention and control is
expected to be adopted shortly.
Land
Certain local authorities are designated as
waste collection or waste disposal authorities,
responsible for different parts of the process
of dealing with controlled wastes. Waste
regulation, formerly a local authority
responsibility, now rests with the EA and the
SEPA. A licensing system regulates waste
disposal sites, treatment plants and storage
facilities receiving controlled wastes.
‘Special’—that is, hazardous—wastes are
subject to additional controls, which have
been tightened with new regulations that
came into force in September 1996.
Responsibility for proper handling of waste
falls on everyone who has control of it from
production to final disposal or reclamation.
Operators of landfill sites now remain
responsible for them, even after closure, until
the EA is satisfied that no future hazard is
likely to arise.
In Scotland, the new unitary councils (see
p. 76) are responsible for the collection and
disposal of refuse, with the SEPA acting as
waste regulation authority. In Northern
Ireland, responsibility for the collection,
disposal and regulation of waste currently rests
with the district councils. However, the
centralisation of waste regulation is proposed.
The Government has introduced a landfill
tax (see p. 166), which provides a fiscal
incentive for waste minimisation and recycling.
Litter and Dog Fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump rubbish
except in designated places. The maximum
355
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
fine is £2,500. Local authorities have a duty to
keep their public land as free of litter and
refuse (including dog faeces) as practicable.
Members of the public have powers to take
action against authorities which fail to comply
with their responsibilities. Local authorities
also have powers to make it an offence not to
clear up after one’s dog in specified places.
To help counteract the problem of litter,
financial support from the Department of the
Environment—which will total £2.7 million in
1997-98—is given to the Tidy Britain Group,
which is recognised as the national agency for
tackling litter. It provides a comprehensive
anti-litter programme in collaboration with
local authorities and the private sector.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The Government encourages the reclamation
and recycling of waste materials whenever this is
the best practicable environmental option; its
target is for 25 per cent of all recyclable
household waste to be recycled or composted by
2000. Local authorities have to make plans for
the recycling of waste. Waste disposal authorities
in England must pay ‘recycling credits’ to waste
collection authorities when they collect and
return household waste for recycling. These
credits are based on savings in disposal costs that
have been avoided. In Wales and Scotland, the
same authorities handle waste collection and
disposal, so that the need for payments does not
arise. The Environment Act 1995 gives the
Government reserve powers to place an
obligation on businesses to re-use, recover or
recycle products and materials. Draft regulations
would require certain businesses in the
packaging chain to recover and recycle specified
tonnages of packaging waste by 2001, in line
with targets set down in an EC directive. Subject
to parliamentary procedures, these regulations
will come into effect in January 1997.
The Government has supported pilot
recycling initiatives in Sheffield, Cardiff,
Dundee and the county of Devon, which have
tested a variety of collection and sorting
methods. For some time now, members of the
public have been able to deposit used glass
containers for recycling in bottle banks. There
are over 9,000 such banks in Britain, and about
6,600 can banks. There are also over 6,000 paper
banks and plastics banks. A variety of other
materials, such as textiles, are also recycled.
The Government published its draft
strategy for sustainable waste
management in England and Wales
in 1995. The key new targets it set
were to: reduce the proportion of
controlled waste going to landfill to
60 per cent of the total by 2005;
recover 40 per cent of municipal
waste by 2005; have 40 per cent of
domestic properties with a garden
carrying out home composting by
2000; and have easily accessible
recycling facilities for 80 per cent of
households by 2000. The SEPA is
preparing a waste strategy for
Scotland.
Water
All discharges to water in Britain require the
consent of the regulatory authority. In
England and Wales the EA’s principal
method of controlling water pollution is
through the regulation of all effluent
discharges into groundwaters, inland and
coastal waters. The EA maintains public
registers containing information about water
quality, discharge consents, authorisations
and monitoring. Similar arrangements apply
in Scotland, where control is exercised by the
SEPA. In Northern Ireland the Environment
and Heritage Service is responsible for
controlling water pollution.
The Government introduced regulations
for a new system of classifying water quality in
England and Wales in 1994. This system will
provide the basis for setting statutory water
quality objectives (SWQOs), which will
specify for each individual stretch of water the
standards that should be reached and the target
date for achieving them. The system of
SWQOs will provide the framework for the
EA to set discharge consents. Once objectives
are set, the EA will be under a duty to use its
powers to ensure that they are met. In March
1996 the EA began consultations on a small
batch of pilot SWQOs. The experience gained
from these will be valuable in determining
356
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
whether to proceed in other water catchment
areas.
More than 95 per cent of the population in
Britain live in properties connected to a sewer,
and sewage treatment works serve over 80 per
cent of the population. In England and Wales
the water industry is committed to an
investment programme of some £11,000
million over ten years for improvements to
water quality. Progressively higher treatment
standards for industrial waste effluents and
new measures to combat pollution from
agriculture are expected to bring further
improvements in water quality. In Scotland,
sewage treatment and disposal come within the
water and sewerage programme, which is
planned to be £220 million in 1996—97.
In March 1996 the Government
announced the designation of 68
Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in England
and Wales. The aim of the zones is to
protect water against pollution
caused by nitrates used in
agriculture; within these areas
farmers can be required to change
their farming practices to reduce the
risk from nitrates, for example by
limiting the application of fertilisers
at certain times of year.
Over the past 30 years, notable progress has
been made in cleaning up the previously
heavily polluted major estuaries of the east
coast of Britain, including the Forth, Tees,
Thames and Tyne. The 1995-2000 price
controls on the water companies, announced in
1994, made provision for an extra £522 million
of spending on river quality in England and
Wales. Results from the monitoring of inland
waters there indicate good progress in
maintaining and improving quality, with over
90 per cent of rivers and canals now of good or
fair quality.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
The water industry is investing roughly
£2,000 million to provide treatment of coastal
sewage discharges and improve the quality of
Britain’s bathing waters. In the 1995 tests of
bathing water quality, 89 per cent of identified
bathing waters (413 out of 464) in Britain met
the mandatory coliform bacteria standards of
the EC bathing water directive, compared with
66 per cent of beaches in 1988. The majority of
the schemes in the improvement programme
are complete. Sea dumping of sewage sludge
will cease by the end of 1998.
Marine Environment
In 1992 a new Convention for the Protection of
the Marine Environment of the North East
Atlantic was agreed in Paris. It covers inputs
and discharges from both land and sea, sets
targets for the introduction of additional
safeguards for the area, and requires
contracting parties to take all possible steps to
prevent or eliminate pollution through an
action plan subject to annual review. Britain is
also a leading participant in the series of North
Sea Conferences, an international forum of
countries bordering the North Sea, the most
recent of which was held in Denmark in 1995.
Good progress is being made in meeting North
Sea Conference targets for reducing the input
of dangerous substances into the sea. For
example, direct and riverine inputs of
cadmium, lead and mercury to coastal waters
were more than halved between 1985 and
1993.
International action on the prevention of
pollution from ships is taken through the
International Maritime Organization (IMO).
Britain applies international requirements to
all ships in British waters and to British ships
wherever they are. Enforcement is undertaken
by the Department of Transport.
The Marine Pollution Control Unit
(MPCU), part of the Coastguard Agency, is
responsible for dealing with spillages of oil or
other hazardous substances from ships at sea.
The Government’s national contingency
plan, which is developed and maintained by
the MPCU, sets out arrangements for
dealing with pollution. The Unit has at its
disposal various counter-pollution facilities,
including:
• remote sensing surveillance aircraft;
• aerial and seaborne spraying equipment;
• stocks of oil dispersants;
357
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• mechanical recovery and cargo transfer
equipment; and
• specialised beach cleaning equipment.
The most recent major incident in which
these capabilities were put to the test was when
the tanker Sea Empress ran aground off
Milford Haven in south Wales in February
1996.
Licences for oil and gas exploration include
special conditions designed to protect the
environment. Applicants for licences in
sensitive areas must demonstrate that they
have addressed the environmental concerns
when developing their work programme.
Before commencing offshore operations, the
operators are required to have approved oil
spill contingency plans in place. In addition, all
discharges that contain oil are controlled under
the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, and
limits are set for the permissible level of oil
discharged. In response to commitments made
at the North Sea Conference, progressively
tighter limits on oil discharged with drill
cuttings have been set. This has resulted in the
quantity of oil discharges from this source
from installations in British waters falling from
18,500 tonnes in 1988 to 3,180 tonnes in 1995.
Britain ended the dumping of industrial
waste at sea in 1992. Waste has not been
licensed for incineration at sea since 1990. The
dumping at sea of most types of waste will be
phased out over the next few years. In 1994
Britain announced that it was accepting an
internationally agreed indefinite ban on the sea
dumping of low- and intermediate-level
radioactive waste—the sea dumping of
high-level waste was already prohibited. After
the phasing out of sewage sludge dumping in
1998, the only category of waste which Britain
will routinely dump at sea will be dredged
material from ports, harbours and the like.
This will only be approved for dumping at sea
if no beneficial use for the material is available.
Air
Air quality in Britain has improved
considerably in the last 30 years. Total
emissions of smoke in the air have fallen by
over 85 per cent since 1960. London and other
major cities no longer have the dense
smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in
central London winter sunshine has increased
by about 70 per cent since the late 1950s.
However, new concerns have arisen, especially
over the emissions from the growing number
of motor vehicles and their possible impact on
health. Measures have consequently been
adopted to reduce substantially emissions from
new vehicles (see p. 361).
The Environment Act 1995 provides a new
framework for air quality management,
including the publication by the Government
of a national strategy which will set air quality
standards and targets for the pollutants causing
the most concern. This was issued for
consultation in August 1996, containing air
quality targets for the year 2005. The Act also
places new duties on local authorities to assess
air quality in their boundaries and to prepare
action plans where standards are not met or are
unlikely to be met in future. Pilot schemes are
being taken forward in 14 areas before full
implementation in April 1997. Earlier
legislation allows local authorities to declare
‘smoke control areas’ within which the
emission of smoke from chimneys is an
offence. About two-thirds of the dwellings in
conurbations are covered by smoke control
orders—around 6,340 are in force.
Those industrial processes with the greatest
potential for harmful emissions are controlled
under the Environmental Protection Act 1990,
enforced in England and Wales by the EA, and
are subject to IPC. Processes with a significant
but lesser potential for air pollution require
approval, in England and Wales from local
authorities. Local authorities also control
emissions of dark smoke from trade and
industrial premises.
In 1994 the Government announced
funding of £5 million for a co-ordinated
programme of research on air pollution and
respiratory disease. Ten key areas are being
addressed, including the short- and long-term
effects of exposure to air pollutants, and the
development of methods for measuring
personal exposure to air pollutants. An expert
panel is recommending standards for
maximum levels of various pollutants, which
the Government aims to meet or exceed by
2005. Britain’s automatic air quality
monitoring network is being extended and
358
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
upgraded at a cost of over £4 million a year,
while local authority sites are being integrated
into the national network. By the end of 1996,
the automated urban network is scheduled to
include over 100 sites.
Since 1990, the Department of the
Environment’s Air Quality Bulletins have
made daily air pollution data from the
monitoring network available to the public.
These give the concentrations of the main
pollutants, together with an air pollution
forecast—and grade air quality on a scale
between ‘very poor’ and ‘very good’. The
information features in television and radio
weather reports, and appears in many national
and local newspapers. Information, updated
hourly from the automatic monitoring sites, is
also available directly on a special free
telephone number, on videotext systems and
on the Internet.
Climate Change
Several gases naturally present in the
atmosphere keep the Earth at a temperature
suitable for life by trapping energy from the
sun—the so-called ‘greenhouse effect’.
Emissions from human activities are increasing
the atmospheric concentrations of several
important ‘greenhouse gases’. This is believed
to be leading to additional global warming.
The most significant greenhouse gases include
water vapour, carbon dioxide (C02), methane
and wholly man-made substances such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 to
consider climate change and possible responses
to it. The IPCC’s second assessment report
was published in spring 1996. One of its key
conclusions was that the balance of evidence
suggested a discernible human influence on
global climate. It suggested that between 1990
and 2100 there might be an increase in global
mean surface temperatures of about 2°C—a
greater average rate of warming than any seen
in the last 10,000 years.
Britain is conducting extensive research
into climate change. The research programme
includes the construction of an advanced
climate change detection instrument for launch
on a satellite towards the end of the 1990s, and
the work of the Hadley Centre for Climate
Prediction and Research. A July 1996 report
from the UK Climate Change Impacts Review
Group suggested that the effect of climate
change in Britain over the next 30 years could
be to push the climate zones northwards by as
much as 200 km (120 miles). The north-west
could become wetter, while the south-east
could be more prone to drought.
The Framework Convention on Climate
Change was signed by more than 150 nations
at the 1992 ‘earth summit’ in Rio de Janeiro
(see p. 347). Its objective is to achieve
stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level which would
prevent dangerous man-made interference
with the climate system.
Britain is one of a handful of developed
countries on course to meet its Convention
commitments to return emissions of greenhouse
gases to below 1990 levels by the year 2000. Its
C02 emissions are expected to be 4 to 8 per cent
below 1990 levels, reflecting the impact of
Britain’s climate change programme, published
in 1994. The programme aims to ensure that
both individuals and organisations exploit the
scope for taking measures that are cost-effective
in their own right. Britain’s national programme
for combating the threat of global climate change
includes:
• the removal of subsidies on the use of
fossil fuels;
• an annual increase in road fuel duties of 5
per cent in real terms;
• the introduction of value added tax on
domestic fuel;
• the promotion of new and renewable
sources of energy to enable them to
compete in energy markets;
• programmes to improve industrial,
commercial and domestic energy
efficiency; and
• the adoption of EU minimum efficiency
standards for electrical appliances.
In 1995 the first conference of parties to the
Convention met in Berlin and set in hand a
process for agreeing new commitments for the
period beyond 2000. The so-called ‘Berlin
Mandate’ is aimed primarily at strengthening
commitments from developed nations.
359
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Another meeting is due to be held in Kyoto,
Japan at the end of 1997, where a protocol
should be agreed to fulfil the Berlin Mandate.
Britain is proposing that developed countries
should aim to reduce their total emissions of
greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by up to 10
per cent by the year 2010.
Stratospheric Ozone Layer
Stratospheric ozone forms a layer of gas about
10 km to 50 km (6 to 30 miles) above the
Earth’s surface, protecting it from the more
harmful effects of solar radiation. However,
there is evidence for ozone losses over much of
the globe, including a ‘hole’ in the ozone layer
over Antarctica, first discovered by British
scientists in 1985. Ozone depletion is caused
by man-made chemicals containing chlorine or
bromine, such as CFCs or halons.
The Government is committed to the
earliest possible phasing out of all
ozone-depleting substances. Britain was one of
the first 25 signatories to the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, which deals with the protection of
the stratospheric ozone layer. The Protocol
required the phasing out of the production of
halons by the end of 1993, and the phasing out
of CFCs, 1,1,1 trichloroethane and carbon
tetrachloride by the end of 1995 in all
developed countries. This has been
substantially achieved in Britain apart from
exemptions for a small number of essential
uses, for example in medical inhalers. The
Protocol has also placed controls on
hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which are
transitional substances with much lower
ozone-depleting potential than CFCs. They
are needed in a number of areas to allow
industry to cease using CFCs more quickly,
but must be phased out in new equipment by
2020. Production and consumption of methyl
bromide must be phased out by 2010. EC
regulations impose even tighter requirements
on member states.
The Montreal Protocol also imposes
controls on developing countries, which are
committed to phasing out CFCs by 2010. A
multilateral fund has been established to assist
developing countries to comply with the
controls on ozone-depleting substances;
Britain contributes towards this.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
Sulphur dioxide (S02) and oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) are the main gases that lead to acid rain.
The principal sources are combustion plants
that burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired power
stations, and, for NOx, road transport.
National S02 emissions have fallen by over 40
per cent since 1970 and a substantial
programme seeks to ensure that this fall
continues. For example, under an EC directive
on the control of emissions from large
combustion plants, the Government has
published a national plan setting out phased
reductions in emissions from existing plants of
NOx by 30 per cent by 1998 and of S02 by 60
per cent by 2003, in both cases compared with
the level in 1980. The latest figures, for 1994,
show that Britain had achieved a reduction of
49 per cent in both cases. Britain has also met
the targets set in the first United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
protocol on NOx. Britain is currently involved
in development of a new UNECE protocol on
NOx, and in 1994 signed the second UNECE
sulphur protocol. It agreed to secure a
reduction of at least 80 per cent in S02
emissions from all sources by 2010. The
Government recently issued a consultation
paper on its proposed strategy.
Tougher authorisations for power
stations belonging to the two main
operators, National Power and
PowerGen, were issued in March
1996. These set stringent S02
emission reduction targets—an 85
per cent cut from 1991 levels of S02
emissions by 2005—but allow the
operators freedom to determine the
means to meet the requirements.
This might include fitting abatement
equipment, switching to low-sulphur
fuel or reducing the operating periods
of particular stations.
The damaging effect of acid depositions
from combustion processes on freshwaters and
soils has been demonstrated by scientific
research. Lower emissions of S02 over the past

20 years (see graph) have, however, led to the
first signs of a decrease in acidification in some
lochs in south-west Scotland.
Vehicle Emissions
Stringent emission standards for passenger
cars were introduced at the end of 1992, which
effectively require new petrol-engined cars to
be fitted with catalytic converters. These
typically reduce emissions by over 75 per cent.
Diesel cars are also subject to strict controls on
particulate emissions. Since 1994, vans have
had to meet the same limit as cars. Stricter
controls for heavy diesel vehicles, including
lorries and buses, were introduced in 1993.
Further cuts in permitted emission levels are
being introduced in 1996 and 1997.
Compulsory tests of emissions from
vehicles in use are a key element in Britain’s
strategy for improving air quality. Britain has
introduced metered emission tests and smoke
checks into the annual ‘MoT’ roadworthiness
test. In 1995, limits for vehicles in service were
further tightened, and special tests were applied
to catalyst-fitted vehicles from January 1996.
Enforcement checks carried out at the roadside
or in operators’ premises also include at least a
visual check for excessive smoke. Wherever
possible, a smoke meter is used for borderline
cases. The Vehicle Inspectorate (see p. 305)
carried out more than 110,000 roadside
enforcement checks in 1995-96.
As a result of these measures, a marked and
progressive decline in regulated pollutants is
expected, which will continue until well into
the first decade of the 21st century.
The November 1995 Budget
contained a government
commitment to look into ways of
using vehicle excise duty to
encourage low-emission vehicles. It
also reduced the duty on liquid
petroleum gas and compressed
natural gas, as studies have shown
that these are relatively clean fuels.
Sales of unleaded petrol have risen from
virtually nothing in the mid-1980s to over 65

per cent of all petrol sold. This is due mainly to:
• a gradual increase in the differential in
duty between leaded and unleaded petrol;
• the requirement for all new cars from
October 1990 onwards to be capable of
running on unleaded petrol; and
• the necessity for cars fitted with catalytic
converters to use unleaded petrol.
These measures have contributed to a 70
per cent reduction of lead in the air.
Regulations were introduced in 1994 which
for the first time set compulsory limits to the
volatility of petrol. The expected benefits
include a reduction in volatile organic
compounds given off. The regulations also
introduce a new EC standard for low sulphur
diesel fuel, which will further reduce
particulate emissions from all diesel vehicles
from 1996.
Internationally developed standards have
also been implemented in Britain to control the
emission of smoke, vented fuel and unburned
hydrocarbons from civil aircraft. International
standards to control NOx and carbon
monoxide will be incorporated into domestic
legislation.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for noise nuisance from premises and
vehicles, machinery or equipment in the street,
and to investigate complaints. They must serve
a noise abatement notice where the noise is
judged to be a statutory nuisance. They can
also designate ‘noise abatement zones’ within
which registered levels of noise from certain
premises may not be increased without their
permission. There are also specific provisions
in law to:
• control noise from construction and
demolition sites;
• control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets; and
• enable individuals to take independent
action through the courts against noise
nuisance.
The Government believes that, wherever
possible, attempts should be made to resolve
problems informally. It promotes increased
public awareness of neighbour noise issues and
also encourages the use of community
mediation, funding the umbrella organisation
Mediation UK. However, informal resolution
may not always be possible, and so it
supported the Noise Act 1996, which was
passed as a Private Member’s Bill and
strengthens the law in England and Wales on
noisy neighbours. The Housing Act 1996 (see
p. 385) includes new powers for local
authorities to deal with anti-social behaviour
by tenants, which includes noise nuisance.
362
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Regulations set out the permissible noise
levels for various classes of new vehicle, and a
new EC noise directive is due to be
implemented by October 1996. Compensation
may be payable for loss in property values
caused by physical factors, including noise
from new or improved public works such as
roads, railways and airports. Regulations also
require highway authorities to make grants
available for insulation of homes that would be
subject to specified levels of increased noise
caused by new or improved roads. Noise
insulation may also be provided where
construction work for new roads will seriously
affect nearby homes for a substantial period of
time. Equivalent regulations for new railways
have been introduced.
Britain has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at phasing out older,
noisier subsonic jet aircraft. The phased
implementation of a complete ban on the
operation of‘Chapter T aircraft (noisier
planes, as classified by international
agreement) began in 1995, and it is intended to
phase out all these types by 2002. Various
operational restrictions have been introduced
to reduce noise disturbance further at
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, where the
Secretary of State for Transport has assumed
responsibility for noise abatement. These
measures include:
• restrictions on the type and number of
aircraft operating at night;
• the routeing of departing aircraft on
routes chosen to minimise noise nuisance;
and
• quieter take-off and landing procedures.
The Government has introduced a control
system for night flights combining a noise
quota with a ceiling on the total number of
movements. The population disturbed by
aircraft noise1 at Heathrow fell from 591,000 in
1988 to 372,000 in 1992, even though the
number of air transport movements increased.
'That is, living within the 57 Leq noise contour, which is
generally regarded as the onset of disturbance. Using the
older,’ broadly comparable, 35 NNI measure, about 1.6
million people were affected in 1979.
This was largely because of the phasing out of
older, noisier aircraft.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is
exposed; most is naturally occurring. A large
proportion of the man-made radioactivity to
which the public is exposed comes from medical
treatments, such as X-rays. Nevertheless,
man-made radiation is subject to stringent
control. Users of radioactive materials must be
registered by the EA in England and Wales or its
equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland;
authorisation is also required for the
accumulation and disposal of radioactive waste.
The Health and Safety Executive (see p. 201),
through its Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is
responsible for granting nuclear site licences for
major nuclear installations. No installation may
be constructed or operated without a licence
granted by the Executive.
The National Radiological Protection Board
(NRPB) provides an authoritative point of
reference on radiological protection. In 1987
the Government announced measures to deal
with the problem of radon, a naturally
occurring radioactive gas which can
accumulate in houses. These included a free
survey by the NRPB for householders living in
areas mostly likely to be affected by radon.
Cornwall, Devon, Derbyshire,
Northamptonshire and Somerset have been
found to have the highest numbers of homes
over the recommended action level. However,
other areas with above-average number of
houses likely to be affected by radon have now
been identified. As a result of earlier surveys,
the NRPB can now predict with much greater
accuracy the areas most likely to have
substantial numbers of homes above the action
level. Free tests are therefore being offered by
invitation to householders in those areas.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and
level of activity, and the methods of disposal
reflect this. Some wastes can be disposed of
safely in the same way as other industrial and
household wastes. UK Nirex is responsible for
363
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
developing a deep disposal facility for solid
low-level and intermediate-level radioactive
waste. It is concentrating detailed geological
investigations on an area near the British
Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield, in Cumbria. As
part of these studies, Nirex has applied for
planning permission for an experimental
underground rock laboratory, known as a ‘rock
characterisation facility’, and a public inquiry
has been held into this.
The Department of the Environment is
developing a research strategy into the disposal
of high-level or heat-generating waste. This
waste will first be stored in vitrified form for at
least 50 years to allow the heat and
radioactivity to decay.
All contracts for reprocessing spent nuclear
fuel from overseas entered into since 1976
include provisions for the resulting waste to be
returned to the country of origin. The
government has announced that it will accept
‘waste substitution’ in such cases, provided
there are appropriate disposal arrangements in
Britain for the substituted waste.
Genetically Modified Organisms
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have
many potentially beneficial uses, such as better
and increased supplies of food and advances in
health care. As with any new technology,
however, it is important to make sure that
there are no significant risks to mankind or the
environment. This is done through the
Environmental Protection Act 1990 and
subsequent regulations. Advice on all
applications to release or market GMOs is
provided by a statutory advisory committee.
Britain participated in drawing up draft
international guidelines on safety in
biotechnology, which were adopted by the
United Nations Environment Programme in
1995. It also supports the development of a
safety protocol to the Convention on Biological
Diversity (see p. 370), which would focus on
transboundary movements of living modified
organisms.
Conservation
Britain has a long tradition of conservation,
and for many years has had policies and laws
designed to protect both its natural
environment and its built heritage. A wide
variety of designations are used to protect
areas, sites and monuments that are of special
interest, and various organisations work
towards the conservation of different aspects of
Britain’s national heritage.
Among the agreements reached at the ‘earth
summit’ were a convention on biodiversity (see
p. 370) and a declaration for the management
of forests. In 1994, Britain published its
national strategies for biodiversity (see p. 370)
and forestry.
The Department of the Environment is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England; the
Department of National Heritage has
responsibility for the listing of buildings and
for scheduled ancient monuments in
England. The Welsh Office, The Scottish
Office and the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland have
broadly equivalent responsibilities. Agencies
such as English Nature, English Heritage,
the Countryside Commission and their
equivalents carry out many functions on
behalf of the Government. In addition, local
authorities and a wide range of voluntary
organisations are actively involved in
environmental conservation and protection.
The Countryside and Nature
Conservation
Four government agencies are responsible for
countryside policy and nature conservation in
Great Britain:
• the Countryside Commission and English
Nature, which both act in England, the
former being responsible for countryside
policy and the latter for nature
conservation;
• the Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW); and
• Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee
(JNCC) is the mechanism through which the
three nature conservation agencies in England,
Wales and Scotland fulfil their responsibilities
for international nature conservation matters
and those affecting Great Britain as a whole.
364
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The JNCC also undertakes research in
connection with these responsibilities and sets
standards for data, monitoring and other
matters connected with nature conservation. It
includes representatives from Northern
Ireland and independent members, and has a
supporting specialist staff.
Countryside Agencies
The Countryside Commission, the CCW and
SNH are responsible for promoting the
enhancement of the natural beauty and amenity
of the countryside and encouraging the
provision of facilities for open-air recreation.
They are expected to respect the needs of those
who live and work in the countryside. Activities
undertaken by these bodies include:
• advising the Government on countryside
matters;
• assisting the provision by local authorities
and others of facilities for recreation in the
countryside, often within easy reach of
towns;
• designating and improving recreational
rights of way;
• undertaking research projects; and
• ensuring the protection of special
landscapes.
Total funding for the countryside agencies
in 1996-97 is £26 million for the Countryside
Commission, £22 million for the CCW and
£31 million for SNH.
The Countryside Commission recognises
over 210 country parks and over 230 picnic
sites in England. A further 35 country parks
and about 30 picnic sites in Wales are
recognised by the CCW. In Scotland there are
36 country parks, and many local authority and
private sector schemes for a variety of
countryside facilities have been approved for
grant aid by SNH.
In Wales the Tir Cymen scheme,
administered by the CCW, rewards farmers
who make agreements to manage their farms in
an environmentally friendly manner.
Nature Conservation Agencies
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are the
Government’s statutory advisers on nature
conservation in their areas. Their work
includes:
• establishing and managing national nature
reserves and encouraging the
establishment of local nature reserves;
• advising the Government;
• identifying, notifying and monitoring
Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs);
• providing general nature conservation
information and advice;
• giving grants; and
• supporting and conducting research.
English Nature’s funding for 1996-97 is
£39 million.
There are over 300 national nature reserves
covering some 190,000 hectares (468,000 acres)
in Great Britain, and two statutory marine
nature reserves, surrounding the islands of
Lundy, off the Devon coast, and Skomer, off
the coast of Wales. About 6,700 SSSIs have
been notified in Great Britain for their plant,
animal, geological or physiographical features.
Some are of international importance and have
been designated for protection under the EC
Birds Directive or the Ramsar Convention (see
p. 370). Local authorities have declared about
395 local nature reserves in England, 23 in
Scotland and 26 in Wales.
In England, to assist those who have an
interest or involvement in environmental
planning and conservation action, English
Nature and the Countryside Commission have
jointly mapped and are describing areas of
distinct landscape and ecological character.
This framework will underpin the separate
programmes of the two agencies. English
Nature’s ‘Natural Areas’ have a distinctive
character that derives from the underlying
geology, land forms, flora and fauna, and the
land uses and settlement patterns of the area.
The Natural Areas framework has been subject
to public consultation, and potential links with
the Countryside Commission’s Countryside
Character Programme are currently being
explored. This latter programme will use the
map and description to help guide countryside
policies and programmes.
English Nature enters into land
management agreements with owners and
365
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
occupiers of SSSI land, increasingly to support
management that is beneficial for its wildlife
and natural features. Payments made under
these agreements totalled £5.6 million in
1994-95. Overall, English Nature’s grant
schemes provide more than £2 million a year
to assist local action to sustain biodiversity and
geodiversity. SNH and the CCW also enter
into land management agreements.
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland has responsibility for both
nature and countryside conservation. The
Council for Nature Conservation and the
Countryside advises the Department on nature
conservation matters, including the
establishment and management of land and
marine nature reserves and the declaration of
Areas of Special Scientific Interest. In all, 72
Areas of Special Scientific Interest had been
declared by March 1995, covering 75,000
hectares (185,000 acres), and 47 statutory
nature reserves had been established.
County wildlife trusts, urban wildlife trusts
and the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds (RSPB) play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout Britain, having
established between them over 2,000 reserves.
The county and urban trusts are affiliated to a
parent organisation, RSNC The Wildlife
Trusts. The RSPB is the largest voluntary
wildlife conservation body in Europe.
Wildlife Protection
The principal piece of legislation protecting
wildlife in Great Britain is the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981. This has:
• extended the list of protected species;
• restricted the introduction into the
countryside of animals not normally found
in the wild in Britain; and
• afforded greater protection for SSSIs than
previously and made provision for marine
nature reserves.
There is also provision for reviews of the
list of protected species to be conducted by the
three official nature conservation agencies,
acting jointly through the JNCC, every five
years, and for recommended changes to be
submitted to the Secretary of State for the
Environment. In Northern Ireland separate
legislation on species and habitat protection is
in line with the rest of Britain.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Extensive research and management are
carried out to encourage the recovery of
populations of species threatened with
extinction. The three nature conservation
agencies have also set up recovery programmes
for a number of threatened species of plants
and animals. English Nature’s programme
covers 43 species, including the dormouse, the
Plymouth pear and the fen raft spider. The
aim is to ensure the survival of self-sustaining
populations of these threatened species in the
wild. SNH has a programme initially covering
17 species, and the CCW one covering 15
species.
Schemes have been devised to reintroduce
species into areas in which they used to be
found. For example, the red kite had died out
in England and Scotland, although it was still
found in Wales and mainland Europe. An
international project was successfully
co-ordinated by the JNCC and the RSPB to
bring adult birds from Sweden and Spain and
release them into the wild in areas which the
species no longer inhabited. Other species
reintroduced in recent years include the
white-tailed sea eagle and the large blue
butterfly. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew
holds seeds from about 3,000 plant species
which are extinct or under severe threat in the
wild, and has had some success with
reintroduction projects. The Royal Botanic
Gardens in Edinburgh also plays a significant
role.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree preservation orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands in
the interests of amenity. Once a tree is
protected, it is in general an offence to cut
down, reshape or generally wilfully destroy it
without permission. The courts can impose
substantial fines for breaches of such orders.
Where protected trees are felled in
contravention of an order or are removed
because they are dying, dead or dangerous,
replacement trees must be planted. Local
authorities have powers to enforce this.

Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes. The planting of
broadleaved trees has increased more than
tenfold since 1985. Major afforestation projects
involving the Countryside Commission
include the creation of a new national forest in
the Midlands, and 12 community forests near
major cities. The Woodland Trust is a
voluntary body which protects existing
woodland and plants new trees for the future.
It now owns about 800 woods across Britain,
and has planted well over a million trees in the
past ten years or so.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The protection of the coastline against
erosion and flooding is administered centrally
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, the Welsh Office and The Scottish
Office. Operational responsibility lies with
local authorities and the EA (see p. 355). New
measures to improve the management of the
coast of England were announced by the
Government in 1994. These include the
establishment of a standing forum on coastal
issues and a review of by-laws relating to
coastal management. Certain stretches of
undeveloped coast of particular beauty in
England and Wales are designated as heritage
coast; jointly with local authorities, the
countryside agencies have designated 45
heritage coasts, protecting 1,525 km (948
miles), about 35 per cent of the total length of
coastline.
English Nature, through its Campaign for a
Living Coast, provides funds for groups
setting up voluntary marine nature reserves or
367
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
producing management plans for England’s
estuaries. So far, 11 reserves have been
grant-aided and 20 estuary management plans
produced, covering more than 85 per cent of
England’s total estuarine area. There are 29
informal marine consultation areas in
Scotland. Statutory bodies taking decisions
that affect these areas are asked to consult
SNH.
The National Trust, through its Enterprise
Neptune campaign, raises funds to acquire and
protect stretches of coastline of great natural
beauty and recreational value. About £22
million has been raised since 1965 and the
Trust now protects 893 km (555 miles) of
coastline in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The National Trust for Scotland also
owns large parts of the Scottish coastline and
protects others through conservation
agreements.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate National Parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), subject
to confirmation by the Secretaries of State for
the Environment and for Wales respectively.
Ten National Parks have been established
in England and Wales. Their aim is first to
provide protection for the outstanding
countryside they contain and secondly to
provide opportunities for access and outdoor
recreation. They are ‘national’ in the sense that
they are of special value to the nation as a
whole. However, most of the land remains in
private hands. These areas are administered by
individual National Park authorities. Among
other things, they:
• act as the development control authority
for their areas;
• negotiate land management agreements
and encourage farmers to manage their
land in the traditional way;
• look after footpaths and negotiate
agreements for public access; and
• set up information centres and employ
rangers.
At present, most of these authorities are
committees or boards of county councils for
the relevant areas. However, under the
Environment Act 1995 the Government is
establishing new independent National Park
authorities to run all the parks from April 1997
(April 1996 for the Parks in Wales). This will
allow better protection and management of the
park areas. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads
are also administered by their own
independent authority and enjoy protection
equivalent to that of a National Park. Since
1994 the planning policies that apply to the
National Parks have also applied to the New
Forest area in Hampshire.
A total of 41 AONBs have been designated,
covering around 20,400 sq km (7,900 sq miles)
in England and 830 sq km (320 sq miles) in
Wales. They comprise parts of the countryside
which lack extensive areas of open country
suitable for recreation and hence National Park
status, but which nevertheless have an

important landscape quality. Local authorities
are encouraged to give special attention to
AONBs in their planning and countryside
conservation work.
In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, covering more
than 11,000 sq km (4,300 sq miles), where
certain kinds of development are subject to
consultation with SNH and, in the event of a
disagreement, with the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Working parties have made
recommendations for the management of the
Cairngorms and for Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs, two areas of outstanding natural
importance in Scotland. For the former, the
Government has established a Cairngorms
Partnership, as recommended by the working
party. In the latter case, the new local
authorities are establishing a joint committee
for the area. In the wider countryside SNH
provides grants for a range of countryside
projects.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland on the preservation of amenities and
the designation of areas of outstanding natural
beauty. In all, nine such areas have been
designated, covering over 2,800" sq km (1,100
sq miles); seven areas are being managed as
country parks and one as a regional park.
There are 11 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering some 2,400 sq km (950 sq miles) and
administered by the Forestry Commission.
There are nine in Northern Ireland, where
they are administered by the Forest Service of
the Department of Agriculture.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County and metropolitan district councils in
England and Wales are responsible for keeping
public rights of way signposted and free from
obstruction. Public paths are usually
maintained by these highway authorities,
which also supervise landowners’ duties to
repair stiles and gates. In Scotland, planning
authorities are responsible for asserting and
protecting rights of way. Local authorities in
Great Britain can create paths, close paths no
longer needed for public use and divert paths
to meet the needs of either the public or
landowners. Farmers in England and Wales
are required by law rapidly to restore public
paths damaged by agricultural operations. In
England and Wales there are some 225,000 km
(140,000 miles) of rights of way.
There are ten approved national trails open
in England, stretching about 2,800 km (1,740
miles), two in Wales, and three approved-
long-distance routes in Scotland, covering
about 550 km (345 miles). Approval for a new
national trail along the line of Hadrian’s Wall
was announced in 1994, and in 1995 a new
Pennine Bridleway, designed for horseriders
and mountain bikers, was approved. Formal
consultations are under way into the
designation of the Cots wold Way as a national
trail in England, and Glyndwr’s Way in Wales.
In Scotland, a new Great Glen Way is at an
advanced stage of planning.
The Countryside Commission intends to
help authorities bring all rights of way in
England into good order by the end of the
century, and a Parish Path Partnership scheme
has been introduced, which is designed to
stimulate local involvement and improvement.
The CCW is also establishing a network of
public rights of way in Wales, and a Public
Paths Campaign has been introduced. In
Scotland a major new ‘Paths for All’ initiative
has been started by SNH to promote better
access to countryside close to towns and cities.
There is no automatic right of public access
to open country, although many landowners
allow it more or less freely. A scheme to
encourage farmers to open ‘set-aside’ land (see
p. 292) to the public was launched in 1994.
Local planning authorities in England and
Wales can secure access by means of
agreements with landowners. If agreements
cannot be reached, authorities may acquire
land or make orders for public access. Similar
powers cover Scotland and Northern Ireland;
in Northern Ireland the primary responsibility
lies with district councils. In Scotland there is
a tradition of freedom to roam, based on
tolerance between landowners and those
seeking reasonable recreational access to the
hills.
Common land totals an estimated 600,000
hectares (1.5 million acres) in England and
Wales, but a legal right of public access exists
for only one-fifth of this area. Common land is
369
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
usually privately owned, but people other than
the owner may have various rights over it, for
example, as pasture land. Commons are
protected by law and cannot be built on or
enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment or Wales. There
is no common land in Scotland or Northern
Ireland.
The Millennium Commission (see p.
43) has agreed in principle to award
up to £10 million to the Countryside
Commission towards a £20 million
programme that will enable at least
250 communities in England to have
their own millennium greens by the
year 2000. A millennium green would
be an area of open space—large or
small—to be enjoyed permanently by
the local community, designed to be
in easy walking distance of people’s
homes.
Voluntary Sector
Many voluntary organisations are concerned to
preserve the amenities of the countryside,
including the Council for the Protection of Rural
England, the Campaign for the Protection of
Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection
of Rural Scotland and the Ulster Society for the
Preservation of the Countryside.
International Action
Britain plays a full part in international action
to conserve wildlife. Its international
obligations include the Berne Convention on
the conservation of European wildlife and
natural habitats, and EC directives on the
conservation of wild birds (the Birds
Directive) and of natural habitats and wild
fauna and flora. The implementation of the
latter directive, which came into force in 1994,
entails the designation of Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs). Together with Special
Protection Areas (SPAs) designated under the
Birds Directive, the SACs contribute to a
EU-wide network of protected sites known as
‘Natura 2000’. Britain is also party to the
Ramsar Convention on wetlands of
international importance.
Britain is a party to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora, which strictly regulates
trade in endangered species by means of a
permit system. Britain has taken new measures
to improve the enforcement of the Convention.
The Convention on Biological Diversity
was signed by over 150 countries, including
Britain, at the ‘earth summit’. It requires
countries to develop national strategies for the
conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity. Britain published its biodiversity
action plan in 1994. In 1995 the Biodiversity
Steering Group, with representatives from a
range of sectors, published a report advising
the Government on:
• the development of a range of specific
costed targets for key species and habitats
for the years 2000 and 2010;
• improving accessibility and co-ordination of
existing biological data, providing common
standards for future recording; and
• increasing public awareness of, and
involvement in, the conservation of
biodiversity.
The Government published its response to
the report in May 1996, welcoming the
objectives and targets put forward by the
Group as relevant benchmarks against which
future success in conserving individual species
and habitat types can be assessed.
The 1995 Biodiversity Steering Group
report contained costed action plans
for 116 of Britain’s most threatened
species and 14 key habitats. It
recommended that a further 286
species and 24 key habitat action plans
be prepared within three years. It also
contains guidance for preparing local
biodiversity action plans, which will
enable people to express their views on
what wildlife they consider to be
important and locally distinctive.
The Darwin Initiative forms part of the
measures announced by Britain at the
370
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
UNCED meeting. It is intended to make
British experience available to developing
countries with important biological resources,
with the aim of assisting the conservation and
sustainable use of species there. A committee
of distinguished experts advises the
Government on the Initiative. By March 1996,
116 projects, totalling over £12 million, had
been approved.
Environmental Improvement
The Government assists local voluntary
organisations to promote projects such as
creating parks, footpaths and other areas of
greenery in cities; conserving the industrial
heritage and the natural environment; and
recycling waste. The Department of the
Environment makes grants through the
Environmental Action Fund, worth over £4
million in 1996-97, to support projects which
actively assist in tackling environmental
problems. The Civic Trust (see p. 373)
manages a Local Projects Fund for the
Department.
The Scottish Office Environment
Department made £430,000 available in
1995-96 to 46 environmental organisations
under its Special Grants (Environmental)
Programme to help them carry out
environmental conservation, improvement and
education work. Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see p. 215)
are responsible for environmental
improvement and land reclamation in
Scotland. The Government’s programme of
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (see p. 292)
supports environmentally sensitive farming
practices that protect and enhance the
countryside.
Buildings and Monuments
Lists of buildings of special architectural or
historical interest are compiled by the
Government, in England with the advice of
English Heritage. In Scotland and Wales,
buildings are listed by Historic Scotland and
Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments, executive
agencies of the Scottish and Welsh Offices
respectively. It is against the law to demolish,
extend or alter the character of any ‘listed’
building without prior consent from the local
planning authority or the appropriate
Secretary of State. The local planning
authority can issue ‘building preservation
notices’ to protect for six months unlisted
buildings that are at risk, while the
Government considers whether they should be
listed. In Northern Ireland, the Environment
and Heritage Service is directly responsible for
the listing of buildings.
Ancient monuments are similarly protected
through a system of scheduling. English
Heritage, the government agency responsible
for the conservation of historic remains in
England, has embarked upon a programme to
evaluate all known archaeological remains in
England. This is expected to result in a
significant increase in the number of scheduled
monuments. A similar effort is being made to
increase the number of listed buildings and
scheduled monuments in Wales. A resurvey of
buildings is also beginning in Northern
Ireland, and the number of scheduled
monuments there is expected to rise.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for
National Heritage and for Scotland. Historic
Royal Palaces and the Royal Parks Agency are

the executive agencies which carry out this
function.
English Heritage cares for over 400
properties on behalf of the Secretary of State
for National Heritage, advises the
Government on certain categories of
applications for consent to alter or demolish
scheduled monuments and listed buildings,
and gives grants for the repair of ancient
monuments and historic buildings in
England. Many of the properties in its care
are now being managed locally; 107
agreements for local management had been
made by the end of 1995—96. Most of its
monuments are open to the public. Core
government funding for English Heritage is
£107 million in 1996-97.
In Scotland and Wales, Historic Scotland,
which cares for 330 monuments, and Cadw,
with 132, perform similar functions. Both
agencies are advised by an Ancient
Monuments Board and an Historic Buildings
Council. The Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland has 181 historic
monuments in its care, managed by the
Environment and Heritage Service. It too is
advised by a Historic Buildings Council and a
Historic Monuments Council.
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 9,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are 469 in Wales, 674 in Scotland and 53
in Northern Ireland, designated by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. These areas receive additional
protection through the planning system,
particularly over the proposed demolition of
unlisted buildings. In 1995 the Government
strengthened the ability of local planning
authorities in England and Wales to protect
conservation areas.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are also of importance to the
national heritage. Government funding totals
£8 million in 1996-97. The Fund also acts as
the distributing body for the heritage share of
the proceeds from the National Lottery (see
p. 42).
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
Britain was the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, and many
advances in manufacturing were invented in
Britain. This has resulted in a large industrial
heritage, the importance of which is being
increasingly recognised. Key sites are
scheduled or listed; one of the most important,
the Ironbridge Gorge, where Abraham Darby
(1677-1717) first smelted iron using coke
instead of charcoal, has been designated a
World Heritage Site (see p. 373). Other
museums devoted to the preservation of
industrial buildings and equipment have also
been set up.
Britain, which pioneered railways, has a fine
heritage of railway buildings and structures,
and there is an active movement to preserve it,
with many volunteers. A large number of
disused railway lines have been bought by
railway preservation societies, and several
railway museums have been established.
Reminders of Britain’s maritime past are
also preserved. At Portsmouth are preserved
HMS Victory, Nelson’s flagship, HMS
Warrior, the world’s first iron battleship, and
the remains of the Mary Rose, an early
16th-century warship, raised from the seabed
in 1982. The Imperial War Museum has
opened the cruiser HMS Belfast to the public
in the Pool of London. Isambard Kingdom
Brunei’s SS Great Britain, the world’s first
large screw-driven ship, is preserved in Bristol.
A voluntary body, the Maritime Trust, has
been established to preserve vessels and other
maritime items of historic or technical interest.
The Trust’s vessels include the clipper Cutty
Sark at Greenwich. In all, it is estimated that
some 400 historic ships are preserved in
Britain, mostly in private hands.
Voluntary Sector
Among the organisations which campaign for
the preservation and appreciation of buildings
are:
• the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings;
• the Ancient Monuments Society;
372
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
• Durham Cathedral and Castle;
• Studley Royal Gardens and Fountains
Abbey, in North Yorkshire;
• the Georgian Group;
• the Victorian Society;
• the Twentieth Century Society;
• the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland;
• the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society;
• the Architectural Heritage Fund; and
• the Council for British Archaeology.
While funded largely by private donations,
some of these amenity societies have statutory
responsibilities, in recognition of which they
receive government support.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with over
2.3 million members, owns and protects 320
properties open to the public, in addition to
over 265,000 hectares (655,000 acres) of land in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Scotland has its own National Trust, which
owns 35 historic houses and 74,800 hectares
(184,700 acres) of land.
The Civic Trust, a voluntary body, makes
awards for development and restoration work
which enhance surroundings. It undertakes
urban regeneration projects and acts as an
umbrella organisation for nearly 1,000 civic
societies. There are associate trusts in
Scotland, Wales and north-east England.
World Heritage Sites
Britain is well represented in the World
Heritage List, which was established under the
World Heritage Convention to identify and
secure lasting protection for those parts of the
world heritage of outstanding universal value.
So far 14 sites in Britain have been listed.
These are:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with St
Augustine’s Abbey and St Martin’s
Church, in Kent;
• Ironbridge Gorge, with the world’s first
iron bridge and other early industrial sites,
in Shropshire;
• the prehistoric stone circles at Stonehenge
and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
• Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
• the city of Bath, in Avon;
• Hadrian’s Wall, the former Roman
frontier in northern England;
• the Tower of London;
• the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster,
also in London;
• the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
• Edinburgh Old and New Towns;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I, in north Wales; and
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland.
Support for these sites under various
programmes can be considerable. For example,
Durham Cathedral received £95,000 in
government repair grant in 1994-95.
In June 1996 the Government
announced that it has put forward
the centre of Greenwich for
consideration as a World Heritage
site. The area proposed for
designation includes the old Royal
Observatory, the National Maritime
Museum and the Royal Naval
College.

Economic trends in recent decades have altered traditional patterns and
locations of employment and brought profound changes to local economies.
Many inner-city areas have suffered from long-established industries moving
out or closing down, leaving problems of dereliction and unemployment.
Unemployment also affects the countryside, where rural areas have had to
diversify away from farm production. The Government is addressing these
problems with a variety of regeneration programmes to stimulate business,
employment and physical renewal. It seeks to balance the demands for land
from business, housing, transport, farming and leisure, and to protect the
environment, by means of a statutory system of land-use planning and
development control.
REGENERATION
The Government is seeking to overcome urban
problems in England using a Single
Regeneration Budget (SRB), which brought
together 20 previous programmes from five
government departments. Several of the more
important programmes are described below.
Urban problems in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are being tackled by
Partnerships, the Programme for the Valleys
and the Making Belfast Work initiative
respectively, as well as by many other
government programmes (see pp. 379-81).
Other programmes and policies are directed at
addressing the needs of rural areas.
Single Regeneration Budget
The Secretary of State for the Environment
has overall responsibility for the SRB, which
came into operation in 1994—95. The aim is to
promote more flexible and locally responsive
forms of regeneration, building on the
approach pioneered with the City Challenge
initiative (see p. 376). The 1996-97 allocation
is £1,318 million. The main programmes
funded by the SRB are administered by the
integrated Government Offices for the Regions
(GORs), which combine the former regional
offices of the Departments of the
Environment, Employment, Trade and
Industry, and Transport. The SRB Challenge
375
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fund was launched in 1995 to support bids for
local regeneration initiatives. The first two
bidding rounds, for schemes starting in April
1995 and April 1996 respectively, resulted in
372 schemes being approved. These are
expected to create or safeguard 500,000 jobs,
support over 80,000 new businesses, complete
or improve nearly 170,000 homes and support
over 20,000 voluntary or community groups.
On average, every £1 of Challenge Fund
money attracts ^2.50 of private investment in
the projects supported. A third round of
bidding is being held for schemes to start in
April 1997.
City Challenge
Under the City Challenge initiative,
launched in 1991, local authorities were
invited, in partnership with the private
and voluntary sectors, local communities
and government agencies, to submit
imaginative and comprehensive plans for
regenerating key neighbourhoods by tackling
problems of physical decay, lack of economic
opportunity and poor quality of life. The
best of these proposals are receiving
government funding of £37.5 million each
over five years, subject to satisfactory
progress being made towards achieving
agreed targets and objectives.
There have been two rounds of the City
Challenge competition. In the first pilot round,
11 local authorities in England were selected to
draw up detailed action plans, which
commenced in 1992 and are due to be fully
implemented by March 1997. The 20
authorities successful in the second round
competition began work on their five-year
programmes in 1993. In the six-year period to
1997-98, £1,163 million of City Challenge
money is expected to attract over £3,500
million of private sector investment.
Urban Development Corporations
Twelve urban development corporations
(UDCs) were set up in England by the
Government to reverse large-scale urban
decline. The first two, London Docklands and
Merseyside, started operations in 1981. Ten
others were subsequently established:
Birmingham Heartlands, Black Country (West
Midlands), Bristol, Leeds, Central
Manchester, Plymouth, Sheffield, Trafford
Park (Greater Manchester), Teesside, and
Tyne and Wear. At their peak, the UDCs
covered about 16,000 hectares (about 40,000
acres). The Bristol and Leeds development
corporations were wound up in 1995, and
Central Manchester in March 1996. All the
other UDCs are scheduled to be wound up by
March 1998. Public expenditure on the
programme will be £208 million in 1996-97,
including spending on the Docklands Light
Railway (see p. 312).
Task Forces
Task Forces, first set up in 1986, are small
teams of five or six people drawn from
government departments, local authorities and
the private and voluntary sectors, which
operate in the most deprived urban areas in
England. Task Forces concentrate on the
economic regeneration of designated inner-city
areas by:
• improving local people’s employment
prospects;
• supporting training and education
initiatives; and
• identifying and removing barriers to
employment.
They also aim to stimulate enterprise and
strengthen the capacity of communities to
meet local needs. Task Forces have a limited
life: an important part of their work is to build
up local organisations to which they can hand
over as they withdraw. Since 1986 Task Forces
have spent over £148 million, which has
helped to provide over 37,000 jobs and more
than 17,000 training places, and supported
over 44,000 businesses.
English Partnerships
English Partnerships, a government
regeneration agency, promotes the
development of vacant, derelict and
contaminated land throughout England. Its
key objectives are to:
376
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
• stimulate local enterprise;
• create job opportunities; and
• improve the environment.
These objectives are being addressed in
partnership with other public bodies and the
private and voluntary sectors. In 1994-95 more
than 250 new projects were approved, creating
13,200 jobs, reclaiming over 1,600 hectares
(4,000 acres) and attracting £300 million in
private finance. English Partnerships’ planned
gross expenditure for 1996-97 is about £207
million. It is also eligible for assistance from
the European Regional Development Fund
(see p. 127).
Safer Cities
Higher than average crime rates, and the fear
of crime, are particular problems in inner-
city areas. Safer Cities projects bring
together all sections of the local community
to combat crime and the fear of crime. Since
the programme’s launch in 1988 almost 4,500
crime prevention and community safety
measures have been initiated, with funding
of £26 million. Results from the first phase
of the programme are being evaluated, and
a second phase is under way. Examples of
help include providing activities for young
people who might be tempted to commit
crime, and fitting good quality locks to
houses on estates which have a high burglary
rate. Successes include a 40 per cent
reduction in burglaries on a Wolverhampton
estate and a 60 per cent reduction in car
crime in a Bradford car park.
Compacts
School/industry ‘Compacts’ have been
introduced since 1988 in urban areas in
England. Employers work with schools to
guarantee a job with training for all
school-leavers aged 16 to 18 who meet agreed
targets for motivation and achievement.
Regional Enterprise Grants
The Regional Enterprise Grant programme
(see pp. 214-6), which has also been brought
within the SRB, supports investment and
innovation projects in small firms in
designated areas. A total of £13.7 million was
allocated to small businesses in 1995-96.
Other Measures
The first of a network of City Technology
Colleges was opened near Birmingham in
1988; 15 are currently operating. Intended to
raise educational standards, the colleges have
been established jointly by government and
industry.
Training programmes such as Youth
Training (see p. 191) and Training for Work
(see p. 190) are helping many people in the
inner cities. About one-third of young people
participating in Youth Training are from inner
cities. In addition, over 100 Employment
Service ‘outreach’ staff are based in, or
regularly visit, inner-city areas, where they
help unemployed people look for jobs and
encourage them to participate in employment
and training programmes. This activity
supplements normal jobcentre services. In
1992—93 there were about 500 inner-city
Jobclubs, many catering for people with
literacy and numeracy or language difficulties.
The Government encourages tourism as a
force for improving inner-city areas, and
several major projects which create a cultural
and artistic focus for inner-city regeneration
have been undertaken. Examples include the
development of the Royal Armouries Museum
at Clarence Dock in Leeds, which opened in
March 1996 at a cost of £42.5 million, and the
International Convention Centre in
Birmingham. The English Tourist Board and
regional tourist boards encourage promotional
activities in inner-city areas through local
initiatives bringing together tourist boards,
local authorities, the private sector and other
agencies.
In 1994 the Government launched the
Urban Forum, a new national body that brings
together voluntary organisations engaged in
urban policy and regeneration. Its aims are to
act as a communication channel between the
voluntary sector and the Government; develop
new ideas; and encourage local communities
and voluntary groups to engage in regeneration
partnerships.

Groundwork Trusts
Groundwork trusts seek to alleviate
environmental problems arising from
dereliction and vandalism and to increase
public awareness of opportunities to change
and improve local environments. They work
in partnership with public bodies, the private
sector, voluntary organisations and
individuals. Traditionally, the trusts have
tended to concentrate on fringe urban or
suburban areas, but increasingly they are also
becoming involved in inner-city areas. For
example, a trust has recently been set up in
the Hackney area of inner London.
Government funding for Groundwork in
1996-97 is £6.9 million in England. The
Groundwork Foundation is a national
body providing the trusts with advice and
support.
Enterprise and Simplified Planning
Zones
Since 1981 the Government has established
28 enterprise zones, including four
extensions. Each zone runs for a period of
ten years from designation; most have,
therefore, already reached the end of
their lives. Benefits available in the zones
include:
• exemption from the national
non-domestic rate (the local property tax
payable by non-domestic property
owners—seep. 171);
• 100 per cent allowances for corporation
and income tax purposes for capital
expenditure on industrial and commercial
buildings; and
• a simplified planning system.
At present it is not generally intended to
extend the enterprise zone scheme by
designating any further sites. However, the
Government has retained the option of
establishing further zones in exceptional
circumstances; for example, a new zone is
likely to be designated in 1996 in Newcastle
upon Tyne to help address the loss of jobs in
shipbuilding.
Simplified planning zones (SPZs) are
designed to help local authorities to secure
development in their areas. An SPZ scheme,
which also lasts for ten years, provides full
planning permission for specified types of
development. Like enterprise zones, from
which the concept was derived, SPZs can act
as part of an overall package to generate private
sector interest in an area.
European Union Programmes
Run-down areas in Britain benefit from EU
Structural Funds (see p. 127). These come
mainly from the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF), which finances
infrastructure projects and support for
industry, among other things. Objectives for
the Funds include regenerating areas affected
by industrial decline and combating long-term
unemployment. The Department of the
Environment is responsible for co-ordinating
ERDF programmes in England. About £1,195
million has been allocated to declining
industrial regions in England during the
period 1994-96.
Following a review of the Structural Funds,
Merseyside qualified for ‘Objective F
support.1 This attracts the highest level of
Structural Funds support. Merseyside stands
to receive about £633 million from the Funds
between 1994 and 1999.
In 1995 it was announced that six
non-Objective 1 urban areas in England were
to receive funding of £37 million under the
URBAN Community Initiative, an EU-wide
scheme to promote urban regeneration that
complements domestic programmes.
Rural Development
The British countryside is facing
considerable change. Agricultural reform (see
p. 290), together with a reduction of jobs in
defence establishments, is creating a need for
more diversified employment opportunities.
The movement of people into the
countryside has increased the demand for
housing and local services and, with a major
projected growth in the number of

development in underdeveloped regions.

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
households, is likely to continue. Rural areas
generally have been successful in recent
years, with strong growth in employment,
especially in high-technology industries.
Continuing technological change will provide
new opportunities for industry to overcome
problems of remoteness stemming from a
rural location.
The Government’s 1995 White Paper,
Rural England: A Nation Committed to
a Living Countryside, set out the
policy framework for rural areas.
Proposals to promote sustainable
development in the countryside
include an expansion of the
Countryside Stewardship scheme (see
p. 293), new planning treatment for
rural businesses, new powers for
parish councils in community
transport, larger grants to housing
associations in recognition of the
higher costs of developing small
schemes in villages, and a new rate
relief scheme targeted at general
stores and post offices. Separate
White Papers have been published for
Scotland and Wales (see pp. 380-1).
The Rural Development Commission is the
government agency concerned with the
economic wellbeing of the people who live and
work in rural England. During 1996-97 the
Commission is expected to spend £44 million.
The bulk of this money is targeted at 312 Rural
Development Areas (RDAs), which cover 35
per cent of the land area of England and 2.75
million people. Expenditure within the RDAs
seeks to diversify the rural economy and
strengthen rural communities through grants
and advice to business, the provision of
workspace and support for projects developed
in partnership with the private, public and
voluntary sectors.
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
Wales
A new Strategic Development Scheme (SDS)
was launched in Wales in 1994, into which the
previous Urban Programme was subsumed.
Projects costing almost £63 million were
approved for 1996—97, which are expected to
generate more than £80 million of private
investment; 76 new major projects will be
started as a result. In 1996-97, local authorities
were for the first time given freedom to
allocate part of the SDS budget themselves,
without prior approval of the Welsh Office;
some £13 million of the total has been passed
to local authorities, of which £9 million was
available for them to allocate to projects. In
addition, Urban Investment Grant encourages
private sector developments on derelict and
run-down sites in urban areas; the 1996-97
budget is £6.8 million.
As part of its area development activities,
the Welsh Development Agency (WDA— see
p. 26), in conjunction with local authorities
and the private sector, is regenerating and
revitalising towns and cities throughout Wales.
In urban areas, through infrastructure and
environmental improvement schemes, it has
brought in £115 million of private sector
investment in two years. Its other capital
development programmes have also played a
vital role in the development of the economy.
For example, its property development
programme provides readily available
industrial premises, both for local businesses
and for inward investment projects. Its budget
in 1996-97 for area development is almost £88
million. Development is also encouraged by
the Land Authority for Wales, a statutory body
with powers to make land available for
development in circumstances where the
private sector would find this difficult or
impossible. It is a self-financing trading body
which ploughs back its profits for future
investment.
The first Programme for the Valleys, which
ran from 1988 to 1993, was an extensive
scheme of economic and urban regeneration,
covering an area of about 2,200 sq km (860 sq
miles) in the south Wales valleys. In 1993 the
Government launched a new five-year
Programme, which builds on the first
Programme and introduces new initiatives for
the social, economic and environmental
regeneration of the Valleys. The aims of the
new Programme are to:
379
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• create more, better-quality jobs;
• improve training, education and transport;
• improve the quality of the environment;
• improve the quality and choice of housing;
and
• improve the health of local people.
It is expected that in 1995—96, 5,000 homes
will have been renovated, over £23 million
spent on land reclamation by the WDA, and
£170 million of new roads started or
completed.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation
was set up in 1987 to promote redevelopment
in part of south Cardiff, once its commercial
centre. Government support for the
Corporation will be £58 million in 1996-97.
The Corporation’s regeneration strategy
includes a £191 million barrage project which
will create a large freshwater lake within
Cardiff Bay and 12 km (7 miles) of waterside
frontage. Work commenced on its construction
in 1994 and is scheduled to be completed in
1998. It is expected that more than 25,000 new
jobs will be created in the Cardiff Bay area,
6,000 new homes will be built and over £1,175
million of private investment will be attracted.
The Government published a White Paper,
A Working Countryside for Wales, in March
1996. Its proposals include:
• a new rate relief scheme for village shops
and post offices;
• the development of a strategy to promote
the Welsh food industry;
• the transfer of funding for rural schemes
from the WDA to local authorities;
• improvements for basic services such as
health and transport; and
• continuing support for the Welsh
language.
Scotland
The Government set out its strategy for
improving the quality of life in the most
deprived urban areas in Scotland in the 1995
policy statement Programme for Partnership. In
April 1996 it formally invited councils and
other bodies to form partnerships and bid for
Urban Programme funding under the
framework set out in the policy statement. It is
expected that by autumn 1996 the
Government will have designated the first
Priority Partnership Areas, in each of which a
broadly-based partnership will undertake
comprehensive regeneration. Of the available
resources—over £81 million in 1996—97—
the larger part will be directed towards the
Priority Partnerships Areas. The partnerships
there will receive a block allocation of money
from the Urban Programme, leaving detailed
decisions about regeneration projects to be
taken by the partnerships themselves.
Remaining funds will go to other areas eligible
for Urban Programme support, to assist
regeneration activity put forward by local
councils or partnerships.
The strategy builds on the experience
gained from four Partnerships in areas of
Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley. Set
up in 1988, three of these are still operational,
led by The Scottish Office and involving other
bodies and groups, including Scottish
Enterprise (see p. 216), Scottish Homes (see p.
389), local authorities, the private sector and
local communities. Their objectives include
plans to:
• improve the quality and tenure mix of
housing available to local people;
• improve employment prospects by
providing more opportunities for training
and further education; and
• tackle social and environmental problems
on the estates.
Local Enterprise Companies (LECs—see
p. 189), working under contract to Scottish
Enterprise, have substantial budgets and a
range of powers and functions to improve the
environment and encourage business and
employment in their areas. Responsibility for
derelict land reclamation also rests with
Scottish Enterprise, LECs and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise. They may acquire and
reclaim land either by agreement or
compulsorily; increasingly they seek to work
with the private sector to bring land back into
use.
The Compact scheme (see p. 377) has also
been introduced in Scotland, where nine
380
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
Compacts are in operation. Many employers
and business organisations participate in
Education Business Partnerships in Scotland.
The Training and Employment Grants
scheme is designed to increase access to
employment opportunities for young and
long-term unemployed people.
A rural White Paper covering Scotland,
launched in December 1995, announced a new
£2.4 million Partnership Fund to support
rural partnerships of government departments
and agencies, private sector bodies and
voluntary groups with responsibilities in rural
areas. A National Rural Partnership has been
established to encourage the formation of such
local partnerships and to advise on spending
priorities for the Partnership Fund. The
Government’s target is for 20 rural
partnerships to be set up by March 1997.
Northern Ireland
Urban Development Grant is the principal
urban regeneration measure in Northern
Ireland. Its objective is the economic and
physical regeneration of inner-city areas of
Belfast and Londonderry by encouraging
private enterprise and investment in
property development, leading to job creation
and improvement of the environment.
Projected expenditure for 1996—97 is £5.4
million.
A comprehensive development programme
aims to revitalise run-down areas of Belfast,
with anticipated spending of £1.8 million in
1996-97. The Making Belfast Work initiative’s
strategy for 1995-97 aims to increase
employment opportunities and quality of life
in the most disadvantaged areas of Belfast. The
development of area partnerships is now a
major policy priority. In addition to extensive
funding already allocated to mainstream
departmental programmes, Making Belfast
Work provided a further £170 million between
1988 to 1996. An additional £25 million has
been allocated in 1996-97. The Laganside
Corporation was established in 1989 to
regenerate Belfast’s riverside area. Its
government grant in 1996—97 is £7.6 million.
The Londonderry Initiative was established
in 1988 to address various problems of urban
decline in the area. Its main aims include
attracting private sector investment to the city,
helping people to secure jobs and refurbishing
the physical environment. By March 1996
nearly £21 million had been allocated to the
Initiative.
The Community Regeneration and
Improvement Special Programme is jointly
funded by the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland and the International
Fund for Ireland (see p. 16). A total of 44 small
towns, as well as Londonderry, Newry,
Strabane, Portadown and Craigavon, have
been assisted at a cost to the Government of
£26 million since the programme was started
in 1990. The urban regeneration
sub-programme of the Special Support
Programme for Peace and Reconciliation aims
to promote peace and reconciliation by
renewing urban areas affected by deprivation.
Introduced in 1996, it has a budget of about
£16 million over the period to 1999 and covers
the main urban areas of Northern Ireland,
including Belfast and Londonderry.
Public Sector Land
The Department of the Environment
promotes the sale and development of vacant
and under-used public sector land in England.
Information is being assembled on key sites
with development potential and, where there
are no firm plans to market or develop land,
action will be taken to promote the sale of sites.
Under the ‘Public Request to Order Disposal’
scheme, members of the public are encouraged
to ask the Government to order public bodies
to dispose of vacant or under-used land on the
open market. In 1994 the rules governing the
way local authorities can spend the proceeds of
asset sales were altered to encourage the sale of
surplus land.
PLANNING
Direct responsibility for land-use planning in
Great Britain lies with local authorities. The
Secretaries of State for the Environment,
Wales and Scotland have overall responsibility
for the operation of the system. The
Department of the Environment brings
together the major responsibilities for land-use
381
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
planning, housing and construction,
countryside policy and environmental
protection in England. The Welsh and
Scottish Offices have broadly equivalent
responsibilities, which also extend to
transport. In Northern Ireland the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for planning
matters, working closely with the district
councils.
In England, the Department of the
Environment provides national and regional
guidance on planning, while strategic
planning is the responsibility of the county
councils and unitary district authorities. At
present, most district councils are
responsible for local plans and development
control, except for minerals and waste, which
are dealt with by the county and unitary
district councils. In London and the
metropolitan counties, and in some
non-metropolitan unitary areas, districts
prepare unitary development plans and are
responsible for development control.
In Wales and Scotland, planning
responsibilities now rest with the new unitary
authorities (see p. 76).
Development Plans
Development plans have a central role in
shaping development patterns in an area, as
planning decisions must be made in
accordance with the development plan unless
‘material considerations’ indicate otherwise. In
England and Wales, the preparation of a
district-wide development plan is mandatory.
In March 1996 the Government consulted on
measures to speed up the adoption of
development plans.
The present development plan system in
England comprises structure, local and unitary
development plans:
• structure plans, setting out broad policies
for the development and use of land, are
adopted by county councils and some
unitary councils;
• local plans, prepared in general
conformity with the adopted structure
plan, and providing detailed guidance for
development, are adopted by most district
councils and National Park authorities;
and
• unitary development plans, setting out
both strategic and detailed land-use and
development policies, are adopted by
metropolitan districts, London boroughs
and some non-metropolitan unitary
authorities.
County councils and unitary councils also
draw up local plans for minerals and waste.
Following local government reorganisation
(see pp. 75—6), some district councils in
England have acquired unitary status or will do
shortly. Unless these are given a unitary
development plan function, they become the
structure plan authority for their area. In most
cases the Government expects these unitary-
authorities to work with the surrounding
county council or with neighbouring unitary
authorities on a joint structure plan
corresponding to the original county area.
In Wales, the new councils have taken over
responsibility for plan preparation and will be
drawing up unitary development plans for
their areas. It is intended to have these plans in
place by the year 2000. In Scotland the new
councils have also undertaken responsibility
for plan preparation. In some cases, structure
may be taken forward by a joint committee of
more than one council. Under Northern
Ireland’s single-tier system, plans are prepared
by the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Members of the public are encouraged to
become involved in the formulation of plan
policies and proposals. They can formally
object and, in the case of local and unitary
development plans, make their case in public
to an independent inspector (reporter in
Scotland). When formulating plans, planning
authorities must take account of any strategic
or regional guidance issued by the
Government.
An important element of the Government’s
strategy for sustainable development (see
Chapter 21) is for full use to be made of urban
land in existing towns and cities, while having
regard to the quality of the urban environment,
in order to avoid the need to develop ‘green
field’ sites and to reduce transport demands.
382
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
The Government announced new
planning guidance in June 1996 aimed
at revitalising town centres in
England. It encourages a plan-led
approach to promoting development
in town centres, lays emphasis on the
importance of a coherent town centre
parking strategy in maintaining
urban vitality, and requires clearer
assessment of retail proposals that
could have an impact on the viability
of town centres. When putting
forward out-of-centre retail
proposals, developers will be
expected to demonstrate that they
have first thoroughly examined more
central sites. Broadly similar
guidance for Scotland had been
issued in April 1996.
Green Belts
‘Green Belts’ are areas ofland intended to be
left open and free from inappropriate
development. Their purposes are to:
• check the sprawl of large built-up areas;
• safeguard surrounding countryside from
encroachment;
• prevent neighbouring towns from
merging;
• preserve the special character of historic
towns; and
• assist in urban regeneration by
encouraging the re-use of derelict and
other urban land.
Green Belts have been established around
major cities and conurbations, including
London, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the West
Midlands, as well as several smaller towns.
Some 1.5 million hectares (3.8 million acres)
are designated as Green Belt in England and
155,000 hectares (380,000 acres) in Scotland.
The Government attaches great importance to
the protection of Green Belts, which have been
a cornerstone of the planning system for over
40 years. Planning guidance on Green Belts in
England was revised in 1995 to strengthen
further the strict controls over development
and to secure greater benefits for the
environment. In Scotland, Green Belt policy
has also been updated, and guidance on Green
Belts in Wales was introduced in May 1996.
Development Control
Most development requires specific planning
permission. Applications are dealt with in the
light of development plans and other relevant
planning considerations, including national
and regional guidance. In 1995-96 about
457,000 applications for planning permission
were received by district councils in England;
in total, about 363,000 applications were
granted in this period. The Government has
set local authorities in England and Wales a
target of deciding 80 per cent of applications
within eight weeks.
Local planning authorities in England and
Wales are required to publicise planning
applications locally. Methods commonly used
include site notices, newspaper advertising and
notifying neighbours. In Scotland applicants
are required to notify owners, occupiers and,
in some cases, lessees of neighbouring land and
buildings when an application is submitted to
the planning authority. Newspaper advertising
is required for certain types of development.
Applicants have a right of appeal to the
relevant Secretary of State if a local authority
refuses planning permission, grants it with
conditions attached, or fails to decide an
application within eight weeks2 (or whatever
longer period is agreed with the applicant).
The majority of appeals are decided on the
basis of written submissions. However, either
party has the right to be heard by an inspector
at a public local inquiry or at a hearing. A local
inquiry is usually held for more complicated or
controversial applications. Similar provision is
made in Northern Ireland.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a
planning application be referred to them for
decision. They generally only use this power to
‘call in’ proposals which raise planning issues
of national or regional importance. In such
circumstances, applicants and local planning
2Two months in Scotland.
383
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
authorities have the right to be heard by a
person appointed by the Secretary of State,
and a public inquiry will normally be held. In
Northern Ireland, major planning applications
can be referred to a public inquiry in certain
circumstances.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Planning applications for certain types of
development must be accompanied by an
environmental statement. This should describe
the likely environmental effects and measures
to minimise them. These statements are
available to the public and to statutory bodies
such as the Countryside Commission and
English Nature (see pp. 364-5). Planning
authorities must consider the environmental
statement, and any representations received on
it, before granting planning permission. The
Government published a good practice guide
on preparing environmental statements in
1995.
Architectural Standards and the Built
Environment
The Government emphasises the importance
of good design and quality, both in individual
buildings and in the built environment as a
whole. It advises that the appearance of new
developments, and their relationship to their
surroundings, are issues that should be
addressed through the design of individual
buildings and through urban design. While
local planning authorities should reject designs
which are out of scale or character with their
surroundings, the Government’s view is that
they should not seek to control the detailed
design of buildings unless the sensitive
character of their location justifies it, nor
should they seek to impose a particular
architectural taste or style arbitrarily.
Guidance on architectural competitions is
being updated in 1996 by the Department of
the Environment and the Department of
National Heritage.
The Royal Fine Art Commissions for
England, Wales and Scotland advise
government departments, local planning
authorities and other public bodies on
questions of quality, public amenity and
artistic importance.
The new Architects Registration Board,
together with the architects’ professional
bodies—the Royal Institute of British
Architects, the Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society
of Ulster Architects—-exercises control over
standards in architectural training and
encourages high standards in the profession.
The Royal Town Planning Institute carries out
similar functions for the planning profession.

Improving Existing Housing 391
Homelessness 392
Housing Advice 394
Increasing home ownership and choice in renting are key themes in the
Government’s housing policies. Strategies to enhance both urban and rural
environments include improvements to housing and diversification of tenure.
Further measures are being taken to reduce homelessness.
In all, 189,000 new dwellings were completed
in Great Britain in 1995, a rise of 3.6 per cent
on 1994. Growth in owner-occupation has
been particularly marked, increasing from 50
per cent in 1971 to 67 per cent at the end of
1995. Both the public and the private sectors
build housing, but about four-fifths of new
dwellings are built by the private sector for sale
to owner-occupiers.
Local authorities are encouraged to see their
housing role as an enabling one, working with
housing associations and the private sector to
increase the supply of low-cost housing for sale
or rent without necessarily providing it
themselves. Housing associations are now the
main providers of new ‘social housing’
—housing provided at rents affordable to
people on low incomes, usually substantially
below market rents. This allows local
authorities to focus on improving the
management of their own stock. Rents on new
private sector lettings in Great Britain were
deregulated (freed from controls) in 1988, with
the aim of stimulating the private rented
sector, which had been declining for most of
this century. These policies have been taken
forward with the Housing Act 1996.
Administration
The Secretary of State for the Environment in
England and the Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible
for formulating housing policy and supervising
the housing programme.
The construction and structural alteration
of housing are subject to building regulations
laid down by the Government. In addition,
warranty arrangements provided by the
National House-Building Council cover many
new houses. This body sets standards and
enforces them by inspection, providing cover
against major structural defects for at least ten
years.
Housing Act 1996
In 1995 the Government set out its housing
policies for England and Wales in a White
Paper, Our Future Homes. It included
commitments to a sustainable expansion in
home ownership, based on economic stability,
stable house prices and low interest rates;
further funding to ensure there is no necessity
for people to sleep rough (outside in the
street); and a target to build half of all new
385
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
homes on re-used sites. It also envisaged the
creation of a new framework for social rented
housing with rents remaining affordable to
tenants in low-paid work, a greater diversity
of social landlords, more transfers of local
authority housing to new landlords outside
the public sector, and commercial
organisations competing alongside housing
associations for grants to provide social
housing. Many of the proposals have been
enacted in the Housing Act 1996, which
applies mostly to England and Wales. Key
features of the Act include:
• a new purchase grant scheme to help
housing association tenants to buy the
homes they are currently renting;
• a fairer system for allocating social
housing, with the retention of a ‘safety
net’ for families and vulnerable people
who lose their homes through no fault of
their own;
• a right for council tenants to vote for new
types of social landlord who could bring in
private money to improve their estates;
• stronger powers for landlords to act
against tenants engaged in anti-social
behaviour;
• better protection against unscrupulous
landlords who, for example, make
excessive service charges; and
• improved safety standards for people in
‘bedsits’ and hostels.
The White Paper proposal to create
housing investment trusts in order to
encourage financial institutions to invest in
private rented housing was embodied in the
Finance Act 1996.
Home Ownership
The number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to 16 million at the
end of 1995, compared with 4.1 million in
1950.
Mortgage Loans
Most people buy their homes with a mortgage
loan, using the property as security. These are
obtained through building societies, banks or
other financial institutions such as specialist
mortgage lenders. Additionally, some
companies grant loans for house purchase to
their employees. The amount that lenders are
prepared to advance to a would-be house
purchaser is generally calculated as a multiple
of his or her annual income, typically up to
two-and-a-half or three times earnings, and the
term of the loan is commonly 25 years.
Owner-occupiers get tax relief on interest
payments on the first £30,000 of their
mortgages on their main home.
In the recession in the early 1990s, many
homeowners saw a fall in the value of their
homes, and some have had trouble keeping up
with mortgage payments. The Government’s
policies to overcome these problems have been
based on maintaining a healthy economy, low
interest rates and stable house prices in order
to help keep home ownership affordable. The
number of repossessions in the first half of
1996 was down 38 per cent from its peak of
38,900 in the second half of 1991. The first half
of 1996 saw a continued recovery in house
prices.

development corporation houses were sold

between 1979-80 and the end of 1995. Sales
are continuing at a rate of about 60,000 a

include shared ownership schemes1 and

housing are given cash help to buy in the
private sector. Over 5,000 local authority
tenants a year are given help in this way,
thereby opening up new lettings for those in
greatest need.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home
ownership scheme which allows purchasers
to buy a home for 70 per cent of its value, the
balance being secured as a charge on the
property. Scottish Homes operates a scheme
to encourage private developers to build for
owner-occupation in areas they would not
normally consider. In 1996-97 planned
investment in the scheme is about £21
million. A shared ownership scheme in
Northern Ireland is administered by the
Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing
Association.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Privately Rented Housing
The proportion of households who rent from
private landlords declined to a low point of 8.6
per cent in the late 1980s, but this has now
increased to over 10.0 per cent. The
Government’s policy has been to increase the
availability of privately rented accommodation.
The Housing Act 1988 further deregulated
rents, and introduced assured and assured
shorthold tenancies, which allow landlords to
charge a reasonable market rent and recover
possession of their property when they need
to. The Housing Act 1996 is introducing
measures to improve small landlords’
confidence in letting property by reducing
paperwork for letting on an assured shorthold
tenancy and by speeding up action on rent
arrears.
A ‘Rent a Room’ scheme enables
homeowners to let rooms to lodgers without
having to pay tax on rents up to a level of
about £62 a week. Housing investment
trusts, provided for in the Finance Act 1996,
will be companies set up to own residential
property for rent. They will benefit from tax
provisions designed to encourage
institutional investment in the private rented
sector.
In Northern Ireland the private rented
sector accounts for approximately 5 per cent
of the total housing stock. Less than half of
this is subject to statutory control on rents.
Rent levels of controlled properties are
linked to those of the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive. Shorthold tenancies are
available; the only assured tenancies in
Northern Ireland are those on properties
made available under the former Business
Expansion Scheme.
Social Housing
Social rented housing is usually owned
either by local authorities or by housing
associations. It accounts for over a fifth of all
homes.

HOUSING
Public Housing
Most social housing in Great Britain is
provided by local housing authorities.2 At
present these are:
• district councils, in those parts of England
with two-tier local government;
• London borough councils, metropolitan
districts and unitary authorities, in areas
with single-tier local government; and
• the new unitary councils in Scotland and
Wales, plus the Scottish islands councils.
Public housing is also provided by Scottish
Homes, which currently has a stock of about
36,000 houses. It is, however, in the process of
transferring its houses to alternative landlords
such as housing associations. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive is responsible for
the provision and management of public
housing there. The Development Board for
Rural Wales also used to provide housing, but
transferred all its 1,200 houses to other social
landlords in April 1996.
Public housing authorities in Great Britain
own about 4.6 million houses and flats; the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive owns
about 145,000 homes. Since 1988, a number of
local authorities have transferred all their
housing stock to housing associations and
others are considering doing so. This has the
advantage of bringing in new sources of
funding and types of management. By July
1996, 51 authorities had transferred their
stock, involving over 220,000 properties and
raising more than £3,600 million.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
modernising their stock by:
• borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (an independent statutory body set
up to make loans to local authorities) or on
the open market;
• using part of the proceeds from the sale of
local authority houses and other assets;
• drawing on their revenue accounts; or
• using grants from central government.
2The reorganisation of local government in England (see
pp. 75—6) will change these arrangements as new local
authorities take over in some areas.
Councils must maintain housing revenue
accounts on a ‘ring-fenced’ basis to keep them
separate from other council funds. The
Government grants local authorities in
England and Wales Housing Revenue Account
Subsidy. This is worth £3,834 million in
England and £193 million in Wales in
1996-97. In Scotland, Housing Support Grant
of about £20 million is available in 1996—97 for
those authorities which are in deficit on their
housing revenue accounts.
Local authorities in England will be able to
borrow £1,213 million in 1996-97 for their
housing investment programmes. In Scotland,
local authorities have received capital
allocations amounting to £341 million for
investment in council homes. In Northern
Ireland, the Housing Executive’s capital
programme is financed mainly by borrowing
from government and receipts from house
sales. In 1996-97 borrowing will total £70
million. Revenue expenditure is funded from
rental income and by a government grant,
which in 1996-97 is about £139 million.
Housing Associations
Housing associations, which are non-profit-
making, are now the main providers of new
low-cost housing for rent and for sale to those
on low incomes and in the greatest housing
need. Some specialise in providing supported
housing to meet the special needs of those
with, for example, learning difficulties (mental
handicap), drug and alcohol problems, young
people at risk and frail elderly people.
Associations own, manage and maintain over
950,000 homes and about 65,000 hostel and
special-needs bed-spaces in Great Britain,
providing homes for well over 1 million
people.
In Great Britain new housing schemes
carried out by associations may qualify for
Housing Association Grant if the association
concerned is one of about 2,200 registered with
the Housing Corporation (in England),
Scottish Homes or Housing for Wales. These
three organisations are statutory bodies which
supervise and pay grant to housing associations
in their respective parts of Great Britain.
Broadly similar assistance is available to
associations in Northern Ireland.
389
f
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Housing Corporation’s approved
development programme provides for about
£1,060 million in grants in 1996-97. This is
supplemented by private finance attracted by
housing associations, thereby allowing more
homes to be built with available public
resources. In 1996-97, Housing Corporation
funding will make possible an additional
43,000 lettings for rent or shared ownership.
For 1996-97, expenditure on Scottish
Homes’ development funding programme,
which includes grants to private developers
and landlords, is £280 million, while the target
for the amount of private finance attracted is
estimated to be £160 million. Housing for
Wales is managing a net capital programme of
£85 million in 1996-97, with a target of
making over 3,000 new homes available.
Government provision to the housing
association movement in Wales was almost
£500 million between 1992-93 and 1995-96.
Private sector finance generated over the same
period reached almost £275 million.
Northern Ireland’s registered housing
associations are expected to start 1,250 units of
accommodation in 1996—97. They now have a
stock of about 19,000 units foi rent. The
budget for building for rent is £36 million in
1997-98, which, with an additional £11
million of private finance, will provide a
further 1,100 units of rented accommodation.
Government plans allow for total funding of
£238 million over the period 1993-94 to
1997-98.
Tenants’ Rights
Local authority tenants in England, Scotland
and Wales have security of tenure and other
statutory rights, which are set out in a Council
Tenant’s Charter. In addition to the right to
buy (see p. 386), these include the right to get
certain urgent repairs done quickly at no cost
to themselves and the right to be paid when
they move home for certain improvements
they have made.
Compulsory competitive tendering is being
introduced for council house management;
tenants must be kept closely involved in the
process of letting the tenders to manage
council estates. Tenants also have the right to
take over the running of their estates through
tenant management organisations (TMOs).
Over 100 TMOs are operational and about 100
more are in the process of development.
The 100th tenant management
organisation (TMO), on the Stockwell
Park estate in Brixton, south London,
was set up in November 1995. The
first borough-wide TMO, also in
London, was established in
Kensington and Chelsea in April
1996. This TMO, directed by a board
composed mostly of tenants, now
manages 8,660 dwellings.
In England and Wales the rights of housing
association tenants are protected under
Tenants’ Guarantees, which are issued by the
Housing Corporation and Housing for Wales.
They cover matters such as tenancy terms,
principles for setting rent levels and the
allocation of tenancies. Under these
guarantees, tenants receive contractual rights
in addition to their basic statutory rights, and
associations are required to set and maintain
rents at levels affordable by those in low-paid
employment. Similar non-statutory guidance,
based on arrangements agreed between
Scottish Homes and the Scottish Federation
of Housing Associations, has been
implemented in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland, the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland has issued a Tenants’
Guarantee, similar to the English and Welsh
versions, for tenants of registered housing
associations.
Following a Citizen’s Charter commitment,
the Government launched a Housing
Association Tenants’ Ombudsman Service in
1993, under the auspices of the Housing
Corporation. The scheme, which covers
England, allows independent investigation of
tenants’ complaints against their housing
association, giving them a right similar to that
for council tenants through the local
government ombudsman (see p. 80). Provision
to make the service statutorily independent is
included in the Housing Act 1996. Similar
schemes have been launched in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
390
HOUSING
Housing for Older People
Sheltered housing provides specialised
facilities for elderly people, such as common
and laundry rooms, alarm systems and resident
or non-resident warden support. Increasing
emphasis is being placed on schemes to help
them to continue to live in their own homes
by, for example, adapting their present homes
to meet their particular needs. In England,
government-funded home improvement
agencies help elderly people, people with
disabilities and those on low incomes to carry
out repairs and improvements to their
properties. Almost £4.4 million of government
help will go to support 142 home improvement
agencies in 1996—97. Care and Repair Ltd is
the natiopal co-ordinating and monitoring
body. Similar arrangements apply in Wales,
where in 1996-97 more than £895,000 in
government help will go to support 24 home
improvement agencies. Corresponding provision
is made for Scotland under the Care and Repair
scheme co-ordinated by Scottish Homes.
Rural Housing
Where there is an identified need for low-cost
housing in rural areas, local authorities can
permit housing in areas where development
would not normally be allowed, so long as the
new housing can be reserved to meet that
need. The Housing Corporation also funds a
special rural programme to build houses in
small villages; between 1989-90 and 1995-96 it
approved funding for the building of over
12,000 such homes.
Housing for Wales has a major role in rural
housing provision, with at least a quarter of its
programme devoted to rural areas. The Welsh
Office also supports low-cost schemes for rural
housing. In Scotland, considerable progress is
being made through a range of initiatives
launched in 1990 as part of the Scottish Homes
Rural Strategy. Scottish Homes has invested
over £360 million in rural areas since 1989-90,
providing more than 12,000 homes. In
1996—97 it will spend more than £53 million in
rural areas, making 1,500 homes available. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive operates
a rural strategy; this involves action both in
public housing and also in the house
renovation grant scheme for private housing,
which it administers.
Improving Existing Housing
In urban areas of Britain, slum clearance and
redevelopment used to be major features of
housing policy, but there has been a trend in
recent years towards the modernisation and
conversion of sub-standard homes in order to
help maintain existing communities. Housing
conditions have improved considerably, but
problems remain in some areas where there are
concentrations of dwellings requiring
substantial repairs. In some cases, however,
clearance may still be the most satisfactory
course of action. To help overcome objections
to clearance, the Housing, Grants, Construction
and Regeneration Act 1996 has recently allowed
local authorities to pay a new discretionary
relocation grant to those displaced by clearance
to help them purchase at least a part share in a
new home in the same area.
Social Housing
Over the next ten years, the Government plans
to tackle the problems of the most deprived
housing estates by:
• improving the physical quality of the
estates;
• encouraging diversity of tenure by
increasing home ownership and renting
from private social landlords; and
• improving economic and social conditions.
Run-down estates will be improved through
the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB—see p.
375) Challenge Fund, which encourages local
partnerships in England to tackle social and
economic problems, including housing
improvements. A high proportion of successful
bids for Challenge Fund support include
improvements to housing. A new £314 million
Estate Renewal Challenge Fund is being made
available over three years to help improve the
remaining poor-quality estates by speeding
their transfer to housing associations and other
new landlords.
There are a number of estates in poorer
condition which would benefit from the
391
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
investment that transfer to a social landlord
(see p. 389) can bring, but which are unable to
attract funding for a transfer because of low or
negative revenue valuations (generally where
the cost of upkeep over the next 30 years will
be more than the rental income). The Estates
Renewal Challenge Fund was set up by the
Government in 1995 to provide an injection of
money to facilitate transfers where they would
not have been viable otherwise and where such
support represents good value for money in
the long term. In the first round, 11 local
authorities received a total of £174 million. It
is expected that this will generate over £250
million of private investment for the
transferred homes.
On six estates, tenants have voted for
housing action trusts to take over their housing
from the local authority; the aim is to provide
new solutions to the physical, social, economic
and environmental problems of the areas.
In Wales, Estate Partnership funding is
available to tackle the problems of selected
estates; £10.6 million of central government
support has been allocated for this in 1996—97
to supplement local authority and private
sector contributions.
In Scotland, the Government’s approach to
urban regeneration is based on the partnership
approach. In the urban Partnerships in parts of
Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley (see
p. 380), more than 2,000 new houses have been
built and another 5,500 refurbished. More
choice of housing type and tenure is now
available, and home ownership has been
increased.
The Government has recently legislated in
the Housing, Grants, Construction and
Regeneration Act 1996 to reform the
renovation grant system in order to give local
authorities greater discretion in deciding
applications for renovation grant. The aim is to
enable local authorities to target more
resources towards:
• renewal areas declared by the local
authority;
• improving the housing conditions of
vulnerable people; and
• supporting community care policies (see
Ch. 25) and enabling elderly, ill or disabled
people to continue to live independently.
In Scotland, local authorities award grants
for improvement and repair. Scottish Homes
also has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
private house renewal. In Northern Ireland,
grants are allocated on a similar basis to that in
England and Wales through the house
renovation grants scheme, administered by the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive. In
isolated rural areas, a grant to replace dwellings
which cannot be restored is also available
through this scheme.
Homelessness
Local authorities have a legal duty to secure
accommodation for households which are
eligible for assistance and which they
accept are unintentionally homeless and in
priority need. The latter category includes
Private Housing
The Government offers help through house
renovation grants to owners of private housing
who are on low incomes and unable to afford
necessary repairs and improvements. Specific
help is available to disabled people needing
adaptations to their homes. Since 1990, house
renovation grants, disabled facilities grants,
and minor works assistance grants have
provided up to 100 per cent support for
essential repairs and improvements to the
poorest homeowners. In all 460,000 grants
were made in England between 1991-92 and
1995-96, totalling almost £2,200 million.

HOUSING
pregnant women, people with dependent
children, and those who are vulnerable
because of old age, mental or physical
handicap or other special reasons. Visitors to
Britain, and certain other groups of people
who require leave to enter the country, are
not eligible for homelessness assistance or to
be allocated council housing. The number of
households accepted as homeless has fallen
since 1991 in England (see Table 24.1) and
since 1993 in Wales.
Provisions in the Housing Act 1996,
which will come into force in January 1997,
will reform the law on homelessness and the
allocation of council housing. This will
ensure fairer access to long-term social
housing by creating a single route to such
accommodation—the local authority housing
register—while ensuring a safety net for
families and vulnerable people who lose their
home through no fault of their own. In
Scotland, where the number of homeless
households continued to rise until 1993-94,
the policy on homelessness is under review
following consultations in 1994. In Northern
Ireland, where the number of households
accepted as homeless has remained stable
since the homelessness legislation was
extended there in 1989, consideration
is being given to the most appropriate
way to effect the reforms provided for in the
Act.
Most people accepted as homeless have
some form of accommodation, even though
this may be temporary, overcrowded or
otherwise unsatisfactory. Those entitled to
rehousing are found accommodation by local
authorities. Only a small proportion of the
homeless are ‘roofless’—that is, literally
without accommodation.
In 1990 the Government established the
Rough Sleepers Initiative to tackle the
problem in central London, with resources of
£182 million in its first six years. This
provided about 950 new places in short-term
hostels and at least 3,300 permanent and 700
leased places in ‘move-on’ accommodation
for hostel dwellers. A voluntary sector count,
held in May 1996, found that 288 people
were sleeping rough in central London,
compared with estimates of over 1,000 before
the Rough Sleepers Initiative began (see
Table 24.2).
The third phase of the Initiative was
announced in March 1996, involving the
provision of:
• at least 250 new permanent homes;
• up to 200 new beds in basic hostel
accommodation;
• up to 40 beds in permanent high-care
accommodation; and
• up to 30 beds in a new ‘wet’ hostel for
people sleeping rough who have drink
problems.
The Initiative was also extended to Bristol
(see panel), and the extent of the problem in 23
other areas in England is being evaluated.
Details of help for rough sleepers in
Bristol were announced in June 1996.
The £7.5 million package includes at
least 150 new permanent homes, 24
beds in permanent high-care
accommodation for mentally ill
people, and the employment of
additional resettlement workers to
help people adjust to life in new
accommodation.
Since 1990 more than £23 million has been
spent by the Department of Health on the
Homeless Mentally 111 Initiative, a programme
to supply accommodation and psychiatric care
for mentally ill people who have been sleeping

rough in central London. The Department has
a long-term commitment to help with the
running costs of the accommodation. It also
funds health care projects designed to ensure
that homeless people have access to health
services. The Government announced in
March 1996 that the amount spent each year
by the Department of Health on the Initiative
would be almost doubled to £4.2 million.
From 1996-97 it is being expended in tandem
with the Rough Sleepers Initiative in London
and to Bristol.
The Government is giving £7.8 million in
1996-97 to voluntary groups helping single
homeless people in England. Grants of over
£400,000 for 1996-97 have been made to
voluntary organisations tackling
homelessness in Scotland, £523,000 in Wales
and £335,000 in Northern Ireland. Research
is being carried out into rooflessness in
Scotland to inform future policy, and this
was expected to be published by the end of
1996.

Housing Advice
As well as housing associations, other
voluntary sector bodies have a role to play in
housing matters. Such groups undertake a
number of roles, for example advising people
about their rights under housing law or
encouraging energy efficiency in the home.
The Government allocates grants to assist the
work of such bodies. In England the largest
project currently funded is the Homelessness
Advice Service, with £1.8 million in 1996—97;
in Scotland aid of over £1 million in 1996-97
is being given to about 20 voluntary bodies for
work on homelessness and other housing
matters. In Northern Ireland, the government
is providing about £200,000 in 1996—97 to the
Housing Rights Service, a voluntary
organisation which provides advice on all
aspects of housing, and £182,000 to the
Northern Ireland Tenants Action Project,
which promotes the participation of tenants in
the management of their homes.

Total spending on health and social services in 1996-97 is expected to be £41,224
million: £40,793 million on health and £431 million on social services. Key
elements of the Government’s spending plans include: continued expansion of
primary care (family health services); improvements in the mental health
services; research and development; and education and training in the National
Health Service.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services which are
available to all residents, regardless of their
income. Local authority personal social
services and voluntary organisations provide
help and advice to the most vulnerable
members of the community. These include
elderly, physically disabled and mentally ill
people, those with learning disabilities (mental
handicap) and children in need of care.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, which is administered by a range
of local health authorities and health boards
throughout Britain. Personal social services are
administered by local authorities but central
government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and
overseeing standards. Joint finance and
planning between health and local authorities
aims to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community
services.
Spending on the health service has
increased substantially in real terms since
1980, reflecting the priority given to this
sector, and it is planned to grow further over
the next two years. More patients are being
treated than ever before.
The Health Programme is funded mainly
by central government and consists of:
• Hospital and Community Health Services
(HCHS), providing all hospital care and a
range of community services;
• Family Health Services (FHS), providing
general medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and some ophthalmic services, and
covering the cost of medicines prescribed
by general practitioners (GPs);
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS), providing services
most effectively administered centrally,
such as welfare food (which includes free
397
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
milk and vitamins to families with
children under five, and pregnant women,
on Income Support) and support to the
voluntary sector; and
• the administrative costs of the health
departments.
The Government has targeted four priority
areas in allocating funds to the health
authorities in England for 1996-97. These are:
primary care; research and development;
education and training in the NHS; and
mental health services.
The Personal Social Services programme
consists largely of spending by local
authorities. The programme is financed in part
by central government but most local authority
personal social services revenue spending
depends on decisions by individual local
authorities on how to spend the resources
available to them.
Major Policy Developments
Reforms in Management
The NHS and Community Care Act 1990
introduced wide-ranging reform in
management and patient care in the health and
social care services. The NHS reforms, which
came into effect in 1991, aim to give patients,
wherever they live in Britain, better health care
and greater choice of service:
1. Health authorities and health boards have
been given a new role as purchasers of health
care for their local residents, and are
responsible for assessing local health care
needs and ensuring the availability of a full
range of services to meet identified health
needs. They ensure that those needs are met
within existing resources.
2. Each health authority/health board is
funded to buy health care for its local residents
through arranging contracts with hospitals and
other health service units in either the public or
the private sector. Hospitals are now directly
funded for the number of patients they treat.
3. The contracts agreed between health
authorities/health boards, GP fundholders
(see below), and hospitals set out the quality,
quantity and cost of the services to be
delivered during the year. The contracts
secured by each health authority are based on
wide consultation with all local GPs.
4. Hospitals may apply to become
self-governing NHS Trusts (see p. 408),
independent of local health authority control
but remaining within the NHS. They are
accountable to the relevant health department,
and are funded largely through general
taxation, under contracts with health
authorities. NHS Trusts provide the services
that health authorities/health boards and GP
fundholders (see below) wish to buy.
5. GPs from larger medical practices may
apply to join the general practitioner
fundholding scheme (see p. 406), under
which they receive an annual budget directly
from the health authority/health board,
enabling them to buy certain hospital services
for their patients.
The reforms in community care provision,
which came into force between 1991 and 1993,
establish a new financial and managerial
framework which aims to secure the delivery of
good quality services in line with national
objectives. They are intended to enable
vulnerable groups in the community to live as
independently as possible in their own homes
for as long as they are able and wish to do so,
and to give them a greater say in how they live
and how the services they need should be
provided. (For fuller details see p. 422.)
Broadly similar changes were introduced
under separate legislation in Northern Ireland,
where health and personal social services are
provided on an integrated basis by health and
social services boards.
Patient’s Charters
Patient’s Charters are part of the health
departments’ response to the Government’s
Citizen’s Charter programme (see p. 69). The
Charters support the objectives of the NHS
reforms: to improve standards of health care
and sensitivity to patients in the NHS. They
set out for the first time the rights of patients
and the standards of service they can expect to
receive from the NHS. The responsibility for
implementing the Patient’s Charters rests with
all parts of the NHS, English regional offices
(see p. 402), purchasers and providers of
services (see above).
398
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
The original Patient’s Charter in England
came into force in 1992. An expanded and
updated Patient’s Charter was issued in 1995,
covering dental, optical and pharmaceutical
services and the hospital environment,
including cleanliness and security.
In England the Patient’s Charter also sets
national charter standards, which are not
legal rights but specific standards of service
that the NHS aims to provide. These cover
respect for the individual patient; waiting
times for ambulances, clinical assessment in
accident and emergency departments and
appointments in out-patient clinics; and
cancellation of operations. Also included are
local charter standards of service which
health authorities aim to provide (see
below).
Separate but similar Patient’s Charters have
been developed for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
In England a maternity services charter,
describing key standards and rights, was
published in 1994, a blood donor’s charter was
issued in 1995, and a patient’s charter for
children and young people was issued in
March 1996. The last mentioned covers
hospital and community services and sets out
the services available to healthy children, and
the health checks available for babies and
pre-school aged children.
All health authorities in England and health
boards and NHS Trusts in Scotland have
produced local charters, which include
statements of the standards of service patients
can expect to receive from them. Staff in GP
practices are being encouraged to produce
their own practice charters, setting out the
standards of service they offer their patients.
By September 1995, 80 per cent of GP
practices in England had, or were developing,
charters.
Openness in the NHS
The Code of Practice on Openness in the NHS
came into force in 1995. Designed to make
NHS organisations more accountable and
provide greater public access to information,
the Code applies to NHS Trusts, health
authorities and local health practitioners such
as GPs, dentists and pharmacists. It sets out
the information that NHS Trusts and health
authorities/health boards should publish or
otherwise make available.
The NHS Code of Practice on Openness
contains, among other things:
• information about what services are
provided, the targets and standards set
and results achieved, and the costs and
effectiveness of the service;
• details of important proposals on health
policies or proposed changes in the way
the services are delivered; and
• information about how people can have
access to their own personal health
records.
A Code of Practice on Openness in the
Health and Personal Social Services is being
developed for Northern Ireland.
Developing Health Strategies
The Government emphasises the importance
of promoting health as well as treating illness.
Preventive health services such as health
education, and the responsibility that
individuals have for their own health, play a
major part in this. While great progress has
been made in eliminating infectious diseases
such as poliomyelitis, there is still scope for
greater success in controlling the major causes
of early death and disability.
The White Paper The Health of the Nation,
published in 1992, sets out a strategy for
improving health in England; its long-term
aim is to enable people to live longer, healthier
lives. It set targets for improvements in the
following areas:
• coronary heart disease and stroke (the
major causes of premature death in
England);
• cancers (now the biggest cause of death
across all ages);
• accidents (the commonest cause of death
in those under 30);
• mental illness (a leading cause of ill-health
and also a cause of many suicides); and
• HIV/AIDS and sexual health (there is
399
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
much scope for reducing sexually
transmitted diseases and unwanted
pregnancies, especially among teenagers).
Targets were set for:
• reducing death rates (for example, from
coronary heart disease and stroke in those
under 65 by at least 40 per cent by the
year 2000);
• reducing ill-health (such as the incidence
of invasive cervical cancer by at least 20
per cent by 2000); and
• reducing risk behaviour (for example, the
percentage of smokers to no more than 20
per cent of the population by 2000).
In most areas there has been steady
progress towards the targets but in a few cases,
such as teenage smoking, obesity and lung
cancer deaths among women under 75, figures
are on the increase. While the NHS has a
central role in working towards the targets, the
strategy also emphasises that there is a role for
everyone in improving the nation’s health.
Strategies have also been developed for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which
reflect the health variations in the different
parts of Britain. In Wales, where the first of
Britain’s four national health strategies was
published in 1990, areas for improvement
include, among others: cancers, cardiovascular
disease, maternal and early child health,
physical disability, mental handicap and
mental health, and injuries. Scotland’s national
strategy, first issued in 1991, places special
emphasis on coronary heart disease, cancer,
HIV/AIDS, accidents, dental and oral health,
smoking, alcohol and drug misuse. Northern
Ireland’s strategy, also published in 1991, sets
targets for improvements in a number of key
areas, which include circulatory diseases,
cancers, respiratory diseases, child and
maternal health, and mental health. (For
publication details of all these, see Further
Reading.)
National activity in England includes, for
example, interdepartmental taskforces on
accident prevention, smoking, the workplace
and physical activity, work with professional
and voluntary bodies, and the provision of
guidance setting out a range of possible actions
for each tier of the NHS. At local level, the
NHS is being encouraged to form ‘healthy
alliances’ with agencies ranging from the
voluntary sector through to industry and the
media. Progress towards the targets is
monitored regularly and formally reviewed,
and periodic progress reports are published.
Similar initiatives are being taken in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Government is working closely with
the World Health Organisation (WHO) in
presenting The Health of the Nation as one
possible approach for other countries wishing
to develop a strategic approach to improving
health.
The Government is to commission an
independent interim review of The Health of
the Nation strategy. A report is expected in
early 1998.
The National Health Service
The NHS is based upon the principle that
there should be a full range of publicly
provided services designed to help the
individual stay healthy. The services are
intended to provide effective and appropriate
treatment and care where necessary while
making the best use of available resources. All
taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to its cost so that those members
of the community who do not require health
care help to pay for those who do. Some
forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free; others (see p. 402) may be
charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health service
is being used to meet the needs of increasing
numbers of elderly people and to take full
advantage of advances in medical technology. It
is also used to provide more appropriate types of
care, often in the community rather than in
hospital, for priority groups such as elderly and
mentally ill people and those with learning
disabilities. Increased spending has, in addition,
been allocated to combat the growing problems
arising from alcohol and drug misuse; and to
remedy disparities in provision between the
regions of Britain.
In 1995 the Government announced six
national priorities for the NHS in England
over the next three to six years. These are:
400
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
• further developing a primary care-led
NHS;
• securing a comprehensive range of secure,
residential, in-patient and community
services for people with mental illness;
• improved cost-effectiveness;
• giving greater voice to the users of
services, and their carers;
• securing better services to meet the
continuing health care needs of elderly,
disabled or vulnerable people; and
• developing NHS organisations as good
employers.
Similar priorities have been identified in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Voluntary Sector
Government grant aid to voluntary organisations
working in health and personal social services in
England (£50 million in 1995-96) goes primarily
to national organisations dealing with children,
elderly people, carers and people from ethnic
minorities, as well as those looking after people
with mental illness, physical or learning
disabilities, or suffering from the effects of
HIV/AIDS or the misuse of alcohol or drugs. In
Scotland central government grants to voluntary
organisations in social welfare amount, in
1996-97, to almost £9 million. In Northern
Ireland the Department of Health and Social
Services plans to spend £6.4 million in support
of a wide range of voluntary activity during
1996-97.
Health authorities and boards and local
authorities have similar powers to make grants
to local organisations.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Health in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible
for all aspects of the health services in their
respective territories. The Department of
Health is responsible for national strategic
planning in England. Within the Department
of Health the NHS Executive is responsible
for developing and implementing policies for
the provision of high quality health services.
The Scottish Office Department of Health, the
Welsh Office and the Department of Health
and Social Services in Northern Ireland have
similar responsibilities.

'The Citizens Advice Bureaux introduced a new recording system in 1994. This now records problems rather than enquiries; a single
problem may involve more than one enquiry. The figure for 1994 is 7.1 million problems.
401
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Health authorities in England and Wales
(see below) and health boards in Scotland are
responsible for securing hospital and
community health services in their areas. They
also arrange for the provision of services by
doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticians, as
well as administering their contracts. The
health authorities and boards co-operate
closely with local authorities responsible for
social work, environmental health, education
and other services. There are community
health councils (local health councils in
Scotland) for each district, representing local
opinion on the health services provided.
In Northern Ireland health and social
services boards are responsible as agents of the
Department of Health and Social Services for
assessing the health and social care needs of
their resident populations. The representation
of public opinion on these services is provided
for by area health and social services councils.
Recent Changes in England and Wales
In April 1996 further changes to streamline the
administrative structure of the NHS in
England and Wales were fully implemented:
• the former district health authorities and
family health services authorities were
replaced by new single all-purpose health
authorities. The new authorities are
responsible for the whole range of health
issues and health services for the areas they
serve. Their role is to assess the needs of
their population, draw up strategies with
local GPs, hospitals, community health
services, local authorities and local people,
and buy services to meet those needs. The
boundaries of the new health authorities,
which largely reflect previous district health
authority boundaries, have populations of
between 125,000 and 1 million; and
• the 14 former regional health authorities
in England, previously responsible for
planning, resource allocation, major
capital building work and certain
specialised hospital services, were
abolished and replaced with eight regional
offices of the NHS Executive, keeping
more of a distance from day-to-day
operational matters.
These changes build on the 1990 NHS
reforms (see p. 398) and continue the
devolution of responsibilities and
decision-making in the NHS to local level. By
1997-98, when the new structure is fully
implemented, savings will rise to nearly £150
million a year, and will be retained by the
NHS and reinvested in patient care.
Finance
About 82 per cent of the cost of the health
service in Great Britain is paid for through
general taxation. The rest is met from:
• the NHS element of National Insurance
contributions (see p. 431), paid by
employed people, their employers, and
self-employed people (12.1 per cent);
• charges towards the cost of certain items
such as drugs prescribed by family
doctors, and general dental treatment (2.3
per cent); and
• other receipts, including land sales and the
proceeds of income generation schemes
(0.9 per cent).
Health authorities may raise funds from
voluntary sources. Certain hospitals increase
revenue by taking private patients, who pay
the full cost of their accommodation and
treatment.
In 1996-97 an estimated 85 per cent of
medical prescription items are being supplied
free. Prescription charges are not paid by:
• children under 16 years (or young people
under 19 who are in full-time education);
• pregnant women and women who have
had a baby in the past year;
• people aged 60 and over;
• patients with certain medical conditions;
• war and armed forces disablement
pensioners (for prescriptions which relate
to the disability for which they receive a
war pension); and
• people in families who are receiving
Income Support, income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance or Disability
Working Allowance (see Ch. 26); and
people or families with low incomes.

In 1995 nearly 473 million prescriptions
were dispensed in England, almost 20
per cent more than in 1985. The cost of
dispensing prescriptions was £3,681
million—an increase of 17 per cent in
real terms over 1985.
There are proportional charges for most
types of NHS dental treatment, including
examinations. However, women who begin a
course of treatment while pregnant or within
12 months of having a baby, children up to 18,
students under 19, those who receive, or whose
partners receive, Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Income Support or Disability Working
Allowance are entitled to free treatment.
Others on low incomes may be entitled to free
treatment or to help with charges.
Sight tests are free to children, full-time
students under the age of 19, people in families
receiving Income Support, income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance or Disability Working
Allowance and those with specified medical
needs. A voucher to help with the cost of
spectacles is also available for children,
full-time students under the age of 19, people
receiving the above benefits and those
requiring certain complex lenses. Other people
on low incomes may apply for help under the
NHS Low Income Scheme.
Hospital staff are salaried and may be
employed full-time or part-time. Family
practitioners (doctors, dentists, optometrists
and community pharmacists) are
self-employed or, in the case of pharmacists,
employed by a pharmacy company, and have
contracts with the NHS. GPs are paid by a
system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. Dentists providing treatment in
their own surgeries are paid by a combination
of capitation fees for treating children,
continuing care payments for adults registered
with the practice, and a prescribed scale of fees
for individual treatments. Community
pharmacists dispense from their own or their
company’s premises and are refunded the cost
of the items supplied, together with
professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
part in the general ophthalmic service receive
approved fees for each sight test carried out.
Private Finance Initiative
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was
launched in 1992 to promote partnership
between the public and private sectors on a
commercial basis (see p. 162). In the health
service it involves the use of private finance in
NHS capital projects for the design,
construction and operation of buildings and
support services. Since 1992 over 50 NHS
schemes in England alone have been approved,
with a total capital value of £500 million. Plans
are in progress for a further 40 major schemes,
costing over £1,500 million, for a new
generation of NHS hospitals designed, built
and maintained by the private sector.
Schemes already announced include a £50
million project which will provide a new
paediatric wing, a private unit, and a medical
science park for research and biotechnology at
St James’s University Hospital NHS Trust in
Leeds, and a new £170 million district general
hospital for the Norfolk and Norwich NHS
Trust. PFI schemes must have the full support
of local health authorities (see p. 402) and
other purchasers of clinical services.
The Government considers that the Private
Finance Initiative reinforces the principle of
health care based on clinical need without
regard to the ability to pay, delivering a
modern and efficient service, while freeing the
NHS to make clinical decisions for patients.
Staffing
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly 1 million
people. Staff costs account for approximately
64 per cent of current spending on hospitals
and community health services. Between 1984
and 1994:
• the number of hospital medical and dental
staff in Great Britain rose by 20 per cent
to 65,000, while the number of hospital
medical consultants grew by 28 per cent to
20,400.
• The number of professional and technical
staff in England rose by 27.7 per cent to
92,800.
• The number of nursing and midwifery
staff, who make up 46 per cent of the
NHS workforce in England, decreased by
11 per cent to 353,100. This reflects the
growth in bursaried students under the
Project 2000 nurse training scheme—see
p. 420. (Project 2000 trainees have full
student status and are not NHS
employees.) The change masks an
underlying trend of an increase of 5 per
cent in the number of qualified nursing
and midwifery staff since 1984.
• The number of general and senior
managers has risen in recent years; this
reflects the progressive introduction of
management posts in a series of phased
stages since 1986. In England general and
senior managers numbered 23,000 in
1994, accounting for 3 per cent of the total
NHS workforce and 4.4 per cent of total
NHS spending on salaries and wages; in
Scotland general and senior managers
numbered 1,720 in 1994, just over 1.5 per
cent of the total workforce.
• The sharp falls in the numbers of directly
employed ancillary staff and of
maintenance and works staff reflect the
continuing effect of competitive tendering
(see p. 78). Many of these jobs are now
carried out by the private sector.
The Government’s aim throughout the
service is progressively to introduce greater
pay flexibility to allow managers to relate pay
to local markets and reward individual
performance. A number of measures are being
taken to provide a more effective workforce
through better management development,
education and training (see p. 419).
Health Service Commissioners
Health Service Commissioners (one each for
England, Scotland and Wales) are responsible
for dealing with complaints from members of
the public about health service bodies. The
three posts are at present held by one person
(with a staff of 80), who is also Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration
(Ombudsman—see p. 63). As Health Service
Commissioner, he reports annually to
Parliament. In Northern Ireland the
404
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Commissioner for Complaints has a similar
role.
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered injustice or hardship as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by a health
service body;
• a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive; or
• maladministration by an NHS
authority—that is, something that the
NHS authority failed to do or did in the
wrong way.
Complaints must be sent to the
Ombudsman in writing, and the health service
body concerned should first have been given a
reasonable opportunity to respond.
New NHS Complaints System
Legislation passed in April 1996 extends the
Health Service Ombudsman’s jurisdiction to
include complaints against all family health
service practitioners and their staff, and about
the exercise of clinical judgment.
Following an independent review of
NHS complaints procedures, the
Government introduced a new
complaints system in Britain in April
1996. Under this, complaints about
all NHS-funded services are dealt
with in a similar fashion at two
distinct levels. The new procedures
aim to resolve complaints speedily at
a local level, where complainants are
dissatisfied with the response at local
level, a new system of review by an
independent panel is an option.
Patients can refer complaints to the Health
Service Ombudsman if they are dissatisfied
with the response from the NHS.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The family health services are those given to
patients by doctors (GPs), dentists, opticians
and pharmacists of their own choice. They
remain the first point of contact most people
have with the NHS. Every year there are about
250 million consultations with GPs and about
6 million people visit a pharmacy every day.
Often those who visit their GP or dentist need
no clinical treatment but healthy lifestyle
counselling and preventive health care advice
instead. The Government’s longstanding
policy has been to build up and extend these
services in order to improve health and relieve
pressure on the far more costly secondary care
sector (that is, hospital and specialist services).
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case of
illness, give advice and may prescribe a suitable
course of treatment or refer a patient to the more
specialised services and hospital consultants.
About four-fifths of GPs in Britain work in
partnerships or group practices. Primary
health-care teams also include health visitors and
district nurses, midwives, and sometimes social
workers and other professional staff employed
by the health authorities. Most GPs in Great
Britain and about 50 per cent in Northern
Ireland work in health centres. As well as
providing medical and nursing services, health
centres may also have facilities for health
education, family planning, speech therapy,
chiropody, assessment of hearing, physiotherapy
and remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical
and ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient
and supporting social work services may also be
provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary health care staff in recent years. For
example, between 1985 and 1995 the number
of GPs in England increased by 11.1 per cent
(to over 26,500); and average patient list size
fell by 8.8 per cent (to just under 1,900). The
wholetime equivalent number of GP practice
nurses increased fourfold—to 9,100—and the
number of opticians increased by over 14.9 per
cent (to 6,778).
Special funds have been earmarked by the
Government for improving the quality of
primary health care in some inner city areas.
Ethnic Minority Health
Efforts have also been made to improve health
services for ethnic minority communities. The
NHS Ethnic Health Unit was set up in 1994
for three years to work with health authorities,
405
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
NHS Trusts and GPs to ensure that people
from different ethnic backgrounds derive full
benefit from the Health of the Nation strategy
(see p. 399), local health purchasing policies,
the Patient’s Charter (see p. 398), the Care in
the Community initiatives and the developing
role of primary care. The Unit has achieved
this through a number of initiatives and
project funding, which aim to give local people
a greater say in shaping health services over the
three years. Funding of over £2.5 million has
supported local initiatives, including those in
primary health care, in more than half of the
health authorities in England.
Recent Developments
GP Fundholders
In England and Northern Ireland GP practices
with 5,000 patients or more may apply for
fundholding status. The corresponding figure
in Wales and Scotland is 4,000. This is a
voluntary scheme which gives larger medical
practices the opportunity to manage NHS
money for the benefit of their patients. It aims
to improve services for patients and enable
GPs to explore more innovative methods of
providing health care. GP fundholders are
responsible for part of their own NHS
budgets, enabling them to buy certain
non-urgent hospital services. NHS costs of
prescription charges and part of the cost of
running the practice are also covered.
Fundholders may negotiate for services
directly with hospitals from both public and
private sectors in any health authority or
health board in Britain. GP fundholders may
buy NHS community nursing services for
their patients, including district nursing and
health visiting services and (except in
Northern Ireland) community psychiatric and
community mental handicap nursing.
A new option—community
fundholding—has been introduced for small
practices or as a stepping stone for larger ones
who are not yet ready to become standard
fundholders. (In England only there is a
minimum list size requirement of 3,000
patients.) By April 1996 some 14,000 GPs in
almost 3,300 practices in Britain had become
fundholders, covering 47 per cent of the
population.
Contracts
The performance-related contract for GPs,
introduced in 1990, is designed to raise
standards of care, extend the range of services
available to patients and improve patient
choice. The changes are intended to make it
easier for patients to see their GP at times
convenient to them; or to change doctors; and
to encourage doctors to practise more
preventive medicine.
The contract for dentists, introduced in
1990, aims at improving care and providing
more information to patients about general
dental services. As a result NHS dental care
now includes preventive care as well as
restorative treatment. All adults and children
have a period of continuing care following
treatment. There are also incentives for
dentists to undertake further training and to
move to areas which are less well served.
Recent improvements to the contract for
NHS dentists include reinforcing the priority
given to children’s oral health by introducing
fees for individual items of treatment in
addition to the monthly capitation payment
made to dentists for each child registered.
In the longer term the Government plans to
introduce a system of local contracting by
health authorities for primary care dentistry.
This will be similar to the system operating in
other areas of the health service.
GP/Health Authority Links
Electronic links between GPs and health
authorities are replacing paper-based systems
with the interchange of electronic data. The
main benefits are: speedier processing of
claims; faster transfer of patient medical
records; reduced clerical effort; and the
elimination of the risk of losing paperwork in
transit.
Community Pharmacists
The Government has funded a number of
initiatives aimed at raising standards within
pharmacies and making fuller use of
pharmacists’ skills. These include the
development of a comprehensive programme
of continuing education and training, and a
406
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
number of audit initiatives to promote
community pharmacists’ participation in
clinical audit (see below).
Since 1992-93 additional funding has been
made available to encourage participation by
pharmacists in local needle exchange schemes
for drug misusers and in the safe disposal of
unwanted medicines. Around £1 million was
made available in 1995-96 for local projects to
examine the contribution community
pharmacists can make to improving the quality
and cost effectiveness of GP prescribing.
At the local level a large number of health
authorities have involved pharmacists in a
range of service developments. These include
participation in health promotion campaigns
and in home visits.
Midwives, Health Visitors and District
Nurses
Midwives provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal
period (up to 28 days after the baby is born).
Midwives work in both hospital and
community settings.
Under a number of pilot schemes in
England and Scotland district nurses and
health visitors are able to prescribe from a
limited list of drugs and medical appliances.
These schemes are based in GP fundholding
practices and are intended to reduce
significantly the time patients have to wait for
relief of their symptoms.
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health promotion of
families,.particularly those with young
children. They have a public health role,
identifying local health needs and working
closely with GPs, district nurses and other
professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere
outside hospital; they also play an important
role in health promotion and education.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
District general hospitals offer a broad range of
clinical specialities, supported by a range of
other services such as anaesthetics, pathology
and radiology. Almost all have facilities for the
admission of emergency patients, either
through Accident and Emergency
Departments or as direct referrals from GPs.
Treatments are provided for in-patients, day
cases, out-patients and patients who attend
wards for treatment such as dialysis. In
England some hospitals also provide specialist
services which cover more than one regional
district. These are known as supra-regional or
supra-district services covering, for example,
heart and liver transplants, and craniofacial
services and rare eye and bone cancers. (In
Scotland similar services are contracted for
centrally.) There are also specialist hospitals
such as the world-famous Hospital for Sick
Children at Great Ormond Street, Moorfields
Eye Hospital, and the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery, all in London.
These hospitals combine specialist treatment
facilities with the training of medical and other
students, and international research.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were built
in the 19th century; some trace their origins to
much earlier charitable foundations. Much has
been done to improve and extend existing
hospital buildings and many new hospitals have
been or are being opened. Recent policy has
been to provide a balanced hospital service
centred around a district general hospital,
complemented as necessary by smaller, locally
based hospitals and facilities.
The hospital service is now treating more
patients a year than ever before. In England
between 1990—91 and 1994—95 the total
number of operations rose by 29 per cent to
nearly 5.8 million, with heart bypass
operations up by 70 per cent to 22,000. Over
the same period, the number of hip operations
rose by 26 per cent to over 62,000, and eye lens
operations went up by 54 per cent to 152,000.
Waiting Times
Over the last few years there have been
substantial reductions in the number of
patients waiting more than 12 months for
in-patient or day case treatment. In March
1996:
• fewer than 5,000 patients in England had
been waiting over a year for hospital
407
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
treatment, compared with more than
200,000 in 1990. There are now very few
patients waiting more than 18 months for
treatment.
• the number of patients in Scotland
waiting over a year for hospital treatment
had fallen to fewer than 150, while nobody
had waited for over 18 months.
NHS Trusts
Under the NHS and Community Care Act
1990 hospitals and other health service units
(for example, ambulance services and
community health services) may apply to
become independent of direct local health
authority control and establish themselves as
self-governing NHS Trusts. Parallel
legislation was introduced in Northern
Ireland to create Health and Social Services
Trusts, which, because of the integrated
nature of the service there, carry a much
wider workload than their counterparts in
Great Britain. The Trusts remain within the
NHS, accountable to the appropriate
Secretary of State and finally to Parliament.
Trusts are required to publish their business
plans and annual reports and accounts, and
to hold at least one public meeting a year.
Since September 1995 all annual reports
have been required to provide information
about management costs.
Each Trust is run by a board of directors.
Trusts are free to employ their own staff
and set their own rates of pay, although
staff transferring to Trust employment
retain their existing terms and conditions
of service. Trusts are also free to carry out
research and provide facilities for medical
education and other forms of training.
They derive their income mainly from
NHS contracts to provide services to
health authorities and GP fundholders.
They may treat private patients to generate
income provided this does not interfere
with NHS obligations. By mid-1996 over
520 Trusts in Britain were delivering almost
all NHS hospital and community health
services.
Organ Transplantation
The United Kingdom Transplant Support
Service Authority provides a centralised organ
matching and allocation service. During 1995,
1,802 kidney transplants were performed. A
similar service exists for corneas and, in 1995,
2,424 were transplanted. By 1996 there were
15,000 kidney transplant patients alive in
Britain, more than in any other European
country.
Heart transplant operations have been
conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire and Harefield Hospital in
London since 1979. There are six other
designated heart transplant centres in England,
and one in Scotland. Programmes for lung and
combined heart and lung transplantation are in
progress and in 1995, 319 heart, 113 lung, and
58 heart/lung transplants were performed.
The world’s first combined heart, lungs and
liver transplant operation was carried out at
Papworth in 1987. There are six designated
liver transplant units in England and one in
Scotland. In 1995, 669 liver transplants were
performed.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their
willingness to become organ donors
in the event of their death. The NHS
Organ Donor Register, a computer
database, was launched in 1994. By
October 1996 it contained over 3.5
million names.
Commercial dealing in organs for
transplantation is illegal.
Blood Transfusion Services
Blood transfusion services are run by the
National Blood Authority in England, the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service,
the Welsh Health Common Services Agency in
Wales and the Northern Ireland Blood
Transfusion Agency. Britain is self-sufficient
in blood and blood products.
In England alone around 2.4 million
donations are given each year by voluntary
unpaid donors and separated into many
408
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
different life-saving products for patients. Red
cells, platelets and other products with a
limited ‘shelf life’ are prepared at blood
centres. The production of plasma products is
undertaken at the Bio Products Laboratory in
Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the Protein
Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national bodies
co-ordinates programmes for donor
recruitment, retention and education, and
donor sessions are organised regionally, in
towns, villages and workplaces. Donors are
normally aged between 18 (17 in Scotland) and
65. Blood centres are responsible for blood
collection, screening, processing and supplying
hospital blood banks. They also provide
wide-ranging laboratory, clinical, research,
teaching and advisory services and facilities.
These are subject to nationally co-ordinated
quality audit programmes.
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
of charge for cases of sudden illness or
collapse, for accidents and for doctors’ urgent
calls. Rapid response services, in which
paramedics use cars and motor cycles to reach
emergency cases, have been introduced in a
number of areas, particularly London and
other major cities with areas of high traffic
density. Helicopter ambulances serve many
parts of England and an integrated air
ambulance service is available throughout
Scotland.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are available free of charge to NHS patients
considered by their doctor (or dentist or
midwife) to be medically unfit to travel by
other means. The principle applied is that each
patient should be able to reach hospital in a
reasonable time and in reasonable comfort,
without detriment to his or her medical
condition. In many areas the ambulance
service organises volunteer drivers to provide a
hospital car service for non-urgent patients.
Patients in families whose heads are on
Income Support or Disability Working
Allowance automatically have their travelling
expenses to hospital reimbursed. People on
low incomes may also be eligible.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation services are available for elderly,
young, and mentally ill people, and for those
with physical or learning disabilities who need
such help to resume life in the community.
These services are offered in hospitals, centres
in the community and in people’s own homes
through co-ordinated work by a range of
professionals.
Medical services may provide free artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports,
wheelchairs, and other appliances. Following
assessment, very severely physically disabled
patients may be provided with environmental
control equipment which enables them to
operate devices such as alarm bells, radios and
televisions, telephones, and heating appliances.
Nursing equipment may be provided on loan
for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition from
hospital to their own homes. These include the
provision of equipment; help with cleaning,
shopping and cooking; care from domestic
help workers; and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers.
Voluntary organisations also provide services,
complementing the work of the statutory
agencies and widening the range of services.
Hospices
A number of hospices provide care for
terminally ill people (including children),
either directly in in-patient or day-care units
or through nursing and other assistance in the
patient’s own home. Control of symptoms and
psychological support for patients and their
families form central features of the modern
hospice movement, which started in Britain in
1967 and is now worldwide. Some hospices are
administered entirely by the NHS; the rest are
run by independent charities, some receiving
support from public funds. The number of
voluntary hospices has more than doubled in
the past ten years. There are 183 hospices in
England and Wales, providing over 2,710 beds;
in Scotland 12 independent voluntary hospices
provide 173 beds; and in Northern Ireland
there are 4 independent hospices providing 63
beds.
409
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The National Council for Hospice and
Specialist Palliative Care Services covers
England, Wales and Northern Ireland; its
Scottish counterpart is the Scottish
Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer
Care.
Private Medical Treatment
The Government’s policy is to welcome
cost-effective co-operation between the NHS
and the independent sector in meeting the
nation’s health needs. It believes that this will
benefit the NHS by adding to the resources
devoted to health care and offering flexibility
to health authorities in the delivery of services.
Some health authorities share expensive
facilities and equipment with private hospitals,
and NHS patients are sometimes treated (at
public expense) in the private sector to reduce
waiting lists. The scale of private practice in
relation to the NHS is, however, very small.
An estimated three-quarters of those
receiving acute treatment in private hospitals
or NHS hospital pay-beds are covered by
health insurance schemes, which make
provision for private health care in return for
annual subscriptions. Over 3 million people
subscribe to such schemes, half of them within
group schemes, some arranged by firms on
behalf of employees. Subscriptions often cover
more than one person (for example, members
of a family); about 12 per cent of the
population in Britain is covered by private
medical insurance. A survey carried out in
1994 showed that 36 per cent of households
with an annual gross income of £26,000 or
more had private medical insurance, compared
with only 3 per cent of those with an annual
gross income of less than £8,000. Those on
higher incomes were also more likely to have
the majority of the costs of their private
medical insurance met by their employer.
Tax relief on private health insurance
premiums paid by people aged 60 and over is
designed to allow people of retirement age to
retain their insurance at a time when
premiums increase and their incomes decrease.
Provisional figures for 1995-96 show that
approximately 550,000 people aged over 60
received this tax relief at the cost of £110
million.
Many overseas patients come to Britain for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics, and
Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided under
the NHS to safeguard the health of pregnant
women and of mothers with young children.
Services include free dental treatment; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 416).
Since 1994 government policy has been to
offer women more choice in maternity care
provision and to move towards greater
community-based care. A woman is entitled to
care throughout her pregnancy, the birth and
the postnatal period. Care may be provided by
a midwife, a community-based GP, a
hospital-based obstetrician, or a combination
of these. The birth may take place in a hospital
maternity unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at
home. After the birth, a midwife will visit until
the baby is at least ten days old and after that a
health visitor’s services are available.
Throughout her pregnancy and for the first
year of her baby’s life, a women is entitled to
free prescriptions and dental care.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health authorities, and increasingly by GPs.
This enables doctors, dentists and health
visitors to oversee the physical and mental
health and development of pre-school
children. Information on preventive services is
given and in some clinics welfare foods are
distributed. The school health service offers
health care and advice for schoolchildren,
including medical and dental inspection and
treatment where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems.
In recent years special efforts have been
made to improve co-operation between the
community-based child health services and
local authority social services for children.
This is particularly important in the
410
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
prevention of child abuse and for the health
and welfare of children in care (see p. 427).
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
Britain in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
The social, ethical and legal implications were
examined by a committee of inquiry under
Baroness Warnock (1984) and led eventually to
the passage of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990, one of the most
comprehensive pieces of legislation on assisted
reproduction and embryo research in the
world.
This Act set up the Human Fertilisation
and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to license
and control centres providing certain infertility
treatments, undertaking human embryo
research or storing gametes or embryos. The
HFEA maintains a code of practice giving
guidance about licensed centres, and reports
annually to Parliament.
Legislation was passed in 1996 to extend
from 5 to 10 years the storage period for
human embryos. The use of fetal ovarian
tissue in fertility treatment was banned in
1994. Commercial surrogacy agencies and
advertising of, or for, surrogacy services are
also prohibited.
Family Planning
Free family planning advice and treatment is
available from GPs or from family planning
clinics. Clinics are also able to provide
condoms free of charge. The Health of the
Nation White Paper contains the objective of
ensuring the provision of effective family
planning services for those who want them.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a
time limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest
category of abortion—risk to the physical or
mental health of the pregnant woman—and
also abortion for similar risk to any existing
children of her family. There are three
categories in which no time limit applies: to
prevent grave permanent injury to the physical
or mental health of the woman; where there is
a substantial risk of serious fetal handicap; or
where continuing the pregnancy would involve
a risk to the life of the pregnant woman greater
than if the pregnancy were terminated. The
Act does not apply in Northern Ireland.
In 1994:
• the number of legal abortions in England
and Wales fell by 1.1 per cent to 166,876
compared with 168,714 in .1993—the
fourth successive annual decrease;
• just over 4 million abortions were carried
out in England and Wales between the
introduction of the Abortion Act in 1968
and the end of 1994, of which 83 per cent
were carried out on resident women;
• nearly 89 per cent of abortions on resident
women were performed at less than 13
weeks gestation, compared with 75 per
cent in 1971.
Drug Misuse
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem, and the Government has made
the fight against such misuse a major priority.
(See p. 86 for details of the Government’s
comprehensive drugs strategy for 1995-98).
Research on various aspects of drug misuse
is funded by several government departments.
The Government is advised on matters
relating to drug misuse and connected social
problems by the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs (in Scotland the Scottish
Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse).
Prevention
The Government has run national mass media
publicity campaigns since 1985 to persuade
young people not to take drugs, and to advise
parents, teachers and other professionals on
how to recognise and combat the problem.
Since 1991-92 the focus has changed to give
greater emphasis to locally-based campaigns
and includes work on solvent misuse. In late
411
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1995 the Department of Health launched a £5
million-a-year publicity campaign, to run for
three years. This aims to increase public
awareness of the risks of drug taking.
The Home Office Drugs Prevention
Initiative provides funding for local drugs
prevention teams in 12 areas in England. The
teams aim to strengthen community resistance
to drug misuse by supporting a wide range of
drugs prevention activities. Since the Initiative
began in 1990 some 1,800 projects have been
supported. The 1996-97 budget for the
Initiative is £5.9 million and funding will
continue until March 1999. The main
objective will be to assess the outcomes of the
various community-based approaches to drugs
prevention.
The Government makes funds available
through local education authorities in England
and Wales to provide in-service training for
teachers involved in drug-prevention work in
schools. As part of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales (see p. 451), children in
primary and secondary schools receive
education on the dangers of drug misuse. A
circular on drug prevention and schools,
containing guidance to help schools provide
effective drug education programmes, was
launched in 1995.
Separate measures have been introduced in
Scotland to discourage drug misuse through
publicity campaigns and action in the
education service and the community. Some
£1 million has been made available to the
Scotland Against Drugs Campaign, launched
in May 1996. This aims to attract support at a
local level in tackling the drugs misuse
problem in Scotland.
National Drugs Helpline
A national drugs and solvents telephone
helpline provides a 24-hour free confidential
advice, counselling and information service
throughout Britain to anyone concerned about
the health implications of drugs or solvent
misuse.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
Treatment for drug dependence includes:
residential detoxification and rehabilitation;
community drug dependency services; needle
and syringe exchange schemes to combat the
spread of HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne
infections; advice and counselling; and
after-care and support services. Facilities are
provided by both statutory and independent
agencies.
A task force set up to review the
effectiveness of treatment services for drug
misusers in England reported in May 1996. It
recommended that:
• services which are a first point of contact
for drug misusers should offer basic health
checks;
• the process of ‘shared care’ with
appropriate support for GPs should be
made available as widely as possible;
• steps should be taken to ensure drug
misusers who inject or are at risk of
injecting have better access to Hepatitis B
vaccinations; and
• counselling and support services should
be recognised as core components of drug
treatment and not as subsidiary to other
treatments.
The total amount available to health
authorities in England for drug treatment
services in 1996—97 is over £21.5 million. An
additional £6 million is being made available to
improve services for young people and to
develop methadone programmes. In addition,
a grant is payable each year to local authorities
to enable them to support voluntary
organisations providing services to drug and
alcohol misusers. In Scotland, £24.5 million is
being made available in 1996-97 for the
support of drug misuse/ HIV/AIDS services.
An increasing number of GPs treat drug
misusers, but only a limited number of doctors
are licensed to prescribe certain controlled
drugs such as heroin and cocaine to drug
misusers. (However, any doctor may prescribe
these drugs for the treatment of organic injury
or disease, and any doctor can prescribe
methadone as a substitute drug for drug
misusers.) All doctors must notify the
authorities of any patient they consider to be
addicted to certain controlled drugs, and
guidelines on good medical practice in the
412
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
treatment of drug misuse have been issued to
doctors.
Other Services
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with, and complement, health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services,
including residential facilities, for example, are
provided by many voluntary organisations.
Support in the community is provided by the
probation service and local social services
departments (social work departments in
Scotland). In April 1996 the Government
announced grants totalling £1 million for
voluntary organisations which help drug
misusers.
Solvent Misuse
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and professionals and, where
practicable, restricting the sales of
solvent-based liquefied gas and aerosol
products to young people. National television
and press publicity campaigns, targeted at
parents, were run in 1992 and 1994.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or has
reason to believe they are to be used to induce
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law.
The Department of Health funds a
hospital-based unit in London to collect and
publish annually the mortality statistics
associated with solvent misuse. The statistics
for 1994 show the number of deaths having
fallen to 57, the lowest figure for 13 years.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90 per cent of the
adult population. It is estimated that about 7.8
million people over 16 in England and Wales
(26 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women)
drink more than the currently recommended
sensible levels and that 1.5 million people
drink at a dangerous level. An estimated 9
million working days each year are lost
through alcohol-related absence. The costs of
alcohol misuse to the NHS have been
estimated (at 1990 prices) at £149 million a
year, and the total annual cost to society at
£2,500 million.
The Government recognises the harm that
results from the misuse of alcohol; its approach is
to encourage people who wish to drink to confine
their drinking to sensible levels and to
appropriate occasions. It considers that education
about sensible drinking helps individuals to make
informed choices about their drinking. It seeks to
tackle alcohol-related problems through a
co-ordinated programme of action across
government departments, and involving health
and local authorities, the independent sector,
employers and the alcohol industry.
In reports published in 1986 and 1987 the
British medical profession advised that
sustained drinking above 21 units of alcohol a
week by men and 14 units a week by women
progressively increased the risk to health.1 The
Government incorporated this advice in the
Health of the Nation targets relating to alcohol.
However, in 1996 the government body set up
to review the sensible drinking message in the
light of the latest scientific and medical
research issued its first report, which
recommended a small increase in the present
recommended levels. The report:
• cited evidence that drinking one or two
units of alcohol a day gives a significant
health benefit in reducing the risk of
coronary heart disease for men over 40
and post-menopausal women;
• concluded that men who drink more than
3 to 4 units a day and women who drink
more than 2 to 3 units a day run an
increasingly significant risk of illness and
death from a number of conditions,
including stroke, some cancers, accidents
and hypertension.
As a result the Government is to reappraise
the place of alcohol in the Health of the Nation
strategy and is to commission a new health
'A unit is 8 grammes of pure alcohol: roughly equivalent
to half a pint of ordinary strength beer or lager, or a glass
of wine, or—in England, Scotland and Wales—a pub
measure of spirits. (In Northern Ireland a pub measure of
spirits is bigger than in the rest of Britain and is measured
as one and a half units.)
413
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
promotion campaign based on the report’s
findings.
Part of the funds of the Health Education
Authority (see p. 417) are for promoting the
sensible drinking message in England, and
equivalent bodies are similarly funded in other
parts of Britain. At a local level this requires
co-ordinated action by a wide range of
organisations with an interest in the use or
misuse of alcohol.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS include in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (GPs, community
psychiatric nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing treatment
and rehabilitation in hostels, day centres and
advisory services also play an important role.
The development of services to help
problem drinkers and their families is being
taken forward within the framework of
community care. Local authorities are required
to identify the need for alcohol misuse services
in their area, and to list the services provided
in their community care plans (see p. 422).
They are then responsible for arranging for the
needs of individuals with alcohol problems to
be assessed, and for buying an appropriate
course of care.
There is close co-operation between statutory
and voluntary organisations. In England the
voluntary agency Alcohol Concern plays a
prominent role in improving services for
problem drinkers and their families; increasing
public awareness of alcohol misuse and
harm-free drinking; and improving training for
professional and voluntary workers.
Between 1990—91 and 1997—98 a total
government contribution of £9 million is being
allocated to Alcohol Concern for improving
and extending the network of care, advisory
and counselling services. In addition, a grant of
£2.5 million is being paid to local authorities
during 1996-97 to help voluntary agencies
improve and extend provision for alcohol and
drug misusers in England. The Scottish
Council on Alcohol undertakes similar work in
Scotland, with the help of a government grant
(£ 150,000 in 1996-97). Research and surveys
on various aspects of alcohol misuse are funded
by several government departments.
Smoking
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable
cause of illness and death in Britain. It is
associated with around 110,000 premature
deaths and an estimated 50 million lost
working days each year, and costs the NHS an
estimated ^610 million a year for the treatment
of related diseases (for example, heart disease,
lung cancer and bronchitis). In Scotland alone,
for example, over 10,600 people die each year
as a result of their smoking—that is, one in six
of all deaths in Scotland. In addition, smoking
by pregnant women is associated with low
birth weight in infants. The Government’s
health education policy is supported by
voluntary agreements with the tobacco
industry (see below) aimed at reducing the
level of smoking.
The Government aims to reduce smoking
in England from the present 30 per cent of
adults to 20 per cent by the year 2000.
Smoking is also being tackled as a priority in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and
similar targets have been set.
A three-year national campaign in England,
aimed at adult smokers and costing a total of
£13.5 million a year, started in 1994. A new
three-year education campaign for teenagers
will be commissioned later in 1996. Education
on the harmful effects of smoking is included
in the National Curriculum for all pupils in
publicly maintained schools in England and
Wales. In Scotland the Health Education
Board for Scotland (see p. 417) operates a
free telephone helpline, ‘Smokeline’, which
has received over 329,500 calls since 1992 and
has been successful in helping a large number
of people to stop smoking. The Board is
spending some £588,000 on smoking
initiatives in 1996-97.
The Government also supports the work of
the voluntary organisation Action on Smoking
and Health (ASH), whose services include a
workplace services consultancy, offering advice
and help to employers in formulating
anti-smoking policies. The Government is
committed to creating a smoke-free
environment, with facilities where appropriate
for those who wish to smoke, and has
published a code of practice on smoking in
public places. Health authorities have been
414
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
asked to promote non-smoking as the normal
practice in health service buildings and to give
help and advice to people who want to give up
smoking. It is estimated that passive smoking
may cause a number of deaths through lung
cancer every year.
The Tobacco Control Alliance, founded in
1994 and supported by over 40 organisations,
calls for a concerted effort to eliminate tobacco
use in Britain, to create an environment where
children are relieved of the pressure to start
smoking, and to encourage and help smokers
to stop.
A new agreement with the tobacco industry
on the use of additives is to be introduced.
Tobacco Advertising and Promotion
Controls
All tobacco advertising is banned on television,
and cigarette advertisements are banned on
radio. Other forms of advertising and
promotion of tobacco products are regulated
by two voluntary agreements between the
Government and the tobacco industry.
• The first agreement bans tobacco
advertising in cinemas and in young
women’s magazines. It also prohibits
outdoor poster advertising within 200
metres of schools; places an upper limit
on poster advertising expenditure; and
requires the tobacco industry to remove
all permanent shopfront advertising by
the end of 1996. It also requires that
government health warnings appear on
all tobacco advertising, alerting the
consumer to the risks associated with
smoking.
• The voluntary agreement on sports
sponsorship covers levels of spending,
restrictions on sponsorship of events
chiefly for spectators under 18 years, and
controls over the siting of advertising at
televised events.
The health warnings which appear on
packets of tobacco products are governed by
law and not by voluntary agreement. Packets of
cigarettes and rolling tobacco must carry one
of the following warnings:
• Smoking kills.
• Smoking causes heart disease.
• Smoking causes fatal diseases.
• Smoking causes cancer.
• Smoking when pregnant harms your baby.
• Protect children: don’t make them breathe
your smoke.
All tobacco products must also carry the
warning ‘tobacco seriously damages health’.
AIDS
Up to the end of June 1996 a total of 12,976
cases of AIDS had been reported in Britain, of
whom 9,148 (70 per cent) had died; the total
number of recognised HIV infections was
27,088. The latest projections (published in
January 1996) show that new cases of AIDS
among homosexual and bisexual men are
expected to fall from the 1994 level, but that
new cases of AIDS from heterosexual contact
are expected to increase. Levels among
intravenous drug users are now low, but there
may be a slight increase among this group. The
total number of people with AIDS and HIV
infections at the end of each year is expected to
increase to reach more than 8,000 by the end of
1999.
Government Strategy
Key elements of the Government’s strategy
include:
• encouraging appropriate behaviour change
by increased targeting of sections of the
population at particular risk, including
homosexual and bisexual men and drug
misusers;
• sustaining and improving general public
awareness;
• continuing to make HIV testing facilities
more widely known, and encouraging
health authorities to commission
additional accessible HIV testing sites;
and
• continued funding for the voluntary
sector.
The Government’s commitment to policies
in this area is demonstrated by its inclusion of
415
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
HIV/AIDS with sexual health as one of the
five key areas in the Health of the Nation White
Paper. HIV/AIDS has also been identified as a
health priority in Scotland. A concerted
approach is being maintained, spanning
government, the NHS, local authorities and
the voluntary sector (including women’s
groups, religious communities and
organisations working with ethnic minorities).
In England NHS funding for HIV/AIDS
and drug-related services amounted to £270
million in 1996-97, and local authority funding
amounted to £13.7 million. In Scotland a
record £25 million has been made available to
health boards for HIV/AIDS and drug misuse
in 1996-97, in addition to their general
allocations for HIV/AIDS-related purposes.
Within local authority grant-aided expenditure
around £1.3 million has been identified for
AIDS-related work. Details of Britain’s
contribution to international co-operation on
AIDS are given in Chapter 9.
Voluntary Organisations
Voluntary agencies concerned with
HIV/AIDS include the Terrence Higgins
Trust, London Lighthouse, Body Positive and
the National AIDS Trust. Both London
Lighthouse and the Mildmay Mission
Hospital, in London, provide hospice care and
community support. The Government will
continue distributing grants on a yearly basis,
taking into account developing health priorities
and the ability of voluntary bodies to raise
funds from other sources for HIV/AIDS
work.
Infectious Diseases
Health authorities/health boards carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and
whooping cough. Immunisation is voluntary,
but parents are encouraged to protect their
children. The proportion of children being
vaccinated has been increasing since 1978. GPs
who achieve targets of 70 and 90 per cent
uptake of child immunisation receive special
payments.
A £20 million nationwide campaign to
immunise all children between 5-16 (5-18 in
Scotland and Northern Ireland) with measles
and rubella vaccine was launched in 1994—the
largest immunisation campaign yet mounted in
Britain.
A new immunisation, ‘Hib’, was introduced
in 1992, offering protection against invasive
haemophilus disease, a major cause of
meningitis in children under five years. As a
result, notifications of Hib infections in
England and Wales fell by 87 per cent
between October-December 1992 and
October-December 1993.
The Public Health Laboratory Service aims
to protect the population from infection
through the detection, diagnosis, surveillance,
prevention and control of communicable
diseases in England and Wales. Similar
facilities are provided in Scotland by the
Scottish Centre for Infection and
Environmental Health and, in Northern
Ireland, by some hospital laboratories.
In response to the worldwide resurgence of
TB (tuberculosis) in recent years, the
Government has set up a working group to
consider policies for TB control.
Cancer Care
Controlling cancer forms an enormous part of
the NHS’s work, consuming nearly 10 per cent
of its total budget. In 1995 the Government
outlined proposals for reorganising the
provision of cancer services in England and
Wales. It proposes care at three levels:
• primary care, with detailed discussions
between GPs and the hospital service to
clarify patterns of referral and follow-up;
• designated cancer units, which will be
created in many district hospitals and will
be large enough to support
multi-disciplinary clinical teams, with
sufficient expertise and facilities to
manage the more common cancers; and
• designated cancer centres, which will treat
less common cancers, as well as providing
more specialised treatments that are too
technically demanding, or require too
much specialised equipment to be
provided for the cancer units.
416
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
The reduction of deaths and illness from
cancer is a key area in the Government’s
Health of the Nation White Paper. The targets
set are:
• to reduce breast cancer deaths among
women invited for screening by at least 25
per cent by the year 2000;
• to reduce the incidence of invasive
cervical cancer by at least 20 per cent by
the year 2000;
• to halt the year-on-year increase in the
incidence of skin cancer by 2005; and
• to reduce the death rate for lung cancer
under the age of 75 by at least 30 per cent
in men and by at least 15 per cent in
women by 2010.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is recognised as a major health
problem in Britain. In England and Wales
some 13,000 women die from it each year and
1 in 12 women in England will develop it.
Britain was the first country in the European
Union to introduce a nationwide breast
screening programme, under which women
aged between 50 and 64 are invited for
mammography (breast X-ray) every three
years by computerised call and recall systems.
The nationwide cervical screening
programme aims to reduce death from cancer
of the cervix by inviting women aged between
20 and 64 (20 and 60 in Scotland) to take a free
smear test at least every five years. Health
authorities must ensure that the results of a
smear test are returned from the laboratory to
the patient within a month.
Special payments are made to GPs who
achieve targets of 50 and 80 per cent for the
uptake of smear tests. The Government
estimates that over 98 per cent of GPs now
earn bonus payments for meeting cervical
screening targets.
Deaths from cervical cancer in England and
Wales have fallen since the programme began,
dropping from 1,942 in 1988 to 1,369 in 1994.
Health Education
Responsibility for health education in Britain
lies with four separate health education
authorities, which work alongside the national
health departments. All four authorities form
part of the NHS. They are the Health
Education Authority; Health Promotion
Wales; The Health Education Board for
Scotland; and the Health Promotion Agency
for Northern Ireland. All have broadly similar
responsibilities. Their aims are:
• to provide information and advice about
health directly to members of the public;
• to support other organisations and health
professionals who provide health
education to members of the public; and
• to advise the Government on health
education.
In addition, the Health Education
Authority has the major executive
responsibility for public education in Britain
about AIDS. It also assists in the provision of
training for HIV/AIDS workers, and provides
a national centre of information and advice on
health education. Major campaigns carried out
by the health education authorities include
those focusing on coronary heart disease,
cancer, smoking and alcohol misuse.
Almost all NHS health authorities/health
boards have their own health education
service, which works closely with health
professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to
determine the most suitable local programmes.
Increased resources in the health service are
being directed towards health education and
preventive measures. GPs receive special
payments for health promotion programmes.
Healthier Eating
There has been growing public awareness in
recent years of the importance of a healthy
diet. Medical research has shown that a diet
which is low in fats, especially saturates, and
rich in fruits, vegetables and starchy foods
contributes to good health and can reduce the
risk of certain serious illnesses, such as
coronary heart disease and stroke.
The Health of the Nation White Paper
followed the recommendations of the
Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food
and Nutrition Policy (COMA) that people
417
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
should reduce their average intakes of total fat
and saturated fatty acids and avoid obesity in
order to reduce cardiovascular disease. It
contained dietary targets for reducing these
two nutrients and for reducing adult obesity,
and the Nutrition Task Force was established
in 1992 to devise a programme to achieve
them. The programme was implemented
through a number of project teams in
information and education, catering, the NHS
and the food chain. The Task Force published
its final report in April 1996.
In July 1996 the Scottish Diet Action
Group published an action plan designed to
deliver, over 10 years, the changes
recommended in a 1993 working party report
on the improvements required in the Scottish
diet. The plan highlights the steps that the
food industry and other interests can take
voluntarily to improve the Scottish diet. The
Food and Nutrition Strategy Group is
developing a plan for Northern Ireland.
Nutritional labelling indicating the energy,
fat, protein and carbohydrate content of food is
being encouraged on a voluntary basis. The
major supermarket chains and most food
manufacturers have already introduced
voluntary labelling schemes. Nutrition
labelling is compulsory on products for which
a nutritional claim is made. The food industry
is exploring ways of making the labelling
information easier to understand.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
In Britain there is no single government
department responsible for environmental
health as a yrhole, although the Department of
Health advises other government departments
on the health implications of their policies.
The role of central government departments
includes the formulation of policy, drafting
and processing of legislation on environmental
health services, provision of guidance on the
legislation, and, in some areas, enforcement.
Environmental health services are mainly
operated at local level through regional and
district local government units.
Professionally trained environmental health
officers are mainly employed by district
councils. They are concerned with inspection,
health education and regulation.
In Northern Ireland district councils are
responsible for noise control; collection and
disposal of refuse; clean air; and food
composition, labelling and hygiene.
The Institute for Environment and Health,
a public body established by the Medical
Research Council (see below) in 1993, is
concerned mainly with the chemical hazards to
which people may be exposed through the
environment. In Scotland the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health
provides surveillance and advisory services on
environmental health matters.
Safety of Food
Under the Food Safety Act 1990 it is illegal to
supply food unfit for human consumption or
falsely or misleadingly labelled. Treatments or
processes must not make food harmful to
health. Places where food or drink is prepared,
handled, stored or sold must comply with
hygiene provisions. Local authorities enforce
food law and environmental health officers
may take away for examination samples of food
sold for human consumption. Specific
regulations lay down hygiene requirements for
milk and milk products, meat and meat
products, eggs, fish products and shellfish, and
cover labelling, composition, additives and
contaminants. The Department of Health and
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, along with their counterparts in
Scotland and Northern Ireland, are concerned
with the safety and quality of Britain’s food.
Departments work closely with industry, local
environmental health and trading standards
departments and consumer bodies to help
ensure protection of public health.
CJD and Public Health
In March 1996 a government scientific
advisory committee announced the discovery
of a new variant of CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease), an extremely rare spongiform
encephalopathy in humans. The Committee
concluded that the most likely explanation, in
the absence of any credible alternative, is that
these cases are linked to exposure to the cattle
disease BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) through the eating of bovine
418
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
products, which may have been contaminated
by BSE-infected brain and spinal cord before
the introduction of the ban on specified bovine
offals in 1989.
While there remains no unequivocal
scientific evidence that CJD is linked to BSE,
the Government is providing additional
funding for research into CJD and BSE,
including for that carried out at the national
CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, which
monitors the incidence of the disease.
See Chapter 18 for details of government
measures to control the spread of BSE.
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
Only medicines that have been granted a
product licence may be sold or supplied to the
public. Eicences are issued following scientific
assessment by the Medicines Control Agency
of the Department of Health. (The Veterinary
Medicines Directorate of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is similarly
responsible for animal medicines.)
A number of committees provide
independent advice to Ministers. The
Medicines Commission advises on matters
connected with the safety of human and
veterinary medicines; its duties also include
hearing appeals from companies against advice
that a product licence should not be granted.
The Committee on Safety of Medicines
advises on the safety, quality and efficacy of
medicinal products for human use and
promotes the collection and investigation of
information relating to adverse reactions.
RESEARCH
The Department of Health’s Research and
Development (R&D) strategy comprises two
complementary programmes:
• The Policy Research Programme provides
a base for the development of policy for
the health service, social services and
public health. Research is focused on a
range of strategic programmes that cover
the department’s central responsibilities.
Priorities are set in relation to the goals,
aims and objectives of the Department;
the feasibility of research; the likely return
on the investment in research; and the
appropriateness and availability of other
research budgets.
• The NHS R&D Programme aims to
secure a health service in which clinical,
managerial and policy decisions are based
on sound information about research
findings and scientific developments. The
setting of priorities is based on widespread
consultation. Over 300 studies have been
funded in areas including mental health,
physical and complex disabilities, and
cardiovascular disease and stroke. Health
technology assessment, which evaluates
new, as well as existing, technologies, is
the largest single body of research in the
programme.
Two major centres for disseminating and
implementing research have been established:
the UK Cochrane Centre and the NHS Centre
for Reviews and Dissemination.
From April 1998 funding for R&D in the
NHS will be provided from a single budget
raised by a levy on all purchasers of NHS
services.
See Chapter 20 for information on the work
of the Medical Research Council (the main
government agency for the support of
biomedical and clinical research).
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for undergraduate
teaching; the NHS provides hospital facilities
for training. Full registration as a doctor
requires five or six years’ training in a medical
school and hospital, with a further year’s
experience in a hospital. For a dentist, five
years’ training at a dental school is required.
An extensive review of specialist medical
training was carried out in 1992-93 and plans
for implementing its recommendations are in
progress. These are expected to have a major
impact on the way in which training is carried
out in the NHS and on the role and
responsibilities of hospital doctors. They will
419
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
include more intensive and better structured
training programmes which, together with the
reduction from three to two training grades,
will shorten the minimum training time for
most hospital specialists. The changes,
together with other policies to increase
consultant numbers and reduce junior doctors’
hours, are expected to increase the amount of
service provided to NHS patients by
consultants.
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council and,
for dentists, the General Dental Council. The
main professional associations are the British
Medical Association and the British Dental
Association.
Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors
There are two routes to registration as a nurse
or midwife: either through a higher education
diploma or through a degree course.
Most students undertake the
pre-registration Diploma in Higher Education
(Project 2000) programme, which emphasises
health promotion as well care of the sick and
enables students to work either in hospitals or
in the community. The course lasts three years
and consists of periods of college study
combined with practical experience in
hospitals or in the community. The first half of
the course comprises a common foundation
programme; the second half comprises one of
the following specialist branches: adult
nursing, mental health nursing, learning
disability nursing, and children’s nursing.
Midwifery training for registered general
nurses or registered general nurses (adult)
takes 18 months, but for others the training
lasts three years.
Health visitors are registered general nurses
who have completed a course in health visiting.
In 1995 new standards were introduced and by
1998 all courses will be at degree rather than at
diploma level.
District nurses are registered general nurses
who provide care for clients in the community.
As with health visitors, new standards were
introduced in 1995. By 1998 all courses will be
at degree rather than at diploma level. In
Northern Ireland health visitors, district
nurses and schools nurses, community
psychiatric, community mental handicap and
occupational health nurses undertake a
one-year diploma course.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering these
professions. Four National Boards—for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland—are responsible for ensuring that the
education and training policies of the Council
are carried out. The main professional
associations are the Royal College of Nursing
and the Royal College of Midwives.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires three or four years’
training in a school of pharmacy, followed by
one year’s practical experience in a community
or hospital pharmacy approved for training by
the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland (regulatory bodies for the
profession).
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered ophthalmic
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training
of ophthalmic opticians takes four years,
including a year of practical experience under
supervision. Dispensing opticians take a
two-year full-time course with a year’s
practical experience, or follow a part-time
day-release course while employed with an
optician.
Other Health Professions
Chiropodists, dieticians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
orthoptists, physiotherapists and radiographers
may, on qualification, apply for state
registration. Each profession has its own board
under the general supervision of the Council
for Professions Supplementary to Medicine.
420
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Applications for a further two boards have
been made from art, drama and music
therapists, and from orthotists and
prosthetists. State registration is mandatory for
employment in the NHS and local authorities
and is highly recommended in other public
services and the private sector.
Following the report of an independent
review of the legislation governing the
regulation of these key health
professionals—The Regulation of Health
Professions—published in July 1996, the
Government proposes to introduce legislation
to streamline existing arrangements.
Dental therapists and dental hygienists are
almost exclusively recruited from certified
dental nurses who have taken at least one
year’s training. Dental therapists then take a
2—3 year training course and dental hygienists
take a two-year training course; both carry out
simple dental work under the supervision of a
registered dentist.
National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and SVQs—see p. 458)
have been developed for health care support
workers, ambulance personnel, operating
department practitioners, physiological
measurement technicians and administrative
and clerical staff.
Complementary Medicine
Complementary medicine (or complementary
therapies) can cover a range of therapies and
practices, the best known being osteopathy,
chiropractic, homoeopathy, acupuncture and
herbalism.
Complementary medicine, with the
exception perhaps of homoeopathy, is usually
available only outside the NHS and is not
commonly included in private health insurance
schemes.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European
Economic Area (see p. 127) have special
health arrangements under which EEA
nationals resident in a member state are
entitled to receive emergency treatment,
either free or at a reduced cost, during visits
to other EEA countries (in most cases on the
production of a completed Form El 11,
which visitors should obtain before
travelling). There are also arrangements for
people who go to another EEA country
specifically for medical care, or who require
continuing treatment for a pre-existing
condition. In addition, there are
arrangements where any visitor to Britain can
receive immediate treatment for an
emergency condition arising during their
stay. Visitors are generally expected to pay if
the purpose of their visit is to seek medical
treatment. Visitors who are not covered by
reciprocal arrangements must pay for any
medical treatment they receive.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help elderly people,
disabled people, children and young people,
people with mental illness or learning
disabilities, their families and carers. Major
services include skilled residential and day
care, help for people confined to their homes,
and the various forms of social work. The
statutory services are provided by local
government social services authorities in
England and Wales, social work departments
in Scotland, and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland. Alongside these
providers are the many and varied
contributions made by independent private
and voluntary services. Much of the care
given to elderly and disabled people is
provided by families and self-help groups.
There are an estimated 7 million informal
carers in Britain, at least 1.5 million of whom
provide over 20 hours of care a week.
Legislation which came into force in April
1996 gives carers who provide (or intend to
provide) substantial care on a regular basis
the right, on request, to an assessment of
their ability to provide care.
Demand for personal social services is
rising because of the increasing number of
elderly people, who, along with disabled and
mentally ill people, or those with learning
disabilities, can lead more normal lives in the
community, given suitable support and
facilities.
421
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In response to the piecemeal way
regulation in social services has developed, in
September 1995 the Government launched a
wide-ranging review of the regulation and
inspection of children’s and adult personal
social services.
Management Reforms
New policies on community care in England,
Wales and Scotland have been implemented
in stages under the NHS and Community
Care Act 1990. In Northern Ireland similar
arrangements were introduced in 1993 under
equivalent legislation. Many of the
procedures which local authorities have
implemented correspond to similar
procedures recently introduced in the NHS
(see p. 398).
Local authorities increasingly act as
enablers and commissioners of services, rather
than as the actual providers, after assessing
their populations’ needs for social care. They
are now responsible for funding and arranging
social care in the community for people who
require public support. This includes the
provision of home helps or home care
assistants to support people in their own
homes, and making arrangements for
residential and nursing home care for those no
longer able to remain in their own homes.
Previously, residents of these homes who
obtained public funding received help
principally through special higher levels of
Income Support (see p. 437).
Local authorities published their first local
community care charters in April 1996. These
give local people more information about the
services and standards they can expect under
the community care reforms. At the same time
new community care plans were also
published. In Scotland the timetable for
introduction is longer because of the
reorganisation of local government which took
effect in April 1996 (see p. 76).
Recent figures for services provided or
bought by local authorities for people being
cared for at home show that during a survey
week in England between 1994 and 1995:
• the number of hours of home help and
home care provided rose by just under 8
per cent (to 2.4 million), although the
number of households receiving services
decreased by 5 per cent (to 512,000);
• places provided at day centres increased
by 6 per cent (to 602,000), while
attendances increased by 3 per cent (to
464,000); and
• the number of meals provided at home or
in lunch clubs increased by almost 3 per
cent (to 815,000), although the number
receiving meals decreased by over 11 per
cent (to 266,000).
All of the growth in home help and home
care was in the independent sector, where
provision in 1995 amounted to 29 per cent of
the total provided, compared with less than 19
per cent in 1994.
Finance
In 1993-94 almost 50 per cent of local
authorities’ spending on personal social
services was on older people (see Table 25.1).
The biggest single item of expenditure was
care for older people, which accounted for
just under half of all gross spending in this
area. Although most of this expenditure
related to residential care provided by local
authorities, the balance is expected to change
as, under the community care reforms, more
services are bought from the independent
sector.
During the same period the greater part of
local authorities’ spending on children’s
services involved the provision of community
homes (£300 million), fostering (£245 million)
and field social work (£325 million).
Legislation was passed in July 1996 to
enable local authorities to give certain people
cash payments as an alternative to community
care services, so that individual recipients will
be able to choose how to buy their services
rather than having to accept the direct
provision from a local authority. The
legislation is not yet in force.
In April 1996 the Government announced
new measures to subject local social services
authorities to closer scrutiny of their
cost-effectiveness and quality of service. In
England and Wales future councils will be
subject to review by the Social Services
422
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Inspectorate and the Audit Commission (see
p. 80). In Scotland the Social Work Services
Inspectorate and the Accounts Commission
will continue to monitor and evaluate
services.
Elderly People
Older people represent the fastest growing
section of the community. The proportion of
the population aged 75 and over has risen from
4.7 per cent 25 years ago to 7.1 per cent in
1996. In this period the proportion of those
over 85 has doubled from 0.9 per cent to 1.8
per cent of the population.
Services for elderly people are designed to,
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well as
day centres, lunch clubs and recreational
facilities. Adaptations to the home can
overcome a person’s difficulties in moving
about, and a wide range of equipment is
available for people with difficulties affecting
their hearing or eyesight. Alarm systems have
been developed to help elderly people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas
‘good neighbour’ and visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Elderly people who live in
residential care homes or nursing homes are
subject to charging with a means test. Those
who cannot afford to pay have their costs met
by the State. Local authorities may also levy
charges for domiciliary services.
In May 1996 the Government issued a
consultation paper on financial provision for
long-term care.2 The main proposal is to set up
a scheme for people who have financed some of
their long-term care costs through an
insurance policy or an annuity. These people
would receive extra protection for their assets
when assessed by a means test for residential
care applied by local authorities. The
Government intends to introduce legislation in
time for the partnership scheme to be in force
from 1997.
The most marked trend in residential care
provision over recent years has been the
continuing increase in the number of places
provided in the private and voluntary sector
and the corresponding fall in the number
provided in local authorities’ own homes.
Independent sector homes generally have
lower costs. Their use is encouraged by
central government finance^ which requires a
high proportion of each year’s new
community care finance to be spent in the
private sector.
New rules for assessing the amount to be
contributed by people in residential care or
nursing homes came into force in April 1996.
Under these, the amount of capital wholly
disregarded by the means test has more than
trebled from £3,000 to £10,000 and the level
of capital above which people are asked to meet
their own care costs in full has doubled from
£8,000 to £16,000.
As part of their responsibility for public
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people (‘sheltered
accommodation’); some of these developments
have resident wardens. Housing associations

and private builders also build such
accommodation.
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for elderly people within
their areas.
Disabled People
Britain has an estimated 6 million adults with
one or more disabilities, of whom around
400,000 (7 per cent) live in communal
establishments. Over the past ten years there
has been increasing emphasis on rehabilitation
and on the provision of day, domiciliary and
respite support services to enable disabled
people to live independently in the community
wherever possible.
Local social services departments help with
social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and to
publicise services. These may include advice
on personal and social problems arising from
disability, as well as on occupational,
educational, social and recreational facilities,
either at day centres or elsewhere. Other
services provided may include adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, stairlifts
and ground-floor toilets), the delivery of
cooked meals, and help with personal care at
home. In cases of greatest need, help may be
given with installing a telephone or a
television. Local authorities and voluntary
organisations may provide severely disabled
people with residential accommodation or
temporary facilities to allow their carers relief
from their duties. Special housing may be
available for those able to look after
themselves.
The Independent Living (1993) Fund is an
independent and discretionary trust which
provides financial help to very severely
disabled people of working age to enable them
to live independently in the community. The
Fund works in partnership with local
authorities, which are expected to make a
contribution in the form of services equivalent
to what they would have spent on residential
or nursing care.
Some authorities provide free or subsidised
travel for disabled people on public transport,
and they are encouraged to provide special
means of access to public buildings. Special
government regulations cover the provision of
access for disabled people in the construction
of new buildings.
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is
designed to tackle discrimination against
disabled people in Britain by providing them
with a more accessible environment. The Act:
• provides a right for disabled people in
employment and places a duty on
employers with 20 or more staff to
consider reasonable adjustments to the
terms on which they offer employment
where these would help to overcome the
practical effects of a disability;
• provides a right of access to goods and
services which will make it unlawful to
refuse to serve a disabled person and may
require service providers to make
reasonable adjustments to their services to
make them more accessible; and
• establishes the National Disability Council
to advise the Government on eliminating
discrimination against disabled people.
The Council has already prepared its
proposals for a code of practice on the
rights of access to goods, facilities and
services; this is currently the subject of
public consultation.
The Government plans to implement the
new employment rights and the initial rights of
access to goods, facilities and services by the
end of 1996.
People with Learning Disabilities (Mental
Handicap)
The Government’s policy is to encourage the
development of local services for people with
learning disabilities and their families through
co-operation between health authorities, local
authorities, education and training services and
voluntary and other organisations.
Local authority social services departments
are the leading statutory agency for planning
and arranging services for people with learning
disabilities. They provide or arrange
short-term care, support for families in their
own homes, residential accommodation and
support for various types of activities outside
424
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
the home. The main aims are to ensure that as
far as possible people with learning disabilities
can lead full lives in their communities and are
admitted to hospital only when it is necessary
on health grounds. People with learning
disabilities form the largest group for local
authority-funded day centre places and the
second largest group in residential care.
The NHS provides for the primary health
care needs of people with learning disabilities
as it does for the general population. It also
provides specialist services when the ordinary
NHS services cannot meet health care needs.
Residential care is provided for those with
severe or profound disabilities whose needs
can only effectively be met by the NHS.
Mentally 111 People
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental illnesses should have access to all
the services they need as locally as possible.
The cornerstone of community care policy for
mentally ill people is the Care Programme
Approach. Under this, each patient in contact
with the specialist services should receive an
assessment and a care plan, have a key worker
appointed to keep in touch with him or her,
and be given regular reviews. Implementation
of this approach is being closely monitored by
the NHS Executive.
While the total number of places for
mentally ill people in the large hospitals has
continued to fall, this has been matched by
increasing provision of alternative places in
smaller NHS hospitals, local authority
accommodation and private and voluntary
sector homes.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social centres
and residential care. Social workers help
patients and their families with problems
caused by mental illness. In some cases they
can apply for a mentally disordered person to
be compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 or,
in Scotland, the Mental Health (Scotland) Act
1984. In England and Wales the Mental Health
Act Commission provides important
safeguards for patients to ensure that the Act is
used appropriately. The Mental Welfare
Commission for Scotland performs similar
functions. Different arrangements apply in
Northern Ireland.
A grant of £58.3 million for 1996-97 to
local authorities in England is designed to
encourage them to increase the level of social
care available to mentally ill patients, including
those with dementia who need specialist
psychiatric care in the community.
The Mental Health (Patients in the
Community) Act 1995 aims to ensure
more effective care and supervision
for people with severe mental illness.
The legislation, which came into
force in April 1996, introduces a new
power of ‘supervised discharge’ for
patients in England and Wales who
need special supervision after they
leave hospital. Similar arrangements,
called Community Care Orders, have
been introduced in Scotland under
the same legislation. Under these
provisions patients who do not
receive the services they need or do
not comply with any requirements
placed on them must have their care
plans reviewed; where appropriate
their compulsory readmission to
hospital may be considered.
In addition supervision registers for
discharged patients most at risk were introduced
in 1994, maintained by the providers of services
for mentally ill people and allow hospital staff to
keep track of discharged patients. For details of
the Government’s homeless mentally ill
initiative, see p. 393.
The first government-backed national
survey of mental illness was carried out in
1993-94. The survey, which covers adults
aged 16 to 64 living in communal
establishments as well as those living in private
households, aims to provide up-to-date
information on mental illness among adults, as
well as on associated social disabilities. It also
examined the varying use of health, social and
voluntary care services, and the risk factors
associated with mental illness. The results of
425
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the survey have been published in a series of
eight reports, the last four of which were
issued in May 1996.3
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with those suffering from mental
illness or learning disabilities, and they play an
important role in providing services for both
groups of people.
Help to Families
Social services authorities, through their own
social workers and others in the voluntary
sector, give help to families facing special
problems. This help takes the form of services
for families with children in need or at risk of
harm or neglect, including some who may need
care away from their own families; and support
for family carers who look after elderly and
other family members, in order to give them
relief from their duties. There is also help for
single parents. Local authorities or voluntary
organisations now run many refuges for
women, often with young children, whose
home conditions have become intolerable. The
refuges provide short-term accommodation
and support while attempts are made to relieve
the women’s problems. Many authorities also
contribute to the cost of support and
counselling for families (such as marriage
guidance) carried out by voluntary
organisations.
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary
agencies and privately. In allocating places in
their day nurseries and other facilities, local
authorities give priority to children with
special social, learning or health needs. Local
authorities also register and inspect
childminders, private day nurseries and
playgroups in their areas and provide support
and advice services.

Day care figures for England up to the end
of March 1995 show:
• nearly 5,500 day nurseries with 161,000
places—an increase of 9 per cent over
1994;
• 97,000 registered childminders, providing
374,000 places—an increase of 5 per cent
over 1994; and
• 17,000 playgroups providing about
411,000 places.
In 1993 the Government launched a £45
million scheme to help create childcare
facilities in Great Britain for children over
five after school hours and during the holidays
(see p. 39).
Child Protection
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of a
number of different agencies and professions.
Area child protection committees provide
forums for discussion and co-ordination and
draw up policies and procedures for handling
these cases. The Government’s central
initiative on child abuse has provided funding
for a variety of projects, including training for
health visitors, school nurses, and local
authority social services staff. In Scotland the
Government provides support for child
protection training at the University of
Dundee and through a grant scheme for local
authorities. The results of a wide-ranging
research programme into child abuse in Great
Britain were published in June 1995.4 Among
its findings were that:
• about 160,000 children a year were being
referred into the protection system. A
third came from lone parent families, and
two-thirds were living in a household that
lacked a wage earner. Domestic violence
and mental illness were features in 15 per
cent of cases. One in seven of the parents
had themselves been abused as children.
• about 40,000 enquiries ended without any
action being taken after professionals had
made informal checks. In a further 80,000
cases matters were quickly allowed to rest
after parents had been interviewed;
*Child Protection: Messages from Research. HMSO, £14.
426
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
• in the comparatively small number of
cases where abuse was established, 96 per
cent of children involved stayed at home,
and where they were removed, 70 per cent
returned home within six months.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children who have no
parent or guardian, have been abandoned, or
whose parents are unable to provide for them.
The Children Act 1989, which came into
effect in England and Wales in 1991, recast the
legislative framework for children’s services,
care and protection into a single coherent
structure. It placed new duties on local
authorities to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children. Under the Act parents of
children in care retain their parental
responsibilities but act as far as possible as
partners with the authority. There is a
requirement for local authorities to prepare a
child for leaving their care and to continue to
advise him or her up to the age of 21. Local
authorities are required to have a complaints
procedure with an independent element to
cover children in their care.
The number of children looked after by
local authorities continues to decline as local
authorities respond to the Act’s requirement
that wherever possible children should remain
at home with their families.
By the end of March 1995, provisional
figures for England show:
• there were 49,000 children looked after by
local authorities, similar to the previous
year’s figure;
• 65 per cent of children were placed with
foster parents, compared with 63 per cent in
1994, reflecting a continued decline in the
numbers in other types of accommodation.
In England and Wales a child may be brought
before a family proceedings court if he or she is
neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral
danger, beyond the control of parents, or not
attending school. The court can commit
children to the care of a local authority under a
care order. Under the Children Act 1989 certain
preconditions have to be satisfied to justify an
order. These are that the children are suffering
or are likely to suffer significant harm because of
a lack of reasonable parental care or because they
are beyond parental control. However, an order
is made only if the court is also satisfied that this
will positively contribute to the children’s
well-being and be in their best interests. In court
proceedings children are entitled to separate
legal representation and the right to have a
guardian to protect their interests.
All courts have to treat the welfare of
children as the paramount consideration when
reaching any decision about their upbringing.
Recent concerns over standards of care in
certain local authority children’s homes
prompted a number of official inquiries
between 1992 and 1993; their
recommendations are now being implemented.
In September 1996, as part of the
Government’s response to incidents of child
abuse in North Wales in the 1970s and 1980s,
a review began of the safeguards introduced
by the Children Act in 1991 and after, for
children living away from home in England
and Wales. A parallel review is in progress in
Scotland.
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker, but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment
while under supervision. Supervision
requirements are reviewed at least once a
year until ended by a children’s hearing. The
Children (Scotland) Act 1995, whose major
provisions come into force between
November 1996 and April 1997, contains
major reforms of both public and private law
and places the child at the centre of
decision-making. It maintains and
strengthens the children’s hearings system,
introduces new child protection procedures
and places wide duties on local authorities to
promote the welfare of children.
In Northern Ireland the juvenile court may
place children who are in need of care,
protection or control into the care of a fit
person (including a health and social services
427
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
board or trust), or may make them subject to a
supervision order. The Children (Northern
Ireland) Order 1995 provides Northern Ireland
with legislation broadly equivalent to the
Children Act 1989 in England and Wales and
creates a separation between the treatment of
children in need of care and young offenders.
The legislation is expected to come into force
in October 1996.
Fostering and Children’s Homes
When appropriate in England and Wales,
children in care are placed with foster parents,
who receive payments to cover living costs.
Alternatively, the child may be placed in a
local authority, voluntary or private children’s
home or other suitable residential
accommodation, including boarding school. In
Scotland local authorities are responsible for
placing children in their care in foster homes,
in local authority or voluntary homes, or in
residential schools. Similar provisions apply in
Northern Ireland. Regulations concerning
residential care and the foster placement of
children in care are made by central
government.
Adoption
Local authority social services departments
are required by law to provide an adoption
service, either directly or by arrangement
with approved voluntary adoption societies.
Agencies may offer adoptive parents an
allowance in certain circumstances if this
would help to find a family for a child. Under
adoption law it is illegal to receive an
unrelated child for adoption through an
unapproved third party. The Registrars-
General keep confidential registers of
adopted children. Adopted people may be
given details of their original birth record on
reaching the age of 18, and counselling is
provided to help them understand the
circumstances of their adoption. An
Adoption Contact Register enables adopted
adults and their birth parents to be given a
safe and confidential way of making contact if
that is the wish of both parties. A person’s
details are entered only if they wish to be
contacted.
The number of children, babies in
particular, who are available for
adoption is far exceeded by those
people wishing to adopt. In recent
years fewer than 7,000 children have
been adopted annually. Of those,
about half are adopted by one legal
parent and a new partner, following
marriage or remarriage.
A draft adoption Bill was issued in March
1996, proposing new safeguards for children
being adopted and updating adoption law and
practice in England and Wales. It includes
proposals to allow children aged 12 or over to
agree to the making of their adoption order and
to have the right to apply to take part in their
own adoption proceedings; simpler alternatives
to adoption for step-parents, relatives or
long-term foster parents; and streamlined
arrangements for adopting from overseas.
In Scotland a number of significant changes
in adoption law were introduced in the
Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
Social Services Staff
The effective working of the social services
depends largely on professionally qualified
social workers. Training programmes leading
to a Diploma in Social Work (DipSW) are
provided by partnerships between educational
institutions (universities and colleges of higher
and further education) and employing
agencies. The Central Council for Education
and Training in Social Work (CCETSW) is
the statutory body responsible for promoting
and regulating social work training. Since
1989, CCETSW has been implementing a
programme of improvements to training and
qualifications. The range of qualifications now
available include National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and, in Scotland,
SVQs), the DipSW and two further
awards—the Post Qualifying Award in Social
Work and the Advanced Award in Social
Work. The range of qualifications is relevant
for staff working in all sectors, including those
in residential, day and domiciliary care service.
Professional social workers (including those
428
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
in the NHS) are employed mainly by the social
services departments of local authorities (local
authority social work departments in Scotland
and Health and Social Services Trusts in
Northern Ireland). There is also a growing
independent sector.
The Government is committed to
improving social work training and each of the
four countries of Britain has a personal social
services training strategy whose objectives
include increasing the supply of qualified
social workers, improving the quality of
qualifying training and the training of the
existing workforce.
A government consultation paper on
proposals for improving the professional
regulation of social services is to be issued later
in 1996.

Benefits 432
Social security is the Government’s largest expenditure programme. Planned
spending in 1996-97 is almost one-third of public expenditure (see pp. 161-2).
Recent developments include the reform of benefits for unemployed people,
measures to improve incentives for unemployed people to find work, changes in
the provision for people of working age unable to work because of illness or
disability, and measures to curb the growth in benefit payments for housing costs.
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement.
As part of its long-term review of public
spending (see pp. 163-5), the Government is
examining the social security programme and
reforming the structure of the present system
to ensure it involves:
• better targeting of those in need;
• encouraging more self-provision; and
• providing more incentives to work.
There are three broad categories of social
security benefit:
• contributory benefits, where
entitlement depends on a satisfactory
record of payment of contributions to the
National Insurance Fund,1 from which
benefits are paid;
The National Insurance Fund is a statutory fund into which
all National Insurance contributions payable by employers,
employees and self-employed people are paid and from
which expenditure on contributory benefits is met.
• income-related benefits, available to
people whose income falls below a certain
level; and
• other benefits, which depend on
qualifying conditions such as disability or
family needs.
Contributory benefits account for about one
half of programme expenditure, income-
related benefits for almost a third, and other
non-contributory benefits about a sixth.
General taxation provides over half the income
for the social security programme, with
employers’ National Insurance contributions
around a quarter and employees’ National
Insurance contributions about a fifth. Appeals
about claims for benefits are decided by
independent tribunals.
ADMINISTRATION
Administration in Great Britain is handled by
five separate executive agencies of the
Department of Social Security, together
employing a total of some 90,000 staff:
•
• the Benefits Agency administers and
delivers the majority of benefits;
430
SOCIAL SECURITY
• the Child Support Agency assesses and
collects maintenance payments for
children (see p. 435);
• the Contributions Agency handles
National Insurance contributions;
• the Information Technology Services
Agency computerises the administration
of social security; and
• the War Pensions Agency delivers services
to war pensioners.
The Employment Services Agency of the
Department for Education and Employment
pays benefits to unemployed people on behalf
of the Benefits Agency. The housing and
council tax benefit schemes are administered
by local authorities, which recover most of the
cost from the Government.
In Northern Ireland National Insurance
contributions and social security benefits are
administered by the Social Security Agency.
The housing benefit scheme is administered by
the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and
the Rate Collection Agency; council tax does
not apply in Northern Ireland, where domestic
‘rates’ are still collected.
A major programme to improve quality and
customer service is in progress. The Benefits
Agency, for example, is moving towards
one-stop service delivery (a single contact
point to handle each customer’s business with
the Agency).
The Benefits, Contributions and War
Pensions Agencies publish customer charters.
Anti-fraud Measures
Further measures are being introduced to
improve the prevention and detection of social
security fraud. These include:
• greater financial incentives to local
authorities to prevent and detect fraud in
the benefits they administer;
• better use of information technology; and
• better targeting of resources, and
additional resources where necessary.
In 1994-95 11X1.6 million of fraud was
identified and stopped. In the four years since
its formation, the Benefits Agency has saved
over £2,000 million through anti-fraud work.
Advice about Benefits
The demand for advice about benefits is partly
met by the Freeline Social Security Service,
which handles over 1 million calls each year.
The Ethnic Freeline Service provides
information on social security in Urdu,
Punjabi and Chinese. There is also a freeline
service in Welsh.
The Department of Social Security
produces a range of leaflets and posters
providing general information on entitlement
and liability. These are available in English and
a number of other languages.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as Retirement Pension, Incapacity
Benefit, Unemployment Benefit, Maternity
Allowance and Widow’s Benefits, is dependent
upon the payment of contributions. There are
five classes of contributions. The rates given
below are effective from April 1996 to
April 1997:.
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees with earnings
below £61 a week do not pay Class 1
contributions. Contributions on earnings
of £61 a week and over are at the rate of 2
per cent of the first £61 of total earnings
and 10 per cent of the balance, up to the
upper earnings limit of £455 a week.
Employers’ contributions are subject to
the same threshold. On earnings above the
threshold, contributions rise in stages
from 3 per cent of total earnings up to a
maximum of 10.2 per cent when earnings
are £210 or more a week; there is no
upper earnings limit. The contribution is
lower if the employer operates a
‘contracted-out’ occupational pension
scheme (see p. 434).
• Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with fuel and/or
a car for private use. A Class 1A
contribution is payable on the cash
equivalent of the benefit provided.
• Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£6.05 a week. The self-employed may
claim exemption from Class 2
431
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
contributions if their profits are expected
to be below £3,430 for the 1996—97 tax
year. Self-employed people are not
eligible for unemployment and industrial
injuries benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Contributions are
at a flat rate of £5.95 a week.
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£6,860 a year), and up to a set upper
limit (£23,660 a year) in addition to their
Class 2 contribution. Class 4 contributions
are payable at the rate of 6 per cent.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to be
liable. Self-employed people over pensionable
age do not pay contributions.
A one-year National Insurance
Contribution Holiday for employers was
introduced in April 1996 to encourage
employers to take on people who have been
unemployed for two years or more. This
enables employers to claim back an amount
equivalent to their share of the National
Insurance contribution for each qualifying
employee for up to a year.
BENEFITS
For most contributory benefits there are two
conditions. First, before benefit can be paid at all,
a certain number of contributions must have
been paid. Second, the full rate of benefit cannot
be paid unless contributions have been paid or
credited to a specific level over a set period. A
reduced rate of benefit is payable dependent on
the level of contributions paid or credited. For
example, a great many of those receiving
retirement pensions and widows’ benefits receive
a percentage-based rate of benefit. Benefits are
increased annually in line with percentage
increases in retail prices. The main benefits
(payable weekly) are summarised on pp. 433-40.
Rates given are those effective from April
1996 until April 1997.

SOCIAL SECURITY
Retirement Pension
A state Retirement Pension is payable, if the
contribution conditions have been met, to
women at the age of 60 and men at the age of
65. The Sex Discrimination Act 1986 protects
employees of both sexes in a particular
occupation from being required to retire at
different ages. This, however, has not affected
the payment of the state retirement pension at
different ages for men and women.
Legislation was introduced in 1995 to
equalise the state pension age for men and
women at 65. The change will be phased in
over ten years, starting from April 2010.
Women born before 6 April 1950 will not be
affected; their pension age will remain at 60.
The new pension age of 65 will apply to
women born on or after 6 April 1955. Pension
age for women born between these dates will
move up gradually from 60 to 65.
The state pension scheme consists of a basic
weekly pension of £61.15 for a single person
and £97.75 for a married couple, together with
an additional earnings-related pension.
Pensioners may have unlimited earnings
without affecting their pensions. Those who
have put off their retirement during the five
years after state pension age may earn extra
pension. A non-contributory retirement
pension of £36.60 a week is payable to people
over the age of 80 who meet certain residence
conditions, and who have not qualified for a

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
contributory pension. People whose pensions
do not give them enough to live on may be
entitled to Income Support (see p. 437). Over
10.2 million people in Great Britain received a
basic state pension in 1995.
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded for
people whose opportunities to work are limited
while they are looking after a child or a sick or
disabled person. Men and women may receive
the same basic pension, provided they have
paid full-rate National Insurance contributions
when working. From April 1999 the
earnings-related pension scheme will be based
on a lifetime’s revalued earnings instead of on
the best 20 years. It will eventually be
calculated as 20 per cent rather than 25 per
cent of earnings, to be phased in over ten years
from 1999. The pensions of people retiring
this century will be unaffected.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from the state scheme for the additional
earnings-related pension and provide their
own occupational pension instead. Their
pension must be at least as good as the state
additional pension. Joining an employer’s
contracted-out scheme is voluntary: employers
are not free to contract out employees from the
earnings-related pension scheme without the
employees’ consent. The State remains
responsible for the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes cover about
half the working population and have nearly 11
million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age, who are unable or who do not
want to transfer their pension rights, are now
offered some protection against inflation.
Workers leaving a scheme have the right to a
fair transfer value. The trustees or managers of
pension schemes have to provide full
information about their schemes.
Increasing numbers of pensioners receive
income from occupational pensions and
investment income. Around two-thirds of all
pensioners now receive an occupational
pension worth, on average, over £70 a week,
while more than three-quarters have some
form of incotne from their investments,
receiving an average of over £37 a week.
As an alternative to their employers’
scheme or the state additional earnings-related
pension scheme, people are entitled to choose a
personal pension available from a bank,
building society, insurance company or other
financial institution. In 1993-94, 5.7 million
people contracted out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme and took out
personal pensions. Legislation passed in 1995
requires occupational schemes to provide equal
treatment between men and women and to
make personal pensions more flexible and
attractive to a broader age range.
A Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints about maladministration of pension
schemes and adjudicates on disputes of fact or
law. A pensions registry helps people trace lost
benefits.
Parents and Children
Most pregnant working women receive
Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working for
the same employer for 26 weeks and who earns
on average at least £61 a week. She will receive
90 per cent of her average weekly earnings for
the first six weeks and a lower rate of £54.55 a
week for the remaining 12 weeks. Women who
are not eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay
because, for example, they are self-employed,
have recently changed jobs or given up their
job, may qualify for a weekly Maternity
Allowance, which is payable for up to 18
weeks. This amounts to £54.55 a week for
employees and £47.35 a week for the
self-employed and those not in work.
All pregnant employees have the right to
take 14 weeks’ maternity leave.
A payment of £100 from the Social Fund
(see p. 440) may be made if the mother or her
partner receive Income Support, income-
related Jobseeker’s Allowance, Family Credit or
Disability Working Allowance (see pp. 436—9).
It is also available if a woman adopts a baby.
Non-contributory Child Benefit of £10.80
a week for the eldest qualifying child and
£8.80 for each other child is the main social
security benefit for children. Tax-free and
normally paid to the mother, Child Benefit is
payable for children up to the age of 16 and for
434
SOCIAL SECURITY
those up to 19 if they continue in full-time
non-advanced education. In addition, One
Parent Benefit of £6.30 a week is generally
payable to certain people bringing up one
child or more on their own, whether as their
parents or not. A non-contributory
Guardian’s Allowance of £11.15 a week
for an orphaned child is payable to a person
who is entitled to Child Benefit for that
child. This is reduced to £9.15 if the higher
rate of Child Benefit is payable for the child.
In exceptional circumstances a Guardian’s
Allowance may be paid on the death of only
one parent.
At the end of 1995 Child Benefit was paid
for 12,780,000 children, an increase on the
previous year of 80,000.
Child Support Agency
An estimated 1.4 million lone parents bring up
over 2 million children in Britain. The Child
Support Agency (CSA), which started work in
April 1993, is gradually replacing the court
system for obtaining basic child maintenance.
The CSA is responsible for assessing,
collecting and enforcing child maintenance
payments and for tracing absent parents.
Assessments are made using a formula which
takes into account each parent’s income and
essential outgoings.
Changes to the child support arrangements
were introduced in 1994 to take account of the
concerns of members of the public and MPs.
The Government believes that the formula
approach to assessment of maintenance is
appropriate for most separated parents.
However, a case has been made for further
changes. Legislation passed in 1995 introduces
a system of departures from the formula
assessment of child support to allow the
amount of maintenance payable to be varied in
a small proportion of cases from 1996-97.
Other measures are designed to improve the
review process in child support and to
introduce a child maintenance bonus worth up
to £1,000 when the parent with care of the
child returns to work.
In Northern Ireland the child support
maintenance scheme is operated by the
Northern Ireland Child Support Agency,
established at the same time as the CSA.
Childcare Charges
Families claiming Family Credit (see p. 439),
Disability Working Allowance (see p. 436),
Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (see
pp. 438-9), and who pay for childcare for
children aged under 11, can have up to £60 a
week in childcare charges offset against their
earnings when their benefit entitlement is
worked out. This help is for lone parents, and
families where both partners work or where
one partner is disabled, who use formal
childcare through registered childminders and
day nurseries. Many families are expected to
take up work as a direct result of the change.
Widows
Widows under the age of 60, or those over 60
whose husbands were not entitled to a state
retirement pension when they died, receive a
tax-free single payment of £1,000 following
the death of their husbands, provided that
their husbands had paid a minimum number of
National Insurance contributions. Women
whose husbands have died of an industrial
injury or prescribed disease may also qualify,
regardless of whether their husbands had paid
National Insurance contributions.
A widowed mother with at least one child for
whom she is getting Child Benefit receives a
Widowed Mother’s Allowance of £61.15 a
week, with a further £9.90 for a child for whom
the higher rate of Child Benefit is payable and
£11.15 for each subsequent child. A widow’s
basic pension of £61.15 a week is payable to a
widow who is 55 years or over when her husband
dies or when her entitlement to Widowed
Alother’s Allowance ends. A percentage of the
full rate is payable to widows who are aged
between 45 and 54 when their husbands die or
when their entitlement to Widowed Mother’s
Allowance ends. Special rules apply for widows
whose husbands died before 11 April 1988.
Entitlement continues until the widow remarries
or begins drawing retirement pension. Payment
ends if she lives with a man as his wife. Widows
also benefit under the Industrial Injuries scheme
(see p. 437).
A man whose wife dies when both are over
pension age inherits his wife’s pension rights
just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sick and Disabled People
Statutory Sick Pay and Incapacity Benefit
A variety of benefits are available for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying Statutory Sick Pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. There is a single rate of
Statutory Sick Pay for all qualifying employees
provided their average weekly earnings are at
least equivalent to the lower earnings limit for
the payment of National Insurance
contributions. The weekly rate is £54.55.
Entitlement to Incapacity Benefit begins
when entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay ends
or, for those who do not qualify for Statutory
Sick Pay, from the first day of sickness. The
benefit has three rates:
• a lower rate of £46.15a week for the first
28 weeks (for those not entitled to
statutory sick pay);
• a higher rate of £54.55 a week between the
29th and 52nd week; and
• a long-term rate of £61.15 a week from
the 53rd week of incapacity.
Extra benefits may be paid for adult and
child dependants. Incapacity Benefit is taxable
from the 29th week of incapacity.
A new, more objective medical test of
incapacity for work has been introduced for
Incapacity Benefit as well as for other social
security benefits paid on the basis of incapacity
for work. The new test usually applies after 28
weeks’ incapacity for work and assesses ability
to perform a range of work-related activities
rather than the ability to perform a specific job.
Severe Disablement Allowance
A Severe Disablement Allowance of
£36.95, plus additions of up to £12.90 a week
depending on the person’s age and when they
became incapable of work, may be payable to
people who have not been able to work for at
least 28 weeks because of illness or disability
and who cannot get Incapacity Benefit because
they have not paid enough National Insurance
contributions. Claims may be made by people
aged between 16 and 65. Once a person has
qualified for the allowance, there is no upper
limit for receipt. Additions for adult
dependants and for children may also be paid.
Since April 1995 new claimants have had to
satisfy the same incapacity test as that used in
Incapacity Benefit (see above).
People who become incapable of work after
their 20th birthday must also be medically
assessed as at least 80 per cent disabled for a
minimum of 28 weeks. People already in
receipt of certain benefits, such as the middle
or higher rate of Disability Living Allowance,
will automatically be accepted as 80 per cent
disabled.
Other Benefits
Disability Living Allowance is a
non-contributory tax-free benefit for people
disabled before the age of 65 who need help
with personal care or with mobility. It has two.
components: a care component which has
three weekly rates—£48.50, £32.40 and
£12.90; and a mobility component which has
two rates—£33.90 and £12.90.
A non-contributory, tax-free Attendance
Allowance of £32.40 or £48.50 a week may be
payable to people severely disabled at or after
age 65, who have personal care needs,
depending upon the amount of attention they
require. The higher rate of Attendance
Allowance and/or Disability Living Allowance
may be paid to people who are terminally ill.
A non-contributory Invalid Care
Allowance of £36.60 weekly may be payable
to people between 16 and 65 who cannot take
up a paid job because they are caring for a
person receiving either Attendance Allowance
or the higher or middle care component of
Disability Living Allowance. An additional
carer’s premium may be paid if the recipient is
also receiving Income Support, income-related
Jobseeker’s Allowances, Housing Benefit or
Council Tax Benefit. An estimated 1.5 million
adults in Great Britain care for a disabled
person for at least 20 hours a week.
Disability Working Allowance is an
income-related tax-free benefit which helps
some disabled people aged 16 or over who
work an average of 16 hours a week or more
and have an illness or disability which puts
them at a disadvantage in getting a job. Awards
436
SOCIAL SECURITY
are for fixed periods of six months. To qualify
a person must either:
• be getting Disability Living Allowance, or
an analogous benefit, such as Constant
Attendance Allowance under the War
Pensions or Industrial Injuries
Disablement scheme; or
• have an invalid three-wheeler or other
vehicle under the NHS Act 1977; or
• have been entitled to one of the following
in at least one of the 56 days before the
date of claim: higher rate short-term
Incapacity Benefit; long-term Incapacity
Benefit; Severe Disablement Allowance;
or the disability premium or higher
pensioner premium with Income Support,
Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit.
The allowance is available to single people,
lone parents and couples. The rate depends on
the person’s income and size of family, and the
ages of any children. The allowance is not
payable if capital or savings exceed £16,000.
Motability, an independent charitable
organisation, helps disabled drivers to obtain
vehicles or powered wheelchairs on favourable
terms by using the higher rate mobility
component of Disability Living Allowance or
the War Pension mobility supplement. Almost
5 per cent of all new cars registered in Britain
in 1994 were bought under the Motability
scheme, which currently has more than
200,000 customers.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits/Reduced
Earnings Allowance
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease caused by a particular type of
employment. The main benefit is Industrial
Injuries Disablement Benefit: up to £99 a
week is usually paid after a qualifying period of
15 weeks if a person is 14 per cent or more
physically or mentally disabled as a result of an
industrial accident or a prescribed disease.
Basic Disablement Benefit can be paid in
addition to other National Insurance benefits,
such as Incapacity Benefit. It can be paid
whether or not the person returns to work and
does not depend on earnings. The degree of
disablement is assessed by an independent
adjudicating medical authority and the amount
paid depends on the extent of the disablement
and on how long it is expected to last. Except
for certain progressive respiratory diseases,
disablement of less than 14 per cent does not
attract Disablement Benefit. In certain
circumstances additional allowances, such as
Constant Attendance Allowance and
Exceptionally Severe Disablement
Allowance, may be payable. In some cases
Reduced Earnings Allowance may be
payable.
Income Support
From 7 October 1996 Income Support is
payable only to certain people who are not
required to be available for work, and whose
financial resources are below certain set levels.
They include lone parents, pensioners, carers
and long-term sick and disabled people.
Income Support is made up of a personal
allowance based on age and on whether the
claimant is single, a lone parent or has a
partner; age-related allowances for dependent
children and additional sums known as
premiums, and housing costs. From this total
amount other income, including other social
security benefits, is deducted.
The Income Support scheme sets a limit to
the amount of capital a person may have and
still remain entitled to claim it. People with
savings or capital worth more than £8,000 are
ineligible; savings between £3,000 and £8,000
will reduce the amount received. Since April
1996 there have been new capital limits for
people living permanently in residential care or
a nursing home.
Until 7 October 1996 Income Support was
also available to unemployed people on low
incomes, capable of, available for, and actively
seeking work. These people now qualify for
assistance under the Jobseeker’s Allowance
(see below).
Jobseeker’s Allowance
Up to 7 April 1996 Unemployment Benefit of
£46.45 a week for a single person or £75.10 for
a couple was payable for up to a year in any
437
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
one period of unemployment. Another benefit,
Income Support (see above), was payable to
people whose income fell below certain set
levels and who were not working for more than
16 hours a week. A new benefit, Jobseeker’s
Allowance, was introduced on 7 October
1996, replacing the former Unemployment
Benefit and Income Support for unemployed
people with a single allowance paid at standard
rates. Since October 1996 all unemployed
people have been required to enter into a
Jobseeker’s Agreement, setting out a plan of
action to seek work. Most recipients qualify
through a means test, and the benefit is paid at
rates determined by family circumstances on a
basis similar to Income Support (see p. 436).
• Contribution-based Jobseeker s Allowance'.
those with a sufficient National Insurance
contribution record are entitled to a
personal Jobseeker’s Allowance for up to
six months, regardless of any savings or
partner’s income.
• Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance:
those on a low income are entitled to an
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
payable for as long as the jobseeker
requires support and continues to satisfy
the qualifying conditions. The amount a
claimant receives comprises an age-related
personal allowance, allowances for
dependent children, premium payments
for those with children or special needs,
and mortgage interest payments.
Back to Work Bonus
To enhance incentives to take up or keep
part-time work, and encourage people to move
off benefit and into employment, recipients of
Jobseeker’s Allowance and people aged under
60 who receive Income Support can benefit
from a Back to Work Bonus. People who
have been unemployed for three months or
more and are working part-time may keep the
first £5 of their earnings (£10 for couples, £15
for lone parents, disabled people and some
people in special occupations) in any week in
which they work while receiving benefit. An
amount equal to half of any earnings above that
level counts towards the build-up of a bonus
amount. When the unemployed person moves
off benefit and into employment, he or she will
be able to claim a tax-free lump sum of up to a
£1,000. The part-time (up to 24 hours a week)
earnings of a partner can also contribute
towards building up a Back to Work Bonus,
which can be paid if the couple leave benefit as
a result of the partner moving into work.
Government Aims
The Government’s three main aims in
introducing Jobseeker’s Allowance are:
• to improve the operation of the labour
market by helping people in their search
for work, while ensuring they understand
and fulfil the conditions for receipt of
benefit;
• to secure better value for money for the
taxpayer by a streamlined administration,
closer targeting on those who need
financial support and a regime which more
effectively helps people back into work;
• to improve the service to unemployed
people themselves by a simpler, clearer,
more consistent benefit structure, and by
better service delivery, wherever possible
from a single office.
The introduction of Jobseeker’s Allowance
is expected to reduce expenditure on benefits
by around £300 million between 1996-97 and
1997-98.
Housing Benefit
The Housing Benefit scheme assists people
who need help to pay their rent (rent and/or
domestic rates in Northern Ireland), using
general assessment rules and benefit levels
similar to those for Income Support (see p.
437). Unlike Income Support, the Housing
Benefit scheme sets a limit of £16,000 on the
amount of capital a person may have and still
remain entitled to claim benefit.
Since January 1996 Housing Benefit for
most private sector tenants has been calculated
by reference to the general level of rents for
properties with the same number of rooms in
the locality. The new measures are designed to
ensure that private sector tenants receiving
benefit have an incentive to choose better value
accommodation at the outset of a tenancy.
438
SOCIAL SECURITY
In 1995-96 a total of £10,800 million of
Housing Benefit was claimed. An average 4.8
million people claimed.
Recent Changes
Since October 1996 most single people under
25 who are not lone parents and who are
renting privately have had their Housing
Benefit limited to the average cost of
non-self-contained accommodation in the
locality. This is intended to reduce
disincentives to work, and to discourage young
people from leaving home before they can
afford to do so.
Council Tax Benefit
Council Tax Benefit helps people to meet
their council tax payments. The scheme offers
help to those claiming Income Support and
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and
others with low incomes. Subject to rules
broadly similar to those governing the
provision of Income Support and Housing
Benefit (see above), people may receive rebates
of up to 100 per cent of their council tax. At
present over 5 million households receive such
help. A person who is solely liable for the
council tax may also claim benefit (called
‘second adult rebate’) for a second adult who is
not liable to pay the council tax and who is
living in the home on a non-commercial basis.
In 1995-96 the total amount of Council Tax
Benefit claimed was £2,100 million. An
average 5.7 million people claimed.
Benefit Controls on People from Abroad
Residence Test
A new residence test, which came into force in
August 1994, requires claimants to establish that
they are habitually resident in Britain before a
claim for income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit can be
paid. The test brings Britain into line with most
other European countries, which already limit
access to their benefit systems to those who have
lived in the country for some time.
Asylum Seekers
Since February 1996 people who claim asylum
on arriving in Britain have had their
entitlement to Income Support (income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance from October 1996),
Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit
restricted. They now cease to be eligible for
benefits if their asylum claim is refused by the
Home Office rather than, as before, from the
time their appeal was rejected. People who
claim asylum after they have arrived in Britain
are no longer entitled to benefit.
Family Credit
Family Credit is payable to low-paid employed
and self-employed working families with
children. It is payable to couples or lone parents.
At least one parent must work for a minimum of
16 hours a week. The amount payable depends
on a family’s net income (excluding Child
Benefit) and the number and ages of the children
in the family. A maximum award, consisting of
an adult credit, plus a rate for each child varying
with age, and an extra credit if the parent works
more than 30 hours a week, is payable if the
family’s net income does not exceed £72.50 a
week. The award is reduced by 70 pence for each
pound by which net income exceeds this
amount. In certain cases where children under 11
have formal childcare arrangements, up to £60 a
week can be deducted from net income before
Family Credit is assessed. People with savings or
capital worth more than £8,000 are ineligible;
savings between £3,000 and £8,000 will reduce
the amount received.
The processing of Family Credit claims has
been speeded up to eliminate gaps in income
on moving into work, and by July 1996 most
claims were being cleared within five days.
In 1993-94 the total amount of family
credit claimed was £990 million; total amount
unclaimed was £230 million. The average
number of people claiming was estimated at
440,000 and the average number not claiming
although entitled was 180,000.
Earnings Top-up
While Family Credit (see above) helps people
with dependent children to be better off in
work, there has been no similar provision for
single people and couples without children. In
October 1996 a new benefit—Earnings
Top-up—was introduced on a pilot basis to
439
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
test whether topping up wages for workers
without dependent children helps them get
jobs and stay in work. The new benefit is
tested at two different levels, with different
rates for couples and single people. It is
payable in eight pilot areas only and is the first
social security benefit to be introduced on a
pilot basis. A decision on possible national
introduction will be made after full research
and evaluation has been carried out.
Social Fund
The Social Fund consists of regulated
payments, which do not have limited
resources, and discretionary payments, which
are paid out of an annual budget (£141.5
million in 1996-97).
The regulated payments are:
• maternity payment—£100 for each baby
born or adopted. Payable to those on
Income Support, income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance, Family Credit or
Disability Working Allowance;
• funeral payment—includes up to £500 for
specified funeral directors’ charges, plus
the reasonable costs of all burial or
cremation expenses. Available to those on
Income Support and income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance, Family Credit,
Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or
Disability Working Allowance; and
• cold weather payment—£8.50 a week
towards the extra cost of heating in very
cold weather from November to March.
Payable to those on Income Support who
are elderly, disabled or have children
under five years.
The discretionary payments are:
• community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, and to ease exceptional
pressure on families. Available to those on
Income Support or income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance;
• budgeting loans for important
intermittent expenses after 26 weeks on
Income Support or income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance; and
• crisis loans to help people in an emergency
or as a result of a disaster where there is a
serious risk to health or safety. There is no
qualifying benefit for this loan.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement as a result
of service in the armed forces or for certain
injuries received in the merchant navy or civil
defence during wartime, or to civilians injured by
enemy action. The amount paid depends on the
degree of disablement: the pension for 100 per
cent disablement is £105 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£7.00 and £21.60 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of
pension for a private’s widow is £79.35 a
week.) Until 1995 the War Widow’s Pension
was withdrawn on remarriage and a lump sum
worth one year’s pension was awarded.
Legislation passed in July 1995 has restored
the pension where the former war widow has
remarried and then become widowed again,
divorced or legally separated.
The War Pensions Agency maintains a
welfare service for war pensioners, war widows
and other dependants. It works closely with
ex-Service organisations and other voluntary
bodies which give financial aid and personal
support to those disabled or bereaved as a
result of war.
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service charges
(see p. 402), grants towards the cost of
spectacles, free school meals and free legal aid
(see pp. 112-3).
People on low incomes, as well as all
pensioners, widows and long-term sick people on
Incapacity Benefit, receive extra help to meet the
cost of VAT on their fuel bills. In 1996-97 some

15 million people will have benefited, at a cost in
this year alone of £710 million.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners are
usually entitled to reduced transport fares.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which replace
lost earnings are subject to tax, while those
intended to meet a specific need are not (see
Table 26.2). Various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or a
need to support dependants.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include
Child Benefit and those for sickness and
maternity, unemployment, retirement,
invalidity, accidents at work and
occupational diseases.
Britain has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries
which also provide cover for some National
Insurance benefits and family benefits.
In 1995 750,000 British National Insurance
pensions were paid overseas, at a cost of some
£940 million.

Over half a million teachers are employed in Britain’s 29,000 state,1 2,000 special
and 2,400 fee-paying independent schools, which are attended by over 9 million
pupils. About 71 per cent of pupils continue studying after the age of 16. The
proportion of young people entering universities and colleges has risen from one
in eight in 1980 to almost one in three. Continuing education for adults is
provided by a variety of colleges and institutions, including universities.
Expenditure on education was £26,846 million in 1993-94.
HISTORY
England and Wales
Although government grants for education
were first made in 1833, it was the 1870
Education Act in England and Wales which
embodied the principle of compulsory
elementary education with government aid.
There were two types of elementary
school—church voluntary schools and state
schools provided by school boards. Attendance
at school became compulsory in 1880 for
children aged between five and ten, and the
school leaving age was progressively raised to
14 by 1918.
A co-ordinated national system of education
was introduced for the first time by the 1902
Education Act, and local government became
responsible for state education and for helping
to finance the voluntary schools. The system
was supervised by the Board of Education.
'For ease of reference the term ‘state school’ is used to
cover schools maintained from public funds.
In 1944 a new Education Act raised the
school leaving age to 15, and schools were
divided into primary and secondary. All
children were given a secondary education,
and the newly created Ministry of Education
was empowered to develop a national
education policy. Local government remained
responsible for administering the system.
Children were allocated to different
secondary schools—grammar, secondary
technical or secondary modern—on the basis
of selection tests taken at the age of 11. The
local education authorities were required to
prepare and submit to the Minister of
Education development plans covering the
whole process of primary and secondary
education, while proceeding with the
planned development of technical and adult
education through schemes of further
education.
In the 1960s and 1970s the selective system
was gradually replaced by comprehensive
schools, which take pupils of all abilities. The
school leaving age was raised to 16 in 1972-73.
442
EDUCATION
Scotland
An Act passed in 1872 transferred
responsibility for Scottish education from the
churches to elected school boards, which
provided compulsory education for children
between the ages of five and 13, and evening
schools for young people over 13. The working
of the new system was supervised by a central
government department (now the Scottish
Office Education and Industry Department)
which also administered the distribution of the
parliamentary grant.
In 1901 the school leaving age was raised to
14. An Act passed in 1918 replaced the boards
with local government authorities and made
the provision of secondary education
mandatory for all children wanting it. Church
schools were transferred to education
authorities, while preserving their
denominational character. The school leaving
age was raised to 15 in 1947 and to 16 in
1972-73.
Northern Ireland
Education in Northern Ireland was brought
into a single system by legislation passed in
1923, under which local government took
over responsibility for its administration,
supervised by the Ministry of Education.
Children were required to receive
‘elementary’ education between the ages of
six and 14. Secondary education remained
largely in the hands of voluntary bodies, with
assistance provided from public funds.
Technical education was provided almost
entirely by the local education authorities.
The school leaving age was raised to 15 in
1947 and to 16 in 1972-73.
Reform
During the 1970s concern arose about the
quality of education provided by Britain’s
schools and the lack of a formal national school
curriculum. Since then major reforms have
taken place in the three education systems,
including the introduction of various forms of
national curriculum (see p. 451), more choice
of school for parents, and the provision of
much more information about school
performance.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Education and
Employment has overall responsibility for
school and post-school education in England.
The Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland exercise similar
responsibilities in those countries. These are
exercised through the Department for
Education and Employment in England, The
Scottish Office Education and Industry
Department, the Welsh Office Education
Department, and the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland.
Most state school education is provided by
local government education authorities and
the rest by self-governing grant-maintained
(GM) schools (see p. 444). In Northern
Ireland the education service is administered
locally by five education and library boards;
in June 1996 the Government announced
that the number of boards would be reduced
to three.
SCHOOLS
Finance
LEA-maintained Schools
Central government annually determines an
appropriate level of spending by local
education authorities (LEAs) in England and
Wales on all their services, including within
that total an amount for education. This
spending is funded from a number of
sources, including Revenue Support Grant
direct from the Government, non-domestic
rates paid by business and commerce, and
local taxes. LEAs themselves, however,
decide how much of their resources should
be spent on education or on their other
services.
LEAs also receive some resources through
central government grants. These focus mainly
on training to improve school performance in
literacy and numeracy and on support for
information technology. Extra resources also
go to inner city schools facing particularly
severe problems. Additional government
grants are made for capital expenditure at
voluntary-aided schools (see p. 444).
443
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Grant-maintained Schools
State grant-maintained (GM) self-governing
schools are not financed by LEAs, as they have
chosen to opt out of LEA control (see below).
Instead, the Funding Agency for Schools in
England calculates and pays grants to GM
schools from public funds. Grant-maintained
schools in Wales are funded by the Welsh
Office.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland most state schools are provided by
local government education authorities;
self-governing schools are funded directly by
the Government. The education authorities
are financed in a similar way to those in
England and Wales.
The costs of the education and library
boards in Northern Ireland are met by the
Department of Education.
School Management
England and Wales
There are four kinds of state school that are
wholly or mainly supported from public funds:
• LEA owned and funded county schools;
• voluntary schools, mostly established by
religious denominations and grant-aided
by LEAs; the governors of some types of
voluntary school contribute to capital
costs;
• special schools for pupils with special
educational needs; and
• self-governing GM schools (see below).
LEA-financed Schools
Each LEA-maintained county, voluntary and
special school has a governing body which
includes governors appointed by the LEA,
elected teacher and parent governors, and
people co-opted from the local community.
Voluntary schools also have governors from
the church associated with the school.
All county, voluntary schools and special
schools manage their own budgets. LEAs
allocate funds to the schools, largely on the
basis of pupil numbers. The school governing
body is responsible for overseeing spending
and for most aspects of staffing, including
appointments and dismissals.
Grant-maintained Status
Some 18 per cent of secondary schools in
England are grant-maintained (GM)
self-governing schools. In Wales the
proportion is approximately 5 per cent. GM
status is achieved if the school’s parents
support the idea in a ballot and if the Secretary
of State approves the school’s proposals for
GM status. The governing bodies of non-GM
state schools must consider each year whether
or not to hold a ballot on GM status. If they
decide not to do so, they must tell parents
why.
The governing body for GM schools
consists of parents, teachers and people from
the community served by the school.
Governors take all decisions about school
management, employ and pay staff, are
responsible for school premises, and may
acquire or dispose of land. GM schools are
entitled to borrow money on the commercial
market for capital investment.
City Technology Colleges
The 15 city technology colleges are
non-fee-paying independent schools created
by a partnership of government and private
sector sponsors. The promoters own or lease
the schools, employ teachers and other staff,
and make substantial contributions towards the
costs of building and equipment. There is no
LEA involvement. The colleges teach the
National Curriculum but with an emphasis on
mathematics, technology and science.
Specialist Schools
The specialist schools programme was
launched in 1993 with the creation of
technology colleges. These are state secondary
schools which teach the National Curriculum
but with a special emphasis on technology,
science and mathematics. A national network
of language colleges concentrates on teaching
444
EDUCATION
modern foreign languages while continuing to
deliver the full National Curriculum. Two
similar schemes, one for the arts and the other
for sports, were announced in June 1996.
A school must have the backing of a
private-sector sponsor if it wishes to become
specialised. Capital and annual grants are
available from public funds to complement
business sponsorship. There are 151
technology colleges and 31 language colleges in
England.
Selection of Pupils
Under Government proposals for England and
Wales published in June 1996, secondary
schools would be given powers to select more
of their pupils on grounds of aptitude and
academic ability. Grant-maintained schools
would be able to select up to 50 per cent of
pupils, technology and language colleges up to
30 per cent in their specialist subjects, and
other schools up to 20 per cent without having
to publish statutory proposals. New grammar
schools would also be encouraged and
promoted by the Funding Agency for Schools.
Scotland
In Scotland most schools have school boards
consisting of elected parent and staff members
as well as co-opted members. They are
required to promote contact between parents,
the school and the community, and are
involved in the appointment of senior staff and
the community use of school premises.
Devolved management (from the local
education authority to the school) is in place in
primary and secondary schools. By April 1997
this will be extended to special schools.
Parents of children at state schools can opt
for self-governing status following approval by
a ballot; the school then receives funding
directly from central government instead of
the education authority. There are two
self-governing schools in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
The main categories of school supported by
public funds are:
j
• controlled schools, which are owned by
the education and library boards and
wholly financed from public funds;
• voluntary maintained schools, most of
which are owned by the Roman Catholic
Church; the majority of these schools are
wholly financed from public funds;
• voluntary grammar schools, which may be
owned by denominational or
non-denominational bodies and are largely
financed from public funds; and
• grant-maintained or controlled integrated
schools, taking both Protestant and
Roman Catholic pupils.
All publicly financed schools are managed
by boards of governors, which include elected
parents and teachers among their members.
Although all schools must be open to pupils
of all religions, most Roman Catholic pupils
attend Catholic maintained schools or Catholic
voluntary grammar schools, and most
Protestant children are enrolled at controlled
schools or non-denominational voluntary
grammar schools.
The Government has a statutory duty to
encourage integrated education as a way of
breaking down sectarian barriers. There are 32
integrated schools and pupil numbers are
expected to rise to over 6,000 (about 2 per cent
of the school population) by 1997. Integrated
schools are financed by the Government.
Existing controlled, maintained and voluntary
grammar schools can apply to become
integrated following a majority vote by
parents.
All nursery, primary and secondary schools
are financed on a basis which relates a major
part of each school’s resources to the number
of pupils it can attract. All secondary schools
have delegated budgets under which school
governors decide spending priorities. Nursery
and primary schools have partially delegated
budgets with responsibility for the non-staff
elements of their budgets. Most primary
schools have full delegation of budgets on a
voluntary basis.
School Places
Education authorities are responsible for
providing school places, with the exception of
445
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
GM schools in England and Wales, where
governing bodies are responsible.
Under the 1993 Education Act the Funding
Agency for Schools in England may take on
some responsibility for securing enough school
places in individual LEA areas. In areas where
between 10 and 75 per cent of pupils are being
educated in GM primary or secondary schools,
the LEA and the Agency may be jointly
responsible. Once 75 per cent of primary or
secondary pupils are in GM schools, the
Agency may be solely responsible for the
provision of school places. The Agency can
only be involved in the provision of school
places if the Secretary of State makes an order
to that effect.
Pupils
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive efficient full-time education,
at school or elsewhere, between the ages of five
and 16 in Great Britain and four and 16 in
Northern Ireland. About 94 per cent of pupils
receive free education financed from public
funds, while the others attend independent
schools financed by fees paid by parents.
Boys and girls are taught together in most
primary schools. Almost 90 per cent of pupils
in state secondary schools in England and
Wales and about 63 per cent in Northern
Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland
virtually all state secondary schools with one
exception are mixed. Most independent
schools (see p. 449) for younger children are
mixed; the majority providing secondary
education are single-sex, but the number of
mixed secondary schools is growing.
Nursery Schools
Nearly 57 per cent of three- and four-year-olds
in Britain attend nursery schools, nursery
classes or reception classes in primary schools.
In addition, many children attend pre-school
playgroups, most of which are organised by
parents.
In July 1995 the Government launched a
voucher scheme to provide over time a nursery
place for every child in the pre-school year in
Britain whose parents wish to take it up. The
first phase of the scheme began in April 1996
in four volunteer local authorities in England,
and it will become fully operational throughout
the rest of England in April 1997.
Both public and private providers of
nursery education under the scheme will be
required by the Government to meet certain
minimum standards regarding literacy,
numeracy and personal and social skills.
Schools will be inspected regularly.
Similar arrangements will apply in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Primary Schools
Compulsory education starts in infant primary
schools or departments; at seven many transfer
to separate junior primary schools or
departments. The usual age for transfer from
primary to secondary schools is 11 in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, but some local
authorities in England have established first
schools for pupils aged five to eight, nine or
ten, and middle schools for age-ranges between
eight and 14. In Scotland primary schools take
children from five to 12, when they transfer to
secondary schools. In Northern Ireland,
children transfer to secondary school at the age
of 11. For information on independent schools,
see p. 449.
Secondary Schools
Around nine-tenths of the state secondary
school population in Great Britain attend
comprehensive schools. These mostly take
pupils without reference to ability or aptitude
and provide a wide-ranging secondary
education for all or most of the children in a
district. Schools in England and Wales can be
organised in a number of ways. They include:
• those taking the 11 to 18 age-range;
• middle schools (see above); and
• schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to
16.
Most other state-educated children attend
grammar or secondary modern schools, to
which they are allocated after selection
procedures at the age of 11.
Scottish secondary education is almost
446
EDUCATION
completely non-selective; the majority of
schools are comprehensives covering the
age-range 12 to 18.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is
organised largely along selective lines, the 71
grammar schools admitting some 61,000 pupils
on the basis of tests in English, maths and
science. Over 90,000 pupils attend non¬
grammar secondary schools. Some secondary
schools are run on a non-selective basis.

Rights of Parents
Parents must be given general information
about a school through a prospectus and the
school’s annual report or, in Scotland, the
school’s handbook. They also have a statutory
right to express a preference for a particular
school for their child, and there is an appeal
system if their choice is not met.
In England and Wales parents choosing a
local secondary school have the right to see:
• national performance tables showing the
latest public examination results,
vocational qualification results and rates of
absence on a school-by-school basis; and
• information in each local school’s
prospectus on its public examination
results, vocational qualification results,
attendance rates and the destinations of
school leavers.
In England parents will also be able to see
primary school performance tables based on
National Curriculum assessment results.
Summaries of school inspection reports (see
p. 455) are given to parents.
All state schools in England and Wales have
to give parents a written annual report on their
child’s achievements, containing details about:
• the child’s progress in all subjects and
activities;
• the child’s general progress and
attendance record;
• the results of National Curriculum
assessments and of public examinations
taken by the child;
• comparative results of pupils of the same
age in the school and nationally; and
• the arrangements for discussing pupils’
school reports with teachers.
All parents are invited to an annual meeting to
discuss the governors’ annual report.
School performance tables for England are
available on the Internet.
In Scotland information is published for
parents on school costs, examination results,
pupil attendance and absence, and the
destinations of school leavers. Inspection
reports are published for parents. National
guidelines to schools on reporting to parents
advise that they should provide them with
information about their children’s attainment
in the various subjects, teachers’ comments on
their progress and details about steps to build
on success or overcome difficulties. One main
school report each year is advised, together
with one brief update report.
The Northern Ireland system for reporting
to parents is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales.
Failing Schools
If school inspectors in England and Wales
identify a school failing to give its pupils an
acceptable standard of education, the LEA can
appoint new governors and withdraw
delegated management from the school. As an
alternative, central government can put the
school under new management until its
performance reaches a satisfactory level. The
new management is financed from central
447
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
government. After further visits from the schools
inspectorate (see p. 455), the Secretary of State
decides whether the school has made sufficient
progress. If it has, it becomes grant-maintained;
if it has not, the school closes. This process takes
about two years.
Ethnic Minority Children
Most school-aged children from ethnic
minorities were born in Britain and tend to
share the interests and aspirations of children
in the population at large. Nevertheless, a
substantial number still have particular needs
arising from cultural differences, including
those of language, religion and custom.
The education authorities have done much
to meet these needs. English language teaching
continues to receive priority for some 450,000
pupils for whom English is an additional
language. Schools may teach the main ethnic
minority community languages at secondary
level in England and Wales as part of the
National Curriculum. Schools have to take
account of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds
of pupils, and curricula should reflect ethnic
and cultural diversity. Measures have been
taken to improve the achievement of ethnic
minority pupils, and to prepare all children,
not just those of ethnic minority origin, for
living in a multi-ethnic society.
From 1996 the annual school census in
England will include new questions about the
ethnic backgrounds of pupils in order to
ensure that all pupils have equal opportunities
to achieve their full potential.
Special Educational Needs
Special educational needs comprise learning
difficulties of all kinds, including mental and
physical disabilities which hinder or prevent
learning. LEAs in England and Wales must
identify children whose learning difficulties are
very severe or complex, assess and meet their
needs, and involve parents in decisions about
their child’s special education.
If the LEA believes that it should
determine the education for the child, it must
draw up a formal statement of the child’s
special educational needs and the action it
intends to take to meet them. There are
statutory time limits governing this procedure.
A state school named in the statement is
required to admit the child.
In England and Wales parents have a right
of appeal to the Special Educational Needs
Tribunal if they disagree with the LEA
decisions about their child’s special
educational needs. The Tribunal’s verdict is
final and binding on all parties.
Wherever possible, children with special
educational needs are educated in ordinary
schools, where placement must be compatible
with the needs of the child and with the
provision of efficient education for the other
children in the school. The LEA is required to
comply with parents’ choice of school unless
this is inappropriate for the child, involves an
inefficient use of resources or is incompatible
with the efficient education of other children.
A Government Code of Practice offers
practical guidance to all LEAs and state
schools in England and Wales on how to
identify, assess and monitor all pupils with
special educational needs.
Each school in England and Wales must
formulate a policy on pupils with special
educational needs and publish information
about that policy. Annual reports to parents
must report on the success of these policies.
In Scotland the choice of school is a matter
for agreement between education authorities
and parents. A 1995 report by school
inspectors sets out clear basic principles which
emphasise the importance of partnership
between all involved in meeting special
educational needs.
In Northern Ireland legislation has been
passed under which similar arrangements to
those in England and Wales, including an
appeal system, will be introduced.
There are nearly 2,000 special schools (both
day and boarding) in Britain for pupils with
special educational needs. Some of these are
run by voluntary organisations and some are
established in hospitals. They cater for some
114,000 pupils. The pupil/teacher ratio in
special schools is 5.9 to 1 compared with 18.9
to 1 in mainstream state schools.
The Government has published guidance
for parents of children with special needs in
England, Wales and Scotland which sets out
the rights and responsibilities of parents in
their child’s education.
448
EDUCATION
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
Physical education, including organised games, is
part of the curriculum of all state schools. In
England and Wales playing fields must be
available for pupils over the age of eight. Most
secondary schools have at least one gymnasium.
Government health departments are
responsible for the medical inspection of
schoolchildren and for advice on, and treatment
of, medical and dental problems. The education
service seeks to help prevent and deal with
juvenile drug misuse and to help prevent the
spread of AIDS. In England government funds
support the training of teachers with
responsibility for anti-drug education.
The Government has also issued guidance on
drug prevention in England’s schools, outlining
how to teach pupils about the dangers of drug
misuse, advising schools on drug education and
prevention, and giving advice on how to deal
with drug-related incidents on school premises.
In Scotland similar curriculum advice is made
available to every school. School drug education
programmes are subject to inspection by school
inspectors.
In Northern Ireland a drug education,
advice and resource pack has been issued to all
schools and colleges. It includes guidance on
drug education policies and procedures for the
handling of drugs incidents in schools. All
schools must have a drug education policy and
publish details about it in their prospectus.
LEAs and GM schools are responsible for
providing school meals for pupils. They make
their own decisions on the nature of the meals
service, taking account of local circumstances.
In Northern Ireland school meals must be
provided for primary, special and grant-aided
nursery school pupils.
Free meals must be provided for children
whose parents receive a social security benefit
called income support or another known as
income-based Jobseekers’ Allowance; all other
pupils have to be charged for meals. Although
LEAs and GM schools do not have to provide
milk to any pupil, they may provide free milk
to pupils of parents in receipt of either of the
above social security benefits; they can also
offer subsidised milk to other pupils.
LEAs must provide free of charge the
transport they consider necessary to enable
pupils living in their area to attend school and
they may help other pupils with their fares.
LEAs must publish annually their policy on
free and assisted transport.
Corporal punishment is prohibited by law
in state schools in Britain, and for pupils in
independent schools whose fees are met wholly
or partly from public funds under the Assisted
Places Scheme (see below).
Independent Schools
Fee-paying independent schools providing
full-time education for five or more pupils of
compulsory school age must register by law
with the Department for Education and
Employment and are subject to inspection.
They can be required to remedy serious
shortcomings in their accommodation or
teaching and, in the case of boarding schools,
welfare of pupils. They must exclude anyone
regarded as unsuitable to teach in, or own, a
school. About 6 per cent of school children
attend independent schools.
There are about 2,400 independent schools
in Britain educating 600,000 pupils of all ages.
They charge fees varying from around £300 a
term for day pupils at nursery age to over
£4,000 a term for senior boarding pupils.
Many offer bursaries to help pupils from less
well-off families. Such pupils may also be
helped by the Government’s Assisted Places
Scheme, under which financial assistance is
given according to parental income. Over
38,000 places are offered in England, Wales
and Scotland under the scheme, which the
Government is going to double in size. The
Government also gives income-related help
with fees to pupils at eight music and ballet
schools; there are a limited number of similar
scholarships at cathedral choir schools.
Independent schools range from small
kindergartens to large day and boarding
schools, and from new and, in some cases,
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
The 600 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory
schools prepare children for entry to senior
schools. The normal age-range for these
preparatory schools is from seven-plus to 11,
12 or 13, but many have pre-preparatory
departments for younger children. A number
449
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of independent schools have been established
by religious orders and ethnic minorities.
Independent schools for older pupils—from
11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include about 550
which are often referred to as ‘public schools’.
These are members of the Headmasters’ and
Headmistresses’ Conference, the Governing
Bodies Association, the Society of
Headmasters and Headmistresses of
Independent Schools, the Girls’ Schools
Association and the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association.
In Northern Ireland the 21 independent
schools, educating about 1,000 pupils, are
subject to inspection by the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland.
Teachers
England and Wales
Teachers in state schools in England and
Wales are appointed by LEAs or school
governing bodies. They must hold
qualifications approved by the Government.
Almost all entrants to teaching in state
schools in England and Wales complete an
approved course of teacher training. These
courses are offered by university departments
of education as well as other higher education
establishments (see p. 459) and groups of
schools. One of the two main qualifications is
the four-year Bachelor of Education (BEd)
honours degree. The other is the successful
completion of a three-year degree course,
topped up by a one-year Postgraduate
Certificate in Education (PGCE) course.
Formal teacher appraisal has been
introduced in English and Welsh
schools in order to assist professional
development, strengthen the
management of schools and improve
the quality of education for pupils.
Reform of Initial Teacher Training
Under new government reforms in England
and Wales, schools play a much larger part in
initial teacher training by taking on more
responsibility for planning and managing
courses and for the selection, training and
assessment of students, usually in partnership
with institutions. The reforms enable schools
to train students to teach their specialist
subjects, assess pupils and manage classes.
The reforms allow consortia of schools to
run courses for postgraduate students if they
wish to do so. Other courses, including all
undergraduate courses, are run by universities
and colleges in partnership with schools.
The Teacher Training Agency is
responsible for accrediting training providers,
financing initial teacher training courses,
ensuring that national standards are met and
promoting teaching. In 1995 the Government
asked the Agency to introduce a new
professional qualification for headteachers. In
1996 the Government requested the Agency to
develop a national curriculum for initial
teacher training covering the core subjects of
English, mathematics and sciences. It has also
asked the Agency to produce a professional
framework for teacher training which would
set out standards and qualifications at key
stages in the profession.
In Wales, initial teacher training is funded
by the Higher Education Funding Council for
Wales, which also accredits institutions and
schools providing courses.
Other Training
Under the Licensed Teacher Scheme, a
trainee teacher is appointed to a school, which
then provides training and pays a salary; on
successful completion of a two-year period of
in-service training, qualified teacher status is
granted. The Scheme and other employment-
based routes into teaching are presently under
review. Qualified teachers from other
European Union countries are usually granted
qualified teacher status.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General Teaching
Council (GTC) for Scotland. The GTC is
responsible for disciplinary procedures under
which teachers guilty of professional
450
EDUCATION
misconduct may be removed permanently or
temporarily from the register. Advice is given
by the GTC to the Secretary of State on
teacher supply and the professional suitability
of teacher training courses.
All entrants to the teaching profession are
graduates. New primary teachers qualify either
through a four-year BEd course or a one-year
postgraduate course at a higher education
teacher training institution. Teachers of
academic subjects at secondary schools must
hold a degree with at least two passes in each
subject which they wish to teach. Secondary
school teachers must undertake a one-year
postgraduate training course or an
undergraduate course combining subject studies,
study of education and school experience.
Guidelines for initial teacher training
courses, issued in 1993, stress the importance
of partnership between teacher training
institutions and schools, and the competences
required in the classroom for teachers
beginning their careers.
All pre-service courses must be approved
by The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department. They must also be
validated by a higher education institution and
accredited by the GTC as leading to
registration. Education authorities have
developed schemes to implement national
guidelines for staff development and appraisal.
Northern Ireland
Teacher training is provided by Queen’s
University, in Belfast, the University of
Ulster, two colleges of education and the Open
University (OU—see p. 461). The principal
courses are BEd Honours (four years) and the
one-year Postgraduate Certificate of
Education. The OU course is part-time and
lasts 18 months. Education and library boards
have a statutory duty to ensure that teachers
are equipped with the necessary skills to
implement education reforms and the
Northern Ireland school curriculum.
School Curriculum
England and Wales
The National Curriculum consists of core
subjects, which are compulsory for five- to
16-year-olds, and foundation subjects, which
must be studied to the age of 14 at least. In
England the core subjects of the curriculum
are English, mathematics and science, and the
foundation subjects are technology (design and
technology, and information technology),
history, geography, music, art, physical
education and, for secondary school pupils, a
modern foreign language.
This is also the case in Wales but, in
addition, Welsh is a core subject in
Welsh-speaking schools and a foundation
subject in non-Welsh speaking schools. Nearly
all primary schools in Wales teach Welsh as a
first or second language and about a quarter
use Welsh as the sole or main medium of
instruction. In secondary schools, Welsh is
compulsory for pupils aged 11 to 16 in
Welsh-speaking schools and for pupils aged 11
to 14 in other schools. By August 1999 Welsh
will be compulsory for almost all 11- to
16-year-old pupils.
There is more choice in the curriculum for
pupils aged 14 to 16. History, geography, art
and music are all optional subjects, as are
technology and a modern foreign language in
Wales. In England a modern foreign language
and technology became compulsory subjects
for 14- to 16-year-olds in September 1996.
Religious education is required for all
pupils as part of the basic curriculum and all
secondary schools must provide sex education.
Parents have a right to withdraw their children
from these subjects (see p. 453).
A revised National Curriculum was
introduced for five- to 14-year-olds in
September 1995 and for 14- to 16-year-olds in
September 1996. This places greater emphasis
on literacy and numeracy. For each subject
programmes of study lay down what pupils
should be taught, with attainment targets
setting out the expected standards of pupils’
performance. Schools are also required to
provide pupils with the opportunity to develop
information technology skills across all
National Curriculum subjects.
In the summer of 1997 pupils’ performance
at the ages of 7, 11 and 14 will be assessed by
their teachers in the core subjects of English,
mathematics and science. Fourteen-year-olds
will also be assessed in the foundation subjects
of the National Curriculum. In addition, all
451
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
7-year-olds will take National Curriculum tests
in English and mathematics and most 11- and
14-year-olds will take tests in the core subjects.
In Welsh-speaking schools the three age
groups are tested in Welsh.
The General Certificate of Secondary
Education (GCSE) is the major qualification
taken by pupils at the end of compulsory
schooling at the age of 16. The proportion of
pupils with five or more GCSEs at grades A to
C has risen significantly in recent years. In
England, the proportion rose from nearly 33
per cent in 1988-89 to 43 per cent in 1994-95.
General supervision of examination
standards rests jointly with the School
Curriculum and Assessment Authority in
England and the Curriculum and Assessment
Authority for Wales.
The Independent Appeals Authority for
School Examinations hears appeals against
grades awarded in GCSE and GCE A level
and AS examinations (see p. 457) when the
appeals procedures of the examining body
concerned have been exhausted.
A new vocational course for pupils
aged 14 to 16 is being piloted. The
new Part One General National
Vocational Qualification (GNVQ) is
broadly equivalent to two GCSE
courses and is available in six subject
areas—business; health and social
care; manufacturing; art and design;
information technology; and leisure
and tourism. Engineering will be
introduced in September 1997.
New GCSE (Short Course) qualifications
were introduced from September 1996. These
take half the time typically allotted to a GCSE
and are available in modern foreign languages,
physical education, religious education,
geography, history, design and technology, and
information technology. For schools in Wales a
GCSE (Short Course) qualification is available
in Welsh as a second language.
A new vocational qualification for 14- to
16-year-olds in foreign languages will provide
an alternative way to assess short course
requirements in languages.
Scotland
The content and management of the
curriculum are not prescribed by statute, and
responsibility rests with education authorities
and headteachers, although guidance is
provided by the Secretary of State and the
Scottish Consultative Council on the
Curriculum. The Council has recommended
that secondary level pupils follow a broad and
balanced curriculum consisting of English,
mathematics, science, a modern European
language, social studies, technological
activities, art, music or drama, religious and
moral education, and physical education.
A major programme of curricular review
and development has been carried out for the
five to 14 age-range. The Government has
issued guidance on English language,
mathematics, expressive arts, Latin, Gaelic,
modern languages, environmental studies and
religious and moral education. Under new
arrangements, standardised tests in English
and mathematics are given to pupils in the five
to 14 age group whenever they complete one of
five levels. A major programme to extend
modern language teaching to primary schools
is in progress.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas and in some other areas
where education authorities have identified
this as a priority.
Pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard Grade at the end
of their fourth year of secondary education,
normally around the age of 16. The proportion
of pupils leaving school with no SCE
qualification has fallen significantly from one
pupil in four in 1983-84 to fewer than one in
ten in 1994-95. SCE Standard and Higher
Grade examinations are conducted by the
Scottish Examinations Board.
The Higher Grade can be taken in the fifth
and/or sixth year of secondary education.
Some pupils also sit examinations for the
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies or take
vocational National Certificate units (see p.
457) awarded by the Scottish Vocational
Education Council. A new system of courses
for fifth and sixth year pupils is being
developed (see p. 458).
452
EDUCATION
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Curriculum,
compulsory in all publicly financed schools, is
made up of religious education and six broad
areas of study: English, mathematics, science
and technology, the environment and society,
creative and expressive studies, and, in
secondary schools, language studies.
The Curriculum also includes four
compulsory cross-curricular themes: cultural
heritage, education for mutual understanding,
health education and information technology.
Secondary schools have two additional themes
—economic awareness and careers education.
Following reviews of the Curriculum, new
arrangements taking effect in September 1996
have reduced its overall content in primary
schools and have allowed secondary schools
and pupils more flexibility in subject choice.
Teaching of the Curriculum takes up about 85
per cent of teaching time in primary schools
and 60 to 65 per cent in secondary schools.
Pupil assessment became statutory in
September 1996. Pupils are being assessed in
English and maths at the ages of 8 and 11; if
a pupil is taught in the Irish language, he or
she is assessed in Irish and mathematics at
the age of 8 and in English, Irish and
mathematics at the age of 11. Fourteen-
year-olds will additionally be assessed in
science. As in England and Wales, the GCSE
examination is used to assess 16-year-old
pupils.
Religious Education and Collective Worship
In England and Wales state schools must
provide religious education and a daily act of
collective worship for all registered pupils.
Every LEA has to produce a religious
education syllabus, which is agreed locally and
must be reviewed every five years. Syllabuses
must reflect Christianity while taking account
of the other main religions practised in Britain.
The School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority has published model syllabuses for
religious education in England to help promote
quality; LEAs may adopt one of the models in
full or draw on them when preparing the local
syllabus. Parents have the right to withdraw
their children from religious education classes
and from collective worship. Voluntary-aided
schools provide the opportunity for
denominational religious education.
Scottish education authorities are required
to see that schools practise religious observance
and give pupils religious instruction; parents
may withdraw their children if they wish.
Certain schools provide for Roman Catholic
children, but in all schools there are safeguards
for individual conscience.
In Northern Ireland, schools must provide
religious education and collective worship,
although parents have the right to withdraw
their children from both. A core syllabus has
been approved by the four main churches in
Northern Ireland and this must be taught in all
grant-aided schools.
Sex Education
All state secondary schools in England and
Wales are required to provide sex education
for all pupils registered at the school. This
must include education about HIV and AIDS
and sexually transmitted diseases. In state
primary schools the governors must consider
whether sex education should be offered
beyond the requirements of the National
Curriculum Science Order.
Sex education in state schools must
encourage young people to have regard to
moral considerations and the value of family
life. Parents are entitled to withdraw their
children from sex education classes other than
those required by the National Curriculum.
All state schools must publish in their
prospectus a summary of the content and
organisation of any sex education provided.
In Scotland, government guidance on sex
education is provided to education authorities
and headteachers, who are responsible for the
content of the curriculum.
In Northern Ireland sex education is taught
through the compulsory science programme of
study and the health education cross-curricular
theme.
Curriculum Development and
Assessment
The School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority in England and the Curriculum and
Assessment Authority for Wales are
responsible for:
453
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• keeping all aspects of the school
curriculum and of school examinations
under review;
• advising the Government on the
curriculum, and assessment and
examination arrangements; and
• publishing information about the
curriculum.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered
to pupils of compulsory school age in state
schools in England and Wales must be
approved by the Government. Associated
syllabuses and assessment procedures must
comply with national guidelines and be
approved by the relevant curriculum and
assessment authority.
In Scotland curriculum development is
undertaken by the Scottish Consultative
Council on the Curriculum in consultation
with The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department. The Scottish
Examination Board liaises with the Council on
links between the curriculum and assessment.
The Northern Ireland Council for the
Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment is
responsible for advising the Department of
Education on the Curriculum and its
assessment, and for the conduct of
examinations.
Information Technology
The National Curriculum places a strong
emphasis on the use of information
technology (IT) to ensure that all children
are appropriately versed in the new
technologies. In England the average number
of pupils per microcomputer in primary
schools in 1993-94 was 18 compared with 25
in 1991-92 and 107 in 1984-85. In secondary
schools the average number of pupils per
microcomputer was ten in 1993-94 compared
with 13 in 1991-92 and 60 in 1984-85.
Under a current scheme, managed by the
National Council for Educational
Technology (see below), two teachers in each
of up to 600 schools have been given a
multimedia portable computer to develop
their expertise. One third of primary schools
in England have multimedia computers. The
Department for Education and Employment
funds the use of CD-ROM technology in
schools in England.
In 1995 the Government announced a £10
million initiative designed to help schools and
colleges to pilot the use of intermediate and
broadband technologies. The initiative draws
together the efforts of educational institutions,
private companies, education authorities and
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs).
In Wales the Welsh Office also has a grant
programme to support microcomputers in
schools and has financed the installation of
satellite television equipment in all secondary
schools. This is used to teach modern foreign
languages and other subjects. A scheme to
supply all primary and special schools in Wales
with either multimedia equipment and
software, or portable computers, has just been
implemented.
In Scotland computing studies are included
in the five to 14 age group national guidelines
on environmental studies. In most secondary
schools, first and second year pupils take a
short course in computing; third and fourth
year pupils choose between a Standard Grade
course or a National Certificate module.
Similarly, fifth and sixth year pupils are able to
choose between Higher Grade and a number
of National Certificate modules.
In Northern Ireland, IT is one of the four
compulsory educational cross-curricular
themes forming part of the curriculum for
primary and secondary pupils in publicly
financed schools.
The four Government education
departments jointly fund the National Council
for Educational Technology, which promotes
and evaluates the use of new technologies in
education and training. The Scottish Council
for Educational Technology also develops
software and other applications geared to the
curriculum and school organisation in
Scotland.
Other Educational Aids
The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation)
and the independent Channel 4 transmit radio
and television programmes designed for
schools (see p. 505). Teachers’ notes, pupils’
pamphlets and computer software accompany
many broadcast series.
454
EDUCATION
School Inspections
Various inspectorates report to the
Government on the quality of education
provided by schools.
England
In England the independent Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) advises
the Secretary of State on quality, standards
and efficiency, and regulates a system of school
inspections. The inspection cycle began in
September 1993 for secondary schools and in
September 1994 for primary and other schools.
Every school has to be inspected every four
years by a team of independent
inspectors—headed by a registered
inspector—containing educationists and lay
people. Inspections take place according to
agreed national standards monitored by
OFSTED. Parents are sent a summary of the
inspection report, which is published in full.
School governing bodies must prepare action
plans to follow it up and report back to parents
on their progress. OFSTED is headed by Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools.
A review of the school inspection system is
in progress. This proposes that all schools
must be inspected at least once within a
six-year period, while some may be inspected
more often, and that inspection resources
should be targeted upon schools which are
failing or have serious weaknesses.
Wales
Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools for
Wales has similar functions to those of
OFSTED. All schools are inspected every five
years in the first instance.
Scotland
In Scotland HM Inspectors of Schools (HMI)
are responsible for independent evaluation of
education standards and for advising the
Secretary of State. Reports are published on
inspections and given to parents. Inspectors
return to the school between one and two years
after the publication of the report to assess
progress in meeting their recommendations.
Their conclusions about progress are
published, together with an indication of any
further action which may be required. The
school remains a focus for attention by HMI
until the recommendations have been
satisfactorily addressed.
The Inspectorate’s Audit Unit collects,
analyses and publishes evidence about the
performance of schools and education
authorities. Evidence is published on a
comparative basis, and recommendations are
made for action and improvement.
Northern Ireland
The Education and Training Inspectorate
evaluates, reports and advises on quality and
standards in schools. Inspection reports are
published and a summary is provided for
parents. Where follow-up action is judged by
an inspection team to be necessary, school
governors are required to indicate any action
planned and to submit details to the
Department of Education. Schools have to be
inspected every five years and there is
provision for lay involvement in inspections.
The Inspectorate is headed by the Chief
Inspector, who is the main adviser on
professional issues to the Department of
Education.
Schools, Careers and Business
One of the Government’s key objectives is to
help young people develop the skills the
economy needs. Some 98 per cent of pupils in
their final year of compulsory education in
England are offered at least one week of work
experience.
Education Business Partnerships, consisting
of representatives from industry, education
and the wider community, aim to bring about
closer links between education and industry in
Great Britain and ensure that young people
develop the skills to help them succeed in the
labour market.
One of the main schemes managed by the
Partnerships is the Teacher Placement Service
(TPS), funded by the Government. The TPS
organises placements in business for teachers
and lecturers to extend their professional and
personal development, improve learning
455
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
opportunities for young people, and provide
better careers education services. Since 1989
190,000 teachers have been on placements.
Compacts bring together employers, young
people, schools, colleges and other bodies
involved in training in order to help young
people achieve more at school, and to continue
their education and training after the age of 16.
Under Compact schemes, young people work
towards agreed goals, while employers provide
a number of incentives for achieving them.
The Government’s Project Business
scheme offers young people the opportunity to
learn how business works and acquire the work
skills needed by employers. Business
volunteers work with teachers and business/
works visits are arranged for young people.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are
entitled to impartial careers guidance. Most
schools have a written policy statement on
careers education and guidance, a careers
co-ordinator and an agreement with their local
careers guidance service about the
co-ordinated contribution they will make to
student development. LEAs are active
participants in the majority of careers service
organisations.
In Northern Ireland careers education is
one of the six compulsory education themes
forming part of the secondary school
curriculum (see p. 453). The Careers Service is
part of the Training and Employment Agency.
All state secondary schools in England and
Wales have to provide leavers with a National
Record of Achievement setting out their school
attainments, including public examination and
National Curriculum assessment results. In
Scotland the Record is not compulsory.
In Northern Ireland all pupils in secondary
education are issued with a Record of
Achievement on leaving school, and from
1997-98 this will apply to primary schools too.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AFTER 16
About 71 per cent of 16-year-old pupils choose
to continue in full-time education after 16: in
school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges, further
education colleges, universities and other
higher education institutions. The percentage
for 17- and 18-year-olds is 59 per cent and 40
per cent respectively.
Broadly speaking, education after 16
outside schools is divided into further and
higher education. Further education
(including education for adults) is largely
vocational and in England covers courses up to
and including GCE A level and AS
qualifications, and GNVQ^Advanced level or
their equivalents (see p. 457). Higher
education covers advanced courses at levels
higher than GCE A level or equivalent. About
3.8 million people were enrolled on further
education courses in 1994—95. Youth credits
are on offer from Training and Enterprise
Councils in England and Wales and from
Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland (see
p. 189). They enable 16- and 17-year-olds
leaving full-time education to obtain vocational
education and training through their employer
or a specialist training provider.
In 1994—95 there were 1.7 million home and
overseas students in higher education, of
whom 49 per cent were women.
Credit accumulation and transfer schemes
are in use in many English and Welsh
post-school establishments. In Scotland a
credit accumulation scheme covers courses in
all further and higher education. Similar
schemes in higher education in Northern
Ireland are compatible with those of
institutions in the rest of Britain.
The national computer-based Educational
Counselling and Credit Transfer Information
Service (ECCTIS) provides prospective
students and their advisers with quick and easy
access without charge to information on course
opportunities at universities and colleges of
higher and further education throughout
Britain. ECCTIS, which is available to
subscribing institutions on CD-ROM, can be
found in over two-thirds of secondary schools
with sixth forms, as well as the majority of
further education colleges, higher education
institutions, careers offices and Training and
Enterprise Councils; ECCTIS is also available
at British Council offices throughout the
world.
456
EDUCATION
Schools and Sixth-form Colleges
Having taken the GCSE examination (see
p. 452), students in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland can stay on at school or be
educated in a further education college.
Students in England and Wales can also study
at sixth-form colleges. They study for
examinations which are the main standard for
entry to higher education or professional
training. These include the academic General
Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced (A)
level, the Advanced Supplementary (AS)
examination, Advanced General National
Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) and
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs).
The GCE A level is usually taken at the age of
18 or 19 after two years’ study; part of the
qualification is based on course work and the
rest on written test papers. AS levels enable
sixth-form pupils to study a wider range of
subjects. Arts students, for example, can still
study science subjects at AS level.
Equality of status for academic and
vocational qualifications is being promoted in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
new GNVQs for young people in full-time
education between the ages of 16 and 18
provide a broad-based preparation for a range
of occupations and higher education, and are
designed to have parity of esteem with GCE A
levels. There are three GNVQJevels—
Advanced, Intermediate and Foundation. An
Advanced GNVQ;—called the vocational A
level—requires a level of achievement broadly
equal to two GCE A levels. GNVQs may also
be taken in combination with other
qualifications, such as GCE A levels or
GCSEs.
GNVQs are accredited by the National
Council for Vocational Qualifications. They
are awarded by the City and Guilds of London
Institute, the RSA Examinations Board and
the Business and Technology Education
Council (BTEC).
In 1996 an official report was published
setting out an agenda for changes designed to
raise standards in qualifications for 16- to
19-year-olds and increase participation and
achievement in education and training for
young people. Consequently, the Government
plans to introduce a new qualifications
framework in 1998 which will provide for
revised and strengthened general and
vocational qualifications, offering young people
more choice.
Skills valued by employers will be given a
higher priority in the new framework. More
young people will be offered the opportunity
to gain a qualification in the three key skills of
communication, numeracy and information
technology which are already compulsory in
GNVQs and some publicly-funded youth
training schemes.
The Government has accepted the report’s
recommendation that a single organisation
should oversee both academic and vocational
qualifications in England by taking over the
roles of the School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority and the National
Council for Vocational Qualifications. This
will be created in 1997, subject to
parliamentary approval. Similar arrangements
are being considered for Wales.
Scotland
Pupils staying on at school after the end of
compulsory education study for the Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education
examination between the ages of 16 and 18;
passes at this grade are the basis for entry to
higher education or professional training. The
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS) is for
pupils who have completed their Higher
Grade main studies and who wish to continue
studies in particular subjects.
A flexible system of vocational courses for
16- to 18-year-olds has been introduced in
schools and colleges in disciplines such as
business and administration, engineering and
industrial production. These courses are also
intended to meet the needs of many adults
entering training or returning to education.
The courses lead to the award of the
non-advanced National Certificate, intended
for students over 16 who have successfully
completed a programme of vocational courses
based on short study units. Similar unit-based
courses are also available at advanced levels,
leading to the award of a Higher National
Certificate or Diploma.
General Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(General SVQs) are designed to meet the
457
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
needs of 16- to 19-year-olds at school or in
further education colleges. Broadly compatible
with the GNVQs in the rest of Britain,
General SVQs are a stepping-stone to higher
education or further training. They are
accredited and awarded by the Scottish
Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC).
A new five-level system of courses and
awards for fifth- and sixth-year pupils will take
effect in the late 1990s. Under this, Highers
will remain as one of the levels but courses will
be based on units of study of 40 or 80 hours.
The recommended study time for each Higher
will be extended from 120 hours to 160 hours.
Existing courses of the Scottish Examinations
Board and SCOTVEC will be drawn into a
unified system of curriculum and assessment.
Advanced Higher courses will be developed,
incorporating the current Certificate of Sixth
Year Studies and building on Highers to
provide a two-year 320-hour course. Group
awards will be available at all five levels. The
Scottish Examinations Board and SCOTVEC
will be replaced in 1997 by a single body called
the Scottish Qualifications Authority.
Further Education Colleges
People over the age of 16 can also take courses
in further education colleges. Much further
education is work-related and vocational.
Further education institutions supply much of
the education element in government-
sponsored training programmes. The number
of students in further education is forecast to
rise by 20 per cent between 1994 and 1999.

"Includes enrolments on Youth Training in public sector
colleges and adult education centres.
Many students on further education
courses attend part-time, either by day release
or block release from employment or during
the evenings. The system has strong ties with
commerce and industry, and co-operation with
business is encouraged by the Government and
its agencies. Employers are normally involved
in designing courses.
Courses are run by some 550 institutions of
further education, many of which also offer
higher education courses (see p. 459). In
England and Wales each is controlled by an
autonomous further education corporation and
governing body with substantial representation
from business. Scottish colleges are controlled
by autonomous boards of management.
Funds are allocated to institutions by
further education funding councils in England
and Wales; part of the funding is not cash
limited and is directly related to student
numbers. The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department distributes funds to
colleges in Scotland. In Northern Ireland
further education colleges are financed via the
education and library boards by the
Department of Education. Institutions in
England, Wales and Scotland are obliged to
publish information about how they use their
financial and other resources.
Funding councils in England and Wales
send out independent inspectors to assess the
quality of the education provided by colleges.
They publish reports containing quality
assessments, and colleges are obliged to explain
how they will put things right if there are
major criticisms. Each college has to publish
information about its examination results
annually. Colleges in Scotland are inspected by
HM Inspectors of Schools (see p. 455) and in
Northern Ireland by the Education and
Training Inspectorate.
Vocational Qualifications
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications has established a framework of
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland which
offers equal access and opportunity for all.
NVQs are applicable to nearly 90 per cent of
jobs. National standards of competence,
knowledge and understanding, which have to
458
EDUCATION
be demonstrated by successful candidates, are
set by industry lead bodies (consisting of
representatives of employers, trade unions and
professional groups) supported by the
Department for Education and Employment.
Lead bodies are often formed by Industry
Training Organisations (see p. 189). NVQs are
established at five levels:
• Level 1—foundation
• Level 2—basic craft
• Level 3—technician, advanced craft,
supervisor
• Level 4—higher technician, middle
management
• Level 5—middle to higher management,
professional.
NVQs consist of units which set out the
standards which the individual must reach in a
range of tasks. The individual is assessed on
the performance of these tasks, this process
consisting of observation in the workplace.
Assessment may also include practical
simulation, oral questioning, assignments and
course work.
In Scotland there is an analogous system of
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs).
NVQs and SVQs have mutual recognition
throughout Britain.
Modern Apprenticeships, which started in
1995 (see p. 191), are employer-based and
designed to train young people at work and
qualify them to NVQJevel 3 or above.
Awarding Bodies
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications does not award NVQs. The
three largest NVQjawarding bodies are the
City and Guilds of London Institute, the RSA
Examinations Board and the London Chamber
of Commerce and Industry Examinations
Board. NVQs are also awarded by a large
number of smaller organisations, many of
which are industry-specific or professional
bodies. The awarding bodies examine and
validate vocational education and training and
their awards must meet the NVQ^criteria and
be submitted to the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications for accreditation.
Accreditation is given for a maximum of five
years. Re-accreditation must then be sought.
In Scotland the Scottish Vocational
Education Council is the national accreditation
body and the main awarding organisation.
National Targets for Education and
Training
The Government has endorsed new national
targets for education and training announced
in 1995 by the National Advisory Council for
Education and Training Targets. The main
targets, which have been set for the year 2000,
are that:
• by age 19, 85 per cent of young people
should achieve five GCSEs at Grade C or
above, an Intermediate GNVQ^or an
NVQ^Level 2; and
• by age 21, 60 per cent of young people
should achieve two GCE A levels, an
Advanced GNVQ^or an NVQ^Level 3.
There is a separate system of targets in
Scotland for the year 2000. These are that:
• by the age of 19, 85 per cent of young
people should attain SVQJLevel II or five
standard SCE grades (1-3) or equivalent;
and
• by the age of 21, 70 per cent of young
people should achieve SVQJevel III or
three Highers (A-C).
Higher Education
Higher education, which consists of degree
and equivalent courses, has experienced a
dramatic expansion since the 1980s. The total
number of full-time and part-time higher
education students in Britain almost doubled
between 1979 and 1995 to some 1.7 million.
The proportion of young people entering
full-time higher education is roughly one in
three.
In order to maintain British expertise in
science, engineering and technology, the
Government has taken steps to promote these
subjects at all levels.
Higher education institutions are
responsible for providing high-quality
education. The Higher Education Quality
Council, financed by subscriptions from
institutions, ensures that satisfactory quality
459
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
control arrangements are in place. The higher
education funding councils for England,
Scotland and Wales (see below) carry out
subject assessments of the quality of teaching
and learning provision, publish regular reports
on their findings and aim to ensure that any
serious problems are put right by the
university or college concerned. Acting on
behalf of the Department of Education for
Northern Ireland, the Higher Education
Funding Council for England publishes
reports on the quality of teaching and learning
provision in the two Northern Ireland
universities.
The Government has set up a National
Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education
to make recommendations on how the future
shape, structure, size and funding of higher
education should develop to meet needs over
the next 20 years.
Finance
Higher education is largely financed by public
funds, tuition fees for students paid through
the student awards system and income
received by institutions from research
contracts and other sources.
Government finance for higher education
institutions in England, Scotland and W ales is
distributed by higher education funding
councils responsible to their respective
Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland grant
is paid direct to the two universities by the
Department of Education, following advice
from the Northern Ireland Higher Education
Council. The private University of
Buckingham receives no public grants.

^Includes the Open University.
The funding councils and the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland help meet
the costs of teaching, research and related
activities in all publicly funded universities and
higher education colleges. In addition to
teaching students, institutions undertake paid
training, research or consultancy for
commercial firms. Many establishments have
endowments or receive grants from
foundations and benefactors. Some 30 per cent
of higher education income originates from
private sources.
Student Grants and Loans
Over 95 per cent of full-time students resident
in England and Wales on first degree and other
comparable higher education courses receive
mandatory awards covering tuition fees and a
maintenance grant. The level of the grant
depends on the income of the student and of
the student’s parents or spouse. Awards are
made by LEAs in England and Wales. The
Government reimburses in full the amount
spent by education authorities on mandatory
awards. Similar schemes are administered by
the Student Awards Agency for Scotland and
the Northern Ireland education and library
boards. LEA grants for other courses can be
given at their discretion.
Most students on courses of full-time,
non-postgraduate higher education can also
take out a loan to help pay their maintenance
costs. Loans are not means tested and
repayments are indexed to inflation. The
scheme is designed to share the cost of student
maintenance more equitably between students,
parents and the taxpayer. In the academic year
1995-96 loans worth £701 million were made
to 559,902 students in Britain, representing
59 per cent of those eligible. Loans are
administered by the Student Loans Company
in Glasgow. In addition, legislation passed in
1996 allows banks and building societies to
operate loan schemes at favourable rates.
Limited access funds administered by
universities and colleges are available to people
in cases where access to higher and further
education might be inhibited by financial
considerations or where students face real
financial difficulties. In 1996-97, there is
provision of £27.7 million in England, £4.3
460
EDUCATION
million in Scotland, £1.7 million in Wales and
£868,000 in Northern Ireland for this purpose.
Grants for postgraduate study are offered
by the government education departments and
by the research councils. Increasing numbers
of scholarships are available from research
charities, endowments and particular
industries or companies.
Access Courses
Access and foundation courses provide a
preparation and an appropriate test before
enrolment on a course of higher education for
prospective students who do not possess the
standard entry qualifications (GCE A levels
and equivalent qualifications). Many are from
the ethnic minority communities.
The Scottish Wider Access Programme
(SWAP) is designed to promote greater
participation in higher education by mature
students and those without the normal entry
requirements. Successful completion of a
SWAP course guarantees a higher education
place.
Universities
There are some 90 universities in Britain,
including the Open University. They are
governed by royal charters or by Act of
Parliament and enjoy academic freedom. They
appoint their own staff, decide which students
to admit, provide their own courses and award
their own degrees. The universities of Oxford
and Cambridge date from the 12th and 13th
centuries, and the Scottish universities of St
Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh
from the 14th and 15th centuries. All the other
universities in Britain were founded in the
19th and 20th centuries. The 1960s saw
considerable expansion in the number of new
universities. The number of universities also
jumped considerably in 1992, when
polytechnics were given their own
degree-awarding powers and were allowed to
take the university title. At the same time,
similar provision was made for higher
education colleges which met certain criteria.
Applications for first degree courses are
usually made through the Universities and
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS), in
Cheltenham.
First degree courses are mainly full-time
and usually last three years in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. However, there are
some four-year courses, and medical and
veterinary courses normally require five years.
All traditional first degree courses in Scotland
require a minimum of three years’ study (or
four years to honours level). The ratio of staff
to full-time students in England is about 1 to
16.5.
Universities offer courses in a wide range of
subjects, including traditional arts subjects and
science and technology. Some courses lead to
the examinations of the chief professional
bodies.
Many universities have close links with
commerce and industry; some students have a
job and attend on a part-time basis.
Degree titles vary according to the practice
of each university. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland the most common titles for a
first degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or
Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second
degree Master of Arts (MA), Master of
Science (MSc), and Doctor of Philosophy
(PhD). In the older Scottish universities
Master is used for a first degree in arts
subjects. Uniformity of standards between
universities is promoted by employing external
examiners for all university examinations.
Some universities are responsible for
validating degrees at higher education
institutions without degree-awarding powers.
Many staff combine research with teaching
duties. The number of postgraduates has
increased by over 53 per cent in the last
decade; 74 per cent are on taught courses. The
Government is encouraging universities to
co-operate closely with industry on research.
Around 50 science parks have been set up by
higher education institutions in conjunction
with industrial scientists and technologists to
promote the development and commercial
application of advanced technology.
The Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
for adult students of all ages in Britain, the
European Union, Gibraltar, Slovenia and
Switzerland.
461
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The University uses a combination of
specially produced printed texts,
correspondence tuition, television and radio
broadcasts, audio/video cassettes and
computing. For some courses there are
residential schools. There is a network of study
centres for contact with part-time tutors and
counsellors, and with fellow students. Formal
academic qualifications are not required to
register for most courses. Its first degrees are
the BA (Open) or the BSc (Open), which are
general degrees awarded on a system of credits
for each course completed. There is also an
MMath degree for students who have taken an
approved combination of courses specialising
in mathematics, and an MEng degree for those
who have taken an approved combination of
courses to achieve the highest professional
status of Chartered Engineer. In 1996 there
were 104,373 registered undergraduates, and
in all 143,828 first degrees have been awarded
since the University started its courses in 1970.
The University also has a programme of
higher degrees. About 9,900 students were
registered on higher degree courses in 1996.
There are also programmes for professionals in
a variety of fields.
The University has advised many other
countries on setting up similar institutions,
and has contributed to projects such as the
European Distance Education Network. It is
financed by the Higher Education Funding
Council for England.
Further Education for Adults
Further education for adults is provided by
further education institutions, adult centres
and colleges run by LEAs, and voluntary
bodies such as the Workers’ Educational
Association. The duty to secure it is shared by
the further education funding councils, The
Scottish Office Education and Industry
Department and LEAs.
The councils and The Scottish Office
Education and Industry Department fund
formal academic and vocational courses,
courses providing access to higher education
and courses in basic literacy and numeracy,
including English for speakers of other
languages. LEAs are responsible for the less
formal leisure and recreational courses. The
councils, The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department and the LEAs must take
account of adult students with special
educational needs.
University departments of continuing
education also provide courses for adults.
Basic Skills Agency
The Basic Skills Agency (BSA) is concerned
with adult literacy, numeracy and related basic
skills in England and Wales. It provides
consultancy and advisory services; funds local
development projects, including research;
publishes materials for teachers and students;
and organises and sponsors staff training.
Government funding of the BSA was worth
about £4 million in 1995-96.
Following a recent review, the BSA has
become a more general basic skills unit which
covers basic skills training in the workplace for
the unemployed and for young people as well
as its traditional work with adults.
National Institute of Adult Continuing Education
The National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education (England and Wales)—known as
NIACE—is the national organisation for adult
learning, representing all interests in the
education and training of adults. It is a
membership body and a registered charity. It
convenes conferences, seminars and meetings,
collects and disseminates information,
conducts inquiries and research, undertakes
special projects and works with other
organisations.
Open and Distance Learning
The terms ‘open’ and ‘distance’ learning
broadly mean learning undertaken through use
of various media, such as television, without
the direct supervision of a tutor. More further
education colleges are incorporating many
distance learning materials and methods in
their mainstream courses.
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes all
462
EDUCATION
community education matters, including adult
literacy and basic education, and youth work.
Educational Research
Educational research is supported financially
by government departments, the Economic
and Social Research Council, philanthropic
organisations, higher education institutions,
teachers’ associations and other agencies.
The major research institutions outside the
universities are the autonomous National
Foundation for Educational Research in
England and Wales, and the Scottish Council
for Research in Education.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people come to Britain from
other countries to study, and British people
work and train overseas. The British aid
programme encourages links between
educational institutions in Britain and
developing countries.
There has been an expansion of interest in
European studies and languages in recent
years, with exchanges of teachers,
schoolchildren and students taking place.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU
SOCRATES programme, through which
grants are provided to enable EU students
and those from other countries belonging to
the European Economic Area (see p. 127)
to study in other states. The programme
covers all academic subjects, and the period
of study normally lasts between three and
12 months.
Another SOCRATES scheme promotes
competence in foreign languages. It offers
funding which contributes towards in-service
training for teachers, student exchanges based
on project work, and the development of new
teaching methods. In 1994—95 nearly 12,000
British students were studying in other EU
member states.
Youth for Europe III aims to bring together
young people from different cultural and social
backgrounds in the European Union through a
wide range of exchanges. The five-year
programme started in 1995 and has an EU
budget of £102 million.
A new EU vocational training programme
—LEONARDO DA VINCI—came into force
in January 1995 and replaces a number of
previous programmes, including COMETT
(university/industry co-operation) and
PETRA (training of young people).
EU member states have created nine
European schools, including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire, for pupils aged between four and
19, to provide a multilingual education for the
children of staff employed in EU institutions.
Overseas Students in Britain
British universities and other higher and
further education establishments have built up
a strong reputation overseas by offering tuition
of the highest standards and maintaining low
student-to-staff ratios.
In 1994-95 there were some 158,000
overseas students at publicly funded higher
and further education institutions in Britain.
Their numbers have more than trebled since
1982-83 when there were about 50,700.
Most overseas students following courses of
higher or further education pay fees covering
the full cost of their courses.
Nationals of other member countries of the
European Union generally pay the lower level
of fees applicable to British students; if their
courses are designated for mandatory awards,
they may be eligible for fees-only awards from
LEAs. Students attending Scottish institutions
apply either to the Student Awards Agency for
Scotland, the appropriate local council or one
of the 43 Scottish incorporated further
education colleges depending on the place and
level of the course.
;
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for foreign students and trainees
through its overseas aid programme and other
award and scholarship schemes. In 1994-95
some 15,500 overseas students were supported,
at a cost of £115 million.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office
463
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(FCO) finances the British Chevening
Scholarships, a worldwide programme offering
outstanding graduate students and young
professionals the opportunity to spend time
studying at British universities and other
academic institutions. In 1995-96 the FCO
spent some £32 million on over 4,000
scholarships for students from 150 countries.
These included jointly funded scholarships for
overseas students co-sponsored by the FCO,
business and industry, grant-giving
foundations, the Churches and universities;
some 760 scholarships were provided under
these arrangements in 1995-96.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded by
the Higher Education Funding Councils,
provides assistance for overseas full-time
postgraduate students with outstanding
research potential.
Other Schemes
Many public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas.. Among the best known are the
British Council Fellowships, the
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the
British Marshall Scholarships, the Rhodes
Scholarships, the Churchill Scholarships and
the Confederation of British Industry
Scholarships. Most British universities and
colleges offer bursaries and scholarships for
which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service—a partnership between
local government and voluntary
organisations—is concerned with the informal
personal and social education of young people
aged 11 to 25 (five to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Many of the voluntary organisations were
established at the end of the 19th century and
in the first decade of the 20th. In 1944 the
Education Act provided for the development
of a youth service in England and Wales by
LEAs in partnership with the voluntary
organisations.
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional voluntary
organisations. The service is said to reach
around 5 million young people, the voluntary
organisations contributing a significant
proportion of overall provision.
The Department for Education and
Employment’s Youth Service Unit gives
grants to the national voluntary youth
organisations to meet 50 per cent of the cost
of programmes designed to promote access to
the youth service, support training for
voluntary youth workers and help improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the
organisations.
Funded primarily by local government,
England’s National Youth Agency provides:
• support for those working with young
people;
• information and publishing services; and
• support for curriculum development.
It is also responsible for the accreditation of
training and staff development for youth
workers.
The Welsh Office provides grant aid to
national youth service bodies with
headquarters in Wales and has established a
Wales Youth Agency.
In Scotland the youth service forms part of
the community education provision made by
local authorities. It is also promoted by the
Scottish Community Education Council. The
Scottish Office gives grants to voluntary youth
organisations to assist them with their
headquarters expenditure and staff training.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund youth clubs
and outdoor activity centres, help pay the
running costs of registered voluntary youth
units, advise and support youth groups and
assist young people visiting the rest of
Britain, Ireland and overseas in connection
with annual camps and award schemes. The
Youth Council for Northern Ireland advises
the education system on the development of
the youth service, promotes the provision of
facilities and encourages cross-community
activity.
464
EDUCATION
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake a significant share of youth activities
through local groups, which raise most of their
day-to-day expenses by their own efforts.
Many receive financial and other help from
LEAs, which also make available facilities in
many areas. The voluntary organisations vary
greatly in character and include the uniformed
organisations, such as the Scouts and Girl
Guides. Some organisations are church-based.
Some also represent Jews and Muslims. Sport
and the arts are catered for by various bodies.
In Wales, Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh
League of Youth) provides cultural, sporting
and language-based activities for young Welsh
speakers and learners.
Thousands of youth clubs encourage their
members to participate in sport, cultural and
other creative activities. Some youth clubs
provide information, counselling and advice.
Many local authorities and voluntary youth
organisations make provision for the young
unemployed, young people from the ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Other areas of concern are
homelessness and provision for handicapped
young people.
Many authorities have youth committees on
which official and voluntary bodies are
represented. They employ youth officers to
co-ordinate youth work and to arrange
in-service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth
and community workers; several
undergraduate part-time and postgraduate
courses are also available. In Scotland one-,
two- and three-year courses are provided at
colleges of education. Students from
Northern Ireland attend courses run in
universities and colleges in Britain and the
Irish Republic.
Other Organisations Concerned with
Young People
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. The Prince’s Trust and the
Royal Jubilee Trust provide grants and
practical help to individuals and organisations;
areas of concern include urban deprivation,
unemployment, homelessness, and young
offenders. Efforts are also made to assist ethnic
minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from Britain and
other Commonwealth countries to meet certain
standards in activities such as community
service, expeditions, social and practical skills
and physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to
help those in need, including elderly and
disabled people. Many schools also organise
community service work as part of the
curriculum.

28 Religion
Introduction 466 Other Religions 472
The Christian Community 468 Co-operation between Faiths 474
Everyone in Britain has the right to religious freedom without interference from
the community or the State. Religious organisations and groups may own
property, conduct their rites and ceremonies, run schools, and promote their
beliefs in speech and writing, within the limits of the law. There is no religious
bar to the holding of public office.
INTRODUCTION
Most of the world’s religions are represented
in Britain. While there are large Hindu,
Jewish, Muslim and Sikh communities, and
also smaller communities of Baha’is,
Buddhists, Jains and Zoroastrians, as well as
numbers of pagans and followers of new
religious movements, Britain is
predominantly Christian. Non-religious
alternatives for humanists and atheists are
offered by organisations such as the British
Humanist Association and the National
Secular Society, although most humanists
and atheists do not belong to organised
groups. Many Britons would class
themselves as agnostic.
There has been a fall in recent years in the
number of full-time ministers and the number
of adults recorded as members of most of the
larger Christian churches. At the same time
there has been significant growth in a range of
independent churches, and in new religious
movements. Surveys have also revealed that
many people who do not belong to religious
groups claim to be religious and say they
believe in God.
Religious Freedom
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was
achieved gradually from the 17th century
onwards. The older laws discriminating
against minority religious groups were
gradually enforced less harshly and then finally
repealed. Heresy ceased to be a legal offence
with the passage of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration Act
1688 granted freedom of worship to Protestant
minority groups.
In 1828 the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts gave nonconformist
Protestant Christians full political rights,
making it possible for them to be appointed to
public office. Roman Catholics gained political
rights under the Roman Catholic Relief Act
1829, and the Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled
Jews to become Members of Parliament. The
religious tests imposed on prospective students
and academic staff of the universities of
Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were
successively abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856
and 1871. Similar restrictions on the staff of
Scottish universities were formally removed in
1932.
466
RELIGION
The past 30 years have seen an increasingly
diverse pattern of religious belief and
affiliation in Britain. This has been linked both
to patterns of immigration and to new religious
directions among some of the indigenous
population. Social structures have been
gradually changing to accommodate this. For
example, arrangements are made at many
places of work to allow the members of the
various faiths to follow their religious
observances.
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in Britain,
that is, churches legally recognised as official
churches of the State: in England the Anglican
Church of England, and in Scotland the
(Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. The
Monarch is pledged by the coronation oath to
defend each Church in its respective territory.
There is no longer an established Church in
Wales or in Northern Ireland. Ministers of the
established churches, as well as clergy
belonging to other religious groups, work in
services run by the State, such as the armed
forces, national hospitals and prisons, and may
be paid a state salary for such services.
Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds. Religious
education in publicly maintained schools is
required by law throughout Britain, as is a
daily act of collective worship (see p. 453).
Religious broadcasting is subject to some
legislative controls (see p. 505).
The State does not contribute to the general
expenses of church maintenance, although
some state aid does help repair historic
churches. In 1995-96, for instance, English
Heritage grants to churches totalled £10.8
million as compared with the £100 million
spent on the buildings by parishes. Assistance
is also given to meet some of the costs of
repairing cathedrals and comparable buildings;
some £4 million is being made available in
1996-97. This funding is not restricted to
Chureh of England buildings.
The Government shares with the Church of
England the upkeep of nearly 300 churches of
special architectural or historic importance
which are no longer required for regular parish
use and for which no alternative use can be
found. The contribution for the period 1994 to
1997 is about £7.2 million. In 1993 the
Historic Chapels Trust was launched, with the
aim of preserving the redundant chapels and
places of worship of other denominations and
faiths, including synagogues and temples,
which are of particular architectural or historic
interest.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social issues
was highlighted in the Church of England
report Faith in the City: A Call for Action by
Church and Nation, published in 1985. This
led to the establishment of the Church of
England’s Church Urban Fund, an
independent charity which raises money to
enable people living in urban priority areas to
found projects which alleviate the effects of
poverty on their lives. By June 1996 it had
made grants totalling £23.5 million to 1,392
projects.
The General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland debates annual reports from its
Committee on Church and Nation on social,
economic, and political matters; and, through
its Board of Social Responsibility, is the
largest voluntary social work agency in
Scotland.
Organisations belonging to other churches
and religious groups are also closely involved
with a wide range of social issues.
The Inner Cities Religious Council, formed
in 1992, is a forum for dialogue between faith
communities and the Department of the
Environment. The Council promotes policy
development and offers advice for religious
groups on urban regeneration. Chaired by a
government minister, it includes members
from the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and
Christian faiths, including the majority Black
churches.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other official
purposes, except in Northern Ireland. Each
467
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
group adopts its own way of counting its
members, and the membership figures in this
chapter—often supplied by the religious
groups themselves—are therefore
approximate.
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY
Church of England
The Church of England became the
established church during the Reformation in
the 16th century. Conflicts between Church
and State culminated in the Act of Supremacy
in 1534 which repudiated papal supremacy and
declared Henry VIII to be Supreme Head of
the Church of England. The Church of
England’s form of worship was set out in
successive versions of the Book of Common
Prayer from 1549 onwards. The Church’s
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation, since the Church’s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’ of
the Church of England and must always be a
member of the Church, and promise to uphold
it. Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans of cathedrals are appointed by the
Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister,
although the Crown Appointments
Commission, which includes lay and clergy
representatives, plays a decisive part in the
selection of archbishops and diocesan bishops.
All clergy swear allegiance to the Crown. The
Church can regulate its own worship. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the
bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House of
Lords. Clergy of the Church, together with
those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, may
not sit in the House of Commons.
The Church is divided into two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses, including
the Diocese in Europe; and York, with 14
dioceses. The dioceses are divided into
archdeaconries and deaneries, which are in
turn divided into about 13,000 parishes,
although in practice many of these are grouped
together. There are, altogether, about 10,265
full-time stipendiary Church of England
clergy—men and women—working within the
diocesan structure, excluding mainland
Europe. In 1994 an estimated 205,990 people
were baptised into the Church in the two
provinces, excluding the Diocese in Europe; of
these, 160,300 were under one year old,
representing 25.1 per cent of live births. In the
same year there were 45,024 confirmations.
Attendances at services on a normal Sunday
are around 1,090,400 million. In 1993, 91,214
marriages were solemnised in the Church of
England. These accounted for 66.4 per cent of
all marriages with religious ceremonies, and
32.2 per cent of all marriages in England.
Many people who rarely, if ever, attend
services still regard themselves as belonging to
the Church of England.
The central governing and legislative body
is the General Synod, which comprises
separate houses of bishops, clergy and lay
members. Lay people are also involved with
church government in the parishes. The
Synod is the centre of an administrative system
dealing with missionary work, inter-church
relations, social questions, and recruitment and
training for the ministry. It also covers other
church work in Britain and overseas, the care
of church buildings and their contents, church
schools (which are maintained largely from
public funds), colleges and institutes of higher
education, and voluntary and parish education.
The Church’s investment income from
historic sources is managed mainly by the
Church Commissioners. Most of the
remainder of the Church’s income is provided
by local voluntary donations. The average
annual stipend of a Church of England priest is
about £14,460; the average value of additional
benefits, including free housing and a
non-contributory pension, is £7,000.
In 1992 the General Synod voted in favour
of legislation allowing the ordination of women
to the priesthood. The Measure was
subsequently approved by both Houses of
Parliament and received the Royal Assent. The
first women priests were ordained in 1994 and
there are now 783 stipendiary women clergy.
The Measure also provided for those, usually
from the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church,
unable to accept the ordination of women,
including the payment of compensation to
clergy who feel they have to leave the ministry
468
RELIGION
of the Church. So far 313 clergy have received
compensation payments under the Measure.
Some 200 former Church of England
clergy (many married) have been
received into the Roman Catholic
Church. Some of these have since
been ordained.
Three bishops have been appointed to
provide additional pastoral care to those
members and parishes of the Church who
remain opposed to the ordination of women to
the priesthood. Women priests can now be
appointed to all offices in the Church, except
those of archbishop or bishop.
Other Anglican Churches
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
communion of Anglican churches. These are
similar in organisation and worship to the
Church of England and originated from it.
There are four distinct Anglican Churches in
the British Isles, each governed separately by
its own institutions: the Church of England,
the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland (which
operates in both Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic). The Church of Ireland was
disestablished in 1869 and the Church in
Wales in 1920.
The Anglican Communion comprises 36
autonomous Churches in Britain and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas with a
total membership of about 70 million. Links
between the components of the Anglican
Communion are maintained by the Lambeth
Conference of Anglican bishops, which is held
every ten years, the last Conference being held
in Canterbury in 1988. Presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference has
no executive authority, but enjoys considerable
influence. The Anglican Consultative Council,
an assembly of lay people and clergy as well as
of bishops, meets every two or three years to
allow consultation within the Anglican
Communion. The Primates Meeting brings
together the senior bishops from each Church
at similar intervals.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian
form of govefnment, that is, government by
church courts, composed of ministers and
elders, all of whom are ordained to office, and
also deacons. It became the national church
following the Scottish Reformation in the late
sixteenth century and legislation enacted by
the Scottish Parliament. The Church’s status
was then consolidated in the Treaty of Union
of 1707 and by the Church of Scotland Act
1921, the latter confirming its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. It appoints its
own office bearers, and its affairs are not
subject to any civil authority.
The adult communicant membership of the
Church of Scotland is over 698,500; there are
about 1,200 ministers serving in parishes. Both
men and women may join the ministry.
Twelve hundred and ninety five churches are
governed locally by Kirk Sessions, consisting
of ministers and elders. Above the Kirk
Session is the Presbytery. The General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and
elders, meets annually under the presidency of
an elected moderator, who serves for one year.
The Monarch is normally represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High
Commissioner.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland. They are
particularly active in the Highlands and
Islands.
Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe those Protestant churches in Britain
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not established
churches. Free Churches have existed in
various forms since the Reformation,
developing their own traditions over the years.
Their members have also been known as
dissenters or nonconformists. While this
historical experience has given these churches
a certain sense of shared identity, they
otherwise vary greatly in doctrine, worship and
church government. All the major Free
469
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Churches—Methodist, Baptist, United
Reformed and Salvation Army—allow both
men and women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, with over 408,000 adult full
members and a community of more than 1.2
million, originated in the 18th century
following the Evangelical Revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). The present church is *
based on the 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. It has 3,600
ministers and 6,950 places of worship.
MAYC, the youth service of the
Methodist Church, has a
membership of 50,000. Each year
MAYC organises London Weekend,
one of the largest youth events in
Europe, bringing together dance,
drama, rock music and worship
produced and performed by youth
groups from all over Great Britain.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the Baptist
Union of Great Britain (re-formed in 1812),
with about 146,200 members, 2,235 ministers
and 2,000 places of worship. There are also
separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales
and Ireland, and other independent Baptist
Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is
the United Reformed Church, with some
103,000 members, 1,864 ministers and 1,768
places of worship. It was formed in 1972
following the merger of the Congregational
Church in England and Wales (the oldest
Protestant minority in Britain, whose origins
can be traced back to the Puritans of the 16th
century) with the Presbyterian Church of
England (a church closely related in doctrine
and worship to the Church of Scotland). This
was the first union of two different churches in
Britain since the Reformation in the 16th
century. In 1981 there was a further merger
with the Re-formed Association of the
Churches of Christ.
Alongside these churches are other historic
Free Church bodies. The Salvation Army was
founded in the East End of London in 1865 by
William Booth (1829-1912). Within Britain it
is second only to the Government as a provider
of social services. It is the largest provider of
hostel accommodation, offering almost 3,400
beds every night. Other services include work
with alcoholics, prison chaplaincy and a family
tracing service which receives 4,900 enquiries
each year. The Salvation Army in Britain is
served by around 1,800 officers (ordained
ministers) and runs some 1,000 worship
centres.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 18,000 adult members in
Britain and 450 places of worship, was founded
in the middle of the 17th century under the
leadership of George Fox (1624-91). Silent
worship is central to its life as a religious
organisation. Emphasis is also placed on social
concern and peace-making.
Among the other Free Churches are: the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest
Protestant church in Northern Ireland, where
it has 291,150 members; the Presbyterian (or
Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, with
53,870 members and the largest of the Free
Churches in Wales; and the Union of Welsh
Independents (45,460 members).
A recent development has been the rise of
Pentecostalism and the charismatic movement.
A number of Pentecostalist bodies were
formed in Britain at the turn of the century.
The two main Pentecostalist organisations
operating in Britain today are the Assemblies
of God (approximately 54,600 members,
nearly 900 ministers and over 600 places of
worship) and the Elim Pentecostal Church.
Since the Second World War immigration
from the Caribbean has led to the growth of a
significant number of majority Black
Pentecostalist churches.
In the early 1960s a Pentecostalist
charismatic movement began to influence some
followers in both the Church of England and
the Roman Catholic Church; it remains a
growing influence in both these churches, and
in the historic Free Churches. The Christian
‘house church’ movement (or ‘new churches’)
began in the early 1970s, when some
charismatics began to establish their own
congregations. Services were originally held in
470
RELIGION
private houses although many congregations
have now acquired their own buildings. The
movement, whose growth has been most
marked in England, is characterised by lay
leadership and is organised into a number of
loose fellowships, usually on a regional basis,
such as the Ichthus Fellowship in south-east
London.
Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which ceased to
exist after the Reformation, was restored in
1850. The Scottish Church’s formal structure
went out of existence in the early 17th century
and was restored in 1878. However,
throughout this period Catholicism never
disappeared entirely. There are now seven
Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain,
each under an archbishop, and 30 dioceses,
each under a bishop (22 in England and Wales
and eight in Scotland, independently
responsible to the Pope). There are almost
3,300 parishes and about 7,200 priests (only
men may become priests). Northern Ireland
has six dioceses, some with territory partly in
the Irish Republic. About one British citizen in
ten claims to be a Roman Catholic.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great
importance to the education of its children and
requires its members to try to bring up their
children in the Catholic faith. Two per cent of
the teachers in Britain’s 2,900 Catholic schools
are members of religious orders. These orders
also undertake other social work. About 250
Roman Catholic religious orders,
congregations and societies are represented in
Britain, as are congregations representing
about 25 different nationalities who live in
Britain. Most Catholic schools are maintained
out of public funds.
Other Christian Churches
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
are traceable to the Reformation.
The Christian Brethren are a Protestant
body organised in their present form by J. N.
Darby (1800-82). There are two branches: the
Open Brethren and the Closed or Exclusive
Brethren.
Many Christian communities founded by
migrant communities, including the Orthodox,
Lutheran and Reformed Churches of various
European countries, the Coptic Orthodox
Church and the Armenian Church, have
established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London. All these churches
operate in a variety of languages. The largest is
probably the Greek Orthodox Church, many of
whose members are of Cypriot origin. It is
represented in many cities throughout Britain.
There are also several other religious
groups in Britain which were founded in the
United States in the last century. These
include the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Church
of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church), the Christadelphians, the
Seventh-Day Adventists, the Christian
Scientists and the Spiritualists.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland (formerly the British Council of
Churches) is the main overall body for the
Christian churches in Britain. The Council
co-ordinates the work of its 31 member
churches, in the areas of social responsibility,
international affairs, church life, youth
matters, world mission, racial justice and
inter-faith relations. The Council’s member
churches are also grouped in separate
ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, Churches
Together in Wales, and the Irish Council of
Churches.
The Free Church Federal Council, with 19
member churches, includes most of the Free
Churches of England and Wales. It promotes
co-operation among the Free Churches
(especially in hospital chaplaincy and in
education matters).
The Evangelical Alliance, with a
membership of individuals, churches or
societies drawn from within 20 denominations,
represents over 1 million evangelical
Christians.
The churches of the Council of Churches
for Britain and Ireland and the Free Church
Federal Council liaise with the Government
through the Churches’ Main Committee.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Inter-church discussions about the search
for Christian unity take place internationally,
as well as within Britain, and the main
participants are the Roman Catholic,
Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist,
Reformed and Baptist Churches. In 1995-96
the Church of England and the Methodist
Church had informal meetings to consider
moves towards unity.
The Anglican Churches and the Church of
Scotland are among the 14 British Churches
which are members of the World Council of
Churches. This organisation links some 340
churches in over 100 countries around the world.
OTHER RELIGIONS
The Buddhist Community
The Buddhist community in Britain consists
largely of adherents of British or Western
origin. There are well over 500 Buddhist
groups and centres, including some 50
monasteries and temples. All the main schools
of Buddhism are represented. The Buddhist
Society, founded in 1924, promotes the
principles of Buddhism; it does not belong to
any particular school of Buddhism.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in Britain comprises
around 320,000 members and originates largely
from India. The largest groups of Hindus are to
be found in Leicester, different areas of London,
Birmingham and Bradford. The first Hindu
temple, or mandir, was opened in London in
1962 and there are now over 150 mandirs in
Britain, a number of which are affiliated to the
National Council of Hindu Temples.
The Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, in
north London, has the largest Hindu temple to
be built outside India, together with an
extensive cultural complex which has provision
for conferences, exhibitions, marriages, sports,
and health clinics.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest and remained until
banished by royal decree in 1290. The present
community in Britain dates from 1656, having
been founded by Jews of Spanish and
Portuguese origin, known as Sephardim. Later
more settlers came from Germany and Eastern
Europe; they are known as Ashkenazim.
The Jewish community in Britain numbers
about 300,000 and is, after that in France, the
largest in Western Europe. The main groups
are to be found in London (210,000),
Manchester and Salford (27,000), Leeds
(9,000), and Brighton and Hove (6,000). About
70 per cent are affiliated to synagogues. The
community is divided into two main groups.
Of these, some 70 per cent are Ashkenazi Jews,
most of whom acknowledge the authority of
the Chief Rabbi. The small Sephardi
Orthodox element follow their own spiritual
head. The recently established Masorti
movement, the Reform movement, founded in
1840, and the Liberal and Progressive
movement, established in 1901, account for
most of the remaining 27 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number
about 360. The Board of Deputies of British
Jews is the officially recognised representative
body for all these groups. Founded in 1760, it
is mainly elected by synagogues. The Board
serves as the voice of the community to both
government and the wider non-Jewish
community.
A large-scale survey of British Jews,
conducted by the Institute of Jewish
Policy Research, was published in
1996. This reports that 44 per cent of
Jewish men aged under 40 are
married, or living with, non-Jewish
partners, and that among Jewish
women in this age range, 20 to 25 per
cent marry outside the Jewish
community.
Roughly one in three Jewish children attend
Jewish schools, some of which are supported
by public funds. Several agencies care for
elderly and handicapped people.
The Muslim Community
Figures for the size of the Muslim community
in Britain have ranged from three-quarters of a
472
RELIGION
million to 2 million. Recent estimates, based
on extrapolations from the 1991 census,
suggest the population is between 1 million
and 1.5 million, while estimates from within
the Muslim community suggest between 1.5
million and 2 million. The largest number
originate from Pakistan and Bangladesh, while
sizeable groups have come from India, Cyprus,
the Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa.
There is a growing number of British-born
Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, but including an increasing number of
converts to Islam.
There are over 600 mosques and numerous
Muslim prayer centres throughout Britain.
Mosques are not only places of worship; they
also offer instruction in the Muslim way of life
and facilities for educational and welfare
activities.
The first mosque in Britain was established
at Woking, Surrey, in 1890. Mosques now
range from converted houses in many towns to
the Central Mosque in Regent’s Park, London,
and its associated Islamic Cultural Centre, one
of the most important Muslim institutions in
the Western world. The Central Mosque has
the largest congregation in Britain, and during
festivals it may number over 30,000. The
Islamic Cultural Centre’s activities include a
weekend school for children, and regular
lectures, seminars and conferences. Pastoral
care includes free legal advice, counselling,
marriage and funeral services, and hospital
visiting.
There are also important mosques and
cultural centres in Liverpool, Manchester,
Leicester, Birmingham, Bradford, Cardiff,
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Many of the mosques are administered by
various local Muslim organisations, and both
the Sunni and the Shi’a traditions within Islam
are represented among the Muslim community
in Britain. Members of some of the major Sufi
traditions have also developed branches in
British cities. The Ismaili Centre in London
provides wide ranging pastoral care and a place
of worship for Shi’a Imami Ismaili Muslims,
whose current Imam is Prince Karim Aga
Khan. There are also several thousand
members of the heterodox Ahmadiyya
movement in Britain.
The Sikh Community
A large British Sikh community (estimates
range from 400,000 to 500,000) originates
mainly from India, and particularly from the
Punjab. The largest groups of Sikhs are in
Greater London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples, or gurdwaras, cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare and cultural needs
of their community. A granthi is normally
employed to take care of the building and to
conduct prayers. The oldest gurdwara in
London was established in 1908 and the largest
is in Hounslow, Middlesex (to the west of
London). There are over 200 gurdwaras in
Britain.
Other Faiths <
Small communities of other faiths include that
of the Jains, mainly living in London,
Leicester and Coventry. Jainism is an ancient
religion brought to Britain by immigrants from
India. A Jain temple (or derasar) opened in
Leicester in 1988. The Zoroastrian religion, or
Mazdaism, which originated in ancient Iran, is
mainly represented in Britain by the Parsi
community, whose ancestors left Iran in the
tenth century and settled in north-west India.
The Baha’i movement originated in
19th-century Iran; there are an estimated 6,000
Baha’is in Britain, organised in 500 local
assemblies and administered by the National
Spiritual Assembly in London.
A more recent development is
Rastafarianism. This emerged out of the Back
to Africa movement in the West Indies early
this century, and arrived in Britain through
Jamaican immigration in the 1950s. It has no
single creed, but draws heavily on the Old
Testament.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious movements,
sometimes popularly referred to as cults,
mainly established since the Second World
War and often with overseas origins, are active
in Britain. Examples include the Church of
Scientology, the Transcendental Meditation
movement, the Unification Church (popularly
473
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
known as the ‘Moonies’) and various New Age
groups. In response to public concern about the
activities of some of these cults, the Government
provided funding from 1987 to 1993 to set up
the Information Network Focus on Religious
Movements (INFORM). Supported by the
main churches, INFORM carries out research
and seeks to provide objective information about
new religious movements.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
A number of national organisations seek to
develop relations between different religions in
Britain. They include the Inter Faith Network
for the United Kingdom, which links a wide
range of organisations with an interest in
inter-faith relations, including representative
bodies from the Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian,
Hindu, Jain, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and
Zoroastrian faith groups.
Other national organisations include the
Council of Christians and Jews, which works
for better understanding among members of
the two religions and deals with issues in the
educational and social fields.
Within each faith tradition are organisations
and individuals working to further good
relations with other faiths. For example, the
Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland
(see p. 471) has a Commission on Inter Faith
Relations.

A great diversity of artistic and cultural activity is enjoyed in Britain, at both
professional and amateur level; a 1994—95 survey showed that 47.6 per cent of
adults attended arts activities in that year. Arts funding has received a major
boost from the National Lottery in 1995-96, benefiting both national and
community-based projects in all areas of Britain.
INTRODUCTION
Britain’s artistic and cultural heritage is one of
the richest in the world. The origins of English
literature, one of the world’s most influential
bodies of writing, can be traced back to
medieval times, while over the centuries
Britain has amassed some of the finest
collections of works of art. The performing
arts also have a long and distinguished
history.
London is one of the leading world centres
for the arts. Other large cities, including
Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh,
Glasgow and Cardiff, have also sustained and
developed their reputations as centres of
artistic excellence in recent years. Arts festivals
attract wide interest. Many British
playwrights, craftspeople, composers,
film-makers, painters, writers, actors, singers,
musicians and dancers enjoy international
reputations. They include, for example,
Harold Pinter, Sir Colin Davis, Sir Andrew
Lloyd Webber, David Hockney, Sir V.S.
Naipaul, Vanessa Redgrave, SirTan McKellen
and Sir Anthony Hopkins. Television and
radio bring a range of arts events to a large
audience. At an amateur level, numerous
groups and societies for the arts make use of
local talent and resources.
Department of National Heritage
The Secretary of State for National Heritage,
who is a member of the Cabinet, is responsible
for government policy in support of the arts
for England. The Department of National
Heritage (see p. 544) determines government
policy and administers expenditure on national
museums and art galleries in England, the Arts
Council of England (see p. 476), the British
Library and other national arts and heritage
bodies. Other responsibilities include the
regulation of the film industry, broadcasting
and the press, the National Lottery and the
export licensing of antiques.
The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible
for the arts in their countries, including the
national museums, galleries and libraries and
their respective Arts Councils.
The Government’s arts policies aim to:
475
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• develop a high standard of artistic and
cultural activity throughout Britain;
• encourage innovation; and
• promote public access to, and appreciation
of, the arts, crafts and the cultural
heritage.
The Government’s Arts and Young People
initiative, announced in 1996, aims to bring the
arts alive for this age group by developing
better links between young people and arts
organisations, galleries and museums, both
within and outside schools.
The Department of National Heritage and
the home departments provide funds and
advice, and encourage partnership with the
private sector, including business sponsorship.
National museums and galleries are given an
incentive to increase their resources—for
example, through trading and other activities.
An important concept in funding policy is the
‘arm’s length’ principle, by which government
funds are distributed to arts organisations
indirectly, through bodies such as the Arts
Councils, the British Film Institute and the
Scottish Film Council. This principle helps to
avoid political influence over funding decisions
by ensuring that funds are allocated by those
best qualified to do so.
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain around 1,000 local
museums and art galleries and a network of
over 4,000 public libraries. They also support
many other arts buildings, arts organisations
and artistic events in their areas, providing
grant aid for professional and voluntary bodies,
including orchestras, theatres, and opera and
dance companies. They undertake direct
promotions of the arts and contribute to the
cost of new or converted buildings for the arts.
In England revenue support from local
authorities is estimated to be about £190
million a year. In Scotland revenue support
from local authorities is £35-£40 million a
year, and in Wales about £12 million a year.
Finance
Planned central government expenditure
through the Department of National Heritage
amounts to £937 million in 1996—97, of
which about £186 million is channelled
through the Arts Council of England mainly
to support the performing and visual arts.
Grants are also made to the British Film
Institute, the Crafts Council, certain other
museums and arts bodies, and to the
National Heritage Memorial Fund. The
Fund helps organisations wishing to acquire,
for the public benefit, land, buildings, works
of art and other objects associated with the
national heritage.
The Scottish Office is providing £39.6
million for Scotland’s National Galleries and
Museums and National Library, while the
Welsh Office is providing £18.3 million for
Wales’s National Museum and National
Library. Planned spending by the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland on the three
major museums there amounts to about £9.2
million in 1996—97.
Arts Councils
The main channels for government aid to the
arts are the independent Arts Councils of
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
The aims of the Arts Councils are to:
• develop and improve the knowledge,
understanding and practice of the arts;
• make the arts more accessible to the
public; and
• advise and co-operate with central
government departments, local authorities
and other organisations.
The Arts Councils give financial help and
advice to organisations ranging from the major
arts centres and opera, dance and drama
companies to small touring theatre companies
and experimental performance groups. They
also provide funds for the training of arts
administrators and help arts organisations to
develop other sources of income, including
sponsorship and local authority support. They
encourage a variety of art forms, including
ballet and contemporary dance, drama, mime,
literature, music, opera, visual arts and
photography, and help professional creative
writers, dramatists, choreographers, dancers,
476
THE ARTS
actors, musicians, composers, artists and
photographers. The Councils also support art
exhibitions and tours of arts events and
performances, make funds available for some
specialist training courses in the arts and
encourage the work of artists in education.
Emphasis is being placed on obtaining funds
through partnership arrangements with local
authorities and other agencies, and from
commercial sources.
Planned 1996-97 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is £24.5 million, £14.2 million and
£7.1 million respectively.
Regional Arts Boards
In England the Arts Council and ten Regional
Arts Boards comprise the integrated arts funding
system. Together, they aim to ensure that a wide
range of high-quality arts is accessible to people
across the country. The Regional Arts Boards
offer financial assistance to artists and arts
organisations and advise on, and sometimes help
to promote, arts activities. They also advise on
the use of National Lottery funding. They are
financed mainly by the Arts Council of England,
with smaller sums from the British Film
Institute and Crafts Council, as well as from
local authorities. The Boards also concentrate on
business development and sponsorship and
many have established ‘Business in the Arts’
schemes in their areas. Through a system of
forward planning and budgeting, the Boards are
accountable to their national funders. One-third
of the members of each Board are nominated by
local authorities. Boards also include
representatives of the regional business
community as well as others with expertise and
interest in the arts.
The Boards are responsible for most of the
funding of organisations within their region.
The Arts Council of England continues to be
responsible for the funding of the national
companies—Royal Opera, Royal Ballet and the
Birmingham Royal Ballet, the English
National Opera, the Royal Shakespeare
Company, the Royal National Theatre and the
South Bank Centre. It is also responsible for
touring companies without a regional base and
for other arts organisations which have a
national strategic role.
Business Sponsorship
Industrial and commercial companies offer
vital sponsorship to a wide range of arts. The
Pairing Scheme, managed by the Association
for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA),
aims to encourage businesses in Britain to
sponsor the arts. Under the scheme,
government funding of between £1,000 and
£45,000 is awarded to arts organisations to
complement the sponsorship from businesses.
Launched in 1985, the sponsorship scheme has
brought over £95 million into the arts
(including a government contribution of £60
million). In 1996-97 the Government is
making available £4.9 million to match new
sponsorships.
Notable business sponsorships during 1996
include:
• The Tate Gallery’s Cezanne exhibition
(sponsored by Ernst & Young);
• Ballet Central, an annual programme of
public performances across Britain for
sixth form graduates of the Central
School of Ballet (sponsored by British
Gas);
• The Royal Shakespeare Company, which
has received the largest single arts
sponsorship, amounting to £3.3 million
over three years from Allied Domecq, for
its seasons of plays by Shakespeare and his
contemporaries; and
• Theatre Clwyd’s Christmas shows—
among them Great Expectations, A
Christmas Carol, Gulliver’s Travels and
The Snow Queen (sponsored by Warwick
International).
Under ABSA’s Business in the Arts
scheme, the private sector gives part-time
management expertise to arts organisations.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was set
up in 1991 by the Pool Promoters Association
to channel funds into sport and the arts.
Almost £20 million of the Foundation’s annual
revenue is used to benefit the arts and is
distributed in the form of awards to a variety
of organisations.
477
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National Lottery
The National Lottery (see p. 43) generates
substantial funds for the arts and Britain’s
national heritage.
By 1 July 1996, grants of over £728
million had been distributed by the
Arts Councils and the Heritage
Lottery Fund (see p. 489) to a wide
range of arts projects, including:
• £3.8 million to The Tate Gallery
in Merseyside;
• £3.7 million to East London’s
Geffrye Museum, which
specialises in domestic interiors;
• £3 million to Armagh City and
District Council, Northern
Ireland, for a new theatre/arts
centre;
• £2.5 million to the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music and Drama in
Glasgow to create a national
opera school; and
• £1.2 million to the Welsh College
of Music and Drama, Cardiff.
Substantial funding is also to be channelled
into the British film industry (see p. 486).
Cultural Diversity and Disability
The arts activities undertaken by Britain’s
diverse communities embrace both traditional
and new forms of artistic expression. The Arts
Council of England has specialist programmes
to make the arts more accessible and to develop
the knowledge, understanding and practice of
diversity in the arts.
Black and Asian Arts
The Arts Council of England and the Regional
Arts Boards jointly support the National Black
Arts Network, a group of individuals and
agencies which is helping to develop black,
Asian and Chinese arts across England. The
Arts Council also supports other umbrella
organisations, including Asian Arts Access, the
British Chinese Artists’ Association and
ADiTi, and has helped in setting up the
Institute of International Visual Arts. It also
supports Afro-Caribbean and Asian music
circuits, the Netting Hill carnival bands, a
funding programme for black video and
film-makers and the development of black
theatre companies.
Arts and Disability
The Arts Council of England has access to
experts in arts and disability through its Arts
and Disability Advisory and Monitoring
Committee, and all its art-form advisory panels
include disabled people. The Council’s paper
on quality of service for disabled people
provides practical information and advice for
Council and Regional Arts Boards staff.
Funding agreements with arts organisations
state that they must have an equal
opportunities policy; they are also encouraged
to adopt the code of practice on employment
issued by the Equal Opportunities
Commission (see p. 40).
The National Disability Arts Forum and
other national agencies are funded by the Arts
Council of England, as are creative
organisations, such as CandoCo, a company of
disabled and non-disabled dancers. The
Council also supports an apprenticeship
scheme for disabled people in major arts
organisations, such as the Royal Shakespeare
Company, which is part of an initiative aimed
at increasing employment opportunities in the
arts for disabled people.
Other schemes supported by the Arts
Council of England include an audit of deaf
arts conducted by Deafworks and projects
involving disabled artists in schools. The
Scottish Arts Council supports Art Link and
Project Ability, which provide opportunities
for people with disabilities to develop
creativity in a range of art forms.
The provision of access for disabled people to
arts buildings is a basic criterion for all grants
made from the National Lottery (see p. 43).
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in Britain give people the
chance of enjoying and taking part in a range
of activities, with educational projects

becoming increasingly important. Nearly all
arts centres are professionally managed and
most are supported .by volunteer groups. They
are assisted mainly by Regional Arts Boards
and local authorities, while the Arts Council of
England funds two national centres—the
South Bank Centre and the Institute of
Contemporary Arts. Many theatres and art
galleries also provide a focal point for the
community by making available facilities for
other arts.
The British Council
The British Council (see p. 140) is Britain’s
international network for culture, development
and education, and maintains libraries
(including film libraries) in many of the 109
countries in which it is represented. The
Visiting Arts Office, an autonomous body
administered by the British Council, fosters an
appreciation and understanding of the arts of
other countries. It acts as a broker between
Britain and overseas arts organisations, advises
on touring matters and makes awards for
projects.
Broadcasting
BBC radio and television and the independent
companies (see Chapter 30) broadcast a variety
of drama, opera, ballet and music, as well as
general arts magazine programmes and
documentaries. These have won many
international awards at festivals such as the
Prix Italia and Montreux International
Television Festivals. Independent television
companies also make grants for arts promotion
in their regions.
Broadcasting is a major medium for making
the arts available to the public and is a crucial
source of work for actors, musicians, writers,
composers, technicians and others in the arts
world. It has created its own forms—nothing
like arts documentaries or drama series, for
instance, exists in any other medium.
Broadcasters commission and produce a vast
quantity of new work. Television and radio
provide critical debate, information and
education about the arts.
The BBC has five orchestras, which employ
many of Britain’s full-time professional
musicians. Each week it broadcasts about 150
hours of classical and other music (both live
and recorded) on its Radio 3 (FM) channel.
BBC Radio 1 (FM) broadcasts rock and pop
music, along with a range of other
programming, 24 hours a day, and a large part
of the output of BBC Radio 2 (FM) is popular
and light music. There are at present two
national commercial radio stations which
broadcast music:
• Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music; and
• Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based
rock music.
Much of the output of Britain’s local radio
stations consists of popular and light music.
The BBC regularly commissions new
music, particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals.
Each summer it presents and broadcasts the
BBC Promenade Concerts (the ‘Proms’), the
world’s largest music festival, at the Royal
Albert Hall.
The Press
Many national and local newspapers devote
considerable space to coverage of the arts, and
developments in the arts are also covered in
periodicals such as the Spectator and New
Statesman and Society (see Chapter 30).
Weekly ‘listings’ magazines, including Time
Out, provide details of cultural and other
events in London and other large cities.
There are also a large number of specialist
publications which cover specific aspects of the
arts, including Classical Music, Art Monthly,
Dance Theatre Journal and Opera. A number of
publications publish original literature,
including the London Magazine and Granta,
which publishes fiction as well as cultural
journalism. New Musical Express (NME) and
Melody Maker cover rock and pop music. The
newspaper Stage and Television Today is
directed at professional actors and others in the
industry.
Festivals
Some 650 professional arts festivals take place
in Britain each year. The annual Edinburgh
479
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
International Festival, featuring a wide range
of arts, is held in August and September and is
the largest of its kind in the world. Other
festivals held in Edinburgh include the annual
International Jazz Festival, the International
Film and Television Festivals and the biennial
Book Festival. The international arts Mayfest
takes place in Glasgow. Some well-known
festivals concentrating on music are the Three
Choirs Festival, which has taken place
annually for more than 260 years in
Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford; the
Cheltenham International Festival of Music,
largely devoted to contemporary British music;
and the Aldeburgh festival.
Among other festivals catering for a number
of art forms are the Royal National Eisteddfod
of Wales, the Royal National Gaelic Mod in
Scotland, the Belfast Festival at Queen’s
University, and the festivals in Brighton,
Buxton, Chester, St Davids, Harrogate,
Llangollen, Malvern, Perth and York. Many
smaller towns also hold arts festivals. A major
event in London is the Netting Hill Carnival,
which is organised largely by the Afro-
Caribbean community.
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council initiative which
celebrates the approach of the millennium.
During each year between 1992 and 2000, one
city, town or region in Britain has been
nominated to celebrate a particular art form.
Swansea was the City of Literature in 1995; the
Northern Region was the Region of Visual Arts
for 1996; and the Eastern Region is the Region
of Opera and Musical Theatre for 1997. Future
years have been designated as follows:
• Yorkshire and Humberside as the Region
of Photography and the Electronic Image
for 1998; and
• Glasgow as the City of Architecture and
Design for 1999.
Arts 2000 is a competitive process judged
by expert Arts Council selection committees.
Winners are offered between £400,000 and
£500,000 from Arts Council funds, and are
expected to match this to create a wide-ranging
and imaginative programme including a strong
international content.
DRAMA
Britain is one of the world’s major centres for
theatre, and has a long and rich dramatic
tradition. There are companies based in
London and in many other cities and towns; in
addition, numerous touring companies visit
theatres, festivals and other venues, including
arts and sports centres and social clubs. There
are more than 250 companies in receipt of Arts
Council or Regional Arts Boards subsidies in
1996-97.
Contemporary British playwrights who
have received international recognition, with
examples of their works, include:
• David Hare—Skylight, Racing Demon;
• Alan Ayckbourn—The Revengers'
Comedies, A Chorus of Disapproval;
• John Godber—Up and Under, On the
Piste;
• Caryl Churchill—Serious Money, The
Skriker; and
• Tom Stoppard—Arcadia, Indian Ink.
Among the best-known directors are Sir
Peter Hall, Richard Eyre, Nicholas Hytner,
Trevor Nunn, Adrian Noble, Jonathan Miller,
Deborah Warner and Terry Hands, while the
many British performers who enjoy
international reputations include Kenneth
Branagh, Dame Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes,
Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Paul
Schofield, Sir Ian McKellen, Helen Mirren,
Vanessa Redgrave, Dame Diana Rigg, Dame
Maggie Smith and Juliet Stephenson. British
stage designers such as John Bury, Ralph
Koltai and Carl Toms are internationally
acclaimed.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended for
professional use which can seat between 200
and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned,
but most are owned either municipally or by
non-profit-making organisations. Over 40 of
these have resident theatre companies
receiving subsidies from the Arts Councils and
Regional Arts Boards. In summer there are
also open air theatres, including one in
London’s Regent’s Park and the Minack
Theatre, which is on a clifftop near Land’s
End in Cornwall.
Most theatres are commercially run and
self-financing, relying on popular shows and

musicals to be profitable. By contrast,
companies funded by the Arts Councils tend to
offer a variety of traditional and experimental
productions. Experimental or innovative work
is often staged in ‘fringe’ theatres in London
and other cities; these are smaller theatres
which use a variety of buildings, such as rooms
in pubs.
London
London has about 100 theatres, 15 of them
permanently occupied by subsidised
companies. These include:
• the Royal National Theatre, which stages
a range of modern and classical plays in its
three auditoriums on the South Bank;
• the Royal Shakespeare Company, which
presents plays mainly by Shakespeare and
his contemporaries as well as some
modern work, in Stratford-upon-Avon
and in its two auditoriums in the City’s
Barbican Centre. Since 1996 the Company
has also toured other parts of Britain for
six months of the year; and
• the English Stage Company at the Royal
Court Theatre in Sloane Square, which
stages the work of many new playwrights.
The largest concentration of London’s
commercial theatres is around Shaftesbury
Avenue. West End theatre attendance was over

musicals.
In 1989 the partial remains of the Globe
Theatre, where Shakespeare acted, and the
Rose Theatre, where his plays were performed
during his lifetime, were excavated on the
south bank of the Thames; both have since
been listed as ancient monuments. A modern
reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, near its
original site, was completed in 1996.
Regional Theatres
Outside London most cities and many large
towns have at least one theatre. Older theatres
which have been restored include the Theatre
Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, which dates
from the 18th century; the Alhambra,
Bradford; the Lyceum, Sheffield; the Theatre
Royal, Bristol; and the Grand Opera House,
Belfast, all dating from the 19th century.
Others, such as the West Yorkshire Playhouse,
Leeds, and the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have
been built to modern designs. Edinburgh’s
rebuilt and restored Empire Theatre, reopened
as the Edinburgh Festival Theatre in 1994,
provides an international venue for large-scale
productions. A custom-built theatre for new
writing recently became the new home of the
Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. Several
universities have theatres which house
professional companies playing to the public.
Most regional repertory companies mount
about eight to ten productions a year; several
have studio theatres in addition to the main
auditorium, where they present new or
experimental drama and plays of specialist
interest. Repertory theatres also often function
as social centres by offering concerts, poetry
readings and exhibitions, and by providing
restaurants, bars and shops.
Regional theatre companies with major
reputations include the Citizens’ Theatre,
Glasgow; the Royal Exchange, Manchester;
Bristol Old Vic; West Yorkshire Playhouse;
the Festival Theatre, Chichester; and the
Nottingham Playhouse, one of the first modern
regional theatres. Successful productions from
regional theatre companies often transfer to
London’s West End. In addition, the largest
regional theatres receive visits from the Royal
National Theatre or the Royal Shakespeare

The Young Vic Company in London and
Contact Theatre Company in Manchester
stage plays for young people. Numerous
Theatre-in-Education companies perform in
schools. Some of these companies operate
independently—Theatre Centre, for example,
plays in London and tours further afield.
Others are attached to regional repertory
theatres such as the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich,
and Greenwich Theatre. Most regional
repertory theatres also mount productions for
younger audiences, and concessionary ticket
prices are generally available for those at
school, college or university. The first Festival
of Theatre for Children and Young People
took place in London in 1995.
There has been a marked growth in youth
theatres, which number more than 500 in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools, among
them the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(RADA), the Central School of Speech and
Drama, the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art (LAMDA), and the Drama
Centre (all in London); the Bristol Old Vic
School, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama (Glasgow) and the Welsh College
of Music and Drama (Cardiff). Theatre design
courses, often based in art schools, are
available for people wanting to train as stage
designers. A number of universities and
colleges offer degree courses in drama.
Amateur Theatre
There are several thousand amateur dramatic
societies throughout Britain. They use a
variety of buildings, including schools and
public halls. Their work is encouraged by a
number of organisations, such as the Central
Council for Amateur Theatre, the National
Drama Conference, the Scottish Community
Drama Association and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals. A nationwide
representative body, the Voluntary Arts
Network, .was established in 1991. Amateur
companies sometimes receive financial support
from local government and other bodies.
MUSIC
People in Britain are interested in a wide range
of music, from classical to different forms of
rock, country and pop music. Jazz, folk and
world music, and brass bands also have
substantial followings.
The 1996 National Music Festival took
place in June, with a programme of cultural
activity associated with the football European
Cup finals, and with the annual National
Music Day, which promotes the enjoyment of
music by encouraging as many people as
possible to take part as performers or listeners
in a day of music-making across Britain.
Orchestral and Choral Music
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in many large towns and
cities. The principal concert halls in central
London are the Royal Festival Hall in the
South Bank Centre, next to which are the
Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room,
which accommodate smaller scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in
the City of London); the Royal Albert Hall in
Kensington; the Wigmore Hall, a recital
centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
Birmingham has its own recently built concert
hall, the Symphony Hall, and a 2,400-seat
international concert hall opened in 1996 for
Manchester’s Halle Orchestra.
The leading symphony orchestras in
London include the London Symphony, the
482
THE ARTS
Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic, the
Royal Philharmonic and the BBC Symphony.
Important regional orchestras include the
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle, the
City of Birmingham Symphony, the
Bournemouth Symphony, the Ulster
Orchestra, the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra and the BBC National Orchestra of
Wales. The BBC’s five orchestras give
broadcast concerts which are often open to the
public. There are also chamber orchestras,
such as the City of London Sinfonia, the
Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the
Northern Sinfonia, the Bournemouth
Sinfonietta and the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra. Specialised ensembles include the
Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the
English Baroque Soloists and the English
Concert. The London Sinfonietta and the
Birmingham Contemporary Music Group
specialise in contemporary music.
British conductors such as Sir Colin Davis,
Vernon Handley, Sir Charles Mackerras, John
Eliot Gardiner, Andrew Davis, Sir Simon
Rattle, Christopher Hogwood, Jane Glover
and Richard Hickox reach a wide audience
through their recordings as well as by their
performances. The works of living composers
such as Sir Michael Tippett, Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies and Sir Harrison Birtwistle
enjoy international acclaim. Other
well-established British composers include
Michael Berkeley, John Tavener, Sir Malcolm
Arnold, Oliver Knussen, Nicola le Fanu,
George Lloyd, David Matthews, Mark
Anthony Turnage, John Casken, James
MacMillan and Judith Weir. The Master of
the Queen’s Music, Malcolm Williamson,
holds an office within the Royal Household
with responsibility for organising and writing
music for state occasions. Percussionist Evelyn
Glennie and clarinettist Emma Johnson are
among solo performers currently enjoying
great acclaim.
The principal choral societies include the
Bach Choir, the Royal Choral Society, the
Huddersfield Choral Society, the Cardiff
Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh
International Festival Chorus and the Belfast
Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading
orchestras maintain their own choral societies.
The English tradition of church singing is
represented by choirs such as those of King’s
College Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ
Church Cathedral, Oxford, while other choirs
such as the Roman Catholic Westminster
Cathedral choir are also well known. There are
many male-voice choirs in Wales and in certain
parts of England.
The Leeds International Pianoforte
Competition for young pianists is one the most
prestigious events in the musical calendar; and
the biennial Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition attracts outstanding young
singers from all over the world.
Pop and Rock Music
Hundreds of hours of pop and rock music are
broadcast through BBC and independent radio
stations every week. Television programmes of
both live and recorded music also feature pop
and rock, which is by far the most popular
form of music in Britain. It covers a diversity
of styles, ranging from dance to heavy metal.
In the 1960s and 1970s groups such as the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and
Pink Floyd achieved international success.
British groups continue to be popular
throughout the world and are often at the
forefront of new developments in music.
The British record industry recognises the
most talented British performers at the annual
Brit Awards. In 1996 Oasis won three
categories, including best British group. Other
winners were Paul Weller (best male singer),
Annie Lennox (best female singer) and David
Bowie (for an outstanding contribution to the
British record industry). Other successful
British performers include Blur, Supergrass,
Massive Attack, Pulp, Gabrielle, Seal, and
East 17.
The pop and rock music industry
contributes significantly to Britain’s overseas
earnings through the sale of recordings,
concert tours, and promotional material,
including clothing and books.
Jazz
Jazz has a large following in Britain and is
played in numerous clubs and pubs. There is
also a jazz radio station, Jazz FM, which
broadcasts in London and in the north west.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The London Jazz Festival attracts
international stars, such as the bandleader
Django Bates, saxophonists Pharoah
Saunders and Joshua Redman, and the singer
Jean Carn. British musicians such as Barbara
Thompson, Stan Tracey, Julian Joseph,
David Jean Baptiste, Tommy Smith and
Courtney Pine have established international
reputations. Festivals of jazz music are held
throughout Britain, including Cardiff Bay,
Brecon, Edinburgh, Glasgow and
Birmingham.
Training
Professional training in music is given mainly
at colleges of music. The leading London
colleges are the Royal Academy of Music, the
Royal College of Music, the Guildhall School
of Music and Drama, and Trinity College of
Music. The City University’s music industry
course provides training in business practice
aimed specifically at musicians and music
administrators. Outside London the main
centres are the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama in Glasgow, the Royal
Northern College of Music in Manchester,
the Welsh College of Music and Drama,
Cardiff, and the Birmingham Conservatoire.
Many universities also offer courses in
music.
Other Educational Schemes
Many children learn to play musical
instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the
Royal Schools of Music. Music is one of the
foundation subjects in the National
Curriculum (see p. 451). In Scottish schools
music and the expressive arts are also well
developed. The National Youth Orchestras of
Great Britain, Scotland, Ulster and Wales, and
other youth orchestras have established high
standards. Nearly a third of the players in the
European Community Youth Orchestra come
from Britain. There is also a National Youth
Jazz Orchestra.
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated
to the international Musicales,
encourages attendance by young people at
opera, dance and concert performances.
OPERA
Interest in opera has been growing markedly in
Britain, with an estimated 2.6 million of the
adult population attending opera performances
in 1995-96. A number of British
singers—Thomas Allen, Anne Evans, Philip
Langridge, Felicity Lott, Ann Murray and
Bryn Terfel, for example—have now
established themselves in the international
opera houses.
An opera season for which international
casts are specially assembled is held every
summer at Glyndebourne in East Sussex. This
is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, using casts
drawn from the chorus of the festival season.
Since 1994 the summer season at
Glyndebourne has taken place in a new
1,200-seat opera house, built at a cost of £33
million. All the funding came from private
sources.
Regular seasons of opera are held at the
Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,
London. The English National Opera stages
opera in English at the London Coliseum.
Scottish Opera has regular seasons at the
Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly
in Scotland and northern England. Welsh
National Opera presents seasons in Cardiff
and other cities; Music Theatre Wales has
become well known for its contemporary
work. Leeds-based Opera North tours
primarily in the north of England and has
gained an international reputation. Opera
Factory in London presents experimental
work in opera and music theatre. English
Touring Opera takes opera to towns
throughout England. Opera Northern
Ireland presents seasons at the Grand Opera
House, Belfast, and tours the province.
The National Opera Studio provides
advanced training for young singers.

Birmingham Royal Ballet tours widely in
Britain and overseas; English National Ballet
divides its performances between London and
the regions; Northern Ballet Theatre is based
in Leeds and also tours; and Scottish Ballet is
based in Glasgow. Other subsidised companies
include the Cardiff-based Diversions Dance
Company and the Dundee Repertory Dance
Company.
The Arts Councils also subsidise a wide
range of other companies and dance
organisations, including Rambert Dance
Company (which celebrated its 70th
anniversary in 1996 with performances at the
Coliseum, London), Adzido Pan African
Dance Ensemble, Shobana Jeyasingh Dance
Company and Richard Alston Dance
Company. Also subsidised is Dance Umbrella,
which promotes an annual festival of
contemporary dance in London. The Arts
Councils and the Regional Arts Boards support
companies such as Phoenix Dance Company,
Adventures in Motion Pictures and CandoCo
Dance Company.
Matthew Bourne, Christopher Bruce,
Richard Alston, Lloyd Newson, Ashley Page,
Shobana Jeyasingh, Siobhan Davies and
Jonathan Burrows are among the foremost
British choreographers. Leading dancers
include Darcey Bussell, Gill Clarke, Adam
Cooper and Deborah Bull.
National Dance Agencies
A network of agencies for professional and
community dancers has been established in
Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, London,
Newcastle upon Tyne, Swindon (Wiltshire)
and Suffolk. The agencies, which receive Arts
Council, Regional Arts Board and local
authority support, offer classes, provide
information and advice, help to co-ordinate
activities, and commission dance artists to
create work. A new agency based in the north
west joined the national network in 1996.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by
specialist schools, which include the Royal
Ballet School, the Central School of Ballet,
the Northern School of Contemporary Dance
(Leeds) and the London Contemporary
Dance School; these, with many private
schools, have helped to raise British dance to
its present standard. Dance is a subject for
degree studies at a number of institutions,
including the Laban Centre (University of
London), the University of Surrey,
Dartington College of Arts in Devon and
Middlesex University.
Courses for students intending to work with
community groups are available at several
institutions. The Royal Ballet is running a
scheme that aims to widen access to ballet
training for children from a different range of
cultural backgrounds.
Other Educational Schemes
The Arts Council of England runs Taped, a
scheme to finance dance videos for use in
education, while the Video Place provides a
library of videotape documentation of dance
performances for viewing by promoters,
choreographers, dancers, teachers and
students. The Scottish Arts Council supports
Dance Base, which offers a range of classes.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Many have won awards for major
projects, such as Phoenix Dance Company’s
‘Urban Exchange’ and English National
Ballet’s ‘Striking a Balance’. Ludus Dance
Company, based in Lancaster, works mainly
with young people; and Scottish Ballet has a
programme of work in schools in Scotland.
The Performing Arts and Technology
School in Croydon, Surrey, offers studies in
drama, music and dance to pupils aged from 14
to 18, with the emphasis on the application of
technology to the performing arts.
The National Youth Dance Company
provides opportunities for young dancers to
work with professionals and to create and
perform dance. Similar opportunities exist for
young people to join youth dance companies
throughout the country.

entry fee at many cinemas.
British actors and film-makers have
won 30 per cent of all Oscars over the
last 20 years. In 1996 there were four
winners:
• Emma Thompson (best
screenplay) —Sense and
Sensibility',
• Nick Park (best animated short
film)—A Close Shave',
• Jon Blair (documentary feature)
— Anne Frank Remembered',
and
• James Acheson (costume)
—Restoration.
There are about 2,000 cinema screens in
Britain, and estimated attendances are
currently running at about 2.5 million a week;
cinema admissions have more than doubled (to
124 million a year) since 1984. In London and
other large cities a number of art or repertory-
cinemas show films which have not been more
widely distributed. These include films from
Britain and abroad; other foreign films, often
with English subtitles; and older films which
are being shown again, sometimes in a newly
edited form.
Animation
The resurgence of interest in animation in
Britain is due in part to the pioneering work of
British animators, who have created 3D
animation and computer animation. British
animations have won five Oscars for Best
Animated Short Film in recent years,
including David Fine and Alison Snowdon’s
Bob’s Birthday in 1995 for Channel 4, and in
1996 Nick Park’s A Close Shave (his third
Oscar). Television has proved an important
source of production finance.
Government Support
An annual government grant of about £16.5
million is made to the British Film Institute
and one of over £1 million to the Scottish Film
Council and the Scottish Film Production
Fund.
In addition, more than £80 million from the
National Lottery (see p. 43) will be provided
by the Arts Council of England to support
film-making over the next five years.
British Film Commission
The British Film Commission (BFC) was
launched in 1991 with government funding to
market the British film and television
production service industry to overseas
production executives with the aim of
increasing inward investment. Productions
assisted by the BFC since its establishment
have contributed in excess of £300 million to
the British production industry and the British
economy. All services offered by the
Commission to overseas producers are free of
charge.
The BFC also works alongside the UK
Film Commission Network, which currently
comprises 20 area or city offices. The growth
of this network over the past three years
illustrates both the growth of production in
Britain and the recognition of local and central
government of the effectiveness of such
organisations in stimulating increased
production activity.
British Screen Finance
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company, provides finance for new
486
THE ARTS
film-makers with commercially viable
productions who have difficulty in attracting
funding. The company, investing its own
money together with contributions from the
Government, makes loans for the production
of low- and medium-budget films involving
largely British talent. It encourages the early
stages of film project development and the
production of short films. The Government
funds the cofnpany with £2 million a year.
During 1994 British Screen Finance
supported 15 films and recouped £2.2
million from its feature film investments in
previous years.
European Co-Production Fund
Funded by the Government with £2 million a
year, the European Co-Production Fund
(ECPF) offers loans of up to 30 per cent of a
film’s budget, enabling British producers to
collaborate in the making of films in Europe. It
has invested more than £6.5 million in 19
feature films, with a total value of more than
£46 million.
British Film Institute
The development of film, video and television
as art forms is promoted by the British Film
Institute (BFI) and in Scotland by the Scottish
Film Council. The BFI offers some direct
financial and technical help through its
Production Board.
The BFI runs the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film and Television
Archive, and has the world’s largest library of
information on film and television. It holds
extensive international collections of books,
periodicals, scripts, stills and posters. BFI
Research and Education Department aims to
enable as many people as possible to discover
new ways of appreciating film, video and
television.
The National Film and Television Archive
contains over 300,000 films and television
programmes, including newsreels, dating from
1895. BFI on the South Bank comprises the
Museum of the Moving Image, which traces
the history of film and television, and the
National Film Theatre. The latter has three
cinemas showing films of historical, artistic or
technical interest, and is unique in offering
regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations. In 1995-96 about
2,000 films, television and video programmes
were shown, attracting attendances of over
180,000. In November each year the National
Film Theatre hosts the London Film Festival,
at which some 250 new films from all over the
world are screened. In 1995 over 100,000
people attended Festival screenings.
The BFI promotes, and helps to fund, a
network of 35 regional film theatres, and is
involved in setting up film and television
centres with a range of activities and facilities.
It also co-operates with the Regional Arts
Boards and grant-aids their film and video
work.
The Wales Film Council acts as the BFFs
agent in Wales, and in Northern Ireland the
BFI works with the Northern Ireland Film
Council (NIFC). Both of these Film Councils
receive Arts Council funding.
Scottish Film Council
The Scottish Film Council supports regional
film theatres, promotes and provides material
for media education and administers the
Scottish Film Archive. Financial assistance to
develop film scripts is available through the
Scottish Film Production Fund. Scottish
Screen Locations provides advice to film¬
makers on suitable locations for film
productions in Scotland. In 1996 the Secretary
of State for Scotland announced plans to
merge these three organisations with Scottish
Broadcast and Film Training, a privately
owned organisation, to form one
body—Scottish Screen.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television
Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films for children, shown
largely through video and television.
The Children’s Film Unit makes feature
films for children (mainly for Channel 4) and
runs weekly workshops for children on all
aspects of film-making. The Unit caters for
about 80 children at any time and has
produced 15 feature films.

BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Northern Ireland Film Council runs
Cinemagic, an award-winning international
film festival for young people.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
enrols about 30 full-time students a year and
about 500 on short course programmes. In
1995-96 it received a government grant of
£1.8 million. The School is planning to move
from its present location in Buckinghamshire
to the former BBC film studios in west
London.
The London International Film School, the
Royal College of Art, and some universities
and other institutions of higher education also
offer courses in film production.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of
children to unsuitable films, and may prevent
the showing of any film. In assessing films
the authorities normally rely on the
judgment of an independent non-statutory
body, the British Board of Film Classification
(BBFC), to which films must be submitted.
The Board was set up on the initiative of the
cinema industry to ensure a proper standard
in films shown to the public. It does not use
any written code of censorship, but can
require cuts to be made before granting a
certificate; on rare occasions, it refuses a
certificate.
Films passed by the Board are put into one
of the following categories:
• U (universal)—suitable for all;
• PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at segregated premises to which no one
under 18 is admitted—for example,
licensed cinema clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of its
classification—for example, to sell or hire a
video classified 18 to a person under 18.
VISUAL ARTS
State support for the visual arts includes
funding for the national museums and
galleries, and funding through local
authorities and the Museums and Galleries
Commission. It also includes funding for the
production, exhibition and distribution of
work by contemporary artists and
photographers and for the promotion of art
to the public, channelled through the Arts
Councils, the Crafts Council and the
Regional Arts Boards, and grants towards the
cost of art education. The Government
encourages high standards of industrial
design and craftsmanship through grants to
the Design Council (see p. 213).
Museums and galleries maintained by local
authorities, universities, independent
museums and private funds may receive help
in building up their collections through grants
administered by the Museums and Galleries
Commission and the museum councils in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Support to national and regional public and
independent museums and galleries is also
given by the Arts Councils and by trusts and
voluntary bodies, including the Henry Moore
Foundation, the Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation and the National Art Collections
Fund. National Lottery proceeds are being
distributed in the form of capital grants by the
Heritage Lottery Fund, the Arts Councils and
the Millennium Commission. The effect of
these grants on the infrastructure of galleries,
and visual arts provision, will be significant; in
the first year of operation the Arts Council of
488
THE ARTS
England allocated £13 million to public arts
projects alone.
The Heritage Lottery Fund also distributes
grants for the purchase of works of art and
items of national significance. In recent years,
for example, the Fund has helped towards the
acquisition of masterpieces by Hans Holbein
and Jacques-Louis David (bought by the
National Gallery) and by El Greco (the
National Gallery of Scotland).
The Museums and Galleries Commission
administers a system whereby pre-eminent
works of art may be accepted by the
Government in place of inheritance tax and
allocated to public galleries; items thus
acquired in 1995-96 include paintings by
George Stubbs, Yves Tanguy and the 15th
century Italian artist Paris Bordone.
In collaboration with the Regional Arts
Boards, the Arts Council of England provides
some strategic funding for galleries;
educational institutions, from art schools and
universities to schools; commercial galleries
and publishers; artists’ agencies; and media
centres. It also supports touring exhibitions
and the presentation of works of art in a variety
of public spaces. The Arts Council of
England’s unique collection of 20th century
British art, with the National Touring
Exhibition Service, is managed on its behalf by
the South Bank Board, which also runs the
Hayward Gallery.
The Arts Council of England also supports
the Institute of Contemporary Art in London
and five other independent galleries: the
Whitechapel and the Serpentine in London,
the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, Ikon in
Birmingham and Arnolfini in Bristol, as well as
the Institute of International Visual Arts,
based in London. The ten Regional Arts
Boards also fund galleries and arts centres and
provide direct support for artists.
Support for galleries is also given by the
Arts Councils in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
British artists, photographers, architects
and sculptors with international reputations
include David Hockney, Lucian Freud, David
Bailey, Jane Bown, Sir Richard Rogers and Sir
Anthony Caro. Younger artists with a similar
standing include Damien Hirst, Rachel
Whiteread and Anish Kapoor.
Museums and Galleries
About 110 million people a year, across all
social groups, visit more than 2,000 museums
and galleries open to the public, which include
the major national collections, around 1,100
independent museums, and museums
receiving support from local authorities.
Museums and galleries in Britain receive
about £440 million a year in public
expenditure, and by June 1996 they had been
awarded over £225 million from the National
Lottery. All national museums and galleries
are financed chiefly from government funds;
they may charge for entry to their permanent
collections and special exhibitions. Most of the
national collections are managed by
independent trustees.
The Museums and Galleries Commission
advises the Government on museum issues.
The Commission also promotes co-operation
between national and regional institutions.
Ten area museum councils supply a variety of
services and advice to individual museums.
The Government encourages the loan of
objects from national and regional collections
so that works of art can be seen by as wide a
public as possible. The Arts Council of
England, through a National Collections
Touring Scheme and the National Touring
Exhibition Service, is also broadening access to
the national collections.

responsible for developing training standards and
programmes within museums. The Arts Council
of England supports an MA course at the Royal
College of Art for curating and commissioning
contemporary art, and promotes professional
practice among artists and curators.
Museums Association
The independent Museums Association, to
which many museums and art galleries and their
staffs belong, facilitates exchange of information
and discussion of matters relating to museums
and galleries. The Association, which has many
overseas members, provides training, seminars
and research; its publications include the
monthly Museums Journal and a new technical
periodical, Museum Practice.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries, many
of them located in London, contain some of
the world’s most comprehensive collections of
objects of artistic, archaeological, scientific,
historical and general interest. The English
national museums are:
• the British Museum (including the
ethnographic collections of the Museum
of Mankind);
• the Natural History Museum;
• the Victoria and Albert Museum (the
V&A, which displays fine and decorative
arts);
• the National Museum of Science and
Industry, including the Science Museum
and its two regional institutes—the
National Railway Museum (York) and the
National Museum of Photography, Film
and Television (Bradford);
• the National Gallery (which houses
western painting from around 1260 to
1920);
• the Tate Gallery, with collections in
London (British painting and modern
art); Liverpool; and St Ives (St Ives
School and contemporary art);
• the National Portrait Gallery;
• the Imperial War Museum;
• the Royal Armouries;
• the National Army Museum;
• the Royal Air Force Museum;
• the National Maritime Museum;
• the Wallace Collection (which includes
paintings, furniture, arms and armour,
and objets d’art); and
• the National Museums and Galleries on
Merseyside.
The Royal Armouries, Britain’s oldest
museum, has collections in the Tower of
London (items relating to the Tower’s
history), Leeds (arms and armoury), and Fort
Nelson, near Portsmouth (artillery). The Tate
Gallery is to create Britain’s first national
museum of modern art, situated on the south
bank of the Thames. Awarded £50 million by
the Millennium Commission, the new
museum will house a collection of 20th century
art of international importance.
In Scotland the national collections are held
by the National Museums of Scotland and the
National Galleries of Scotland. The former
include the Royal Museum of Scotland, the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland,
the Scottish United Services Museum and the
Scottish Agricultural Museum, in Edinburgh;
the Museum of Flight, near North Berwick;
and the Museum of Costume at Shambellie
House near Dumfries. A new Museum of
Scotland is being built next to the Royal
Museum to house the National Museums’
Scottish collection.
The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. The
National Galleries of Scotland also have
collections at Paxton House near Berwick and
Duff House in Banff. In 1995—96 the National
Museums of Scotland attracted 1.5 million
visitors and the National Galleries of Scotland
some 870,000.
The National Museum of Wales, which has
opened new galleries at its main building in
Cardiff, has a number of branches, including
the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagans and the
Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff s
dockland.
Northern Ireland has two national
museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and
490
THE ARTS
the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in
County Down. There are plans to merge
these two museums with the Ulster-
American Folk Park in County Tyrone to
form a single National Museum for Northern
Ireland.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London include
the Museum of London; Sir John Soane’s
Museum; the Courtauld Institute Galleries;
and the London Transport Museum. The
Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace has
exhibitions of pictures from the extensive royal
collection.
Most cities and towns have museums
devoted to art, archaeology and natural history,
often administered by the local authorities but
sometimes by local learned societies or by
individuals or trustees. Many are associated
with their universities, such as the Ashmolean
Museum in Oxford and the Fitzwilliam
Museum in Cambridge.
Many collections of art and antiques in
historic family houses, including those owned
by the two National Trusts (see p. 373) and
English Heritage (see p. 372), are open to the
public.
There are also a number of national art
exhibiting societies, the most famous being
the Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington
House in London. The Academy holds an
annual Summer Exhibition and other
important exhibitions during the rest of the
year. The Summer Exhibition is the world’s
largest open contemporary art exhibition and
brings together a wide range of work by
established artists and by others exhibiting
for the first time. The Royal Scottish
Academy holds annual exhibitions in
Edinburgh. There are also children’s
exhibitions, including the National
Exhibition of Children’s Art.
An increasing number of open air museums
depict the regional life of an area or preserve
early industrial remains. These include the
Weald and Downland Museum in West
Sussex, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in
Shropshire. Skills of the past are revived in a
number of‘living’ museums, such as the
Gladstone Pottery Museum near Stoke-on-
Trent and the Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in
Cheshire.
Among recently established museums are:
• the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth,
housing the restored wreck of the flagship
of Henry VIII;
• the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life
and Art in Glasgow, containing artefacts
representing the world’s major religions;
and
• Eureka!, the first museum designed
specifically for children, in Halifax, West
Yorkshire.
The Burrell Collection in Glasgow houses
world-famous tapestries, paintings and objets
d’art. The Design Museum in London’s
Docklands contains a collection of 20th-
century mass-produced consumer objects.
Crafts
The crafts in Britain have an annual turnover
estimated at £400 million. Government aid for
the crafts, amounting to £3.2 million in
1996-97, is administered in England and
Wales by the Crafts Council. The Council
supports craftspeople by promoting public
interest in their work, and encouraging the
creation of works of contemporary
craftsmanship. Grants are available to help
with setting up workshops and acquiring
equipment. The Crafts Council runs the
national centre for crafts in London, which
houses a gallery, reference and picture
libraries, and a gallery shop. It organises the
annual Chelsea Crafts Fair, and co-ordinates
British groups at international trade fairs.
Crafts Council exhibitions tour nationally and
internationally, and grants are made to
encourage exhibitions, projects and
organisations.
Funding is given to the Regional Arts
Boards and the Arts Council of Wales for the
support of crafts, and to Contemporary
Applied Arts, a membership organisation that
holds exhibitions and sells work through its
London gallery.
Craftworks, an independent company, is
the crafts development agency for Northern
Ireland, providing training, marketing and
business counselling for the crafts sector. The
491
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Arts Council of Northern Ireland also funds
crafts promotion, as does the Scottish Office
through the Scottish Arts Council.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities (these
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmith’s College of Art, London); and in
further education colleges and private art
schools. Many of these institutions award
degrees at postgraduate level. Art is also taught
at an advanced level at the four Scottish
Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities concentrate largely
on academic disciplines, such as the history of
art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College, London. The Open University also
offers courses in art history and theory of art.
Art is one of the foundation subjects in the
National Curriculum. The Society for
Education through Art encourages, among
other activities, the purchase by schools of
original works of art by organising an annual
Pictures for Schools exhibition.
The Open College of the Arts offers
correspondence courses in art and design,
painting, sculpture, textiles, photography and
creative writing to people wishing to study at
home.
Export Control of Works of Art
London is a major centre for the
international art market, and sales of works
of art take place in the main auction houses
(two of the longest established being
Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through
private dealers. Certain items are covered by
export control; guidance is provided by the
Export Licensing Unit of the Department of
National Heritage.
A licence from the Department of National
Heritage is required before such items can be
exported. If the Department’s advisers object
to the granting of a licence, the matter is
referred to the Reviewing Committee on the
Export of Works of Art. If the Committee
considers a work to be of national importance,
it can advise the Government to defer a
decision on the licence application for a
specified time to provide an opportunity for an
offer to be made to buy at or above the
recommended fair market price.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
A number of literary activities receive public
subsidy through the Arts Councils. In 1995,
for example, there was continued support for a
programme of tours by writers from other
countries; and a partnership between the four
Arts Councils and the Republic of Northern
Ireland to promote tours of prominent writers
from and in each country. There were also
innovative broadcasting projects promoting
reading and writing.
There are free public libraries throughout
Britain (see p. 494), private libraries and
several private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on television and
radio, and numerous periodicals concerned
with literature are published.
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is
provided by a number of awards, some of the
most valuable being the Booker and Whitbread
prizes. The 1996 Booker Prize was won by
Graham Swift for Last Orders. In 1995 Harold
Pinter was awarded the second David Cohen
British Literature Prize for a lifetime’s
achievement by a living British writer. A part
of the £40,000 prize, which is awarded every
two years, enables winners to commission new
works from younger writers. Other awards to
encourage young authors include those of the
Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E.C.
Gregory Trust Fund.
Ulster-born poet Seamus Heaney was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1995. Other distinguished British poets
include Ted Hughes (the Poet Laureate),
James Berry, Gillian Clarke, Carol Ann Duffy,
U.A. Fanthorpe, Tony Harrison, Geoffrey
Hill, Elizabeth Jennings, R.S. Thomas and
Carol Rumens. As the Poet Laureate, Ted
Hughes is a member of the Royal Household
and receives an annual stipend from the Civil
List (see p. 51).
492
THE ARTS
Many British writers are
internationally recognised. Well-
known living novelists, with
examples of their works, include:
• Martin Amis—London Fields,
Money, The Information',
• A.S. Byatt—Still Life, Possession:
A Romance, Babel Tower,
• Julian Barnes—Flaubert’s Parrot,
Letters from London, Cross
Channel", and
• Ruth Rendell—Crocodile Bird,
Demon in my View, Simisola.
Many writers from overseas, often from
Commonwealth countries, live and work in
Britain, writing books in English which have a
wide circulation in Britain and overseas.
English literature is taught extensively at
schools, colleges and universities throughout
Britain. Creative writing is also taught at a
variety of institutions; one of the best known is
the University of East Anglia, in Norwich,
where writers such as Ian McEwan and Kazuo
Ishiguro have studied. The University also
houses the British Centre for Literary
Translation.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works, films, sound recordings and broadcasts
are automatically protected by copyright in
Britain. This protection is also given to works
from countries party to international copyright
conventions. The copyright owner has rights
against unauthorised reproduction, public
performance, broadcasting and issue to the
public of his or her work; and against dealing
in unauthorised copies. In most cases the
author is the first owner of the copyright, and
the term of copyright in literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic works is the life of the
author and a period of 70 years after death. For
films the term is 70 years from the last death
among the following: principal director,
authors of the screenplay and dialogue, or
composer of music for the film. Sound
recordings are protected for 50 years from the
year of making or release, and broadcasts for
50 years from the year of broadcast.
Performers are also given automatic
protection against broadcasting and recording
of live performances, and reproduction of
recordings. This lasts for 50 years from the
year of performance or release of a recording of
it. The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988 revised the law on copyright and
performers’ rights, and has since been
amended to comply with the EC Directives
on copyright.
•
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society of
Literature. The leading society for studies in
the humanities is the British Academy for the
Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and
Philological Studies (the British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several societies devoted to
particular authors, the largest of which is the
Dickens Fellowship. Various societies, such as
the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry readings
and recitals. London’s South Bank Centre
runs a programme of literary events.
Libraries
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of
Britain, is one of the world’s greatest
libraries, with a collection of more than 150
million separate items. These include books,
journals, manuscripts, newspapers, stamps,
maps and recorded sound. Publishers must
deposit in the Library a copy of everything
published.
A new building for the British Library is
being constructed at St Pancras, London, at a
cost of £511.1 million. The St Pancras
building will offer, for the first time, a
purpose-built home for the national library
with environmentally controlled storage,
increased reader space and seating and greatly
improved public facilities, including three
exhibition galleries, an auditorium and a
bookshop.
493
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Library’s collection grows by about five
shelf miles a year and consists of bequests,
donations and purchases collected over a period
of more than 200 years. It is also the guardian of
treasures such as the Magna Carta and
Shakespeare’s First Folio. Some 450,000 reader
visits are made to the Library each year;
admission to all reading rooms is free of charge.
The Library’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within Britain
and between Britain and countries overseas. It
dispatches over 4 million documents a year.
The Research and Information Commission
is a major source of funding for research and
development in library and information services.
Other Libraries
The National Libraries of Scotland and Wales,
the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and
the Cambridge University Library can also
claim copies of all new British publications
under legal deposit. At the National Library of
Scotland the second phase of a new building,
accommodating a map library, lending services
and the Scottish Science Library, was opened
in May 1995. A major extension of the
National Library of Wales was completed
in 1995.
Some national museums and government
departments have important libraries.
• The Public Record Office in London and
in Kew, Surrey, houses the records of the
superior courts of law of England and
Wales and of most government
departments, as well as famous historical
documents. The Office has many millions
of documents, dating from the time of the
Norman Conquest to the present day.
Public records, with a few exceptions, are
available for inspection by members of the
public 30 years after the end of the year in
which they were created.
• The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh
and the Public Record Office of Northern
Ireland, Belfast, serve the same purpose.
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the libraries of the learned
societies and institutions, such as the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, the Royal
Geographical Society and the Royal Academy of
Music. The Poetry Library in the South Bank
Centre, owned by the Arts Council of England,
is a collection of 20th-century poetry written in
or translated into English; the library houses
about 60,000 volumes.
University Libraries
The university libraries of Oxford and
Cambridge are unmatched by those of the more
recent foundations. However, the combined
library resources of the colleges and institutions
of the University of London total 9 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library of
Manchester contains 3.5 million volumes,
Edinburgh 2.5 million, Leeds 2.3 million, and
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen
each have over 1 million volumes. Many
universities have important research collections
in special subjects—the Barnes Medical Library
at Birmingham and the British Library of
Political and Economic Science at the London
School of Economics, for example.
Special Libraries
Numerous associations and commercial and
industrial organisations run library and
information services. Although most are
intended primarily for use within the
organisation, many can be used, by
arrangement, by people interested in the area
covered, and the specialist publications held
are often available for inter-library lending.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and education
and library boards in Northern Ireland have a
duty to provide a free lending and reference
library service, and Britain’s network of about
4,100 public libraries has a total stock of over 130
million books. Public libraries issue an average of
ten books a year for every person in Britain. Of
these, 58 per cent are works of fiction. Over half
of the total population are members of public
libraries. Some areas are served by mobile
libraries, and domiciliary services cater for
people unable to visit a library.
Many libraries have collections of compact
discs, records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
494
THE ARTS
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local
history, and nearly all provide children’s
departments, while reference and information
sections and art, music, commercial and
technical departments meet a growing
demand. The information role is one of
increasing importance for many libraries, and
greater use is being made of information
technology, including microcomputers,
CD-ROMs and reference databases.
The Government remains committed to
providing a free basic library service—the
borrowing and consultation of printed
materials—but believes there is scope for
greater private sector involvement. Public
libraries charge for some services, such as
research services and the lending of
non-printed materials.
The Government is advised by the Library
and Information Commission, which is a forum
for policy on library and information provision in
general, and the Advisory Council on Libraries,
which advises Government on public libraries in
England. In Northern Ireland, the Library and
Information Services Council also advises
Government on all library matters, including
school libraries. The Commission also advises
the Government on Britain’s representation
abroad and research strategy.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 25,000 members. It
maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians
and publishes books, pamphlets and an official
journal.
The Library Association is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other EU member states.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors the right to receive payment
from a central fund (totalling £4.9 million in
1995—96) for the loans made of their books
from public libraries in Britain. Payment is
made in proportion to the number of times the
authors’ books are lent out. The maximum
payment an author can receive is £6,000.
Books
In 1995 British publishers issued about
100,000 separate titles. The British publishing
industry devotes much effort to developing
overseas markets, and in 1995 the estimated
value of exports of British books amounted to
around £1,089 million.
Among the leading organisations
representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association, which
has 200 members; and the Booksellers’
Association, with 3,300 members. The
Publishers Association, through its
International Division, promotes the export of
British books. The Welsh Book Council
supports the production of books in the Welsh
language. Book Trust encourages reading and
the promotion of books through an
information service and a children’s library.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts locates, reports on, and gives
information and advice about historical papers
outside the public records. It also advises private
owners, grant-awarding bodies, record offices,
local authorities and the Government on the
acquisition and maintenance of manuscripts.
The Commission maintains the National
Register of Archives (the central collecting point
for information about British historical
manuscripts) and the Manorial Documents
Register, which are available to researchers.

Legislation to provide a regulatory framework for digital terrestrial
broadcasting in Britain was introduced in 1996. The Government hopes that
digital broadcasting will create new opportunities for the broadcasting and
programme production industries and extend their contribution to national
prosperity and prestige. The Broadcasting Act 1996 will also liberalise the
restrictions governing the ownership of broadcasting licences, allowing British
media businesses to take advantage of new developments, while at the same
time preserving essential safeguards on diversity of viewpoint and plurality of
ownership.
Television and Radio
Broadcasting in Britain has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public service
accountable to the people. While retaining the
essential public service element, it now
additionally embraces the principles of
competition and choice.
Three public bodies have the main
responsibility for television and radio services.
These authorities work to broad requirements
and objectives defined or endorsed by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day conduct of business. They are:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), which broadcasts television
and radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission), which licenses and
regulates commercial television services,
including cable and satellite services; and
• the Radio Authority, which licenses and
regulates commercial radio services,
including cable and satellite.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1996, BBC
commercial broadcasting services—as opposed
to those funded by the licence fee (see p.
500)—will be regulated by the ITC and Radio
Authority, just as other commercial
broadcasting services.
The Department of National Heritage is
responsible for overseeing the broadcasting
system; the Secretary of State for National
496
THE MEDIA
Heritage is answerable to Parliament on broad
policy questions.
Television
Television viewing is Britain’s most popular
leisure pastime: 97 per cent of households have
a colour television set and 77 per cent a video
recorder. People spend an average of over
three and a half hours a day watching
television, including video playbacks.
There are currently four terrestrial
television channels offering a mixture of
drama, light entertainment, films, sport,
educational, children’s and religious
programmes, news and current affairs, and
documentaries. A fifth channel is due to be
launched in early 1997 (see p. 503).
The BBC provides two complementary
national networks—BBC 1 and BBC 2—which
are financed predominantly by a licence fee.
The ITC licenses and regulates two
commercial television services—ITV (Channel
3) and Channel 4—which complement each
other and are largely funded by advertising. In
Wales S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru) broadcasts
programmes on the fourth channel. All four
channels broadcast on 625 lines UHF
(ultra-high frequency), and over 99 per cent of
the population live within range of
transmission.
Radio
Almost every home has a radio, and the
widespread ownership of portable sets
(including personal stereos) and car radios
means that people can listen to radio
throughout the day.
The BBC has five national networks, which
together transmit all types of music, news,
current affairs, drama, education, sport and a
range of features programmes. There are three
national commercial radio stations—Classic
FM, Virgin 1215 and Talk Radio UK (see p.
503). The Irish radio station, Atlantic 252, also
transmits over much of Britain.
There are 38 BBC local radio stations
serving England and the Channel Islands, and
national regional radio services in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, including Welsh
and Gaelic language stations. About 180
independent local radio (ILR) services are also
in operation. Stations supply a comprehensive
service of local news and information, sport,
music and other entertainment, education and
consumer advice.
RECENT CHANGES IN REGULATION
In recent years broadcasting in Britain has seen
radical changes. The availability of more radio
frequencies, together with satellite, cable and
microwave transmissions, has made a greater
number of local, national and international
services possible. The transition from analogue
to digital transmission technology1 has the
potential to expand this capacity greatly (see
also p. 498). Digital technology promises
improved sound and picture quality, greater
potential for wide-screen broadcasts and
interactivity, more subscription services, and
many more channels.
In response to the rapidly developing
technology and the prospect of a much wider
choice of programmes and services, the
Government has made legislative provision for
a more flexible regulatory framework for
broadcasting. Its aim is to give viewers and
listeners access to a greater range of services,
while at the same time promoting competition
and plurality of media ownership, and
maintaining high standards of taste and
decency.
Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990, which
overhauled the regulation of independent
television and radio and opened the way for
many more services, the IBA (Independent
Broadcasting Authority) was replaced in 1991
by the ITC (Independent Television
Commission), the Radio Authority and a
transmission and engineering company,
National Transcommunications Limited
'Digital television promises to have a greater impact than
the introduction of colour broadcasting. Using a process
called digital compression, the transmitter sends not the
whole image, but only the information needed to effect
changes between frames. This uses much less spectrum
than the existing analogue process, thereby releasing
transmission capacity for a far greater number of television
channels.
497
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(NTL). At the same time the Cable Authority
was made part of the ITC and the Radio
Authority. The ITC and the Radio Authority
issue licences to commercial broadcasters and
enforce rules to ensure diversity of ownership.
NTL (which took over the IBA’s networks and
other facilities) transmits television services for
the independent television companies,
Channel 4 and S4C, and radio services for
many independent local radio stations. The
Act also provided for the establishment of a
new national independent television
station—Channel 5—and three national
commercial radio stations, with opportunities
for launching hundreds of independent local
radio and television channels.
The Government wishes to encourage
the eventual transition of all
broadcasting and
telecommunications services to
digital means of transmission. The
Broadcasting Act 1996 introduces a
new regulatory framework to forward
the development of digital terrestrial
broadcasting.
The legislation:
• provides for the licensing of at least 18
national digital terrestrial television
channels (transmitted on six
‘multiplexes’,2 and serving, in the medium
term, from 60 to over 90 per cent of the
population);
• secures places on the new digital
frequencies for the existing public service
broadcasters, to ensure that British
broadcasting maintains its current
standards of programming; and
• encourages the development of digital
broadcasting by requiring the ITC and
Radio Authority to award licences to those
2Through the process known as multiplexing, the signals
of several broadcasters are combined into a single stream
on a single frequency channel. There is therefore no longer
a direct one-to-one relationship between a television
service and a frequency. The signals are finally received
and decoded by digital receivers or set-top boxes attached
to existing sets.
organisations which pledge to install the
new transmission network as quickly as
possible, to make consumer receiver
equipment as affordable as possible, and
to broaden consumer choice of
programming.
The Government will review setting a date
for switching off analogue frequencies five
years after the introduction of digital terrestrial
television or once 50 per cent of the population
has digital receivers, whichever is the sooner.
Media Owner ship
The Broadcasting Act 1990 established rules
designed to enable the ITC and Radio
Authority to keep ownership of the
broadcasting media widely spread and to
prevent undue concentrations of single and
cross-media ownership. Under that legislation,
ownership of broadcasters by companies based
outside the European Union is largely
prohibited; newspapers are allowed relatively
small stakes in Channel 3 (and 5), and national
and local radio, but are not restricted in
non-domestic satellite broadcasters; public
telecommunications operators are not allowed
to have controlling interests in any Channel 3,
Channel 5, national radio or domestic satellite
licence; and political bodies and local
authorities are barred from holding licences.
A government review of media ownership
regulation issued in 1995 concluded that there
was a continuing case for specific regulations
beyond those which are applied by the general
competition law; but that there was a need to
liberalise the existing ownership regulations
both within and across different media sectors.
Following on from those recommendations,
the Broadcasting Act 1996:
• allows greater cross-ownership between
newspaper groups, television companies
and radio stations, at both national and
regional levels; and
• introduces ‘public interest’ criteria by
which the regulatory authorities can assess
and approve (or disallow) mergers or
acquisitions between newspapers and
television and radio companies.
The legislation removes the two-licence
limit on the control of ITV licences, replacing
498
THE MEDIA
it by a television ownership limit of 15 per cent
share of the total television audience. It also:
• gives the ITC new powers to protect
regional programming and production in
the event of a merger or acquisition of an
ITV licence; and
• allows local newspapers with more than a
50 per cent share of their market to own a
local radio station, providing there is at
least one other independent local radio
station operating in that area.
Programming Obligations
Licence-holders of the independent television
Channel 3 (and the forthcoming Channel 5)
need to pass demanding quality tests (see p.
502). ITC regulations place a limit on the
proportion of non-European material
broadcast. Both the BBC and commercial
television licensees are required to ensure that
at least 25 per cent of their original
programming comes from independent
producers.
Programme Standards
Recognising that broadcasting is an extremely
powerful medium with the potential to offend,
exploit and cause harm, the Broadcasting Act
1990 contained guarantees on programme
standards which are extended to all
British-based broadcasters. These guarantees
cover taste, decency, accuracy and balance.
The Government can proscribe unacceptable
foreign satellite services receivable in Britain,
and anyone in Britain supporting such a
service can be prosecuted.
THE BBC
The constitution, finances and obligations of
the BBC are governed by a Royal Charter and
Agreement. The Corporation’s Board of
Governors, including the Chairman,
Vice-Chairman and a National Governor each
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, is
appointed by the Queen on the advice of the
Government. The Board of Governors is
ultimately responsible for all aspects of
broadcasting by the BBC. The Governors
appoint the Director-General, the
Corporation’s chief executive officer who
heads the executive committee and board of
management—the bodies in charge of the daily
running of the Corporation.
The BBC has a regional structure
throughout Britain. The three English
regions—BBC North, BBC Midlands & East
and BBC South—and BBC Scotland, BBC
Wales and BBC Northern Ireland make
programmes for their local audiences as well as
contributing to the national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland advise
on the policy and content of television and
radio programmes intended mainly for
reception in their areas. Ten Regional Councils
in England advise the Board of Governors on
the needs and concerns of audiences.
New BBC Charter and Agreement
In May 1996 a new Royal Charter came into
effect, providing for the continuation of the
BBC as Britain’s main public service
broadcaster until 2006. The new Agreement
between the BBC and the Secretary of State
for National Heritage, which runs
concurrently with the Charter, formally
establishes the Corporation’s editorial
independence in all matters of programme
content, scheduling and management. It also
provides for the licence fee (see below) to
remain the chief source of finance for the
BBC’s public service activities until at least
2002.
The new Charter and Agreement give effect
to policies set out in a government White
Paper (The Future of the BBC: Serving the
Nation, Competing Worldwide) published in
1994. They maintain the BBC’s essential
characteristics as a public corporation; preserve
its primary objectives of providing
broadcasting services of information, education
and entertainment; and reinforce the duties
laid on the Board of Governors to maintain
programme standards and ensure that the BBC
is even more accountable to its audiences.
They also allow for the development of the
BBC’s commercial activities, in partnership
with the private sector, in Britain and abroad
(although these must be separate and distinct
from its licence fee-funded services).
499
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are financed
predominantly from the sale of television
licences. Properties with a television must buy
an annual licence costing £89.50 for colour and
£30.00 for black and white. Nearly 21.2
million licences were current on 30 June 1996;
of these, almost 20.6 million were for colour.
Licence income is supplemented by profits
from trading activities, such as television
programme exports, sale of recordings,
publications and other merchandise connected
with BBC programmes, hire and sale of
educational films, film library sales, and
exhibitions based on programmes. The BBC
World Service’s radio broadcasting operations
are financed by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign
& Commonwealth Office, while BBC
Worldwide Television (see p. 508) is
self-financing.
TV Licensing, a subsidiary company of the
Post Office, undertakes the licence
administration on behalf of the BBC. Since
1988 annual rises in the licence fee have been
at, or below, the general rate of inflation, and
continues to be until the end of 1996; this is
intended to improve the BBC’s efficiency even
further and encourage it to continue to develop
alternative sources of revenue.
In November 1995 the Government
announced that the BBC’s transmission
facilities were to be privatised; this will provide
the Corporation with new funds to invest in
digital television. In August 1996 an
information memorandum describing the
transmission businesses and the proposed
terms of the sale was issued, on behalf of the
BBC, to interested parties.
Structural Reorganisation
In June 1996 the BBC announced a radical
reorganisation of its management structure in
order to strengthen its existing channels and
services and to develop additional digital
services for the licence-fee payer. The changes
centre on the separation of broadcasting
(scheduling and commissioning) from
production (television, radio and multimedia)
and the creation of a single national and
international news operation. From April 1997
the new organisation will comprise six major
components:
• BBC Broadcast—*o schedule channels
and commission services for audiences in
Britain and abroad;
• BBC Production—to develop the BBC’s
in-house radio and television production
capability across all genres and media;
• BBC News—to be responsible for an
integrated national and international news
operation across the full range of BBC
news and current affairs services;
• BBC Worldwide (see p. 507)—to be
responsible for generating income in
Britain and abroad, and for the World
Service;
• BBC Resources—to provide support
facilities and expertise to BBC
programme-makers and broadcasters; and
• the Corporate Centre—to provide
strategic services to the BBC as a whole.
BBC Television
BBC Television is based at Television Centre
in West London, which houses eight major
television studios as well as production and
support departments. Its two domestic
channels are BBC 1 and BBC 2:
• BBC 1 is the channel of broad appeal. In
1995-96 it broadcast over 1,100 hours of
features, documentaries and current
affairs programmes, together with over
950 hours of drama and entertainment,
500 hours of sport and over 400 hours of
children’s programmes.
• BBC 2 is more innovatory. Special
audience interests are catered for, with a
variety of programmes including
documentaries, late-night comedy and
leisure and lifestyle shows.
Programmes are made at, or acquired
through, Television Centre and six major bases
throughout Britain (Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland and, in England, at
Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester), or they
are commissioned from independent
producers. In addition to a wide range of
programmes for the general audience, BBC
500
THE MEDIA
Television provides programmes for Open
University and further education students and
for others learning for leisure or work.
BBC Television celebrated its diamond
jubilee in 1996 having started the world’s first
regular high-definition service 50 years earlier.
BBC Focus
BBC Focus is one of the Corporation’s
specialist night-time television services. It is a
unit within the BBC’s Education Directorate
and broadcasts education, training, and
professional information and updating
programmes as part of BBC 2’s night-time
service, The Learning Zone (see p. 505).
BBC Focus does not make any of the’
programmes that it broadcasts, but works with
a variety of public bodies and charities to
enable them to communicate with specific
audiences as part of the BBC’s educational
service. All programmes are ‘open access’ and
free. They are designed for recording on video
and viewing at a later date.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio (broadcasting to the
whole of Britain) serves an audience of 29
million each week, transmitting 41,000 hours
of programmes each year on its five networks:
• BBC Radio 1 is a leading contemporary
music station, concentrating on pop music
for a target audience of 15 to 24-year-olds
(24 hours a day);
• BBC Radio 2 provides a service of popular
music and speech for the mature listener
(24 hours a day);
• BBC Radio 3 is the largest patron of
classical music in Britain, but also offers
jazz, drama, documentaries and feature
programmes (24 hours a day from 1996);
• BBC Radio 4 (broadcast with some
differences on FM and LW) provides
authoritative news and current affairs
coverage, complemented by drama,
science, the arts, religion, natural history,
medicine, finance and gardening; it also
carries parliamentary coverage, and
cricket in season on LW; and
• Radio 5 Live has news and sports coverage
(24 hours a day).
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
Like the Radio Authority and S4C, the ITC’s
constitution and finances are governed by the
Broadcasting Act 1990. The ITC is responsible
for licensing and regulating commercial
television services operating in or from Britain.
These include:
• ITV (Channel 3);
• Channel 4;
• the forthcoming Channel 5;
• cable and other local delivery services;
• independent teletext services; and
• satellite services transmitted from Britain.
Under the provisions of the Broadcasting
Act 1996 the ITC will also have powers to
license and regulate commercial digital
terrestrial television (see p. 498) and BBC
commercial television services.
The ITC monitors the licences and licence
conditions but is not involved in detailed
scheduling of programmes. It is advised by
committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and
advertising. Ten viewer consultative councils
also comment on the commercial services’
programmes.
ITV Programmes
The first regular ITV programmes began in
London in 1955 (19 years after the BBC
launched the world’s first regular television
service in 1936). ITV programmes are
broadcast 24 hours a day throughout the
country. About one-third of the output
comprises informative programmes—news,
documentaries, and coverage of current affairs,
education and religion. The remainder covers
sport, comedy, drama, game shows, films, and
a range of other programmes with popular
appeal. Over half the programmes are
produced by the programme companies and
ITN (Independent Television News—see
below).
501
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ITV (Channel 3) Programme Companies
ITV is made up of 15 regionally-based
television companies which are licensed to
supply programmes in the 14 independent
television geographical regions. There are two
licences for London, one for weekdays and the
other for the weekend. An additional ITC
licensee provides a national breakfast-time
service, transmitted on the ITV network.
The licensees operate on a commercial
basis, deriving most of their revenue from
selling advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue and programme
production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the
population of the areas in which they operate.
Although newspapers may acquire an interest
in programme companies, safeguards exist to
ensure against concentration of media
ownership (see p. 498).
Each programme company plans the
content of the programmes to be broadcast in
its area. These are produced by the company
itself, or by other programme companies, or
are bought from elsewhere.
A common news service is provided by
ITN. ITN has been appointed to supply a
service of national and international news to
the ITV network until 31 December 1997.
ITV Network Centre
The ITV Network Centre, which is wholly
owned by the ITV companies, independently
commissions and schedules those television
programmes which are shown across the ITV
network. Programmes are commissioned from
the ITV companies as well as from
independent producers. The Centre also
promotes the ITV network and co-ordinates
developments in technology and training.
Licences
The ITV licences for Channel 3 (which came
up for renewal at the end of 1992) are awarded
by the ITC for a ten-year period by
competitive tender to the highest bidder who
has passed a quality threshold. In exceptional
cases a lower bid can be selected, for instance
where an applicant is able to offer a
significantly better quality of service than that
offered by the highest bidder.
There are safeguards for quality
programming, with licensees being required to
provide a diverse programme service
calculated to appeal to a wide variety of tastes
and interests. They also have to show high
quality news and current affairs programmes
and a reasonable proportion of other
programmes of high quality. There is a
statutory duty to present programmes made in
and about the region. There is also a
requirement for district and regional
programming to be aimed at different areas
within regions. Channel 3 licensees are obliged
to operate a national programme network.
Networking arrangements are subject to the
approval of the ITC and the Director General
of Fair Trading so that anti-competitive
practices are avoided.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in 1982,
provides a national television service
throughout Britain, except in Wales, which has
a corresponding service—S4C (Sianel Pedwar
Cymru). In January 1993 Channel 4 became a
public corporation, licensed and regulated by
the ITC, and funded by selling its own
advertising time. It was previously a public
limited company owned by the ITC.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide programmes
with a distinctive character and to appeal to
tastes and interests not generally catered for by
Channel 3. It must present a suitable
proportion of educational programmes and
encourage innovation and experiment.
Channel 4 commissions programmes from the
ITV companies and independent producers
and buys programmes from overseas. It
broadcasts for around 148 hours a week.
In Wales programmes on the fourth
channel are run and controlled by S4C.
Members of its authority are appointed by the
Government. S4C is required to see that a
significant proportion of programming, in
practice about 32 hours a week, is in the Welsh
language and that programmes broadcast
between 18.30 and 22.00 hours are mainly in
Welsh. At other times S4C transmits national
Channel 4 programmes.
502
THE MEDIA
Like Channel 4, S4C has sold its own
advertising since 1993. However, it is
recognised that S4C will not be self-financing;
in practice roughly 10 per cent of its income
comes from advertising, with the remainder
financed by the Government.
Gaelic TV Fund
The Gaelic Television Committee, appointed
by the ITC, administers government finance
for making television programmes in Gaelic.
The Gaelic Television Fund was created and
programmes thus financed came on screen
from 1993. In 1995 the Government paid £8.9
million to the ITC, which was credited to the
Fund. The Broadcasting Act 1996 extends the
scope of the Fund to cover training and other
support costs for Gaelic radio.
Channel 5
A new national terrestrial television channel—
Channel 5—was originally intended to come
into operation in late 1994, financed through
advertising, subscription or sponsorship. The
ten-year licence was to be awarded by
competitive tender. However, in 1992 the ITC
rejected the single bid it had received, and in
September 1994 announced that it was again
inviting applications for the licence. The
successful applicant, Channel 5 Broadcasting
Limited, was awarded the licence in October
1995. The service, which will serve
approximately 70 per cent of the population, is
intended to start early in 1997. Channel 5 will
be subject to as many of the quality
programming requirements as Channel 3.
Local Television
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 licences for
the delivery of local television services are
awarded by competitive tender. ITC
licence-holders can supply national and local
television channels using both cable and
microwave transmission systems.
Under the 1996 legislation, a new category
of licence—the restricted service licence—has
been created to enable television broadcasts to
be established in local areas and at special
events, subject to the availability of suitable
frequencies.
The Radio Authority
Independent national (INR) and local (ILR)
radio services are based on principles similar to
those of ITV. The programme companies
operate under licence to the Radio Authority
and are financed mainly by advertising
revenue. The Radio Authority is required to
ensure that licensed services, taken as a whole,
are of a high quality and offer a range of
programmes calculated to appeal to a variety of
tastes and interests.
The Authority awards national radio licences
by competitive tender to the highest bidder.
There are three independent national services:
• Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music, together with news and
information, came on air in 1992;
• Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based
rock music, came on air in 1993 (and is
supplemented by a separate Virgin station
which operates under a local London
licence); and
• Talk Radio UK, which is a speech-based
service, came on air in 1995.
Since the early 1990s more local radio
stations have continued to come on the air.
The Authority has awarded about 60 new local
radio licences since it came into operation in
1991. Local radio licences are not allocated by
competitive tender; the success of licence
applications is in part determined by the extent
to which applicants meet the needs and
interests of the people living in the area and in
part by whether they have the necessary
financial resources to sustain programme plans
for the eight-year licence period.
Some of the locations for stations have been
selected with small-scale ‘community radio’ in
mind. As part of its brief to develop a wide
range of radio services, the Authority is
licensing a number of more specialist stations.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted
service licences. These are issued at the
discretion of the Authority (subject to certain
conditions and frequency availability), usually
for a maximum of 28 days. They enable local
events—such as sports events, arts festivals
and conferences—to be covered by a
temporary radio service in a limited area, for
example, part of a city or town or an arena.
503
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext
The BBC and independent television each
operate a teletext service, offering constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, weather
conditions and entertainment. The teletext
system allows the television signal to carry
additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics on
receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. Both the BBC and Channels 3 and 4
provide subtitling as part of the text service for
certain programmes for people with hearing
difficulties. Channel 3 and Channel 4 are
required to offer subtitling services for at least
50 per cent of their programmes by 1998, and
the BBC is set to match this.
Licences
The Broadcasting Act 1990 introduced a
regulatory system for licensing spare capacity
within the lines of the television signal. This
allows more varied use of the capacity—data
transfer, for instance—but the position of the
public teletext service and subtitling on
commercial television is safeguarded.
In 1991 the ITC advertised three teletext
licences. These ten-year licences are awarded
by competitive tender, with applicants having
to satisfy certain statutory requirements before
their cash bid can be considered. The ITC
awarded the public teletext licence to Teletext
Ltd, which replaced Oracle in 1993, and
awarded one of the additional commercial
service licences on Channel 3 to the only
bidder, Data Broadcasting International. The
other additional commercial service licence on
Channel 4/S4C was awarded to SimpleActive
Ltd in 1994. The ITC will advertise the
Channel 5 teletext licence in due course.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the licensing of cable television
services are carried out by the Cable and
Satellite Division of the ITC, while the Radio
Authority issues cable radio licences.
‘Broadband cable’, the cable system
currently being designed and built, can carry
between 30 and 65 television channels
(including terrestrial and satellite channels,
channels delivered to cable operators by video,
and a purely local service) as well as a full
range of telecommunications services.
Interactive services such as video-on-
demand, home shopping, home banking,
security and alarm services, electronic mail and
remote meter readings are also possible and are
being tested in some locations.
Cable franchises have already been granted
covering areas which include three-quarters of
all homes and nearly all urban areas in Britain.
By July 1996 there were 115 broadband cable
franchises in operation in Britain, 23 of which
had been set up within the previous year.
Regulation is as light as possible to encourage
the development of a wide range of services,
and flexible enough to adapt to new
technology. The ITC awards only one
broadband cable franchise in each area so that
the new franchisee is protected from direct
competition in the early stages. At present
there are 7 million homes able to receive
broadband cable services and there are over 1.5
million subscribers.
ITC licences are required for systems
capable of serving more than 1,000 homes.
They are awarded for each area on the basis of
competitive tendering. Systems extending
beyond a single building and up to 1,000
homes require only an individual licence from
OFTEL (see p. 320). Cable investment must
be privately financed.
There are no specific quality controls on
cable services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they need a
programme services licence from the ITC,
which includes consumer protection
requirements.
Direct Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by
which television is transmitted directly by
satellite into people’s homes, has been available
504
THE MEDIA
throughout Britain since 1989. The signals
from satellite broadcasting are received
through specially designed aerials or ‘dishes’.
Several British-based satellite television
channels have been set up to supply
programmes to cable operators and viewers
with dishes in Britain and, in some cases,
throughout Europe. Some offer general
entertainment, while others concentrate on
specific areas of interest, such as sport, music
and children’s programmes.
The largest satellite programmer is BSkyB
(British Sky Broadcasting), which provides
nine channels devoted to light entertainment,
news, feature films, sport and home shopping
transmitted from the Astra satellite.
Over 30 English language channels were
available to viewers with normal satellite dishes
at the end of 1995. The ITC also licenses a
number of foreign language services, some of
them designed for ethnic minorities within
Britain and others aimed primarily at
audiences in other countries. Viewers in
Britain may also receive a variety of television
services from other European countries.
OTHER ASPECTS
Educational Broadcasting
Both the BBC and Channel 4 broadcast
educational programmes for schools and
Continuing Education programmes for adults.
Broadcasts to schools deal with all subjects of
the National Curriculum (see p. 451), while
programmes for adults cover many areas of
learning and vocational training. Books,
pamphlets, computer software, and audio and
video cassettes are produced to supplement the
programmes. Ninety four per cent of primary
schools and 91 per cent of secondary schools in
Britain use BBC schools television; 80 per cent
of primary schools use BBC schools radio.
Channel 4 and the BBC collaborate to avoid
unnecessary duplication or scheduling clashes
in schools television. The ITC has a duty to
ensure that schools programmes are presented
on independent television.
In 1995 the BBC launched The Learning
Zone, a new night-time education and training
service. Broadcast five nights a week on BBC
2, it includes programmes for further
education colleges, schools, the Open
University (see p. 461) and BBC Focus.
During 1995—96 the BBC broadcast 797
hours of television and 149 hours of radio on
behalf of the Open University.
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not obtain revenue from the
broadcasting of advertisements or from
commercial sponsorship of programmes on its
public service channels. Its policy is to avoid
giving publicity to any firm or organised
interest except when this is necessary in
providing effective and informative
programmes. It does, however, cover
sponsored sporting and artistic events.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed on
commercial television and radio services
subject to controls. The ITC and the Radio
Authority operate codes of advertising
standards and programme sponsorship.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast between programmes
as well as in breaks during programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertisements must be
distinct and separate from programmes. The
time given to them must not be so great as to
detract from the value of the programmes as a
medium of information, education or
entertainment. Advertising on radio has
increased markedly in the last few years.
Television advertising is limited to an average
of seven minutes an hour during the day and
seven and a half minutes in the peak evening
viewing period. Advertising is prohibited in
broadcasts of religious services and in
broadcasts to schools.
The ITC and the Radio Authority’s codes
governing standards and practice in
advertising give regulations on the forms of
advertisement which are prohibited, alongside
rules and guidance on scheduling and creative
matters.
Political advertising and advertisements for
betting (other than the National Lottery and
the football pools) are prohibited. All tobacco
advertising is banned on television and
cigarette advertisements are banned on radio.
Religious advertisements may be broadcast on
commercial radio and television, provided they
505
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
comply with the guidelines issued by the ITC
and the Radio Authority.
The ITC and the Radio Authority can
impose severe penalties on any television or
radio company failing to comply with their
codes.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In Britain sponsorship is a relatively new way
of helping to finance commercial broadcasting,
although the practice has long been established
in other countries. In return for their financial
contribution, sponsors receive a credit
associating them with a particular programme.
The ITC’s Code of Programme
Sponsorship and the Radio Authority’s
Advertising and Sponsorship Code aim to
ensure that sponsors do not exert influence on
the editorial content of programmes and that
sponsorships are made clear to viewers and
listeners. News and current affairs
programmes may not be sponsored. Potential
sponsors for other categories of programme
may be debarred if their involvement could
constrain the editorial independence of the
programme maker in any way. References to
sponsors or their products must be confined to
the beginning and end of a programme and
around commercial breaks; they must not
appear in the programme itself. All
commercial radio programmes other than news
bulletins may be sponsored.
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support
non-political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent television and radio. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. Short public
service items, concerning health, safety and
welfare, are transmitted free by the BBC and
independent television and radio. All
government advertisements and public service
information films are subtitled via electronic
text to support people with hearing difficulties.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it certain
obligations over programme content.
Programmes must display, as far as possible, a
proper balance and wide range of subject
matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not
offend against good taste. Broadcasters must
also comply with legislation relating to
obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply codes providing guidance on
impartiality and on violence and standards of
taste and decency in television programmes,
particularly during hours when children are
likely to be viewing. By convention,
programmes broadcast before 21.00 hours are
expected to be suitable for a general audience,
including children.
Complaints can be made to the regulators,
including the BBC, which opened its own
Programme Complaints Unit in early 1994 to
investigate serious complaints about BBC
television or radio programmes.
The Broadcasting Act 1996 provides for the
replacement of the Broadcasting Standards
Council (which monitors programmes,
examines complaints from the public and
undertakes research) and the Broadcasting
Complaints Commission (which deals with
complaints of unfair treatment or unwarranted
infringement of privacy in programmes or in
their preparation) by a new Broadcasting
Standards Commission. From April 1997 the
BSC is required to:
• draw up and review guidance for the
avoidance of unjust or unfair treatment
and unwarranted infringement of privacy
in television and radio;
• draw up and review a code on the
portrayal of violence and sexual conduct
and on standards of taste and decency
(which television and radio broadcasters
would have to take into account when
drawing up their own guidelines);
• monitor and report on the portrayal of
violence, sexual conduct and standards of
taste and decency in programmes
generally;
• consider and adjudicate on complaints
about fairness and standards; and
• represent the Government at international
bodies concerned with setting standards
for broadcasting.
506
THE MEDIA
Parliamentary and Political Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio,
either live or, more usually, in recorded and
edited form on news and current affairs
programmes. The BBC has a specific
obligation to transmit an impartial account day
by day of the proceedings in both Houses of
Parliament.
The BBC and the commercial services
provide time on radio and television for an
annual series of party political broadcasts.
Party election broadcasts are arranged
following the announcement of a general
election. In addition, the Government may
make ministerial broadcasts on radio and
television, with opposition parties also being
allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the commercial sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and their
opinions of programmes. For television, this
work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board),
owned jointly by the BBC and the ITV
Network Centre. For radio, joint research is
undertaken for BBC and commercial radio by
RAJAR (Radio Joint Audience Research).
Both the BBC and the commercial sector
conduct regular surveys of audience opinion
on television and radio services. Public opinion
is further assessed by the BBC and ITC
through the work of their advisory committees,
councils and panels. Regular public meetings
are also held to debate services, and
consideration is given to letters and telephone
calls from listeners and viewers.
Training
All ITV (Channel 3) licensees are obliged to
provide staff training. Channel 4 also provides
a range of training for its staff and for the
independent production sector.
The BBC Centre for Broadcast Skills
Training (part of BBC Resources) operates on
a commercial basis and provides courses on all
technical aspects of broadcasting, including
craft skills. Courses can be mounted specially
to meet particular requirements.
In addition BBC World Service Training
runs courses for radio and television
broadcasters and their managers from all over
the world. Courses and training programmes
are tailor-made and carried out both in Britain
and in the countries concerned.
The Government finances overseas
students on broadcasting training courses at
the BBC, the British Council and the
Thomson Foundation; the Foundation also
conducts courses overseas in broadcast
journalism, media management, radio and
television production, and technology.
INTERNATIONAL SERVICES
BBC Worldwide
In 1994 the international and commercial
interests of the BBC were brought together in
BBC Worldwide, to enable the BBC to develop
its role in the fast-expanding broadcast and
media world. BBC Worldwide comprises BBC
World Service, funded by a government grant,
and BBC Worldwide Limited, which has three
commercial divisions-—BBC Worldwide
Television, BBC Worldwide Publishing and
BBC Worldwide Learning.
BBC World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in
English and 43 other languages worldwide. It
has a global weekly audience of at least 140
million listeners. This excludes any estimate
for listeners in countries where it is still
difficult to survey audiences. The core
programming of news, current affairs, business
and sports reports is complemented by a wide
range of cultural programmes, including
drama, literature and music.
BBC World Service programmes in English
and many other languages are made available
by satellite for rebroadcasting by agreement
with local or national radio stations, networks
and cable operators. BBC World Service Radio
International sells recorded programmes to
other broadcasters in over 100 countries.
507
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
BBC MPM—Marshall Plan of the
Mind—provides a range of business, economic
and associated political programmes to the
countries of the former Soviet Union. It is
mainly funded by the British Government’s
Know How Fund (see p. 130).
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service,
provides transcripts of radio and television
broadcasts from over 140 countries. As well
as providing a vital source of information to
the BBC, this service is also used by other
media organisations, government
departments, the commercial sector and
academic institutions.
BBC Worldwide Television
With responsibility for the BBC’s commercial
television activity, BBC Worldwide Television
is a major international broadcaster and a
leading distributor and co-producer of BBC
programmes.
In 1995-96 BBC Worldwide
Television licensed more than 15,000
hours of programming to 164
broadcasters in 80 countries, making
the BBC the largest European
exporter of television programmes.
Notable successes were Pride and
Prejudice, People's Century, Alien
Empire and Dancing in the Streets.
BBC Worldwide Television works closely
with BBC production departments,
independent producers and its network of
international offices to determine commercial
strategies for key programmes with
international licensing potential. It is also
developing premium channels to compete in
the international marketplace. BBC
World—the BBC’s 24-hour international news
and information channel—is available to over
45 million homes worldwide. BBC Prime, an
entertainment channel for Europe, has more
than 4 million subscribers.
BBC Worldwide Television has a 20 per
cent shareholding in UK Gold, an
entertainment satellite channel, and UKTV, a
new subscription channel in Australia.
BBC Worldwide Publishing
BBC Worldwide Publishing is the BBC’s
large-scale publishing and licensing operation.
Its divisions incorporate:
• BBC Magazines, which publishes popular
titles including the Radio Times and the
best-selling BBC Music;
• a consumer publishing division, which
publishes a wide range of books, videos
and spoken word audio tapes;
• BBC Multimedia, which produces
CD-ROMs3;
• BBC Licensing, which handles the
licensing of BBC properties, characters
and brands of all forms of
merchandising;
• BBC English, which develops English
language learning and teaching materials
in a variety of formats for international
markets;
• BBC Language Publishing, which is a
major publisher of multiple media
language teaching courses and products;
and
• on-line services.
BBC World Publishing is active in over 70
countries, marketing its products
and properties alongside BBC Worldwide
Television’s business operation.
BBC Worldwide Learning
BBC Worldwide Learning was established in
September 1995 as a division of BBC
Worldwide to develop commercial markets for
educational and learning products around the
world. Its goal is to establish the BBC as a
major player in this field, gaining a significant
presence in markets in Britain and
internationally, and across all media. It is
working to exploit existing assets and has
started evaluating the scope for new interactive
learning services and products for the digital
age. These include CD-ROMs, on-line
services and the BBC Learning channel.

THE MEDIA
COI Overseas Radio and Television
Services
The Central Office of Information (COI),
which procures and provides publicity material
and other information services on behalf of
government departments and other public
agencies, produces radio programmes for
overseas. Recorded material is sent to radio
stations all over the world. COI television
services also distribute material such as
documentary and magazine programmes
commissioned by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office or acquired from
television broadcasters.
News Agencies
WTN (Worldwide Television News), owned
by ITN, ABC (the American Broadcasting
Corporation) and Channel 9 in Australia,
supplies news and a wide range of television
services to about 1,000 broadcasters in over 90
countries, as well as to governments and
international corporations. It also produces
British Satellite News, an international satellite
news service, for the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office. The service, under
FCO editorial control, transmits programmes
five days a week. These are distributed, either
by satellite or on hard copy compilations, free
to television stations throughout Eastern
Europe, the Middle East and Asia for use in
news bulletins. WTN provides services
through the Eurovision network (see below)
and by satellite.
For details of Reuters Television, see
p. 514.
International Relations
European Agreements
Britain has implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
broadcasting: the European Community
Directive on Broadcasting and the Council of
Europe Convention on Transfrontier
Television. Under these, countries have to
remove restrictions on the retransmission of
programmes originating from other
participating countries. They must also ensure
that their own broadcasters observe certain
minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency and the
portrayal of sex and violence on television.
Audiovisual Eureka (AYE), which has a
membership of 3 3* European countries,
including Britain, aims to help improve aspects
of the European audiovisual industry through
practical measures to enhance training,
development and distribution. It concentrates
its work on the countries of central and eastern
Europe. An important task of AYE has also
been to establish an Audiovisual Observatory
based in Strasbourg which collects,
disseminates and standardises European
audiovisual data for the industry.
In 1995 Britain played an active part in the
negotiations establishing the European
Community MEDIA II programme. The
programme (succeeding MEDIA I on 1
January 1996) will stimulate a number of
initiatives to improve training (especially
business and new technology skills) and the
development and distribution of films and
television programmes.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC and the Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news and
programme exchange. The Union is
responsible for co-ordinating the exchange of
programmes and news over the Eurovision
network and intercontinental satellite links.
The Union provides a forum linking the major
public services and national broadcasters of
Western Europe and elsewhere, and
co-ordinates joint operations in radio and
television.
International Telecommunication Union
The BBC takes part in the work of the
International Telecommunication Union, the
United Nations agency responsible for
regulating and controlling all international
telecommunications services, including radio
and television. The Union also allocates and
registers all radio frequencies, and promotes
and co-ordinates the international study of
technical problems in broadcasting.
509
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
The introduction of computer-based digital
production equipment for both television and
radio is one of the most significant technical
advances affecting the broadcasting industry in
Britain in recent years. It allows programmes
to be made more quickly and more effectively,
with the sound and vision information being
held and manipulated on computer disc
storage units. A significant proportion of
programmes produced by the BBC and
independent companies is edited on this type
of equipment.
Other recent advances include:
• the introduction of ‘all-digital’ studios
(including digital video recorders and
control desks) at both the BBC and
independent companies;
• the introduction of digital transmission
links, mainly based on optical fibre
technology, between studios and from
studios to the transmitters; and
• the use of miniature cameras and
transmitters.
The BBC and the ITC also undertake
long-term research into broadcast technology.
Key development areas include:
• digital television transmission (see p. 497);
• the transmission of digital radio
broadcasting (DAB) from terrestrial
transmitters and by satellite; and
• digital widescreen and high definition
television (HDTV), and its associated
surround sound.
The Press
More daily newspapers, national and regional,
are sold for every person in Britain than in
most other developed countries. On an average
day nearly 60 per cent of people over the age of
15 read a national morning newspaper; over 65
per cent read a Sunday newspaper. Around 90
per cent read a regional or local newspaper.
National papers have an average total
circulation of over 13 million on weekdays and
nearly 17 million on Sundays, although the
total readership is considerably greater. Men
are more likely to read newspapers than
women, and more people in the 25-44 age
group read a daily newspaper than in any other
age group.
There are about 1,400 regional and local
newspaper titles and over 6,500 periodical
publications.
Several newspapers have had very long and
distinguished histories. The Observer, for
example, first published in 1791, is the oldest
national Sunday newspaper in the world, and
The Times, Britain’s oldest daily national
newspaper, began publication in 1785.
The press caters for a range of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where they
express pronounced views and show obvious
political leanings in their editorial comments,
these may derive from proprietorial and other
non-party influences. Nevertheless, during
general election campaigns many newspapers
recommend their readers to vote for a
particular political party. Even newspapers
which adopt strong political views in their
editorial columns sometimes include feature
and other types of articles by authors of
different political persuasions.
In order to preserve their character and
traditions, some newspapers and periodicals
are governed by trustee-type arrangements.
Others have management arrangements that
endeavour to ensure their editors’ authority
and independence.
In recent years working practices
throughout the newspaper industry have
undergone major changes in response to the
challenges posed by computer-based
technology and the need to contain costs.
Newsprint, more than half of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales revenue,
newspapers and periodicals earn considerable
amounts from their advertising. Total
spending on press advertising (including
newspapers, magazines and directories) in
1995 was £5,465 million, making the press by
far the largest advertising medium in Britain.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the
British press receives no subsidies and
relatively few tax and postal concessions.
510
THE MEDIA
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
Ownership of the national, London and many
regional daily newspapers lies in the hands of a
number of large press publishing groups.
Although most enterprises are organised as
limited liability companies, individual and
partner proprietorship survives. The large
national newspaper and periodical publishers are
major corporations; many are involved in the
whole field of publishing and communications.
The National Press
The national press consists of 10 morning daily
papers and 9 Sunday papers (see Table 30.1).
Formerly they were produced in or near Fleet
Street in central London with, in some cases,
northern editions being printed in Manchester.
All the national papers have now moved their
editorial and printing facilities to other parts of
London or away from the capital altogether.
The Daily Mirror and the Independent, for
example, are printed in Watford and Oldham;
the Financial Times is printed in London and
Leeds. Scottish editions of the Sun, the News
of the World and the Sunday Times (Scottish
Section) are printed in Glasgow.
In order to improve distribution and sales
overseas, editions of the Financial Times are
printed in Frankfurt, Roubaix (northern
France), Hong Kong, New Jersey, Los
Angeles, Tokyo and Madrid, while the
Guardian prints international editions in
Frankfurt and Roubaix. The Times prints in
Charteroix (Belgium), Cork and Dublin, while
the Sun prints in Barcelona and Tenerife.
National newspapers are often described as
either ‘quality’, ‘mid-market’ or ‘popular’
papers on the basis of differences in style and
content. Five dailies and four Sundays are
usually described as ‘quality’ newspapers,
which are directed at readers who want full
information on a wide range of public matters.
Popular newspapers appeal to people wanting
news of a more entertaining character,
presented more concisely. ‘Mid-market’
publications cover the intermediate market.
Quality papers are normally broadsheet
(large-sheet) in format and mid-market and
popular papers tabloid (small-sheet). Today, a
mid-market daily which started in the
mid-1980s, closed in November 1995.
Many newspapers are printed in colour and
most produce colour supplements as part of
the Saturday or Sunday paper, with articles on
travel, food and wine, and other leisure topics.
The leading Scottish papers, The Scotsman
and the Herald, have considerable circulations
outside Scotland.
Regional Newspapers
There are about 100 daily (Monday to
Saturday) and Sunday newspapers, and about
1,300 weekly paid-for and free newspapers
(not including business, sporting and religious
newspapers).
England
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post
(Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and
the Eastern Daily Press (Norwich) each has a
circulation of approximately 75,000, and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday
Mercury (Birmingham) and the Sunday Sun
(Newcastle upon Tyne)—sell 145,000 and
125,000 copies respectively. Circulation figures
of evening papers start at about 10,000 and
most are in the 20,000 to 100,000 range. Those
with much larger sales include the Manchester
Evening News (180,600), Wolverhampton’s
Express and Star (208,700) and the Birmingham
Evening Mail (197,500). Paid-for weekly •
papers have a mainly local appeal and most
have circulations in the 2,000 to 30,000 range.
London has one paid-for evening paper, the
Evening Standard, with a circulation of
441,300. It covers national and international
news as well as local affairs. Local weeklies
include papers for every district in Greater
London, which are often different local
editions of one centrally published paper.
Wales
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the
Western Mail, with a circulation of 64,200, and
Wales on Sunday, with a circulation of 59,300.

Free Distribution Newspapers
About 800 free distribution newspapers,
mostly weekly and financed by advertising, are
published in Britain; over half are produced by
established newspaper publishers. They have
enjoyed rapid growth in recent years.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newspapers and magazines in Britain are
produced by members of ethnic minorities.
Most are published weekly, fortnightly or
monthly. A Chinese newspaper, Sing Tao, the
Urdu Daily fang (see below) and the Arabic
Al-Arab, however, are dailies.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include the
Gleaner and West Indian Digest. The Voice and
Caribbean Times, both weeklies, are aimed at
the black population in general. The Weekly
Journal, launched in 1992, is the first ‘quality’
broadsheet aimed at Britain’s black
community.
The Asian Times is an English language
weekly for people of Asian descent; the Sikh
Courier is produced quarterly. Examples of
ethnic language newspapers include the Urdu
Daily Jang, an offshoot of the largest
circulation paper in Pakistan, and the weeklies
Garavi Gujarat and Gujarat Samachar.
Publications also appear in Bengali, Hindi and
Punjabi. The fortnightly Asian Trader and
Asian Business are both successful ethnic
business publications, while Cineblitz
International targets those interested in the
Asian film industry.
Many provincial papers print special
editions for their local populations. The
Leicester Mercury, for example, publishes a
daily Asian edition, incorporating news from
the South Asian sub-continent.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
The 6,500 periodical publications are classified
as ‘general consumer’, ‘consumer specialist’
and ‘business and professional’ titles. There
are also many in-house and customer
magazines produced by businesses or public
services for their employees and/or clients.
Directories and similar publications number
more than 2,000. The ‘alternative’ press
comprises a large number of titles, many of
them devoted to radical politics, community
matters, religion, the occult, science or
ecology.

issues, politics, literature and the arts from an
independent socialist point of view, and the

PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association, whose members
publish national newspapers, and the
Newspaper Society, which represents British
regional and local newspapers. The Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society represents the
interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Publishers’
Association acts on behalf of the owners of
weekly newspapers in Scotland; and
Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers is
made up of proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland. The membership of the
Periodical Publishers Association includes
most independent publishers of business,
professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists and the
Chartered Institute of Journalists. The main
printing union is the Graphical, Paper and
Media Union, with some 225,000 members.
The Foreign Press Association was formed
in 1888 to help the correspondents of overseas

TRAINING AND EDUCATION
The National Council for the Training of
Journalists (NCTJ), which represents many
515
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
regional newspaper publishers, sets and
conducts examinations, and organises short
training courses for journalists.
The two main methods of entry into
newspaper journalism are selection for NCTJ
pre-entry courses at a college of further or
higher education or direct recruitment by a
regional or local newspaper. Both types of
entrant take part in ‘on-the-job’ training.
Similar courses exist for press photographers.
Universities and colleges which offer
undergraduate and/or postgraduate courses in
journalism include City University, London;
the University of Central Lancashire;
Bournemouth University; Sheffield
University; the University of Wales, Cardiff;
Strathclyde University; Glasgow Caledonian
University; and the London College of
Printing, which also provides GCE (General
Certificate of Education) Advanced (A) level
courses in journalism.
Courses for regional newspapers in such
subjects as newspaper sales, advertising, and
management are provided by the Newspaper
Society’s training service. Some newspaper
publishers carry out journalist training
independently of the NCTJ, awarding their
own certificates or diplomas. National
Vocational Qualifications (see p. 458) are now
available in newspaper journalism.
Specialist training courses for journalists
and broadcasters from developing countries
and from Eastern Europe are offered by the
Thomson Foundation in Cardiff. The
Foundation runs training courses overseas and
provides consultants to assist newspapers and
news agencies in editorial, advertising and
broadcast management.
Newspapers in Education, a worldwide
scheme using newspapers to improve
standards of literacy among young people, is

for teaching a wide range of subjects at all
levels of education. The scheme has over 700
projects operated by regional newspapers in
partnership with local schools.
Through its charitable trust—the Reuter
Foundation—Reuters offers assistance to
overseas journalists to study and train in
Britain and other parts of the world. The
Foundation awards fellowships to overseas
journalists to spend up to one year at Oxford
University. It also runs shorter practical
training programmes in London for journalists
from the former communist countries of
Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
The Periodicals Training Council is the
official training organisation in periodical
publishing. It offers a range of short courses
covering management, editorial work,
advertisement sales and circulation sales. It has
special responsibility for editorial training and
administers an editorial training scheme for
those already in employment.
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
The Press Complaints Commission
The Press Complaints Commission, a
non-statutory body, was established in 1991
following recommendations in a report on
privacy and related matters by a
government-appointed independent
committee. The Commission was set up by the
newspaper and periodical industry in a final
attempt to make self-regulation of the press
work properly. It is funded by PRESSBOF
(the Press Standards Board of Finance), which
co-ordinates and promotes self-regulation
within the industry. These measures were
prompted by growing criticism of press
standards, with allegations of unjustified
invasion of privacy and inaccurate and biased
reporting, among other abuses, resulting in
calls for government regulation of the press.
In its White Paper Privacy and Media
Intrusion: The Government’s Response,
published in 1995, the Government rejected
proposals for statutory regulation of the press,
and for legislation to give protection to
privacy. Instead, it endorsed self-regulation
under the Commission, and recommended
further measures to make it more effective.
The Commission’s membership is drawn
from newspaper and magazine editors and
from people outside the industry. It deals with
complaints by members of the public about the
content and conduct of newspapers and
magazines, and advises editors and journalists.
It operates a code of practice agreed by editors
governing respect for privacy, opportunity to
reply, corrections, journalists’ behaviour,
516
THE MEDIA
references to race and religion, payments to
criminals for articles, protection of confidential
sources and other matters. The Commission
publishes regular reports of its findings.
The industry and the Press Complaints
Commission have reinforced voluntary
regulation through, for example:
• measures to increase the number of
independent members of the Commission
to ensure a lay majority;
• a strengthening of the code of practice,
and the incorporation of the code into the
contracts of employment of most editors
and journalists;
• the setting up of a helpline service for
members of the public who fear the code
of practice has been, or is about to be,
breached; and
• the appointment of a Privacy
Commissioner with special powers to
investigate complaints about privacy.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and journalists
are subject to the law in the same way as any
other citizen. However, certain statutes include
sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies (see p.
498);
• the transfer of newspaper assets; and
• the right of press representatives to be
supplied with agenda and reports for
meetings of local authorities, and
reasonable facilities for taking notes and
telephoning reports.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
/ newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see p. 493).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, copyright, financial services and fraud
legislation. Legal restrictions are imposed on
certain types of prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press. A
newspaper may not publish comments on the
conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings, nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such areas
as defence and international relations, where
such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. However, these are
restrictions on publication—that is, on
dissemination to the public by any means—not
just through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Defence Advisory Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which has
agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of information
might endanger national security. Details of
these categories are contained in Defence
Advisory Notices (DA Notices) circulated to
the media, whose members are asked to seek
advice from the Secretary of the Committee, a
retired senior military officer, before
publishing information in these areas.
Compliance with any advice offered by the
Secretary is expected but there is no legal force
behind it and the final decision on whether to
publish rests with the editor, producer or
publisher concerned.
The Notices were published for the first
time in July 1993 to promote a better
understanding of the system and to contribute
to greater openness in government.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
promotions, cinema and direct mail, is
regulated by the Advertising Standards
517
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Authority, an independent body funded by a
levy on display advertising expenditure. The
Authority aims to promote and enforce the
highest standards of advertising in the interests
of the public through its supervision of the
British Codes of Advertising and Sales
Promotion.
The Codes’ basic principles are to ensure
that advertisements:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of responsibility
to the consumer and society; and
• respect the principles of fair competition
generally accepted in business.
The Authority monitors advertisements to
ensure their compliance with the Codes and
investigates any complaints received.
The advertising industry has agreed to
abide by the Codes and to support them
with effective sanctions. Free and
confidential pre-publication advice is
offered to assist publishers, agencies and
advertisers. The Authority’s main sanction
is to recommend that advertisements
considered to be in breach of the Code
should not be published. This is normally
sufficient to ensure that an advertisement is
withdrawn or amended. The Authority also
publishes monthly reports on the results of
its investigations.
The Authority is recognised by the Office
of Fair Trading as the established means of
controlling non-broadcast advertising. It can
refer misleading advertisements to the
Director General of Fair Trading, who has the
power to seek an injunction to prevent their
publication.

Over 100 British sportsmen and women currently hold world championship
titles in sports ranging from athletics to windsurfing. Britain won a total of 15
medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and 122 at the subsequent Paralympics.
The finals of the European football championship—Euro 96—were held in
England in June 1996, the largest sporting event to be held in Britain for 30
years. A new national stadium is planned in England.
It is estimated that 29 million people in Britain
over the age of 16 regularly take part in sport
or exercise. The 1993 General Household
Survey found that almost two-thirds of those
interviewed had taken part in at least one
sporting activity during the previous four
weeks. The most popular participation sports
or activities are walking (including rambling
and hiking), swimming, snooker/pool, keep
fit/yoga and cycling.
Men were more likely than women to have
participated in a sporting activity, with 72 per
cent of men claiming to have taken part in at
least one sport during the previous four weeks
compared with 57 per cent of women.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
In July 1995 the Government issued a policy
statement—Sport: Raising the Game—with a
set of proposals designed to develop,
encourage and promote sport in Britain. In
July 1996 a report was published setting out
the action taken to promote sport during the
previous 12 months, and a series of policy
announcements was made. The Government’s
aim is to improve sporting opportunity at all
levels, from school sport, through clubs and
further and higher education institutions, to
the highest level.
Separate policy statements were issued in
1995 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
British Academy of Sport
The Government wishes to see the
establishment of a British Academy of Sport as
the pinnacle of a regional network of centres of
sporting excellence and academies for
individual sports. It will focus on the needs of
top-level performers and provide world-class
training facilities. Support will be provided to
selected sports and their national governing-
bodies with the intention of developing future
British world and Olympic champions.
Support services will be provided direct to
performers throughout Britain and will include
sports science support, sports medicine,

coaching, ‘lifestyle management services’, and
financial assistance with training programmes.
A prospectus inviting bids for the Academy
was issued in July 1996 and it is hoped that a
final decision will be made by the end of
January 1997. The cost of the Academy and its
network of regional sites is expected to be
financed principally from the National Lottery
Sports Fund.
Sport in Schools and for Young People
The Government believes that all young
children should have the opportunity to learn
basic sports skills. Physical education (PE),
which includes sport, is a compulsory subject
in the National Curriculum (see p. 451) for all
pupils aged 5 to 16 in state-maintained schools
in England and Wales and in the common
curriculum in Northern Ireland. When the
National Curriculum was revised in 1995, it
placed a greater emphasis on traditional team
games and competitive sports.
In Scotland the Secretary of State has
issued National Guidelines which contain
programmes of study and attainment targets
for physical activity for pupils aged 5 to 14.
Assessment of Sporting Facilities
Two new schemes are being set up to assess
the sporting merits of schools:
• a Sportsmark scheme to recognise schools
that have effective policies for promoting
sport; and
• ‘Sportsmark Gold’ awards for the most
innovative schools.
Schools will be expected to aim for four
hours of structured sporting activity a week
outside formal lessons. The first awards for
secondary schools will be made in April 1997.
An equivalent scheme for primary schools will
be set up in the 1997-98 academic year. In
Northern Ireland the scheme will start in
primary schools.
Accountability and Inspection
From September 1996 onwards schools have
had to include in their annual prospectuses
details of their sporting aims and the provision
for sport, and to record in their annual
governors’ reports how they have met these
aims. OFSTED (see p. 455) has sent to schools
a summary of its survey of good practice in
physical education and sport in schools, and
OFSTED’s framework of school inspections is
being extended to look at extra-curricular
sporting provision made by the school in
addition to timetabled PE.
Partnerships with the Local Community
The Government is encouraging stronger links
between schools and the wider community to
ensure that children have access to the sports
amenities which clubs and associations can
make available outside school hours. Efforts to
strengthen these links have been promoted by
schemes such as ‘Team Sport Scotland’, which
aims to promote the development of school-
aged team sport, with support from The
Scottish Office. In October 1996 a fl million
challenge fund was established in England to
promote links between schools and sports clubs.
National Junior Sport Programme
In 1996 the National Junior Sport Programme
(NJSP) was launched in England with the aim
of encouraging sporting participation and of
developing the range of children’s sports skills.
It is run by the English Sports Council (ESC,
see p. 522). Key partners include the Youth
Sport Trust, the physical education profession,
local authorities, youth clubs, the National
Coaching Foundation (see p. 522) and national
governing bodies of sport. One of the
programmes in the NJSP is the TOP
programme designed to provide 4 million
children with sports equipment, qualified
coaches and places to play. A total of £14
million is being provided over a three-year
period by the National Lottery Sports Fund
(£7.7 million), the ESC and private sector
funding including business sponsorship.
The scheme contains four main elements:
• Top Play, introduced in schools in April
1996, which is for those aged four to nine
and aims to develop core skills, such as
co-ordination, ball skills and teamwork;
520
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
• BT Top Sport, for those aged seven to 11,
which introduces children to games
leading up to mini versions of seven sports
including cricket, football, hockey, rugby
and tennis;
• Champion Coaching (see p. 522), run by
the National Coaching Foundation; and
• Top Club, a programme which assists
governing bodies of sport and their clubs
to develop junior coaching and
competitive opportunities for young
people—it is being piloted in
gymnastics, swimming, athletics,
table tennis, basketball and rugby union,
and will be fully launched in autumn
1997.
Sport for young people is also given a high
priority by the Sports Councils in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Other Aspects
Other measures include increasing investment
in coaching schemes for teachers with the
opportunity for them to acquire coaching
qualifications. A further £1 million is to be
provided by the ESC for coaching
opportunities via the National Coaching
Foundation and the governing bodies of sport.
About £1 million of funds under the
Sportsmatch scheme (see p. 528) are to be set
aside for schemes for young people.
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for National Heritage
has responsibility for the Government’s
policies on sport and recreation in England.
The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland have similar
responsibilities in their countries.
Responsibility for those aspects of government
sports policy of benefit to Britain as a whole
rests with the Secretary of State for National
Heritage, in association with the respective
home country Secretaries of State.
Government responsibilities in sport and
recreation are largely decentralised and are
channelled through the Sports Councils.
Sports Councils
The Sports Councils, appointed and directly
funded by the Government, are the principal
advisers on sporting matters. The Government
works closely with them in implementing its
sports policies.
The Sports Councils make grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to
the governing bodies of sports and other
national organisations, administer the National
Sports Centres (see p. 524), and manage and
allocate the National Lottery Sports Fund.
Grants and loans are also made to voluntary
organisations, local authorities and commercial
organisations to help them provide sports
facilities. Facilities receiving support from the
Sports Councils include sports halls, indoor
swimming pools, intensive-use pitches, indoor
tennis halls and school facilities.
During 1996 the structure of the Sports
Councils has been reorganised, with the
replacement of the former Sports Council—
which used to have responsibility for general
matters affecting Great Britain and matters
specifically concerning England—by two new
bodies: the United Kingdom Sports Council
(UKSC) and the English Sports Council
(ESC). There are three other Councils: the
Sports Council for Wales; the Scottish Sports
Council; and the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland.
The UKSC will lead in all aspects of sport
requiring strategic planning, co-ordination and
representation for the benefit of Britain as a
whole. Key functions include representing
British sporting interests overseas and
increasing influence at international level,
co-ordinating policy for bringing major
sporting events to Britain, and identifying
areas of unnecessary duplication and waste in
the administration of sport. It is giving
particular support to the pursuit of high
standards of sporting achievement. It will also
have an important role in advising and guiding
the home country Sports Councils on Lottery
projects of significance to Britain. The UKSC
has ten members: an independent chairman;
the chairmen of the four other Sports
Councils; and key individuals from amateur
and professional sport, one of whom chairs the
British Olympic Association (see p. 523).
521
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The ESC has similar responsibilities to
those of the Sports Councils in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Key ESC
functions include young people and sport, the
encouragement and development of
performance and excellence, and the provision
of sporting facilities in England.
Local Authorities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the local
community. In England local authorities
manage over 1,500 indoor centres, largely built
in the last 20 years, as well as numerous
outdoor amenities. Facilities include parks,
lakes, playing fields, sports centres, tennis
courts, artificial pitches, golf courses and
swimming/leisure pools. Many local
authorities employ full-time sports
development officers.
National Sports Associations
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
(CCPR) is the largest sport and recreation
federation in the world. It comprises 209
British bodies and 68 English associations,
most of which are governing bodies of sport.
The Scottish Sports Association, the Welsh
Sports Association and the Northern Ireland
Council of Physical Recreation (NICPR) are
similar associations. Their primary aim is to
represent the interests of their members to the
appropriate national and local authorities,
including the Sports Councils, from which
they receive funding. Award schemes run by
the associations include the CCPR’s
Community Sports Leaders Award scheme
and the NICPR’s Service to Sport Awards.
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400
independent governing bodies, whose
functions include drawing up rules, holding
events, regulating membership, and selecting
and training national teams. Governing bodies
receiving funding from the Sports Councils are
required to produce four-year development
plans, from the grass roots to the highest
competitive levels and including their
proposals for young people. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation, such
as walking and cycling. The majority of the
sports clubs in Britain belong to the
appropriate governing body.
National Coaching Foundation
The National Coaching Foundation (NCF)
works closely with national governing bodies
of sport, local authorities, and higher and
further education. Supported by the Sports
Councils, it provides a comprehensive range of
education and development services for
coaches in all sports. The NCF network has
ten regional offices in England, and one each in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The NCF also runs Champion Coaching,
one of the four elements of the National Junior
Sport Programme (see p. 520). Champion
Coaching provides after-school coaching in a
wide variety of sports in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. In 1996—97 there will be 90
schemes, with about 30,000 children and 3,000
coaches participating.
Women and Sport
Efforts to narrow the gap between men’s and
women’s participation in sporting activities
have resulted in more women taking part in
sport. Women are now being encouraged to
adopt leadership roles, such as coaches,
officials and administrators. Projects to
promote coaching opportunities have been
established by the Sports Councils in
partnership with the NCF and the Women’s
Sports Foundation (WSF). The Sports
Councils have also supported the provision of
management training for women, while a
women and sports science and sports medicine
network has been established to help increase
the number of women in this area and to
encourage them to reach senior positions.
The WSF is a voluntary organisation
promoting the interests of women and girls in
sport and active recreation. It encourages the
establishment of women’s sports groups
throughout Britain and organises a wide range
of events and activities. It runs both the
Sportswomen of the Year Awards and an
annual nationwide awards scheme for girls and
young women between the ages of 11 and 19.
522
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Sport for Disabled People
The governing bodies of sport are increasingly
taking responsibility for disabled people. Close
liaison takes place with the Sports Councils,
which provide advice to governing bodies on
encouraging the integration of people with
disabilities.
The key organisations for people with
disabilities are the British Sports Association
for the Disabled (BSAD), the United
Kingdom Sports Association for People with
Learning Disability (UKSAPLD), the British
Paralympic Association (BPA—see below) and
a range of bodies concerned with individual
disabilities and single sports. These include
the Riding for the Disabled Association, which
caters for some 25,000 riders.
The BSAD is a national body working
across all the disabilities. It organises regional
and national championships in a wide range of
sports and also runs training courses, coaching
courses and development days. The Scottish
and the Welsh Sports Associations for the
Disabled and the Northern Ireland Committee
on Sport for People with Disabilities have
similar co-ordinating roles.
The UKSAPLD is a co-ordinating body
with a membership of over 20 national
organisations. It promotes and develops
opportunities in sport and recreation for
people with learning disability.
There are five national disability sports
organisations concerned with individual
disabilities: the British Amputee and Les
Autres Sports Association; British Blind
Sport; the British Deaf Sports Council; the
British Wheelchair Sports Foundation; and
Cerebral Palsy Sport. They provide coaching
and help to organise national competitions in
conjunction with the national governing bodies
of sport and the BSAD.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic Association (BOA) is the
National Olympic Committee for Britain and
comprises representatives of the 33 governing
bodies of Olympic sports. Its primary function
is to organise the participation of British teams
in the Olympic Games.
The BOA determines the size of British
Olympic teams and sets standards for selection,
raises funds and makes all necessary
arrangements for Britain’s participation in the
Olympics. The British team contained over 300
competitors in the 1996 Olympics and won 15
medals: one gold, eight silver and six bronze.
T he BOA also makes important contributions
to the preparation of competitors in the period
between Games. For example, multi-sport
training camps were set up in Tallahassee in the
United States to allow athletes to experience
training in a climate similar to that in Atlanta.
The Association’s British Olympic Medical
Centre at Northwick Park Hospital in north
London supplies a medical back-up service for
competitors before and during the Olympics.
The BOA is supported by sponsorship and by
donations from the private sector and the public.
The BOA is investigating whether a British
city could submit a viable bid for the 2008
Olympic Games, in the light of the selection of
Manchester or Wembley (London) as the site
of the new national stadium (see p. 524).
British Paralympic Association
Britain’s participation in the Paralympics is
organised by the BPA, which liaises closely
with the BOA. The UKSPALD is responsible,
in partnership with the BPA, for the
preparation and training of the Paralympic
team. In 1996, 244 competitors represented
Britain in the Paralympics and won a total of
122 medals: 39 gold, 42 silver and 41 bronze.
Sports Clubs
Local sports clubs provide a wide variety of
recreational facilities. Some cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those
providing sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. It is estimated that there are over 150,000
voluntary sports clubs affiliated to the national
governing bodies of sport. Many clubs linked
to business firms cater for sporting activities.
Commercial facilities include fitness centres,
tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller-skating
rinks, squash courts, golf courses and driving
ranges, riding stables and marinas.
Countryside Bodies
The Countryside Commission (for England),
the Countryside Council for Wales and
523
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scottish Natural Heritage are responsible for
conserving and improving the natural beauty
of the countryside, and for encouraging the
provision of facilities for open-air recreation.
They are also responsible for designating
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty, heritage coasts and National Scenic
Areas (see pp. 368-9).
In Northern Ireland the Environment and
Heritage Service, an agency within the
Department of the Environment, is
responsible for protecting and conserving the
natural environment and promoting its
appreciation. The Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside provides
independent advice on environmental issues to
the Service.
British Waterways
British Waterways is a publicly owned body
responsible for managing and developing
much of Great Britain’s inland waterways.
Many leisure and recreational pursuits, such as
angling and various types of sailing and
boating, are enjoyed on waterways and
reservoirs. British Waterways, which is
responsible for approximately 2,000 miles
(3,220 km) of canals and river navigations,
actively promotes water safety and community
activities.
Playing Fields
The National Playing Fields Association is a
charity which aims to ensure that there are
adequate playing fields and playspace available
for use by the community. There are affiliated
associations in the English and Welsh counties
and independent organisations in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
Under government action to improve the
protection of playing fields, the appropriate
Sports Council will have to be consulted on
planning applications affecting playing fields,
while a government-supported research
project will investigate the effectiveness of
existing planning guidance.
MAJOR SPORTS FACILITIES
Britain has a range of world-class sporting
facilities for training and competition at the
highest level including 13 National Sports
Centres, operated by the Sports Councils.
Facilities are being expanded, notably
through the planned new national stadium
and developments in Manchester, which will
host the Commonwealth Games in 2002.
Preparations for the Games include the
construction of a £55 million indoor arena
with seating for 18,000 people, and a
3,500-capacity velodrome opened in 1994
(see p. 525). These two facilities were
assisted by a government grant of £43
million.
National Stadium
A new national sports stadium for England is
planned to provide facilities of the highest
standard and with a large seating capacity to
attract major world sports events. Popular
spectator sports likely to use the new stadium
include football, rugby league and athletics.
A capacity of 80,000 is envisaged. Five
venues were nominated—Birmingham,
Bradford, Manchester, Sheffield and
Wembley (London). This was reduced to a
short list of Manchester and Wembley in
1995. A decision is expected to be taken by
the ESC by the end of 1996. A major part of
the funding is likely to come from the
National Lottery Sports Fund.
National Sports Centres
First priority at the National Sports Centres is
given to the governing bodies of sport for
national squad training and for the training of
coaches. However, the Centres also make their
facilities available to top sportsmen and women
for individual training and to the local
community. Most of the Centres provide
residential facilities.
England
The ESC operates six major National Sports
Centres. Crystal Palace in London is a leading
competition venue for a wide range of sports
and a major training centre for national squads,
clubs and schools, and serious enthusiasts. The
Centre is a regional centre of excellence for
athletics, netball, weightlifting and swimming.
524
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Crystal Palace stadium is Britain’s major
international athletics venue, with capacity for
17,000 spectators. Other facilities include
Olympic-size swimming and diving pools and
a sports injury centre. The Centre also houses
the National Boxing Academy.
Bisham Abbey in Berkshire caters for a
number of sports, including tennis, football,
hockey, weightlifting, squash, rugby union and
golf. The England football, rugby union and
hockey squads train at the Centre. Bisham
Abbey has long-standing partnerships with the
British Amateur Weightlifting Association and
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), which
has helped to develop the Abbey as the
National Tennis Training Centre and the
home of the LTA Rover Tennis School.
Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire offers extensive sports facilities,
which are used by a variety of national teams.
Facilities include the Olympic Gymnastics
Centre, regularly used by the British
gymnastic squads, and extensive playing fields
for football and hockey. The Football
Association (FA) uses Lilleshall as its base for
major coaching activities. The FA school has
32 places for boys aged 15 and 16, who each
take up a two-year residency funded by an FA
scholarship. Lilleshall also houses the Olympic
Archery Centre.
The National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire is one
of the most comprehensive water sports
centres in the world. There are facilities for
rowing, canoeing, water-skiing, powerboating,
ski-racing, angling and sailing. Its main
features are a 2,000-metre regatta course and
the only purpose-built floodlit canoe slalom
course in the world.
The National Cycling Centre, opened in
Manchester in 1994, is Britain’s first indoor
velodrome. The Centre was the venue for the
World Cycling Championships in August and
September 1996 (see p. 532).
Wales
The Sports Council for Wales runs two
National Sports Centres: the Welsh Institute
of Sport and the National Watersports Centre.
The Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff is
the country’s premier venue for top-level
training and for competition in a large number
of sports. Facilities include a world-standard
gymnastics hall, a sports science laboratory and
a sports injury clinic.
The National Watersports Centre at Plas
Menai in north Wales is primarily a centre of
excellence for sailing and canoeing, with an
extensive range of activities including dinghy
and catamaran sailing, offshore cruising and
powerboat training.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre, a
third centre, is run by the ESC. Situated in
Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, it
offers courses in rock climbing,
mountaineering, sea and river canoeing,
orienteering, skiing and most other
mountain-based activities. It is renowned as
Britain’s leading training institution for the
development of mountain instructors.
Scotland
Scotland has three National Sports Centres,
which are operated by the Scottish Sports
Council.
The National Outdoor Training Centre at
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore caters for a
wide range of activities, including hill walking,
rock climbing, mountaineering, skiing,
kayaking and canoeing. Its main purpose is to
provide top-quality training for those who
intend to lead or instruct others in outdoor
activities. A new biathlon and cross-country
skiing facility was opened in 1994.
The Inverclyde National Sports Training
Centre at Largs has a large number of
facilities, including a gymnastics hall, a golf
training facility and a laboratory for fitness
assessment. The Centre also acts as an
important venue for major championships.
Inverclyde was used by 28 governing bodies of
sport in 1995-96, many of them using it as
their national training base.
The Cumbrae National Water Sports
Training Centre on the island of Great
Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde offers an
extensive range of courses catering for all levels
of ability. The Centre has a comprehensive
range of modern craft for a wide variety of
sailing activities, as well as sub-aqua diving
equipment. Cumbrae regularly hosts major
sailing championships.
525
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Centre for Outdoor
Activities at Tollymore in County Down, run
by the Sports Council for Northern Ireland,
offers courses in mountaineering, rock
climbing, canoeing and outdoor adventure.
Leadership and instructor courses leading to
nationally recognised qualifications are also
available.
A Northern Ireland Outdoor Team Sports
Training Centre is under development in
Belfast, with the assistance of a £1 million
grant from the Foundation for Sport and
the Arts (see p. 528) and £550,000 from
the Government. The first phase, involving
two new synthetic pitches, was opened in
1995 at Queen’s University of Belfast
Playing Fields.
SPORTS MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute,
funded by the UKSC and ESC, is responsible
for the co-ordination of sports medicine
services. Based at the medical college of St
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, its facilities
include a physiology laboratory, library and
information centre.
Work is in progress to develop a network of
regional centres to provide both clinical and
educational services, which will be linked with
new support services at the National Sports
Centres. In Scotland a network of 33 sports
medicine centres provides specialist help with
sports injuries.
The Scottish Sports Council has developed
a partnership with the Universities of
Strathclyde and Aberdeen which led to the
opening in 1995 of the Scottish Institute of
Sports Medicine and Sports Science. The
Institute aims to form partnerships with
national governing bodies to provide athletes
and coaches with high-quality medical and
scientific support. A Northern Ireland Sports
Medicine Centre was established in June 1996
as a partnership between the Sports Council
for Northern Ireland and a local healthcare
trust.
/
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports
Councils, in collaboration with the BOA and
the NCF, in an effort to raise the standards of
performance of national squads. The nature of
the support provided may cover biomechanical
(human movement), physiological (physical
response to exercise and training), or
psychological factors (the mental processes
that influence performance). There are 15
governing bodies involved in the UKSC’s
Sports Science Support Programme, and the
ESC is supporting 17 projects involving 13
governing bodies. The Sports Council for
Wales has established a sports science service
at the Welsh Institute of Sport with support
from the Welsh Office.
Drug Abuse in Sport
The UKSC’s independent drugs-testing
regime provides for random testing in and out
of competition by independent sampling
officers, and the publication of adverse
findings and actions taken by governing
bodies. Samples are analysed by a laboratory,
accredited by the International Olympic
Committee, at King’s College, University of
London, which also carries out research into
methods of detection for new drugs which
unfairly aid performance.
The Sports Councils have intensified their
drugs-testing programmes, with greater
emphasis on out-of-competition tests. In
1995-96 the Sports Councils carried out 4,327
tests in 52 sports, with 2 per cent proving
positive under the British programme.
In September 1996 anabolic steroids and
other anabolic substances (such as growth
hormones) became controlled drugs under the
misuse of drugs legislation. As a result, greater
penalties for their unauthorised supply will
take effect. The new controls, which are aimed
at those selling such substances, should help to
eliminate their abuse in sport and other leisure
activities such as bodybuilding.
Britain has fully implemented the
provisions of the Council of Europe’s
Anti-doping Convention, which aims to
provide an international framework within
526
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
which national anti-doping campaigns can
work effectively. Britain is also a partner in an
international Memorandum of Understanding
on doping in sport, with Australia, Canada,
France, New Zealand and Norway.
SPECTATOR SAFETY
Safety at sports grounds in Great Britain is
governed by legislation. The main instrument
of control is a safety certificate which is issued
by the relevant local authority. When
determining the conditions of a safety
certificate, the local authority is expected to
comply with the Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds produced by the Department of
National Heritage and The Scottish Office.
The implementation of similar legislation in
Northern Ireland is under discussion.
The Taylor Report
Following the Hillsborough stadium disaster
in Sheffield in 1989, when 96 spectators died,
the Taylor Report was published in 1990. Its
major recommendation was that standing
accommodation should be eliminated at all
grounds designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975. The Government accepted
the report but limited the all-seating
requirement to football in view of the
particular problems of safety and crowd
control in that sport.
In England and Wales the all-seater policy
is being enforced through licences issued by
the Football Licensing Authority. Conditions
in these licences require all clubs in the
Premier League and those in the First Division
of the Football League to have all-seater
grounds; these conditions have now largely
been satisfied. Clubs in the Second and Third
Divisions of the Football League are permitted
to keep some standing accommodation,
providing that the terracing is safe. In Scotland
the all-seating policy is being implemented
through a voluntary agreement under the
direction of the Scottish football authorities.
The Football Trust
The Football Trust provides grant aid to help
football clubs at all levels. Annual income is
about £25 million. It is funded partly by the
pools companies from their spot-the-ball
competition and partly from a 2.5 per cent
reduction in pool betting duty which will
continue until 2000. This concession has
provided £437 million to assist football clubs
in financing projects to improve the comfort
and safety of spectators in line with the Taylor
Report recommendations. A further 0.5 per
cent reduction in pool betting duty took effect
in May 1996 and is expected to generate up to
£3 million a year for the Football Trust.
The Government has given the Football
Trust a new wider role to enable it to fund up
to £8 million a year of safety work at rugby
league, rugby union, cricket and non-league
football grounds. The work is being financed
through a Sports Ground Initiative by the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts (see p. 528).
Crowd Control
The Government has worked closely with the
police, football authorities and the
governments of other European countries to
implement crowd control measures.
Extensive measures were taken to
ensure that Euro 96—the final of the
European Championship (see
p. 533) —held in England was not
disrupted by violence or disorder.
About 10,000 police officers from ten
police forces were involved in
security arrangements. The National
Criminal Intelligence Service
Football Unit, which co-ordinates
police intelligence about football
hooligans, liaised closely with the
forces of all the 15 other participating
countries to exchange intelligence
about potential troublemakers. A
national centre in London ensured
effective liaison between eight
regional police intelligence centres.
Strict crowd control and surveillance
measures were taken at the eight
grounds where matches were held.
Legislation has made it an offence in

matches, run onto the playing area or chant
indecent or racist abuse. There are also
controls on the sale and possession of alcohol at
football grounds and on transport to and from
grounds. Courts in England and Wales have the
power to prohibit convicted football hooligans
from attending football matches, and to impose
restriction orders to prevent them travelling
abroad to attend specified matches. In Northern
Ireland similar legislation is under consideration.
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER
FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in Britain. In
addition to professional sportsmen and
women, over 450,000 people are employed in
the provision of sports clothing, publicity,
ground and club maintenance and other
activities connected with sport. In total an
estimated £9,750 million is spent on sport
annually in Britain. The private sector makes a
substantial investment in sports sponsorship,
contributing an estimated £285 million in
1995. More than 2,000 British companies are
involved in sports sponsorship.
Sponsorship may take the form of financing
specific events or championships, such as horse
races or football/cricket leagues, or of grants to
sports organisations or individual performers.
Motor sport and football receive the largest
amounts of private sponsorship.
Sponsorship of sport is encouraged by a
number of bodies, including:
• the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, set up
by the CCPR and which comprises some
80 British companies involved in the
sponsorship of sport;
• the Sports Sponsorship Advisory Service,
administered by the CCPR and funded by
ESC, which has helped sporting bodies to
raise over £1 million in England over the
last three years;
• the Scottish Sports Council’s Sponsorship
Advisory Service, which raised £200,000
for Scottish sport in 199T-95; and
• the Sports Council for Wales’s Sponsorship
Advisory Service, which generated
£106,200 for Welsh sport in 1994—95.
Successive governments have negotiated
voluntary agreements with the tobacco
industry to regulate tobacco companies’
sponsorship of sport.
Sportsmatch
Launched by the Government in 1992,
Sportsmatch is a business sponsorship
incentive scheme which aims to increase the
amount of business sponsorship going into
‘grass roots’ sport and physical recreation. The
scheme offers matching funding for new
sponsorships and extension of existing
sponsorships. Priority is given to projects
involving groups such as the young, disabled
people and ethnic minorities and to projects in
deprived areas.
In England the Institute of Sports
Sponsorship runs the scheme on behalf of the
Department of National Heritage. Since its
inception, Sportsmatch has approved over
1,400 awards in England, totalling £12.2
million and covering more than 60 different
sports. Rugby union, football, cricket and
tennis have each received over 100 awards.
Minority sports, such as archery, korfball,
orienteering and trampolining, have also
received awards. About half the companies
involved are sponsoring sport for the first time.
In Scotland and Wales the scheme is
managed by the appropriate Sports Council’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service. In 1994-95 the
Scottish Awards Panel approved 149 awards
totalling £506,000. In Wales awards of nearly
£232,000 were allocated to 78 sporting bodies.
Sports Aid Foundation
The Sports Aid Foundation raises and
distributes funds from industry, commerce
and private sponsors as well as distributing
public funds in order to assist the training of
talented individuals. Grants are awarded on
the recommendation of the appropriate
governing bodies to British competitors who
need help preparing for Olympic, World,
European and Commonwealth championships.
The Scottish and Welsh Sports Aid
Foundations and the Ulster Sports and
Recreation Trust have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was set
up by the football pools promoters in 1991 to
528
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
channel funds into sport and the arts. The
pools promoters are providing the Foundation
with some £32 million a year. A further
£16 million a year is received as a result of the
2.5 per cent reduction in pool betting duty
announced in the 1990 Budget. About
£50 million was given to sports schemes in
1995-96. The Foundation has made nearly
12,800 awards to schemes benefiting over 100
sports and totalling over £180 million.
Betting and Gaming
Most betting in Britain takes place on horse
racing and greyhound racing. Bets may be
made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or
through 9,000 licensed off-course betting
offices, which take about 90 per cent of the
money staked. A form of pool betting—
totalisator betting—is organised on racecourses
by the Horserace Totalisator Board (the Tote).
Racecourse bets may also be placed with
on-course bookmakers.
Bookmakers and the Tote contribute an
annual levy—a fixed proportion of their
turnover—to the Horserace Betting Levy
Board. The amount of levy payable is decided
by the racing and bookmaking industries or, in
cases where agreement cannot be achieved, by
the Home Secretary. The Levy Board
promotes the improvement of horse breeds,
advancement of veterinary science and the
improvement of horse racing.
In 1995-96 the total money staked in all
forms of gambling, excluding gaming machines,
was estimated at over £15,000 million. The
Home Office is proposing measures to
deregulate the gambling industry, in order to
provide new opportunities for the industry and
the consumer. These include relaxation on
membership conditions of casinos (of which
there are around 120 in Great Britain), 13 new
locations for casinos, and the removal of
advertising restrictions on bingo and on betting
offices.
National Lottery
Sport is one of five good causes to receive
awards from funds raised by the National
Lottery (see also p. 43). By July 1996 over
1,300 awards totalling £248 million had been
made to sports in England alone. Projects have
ranged from the provision of small items of
equipment and floodlight facilities at grass
roots level to the building of major sports
venues. Around 50 sports have benefited from
Lottery funding. For example, 297 small
football clubs have received funds totalling
£17.5 million for schemes ranging from
floodlighting and drainage of pitches to new
purpose-built clubhouses.
The largest single award from the
National Lottery Sports Fund has
been for nearly £8 million for a
high-quality outdoor multi-sport
complex at the University of Central
Lancashire. The award has covered
55 per cent of the cost of the sports
facilities, including an all-weather,
eight-lane running track and field
events area, an artificial turf floodlit
sports area, a rugby league pitch, a
club and community centre, a cricket
square with artificial wicket and
pavilion, and a cycling road circuit.
Some of the funds from the Millennium
Commission are also for sporting and
recreational developments. Major schemes
include:
• £46 million for the Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, which will be ready for the
1999 Rugby World Cup (see p. 537);
• £42.5 million for a new national cycle
network; and
• £23 million for the development of the
Hampden Park (Glasgow) football
ground.
TELEVISED SPORT
Major sporting events receive extensive
television coverage and are watched by
millions of viewers. The largest ever audience
for a sporting event shown on one channel was
achieved by Jayne Torvill and Christopher
Dean, who attracted 23 million viewers for
their performance in the ice dance competition
at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Euro 96
529
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
attracted a peak viewing figure of 26 million,
spread over two channels. On terrestrial
television the sports which receive the most
coverage are football, horse racing, snooker
and cricket.
Since 1988 the amount of sport on
television has more than quadrupled, to over
12,000 hours a year, primarily as a result of the
development of satellite and cable
broadcasting. Some major events, such as live
Premier League football, are now shown
exclusively on these channels. As a result,
there has been considerable public debate
about broadcast sports rights.
Certain important sporting events are not
permitted to be shown oh television solely on
pay-per-view or subscription terms unless
these have first been offered to terrestrial
channels. These ‘listed’ events comprise:
• the FIFA World Cup football finals;
• the FA Cup Final;
• the Scottish FA Cup Final;
• the finals weekend of the Wimbledon
Tennis Championships;
• the Olympic Games;
• the Grand National;
• the Derby; and
• Test cricket matches involving England.
The first pay-per-view individual
sporting event to be shown in Britain
was the world heavyweight title fight
in March 1996 between Frank Bruno
and Mike Tyson. Over 15 per cent of
BSkyB subscribers paid an extra
charge to watch the contest.
Following consultation with broadcasters,
sports governing bodies, viewers, listeners and
other interested parties, the Government has
decided on additional protection for listed
events. Under the Broadcasting Act 1996, the
availability of live coverage of listed events for
terrestrial television is guaranteed.
Subscription and pay-per-view services will
also be guaranteed live coverage, in order to
increase the choice available to viewers.
A TO Z OF POPULAR SPORTS
Some of the major sports in Britain, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below.
Angling
Angling, one of the most popular countryside
sports, has over seven times as many male as
female participants among Britain’s 3 million
anglers. Many fish for salmon and trout,
particularly in the rivers and lochs of Scotland
and in Wales. In England and Wales the most
widely practised form of angling is for coarse
fish (freshwater fish other than salmon or
trout). Separate organisations represent game,
coarse and sea fishing clubs in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, and there are
separate national and international
competitions in each of the three angling
disciplines.
Athletics
Athletics is governed in Britain by the British
Athletic Federation (BAF). It is responsible
for the selection of British teams for
international events, and also administers
coaching schemes. For the Olympic Games
and the World and European championships
one team represents the whole of Britain.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers of
participants. In recent years there has been a
significant growth in mass participation events,
such as marathons and half marathons. The
largest is the London Marathon, which takes
place every spring. Nearly 26,800 runners
completed the course in the 1996 event.
Jonathan Edwards twice broke the world
record in the triple jump, in July and August
1995. In winning the gold medal at the World
Athletics Championship in Gothenburg, he
became the first man to jump beyond 18
metres. He achieved one of six medals won by
British athletes in the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, winning a silver medal. Silver medals
were also won by Roger Black (400 metres),
Steve Backley (javelin) and the men’s 4 x 400
metres relay team (Jamie Baulch, Roger Black,
Mark Richardson and Iwan Thomas), and
bronze medals by Denise Lewis (heptathlon)
and Steve Smith (high jump).

SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch)
Badminton Unions. Around 5 million people
play badminton in Britain and there are over
5,000 clubs. The All England Badminton
Championships, held at the National Indoor
Arena in Birmingham, is a leading tournament
in the world grand prix circuit. The
Badminton Association of England has a
modern coach education system to develop
coaches for players of all levels.
A mini version of the game—Short
Badminton—and badminton for the disabled
have been introduced in recent years.
Basketball
In Britain over 3 million people participate in
basketball. The English Basketball Association
is the governing body in England, with similar
associations in Wales, Scotland and Ireland
(Ulster Branch). All the associations are
represented on the British and Irish Basketball
Federation, which acts as the co-ordinating
body for Britain and the Irish Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues, which cover three
divisions for men and two for women, while
there are also leagues for younger players.
Mini-basketball has been developed for players
under the age of 13. Wheelchair basketball is
played under the same rules, with a few basic
adaptations, and on the same court as the
running game.
In 1995 the English Basketball Association
started a new coaching scheme for
schoolchildren which aims to increase
participation and improve the quality of
basketball throughout England.
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat green
and crown green) and indoor bowls. In recent
years the most notable increases have been in the
number of women taking part. Bowls is also
popular among people with disabilities.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish Bowling Associations, which, together
with Women’s Bowling Associations for the
four countries, play to the rules of the World
Bowls Board. Crown green bowls and indoor
bowls have their own separate associations.
British bowlers achieved considerable
success at the 1996 world outdoor
championships in Adelaide. The event is held
every four years. Among the winners were
Tony Allcock, who became the first man to
defend the singles title successfully, while
Scotland won the overall team title.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the
rules established by the Marquess of
Queensberry in 1865. In Britain boxing is both
amateur and professional, and in both strict
medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is controlled
by the Amateur Boxing Association of England.
There are separate associations in Scotland and
Wales, and boxing in Northern Ireland is
controlled by the Irish Amateur Boxing
Association. The associations organise amateur
boxing championships as well as training courses
for referees, coaches and others. Headguards
must be used in all British amateur competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the
British Boxing Board of Control. The Board
appoints inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed and to guard against overmatching
and exploitation.
In 1995 the British Boxing Board of
Control announced measures designed
to give boxers greater medical
protection, including: bringing forward
the weigh-in time for championship
bouts; compulsory annual brain scans;
tighter medical checks after fights;
longer suspension periods for boxers
who have been knocked out or stopped;
and more random drug testing.
Britain currently has five world champions.
Naseem Hamed (World Boxing Organisation
531
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
featherweight champion) recorded one of the
fastest wins in the history of world title fights
when he knocked out his opponent in 35 seconds
when retaining his title in March 1996.
Cricket
The earliest extant set of laws for cricket are
dated 1744. The rules of the game became the
responsibility, in the 18th century, of the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which still
frames the laws today. The MCC and the Test
and County Cricket Board (TCCB), which
represents first-class cricket in England, are
both based at Lord’s cricket ground in north
London, the administrative centre of the
English game. Men’s cricket in Great Britain is
governed by the Cricket Council, consisting of
representatives of the TCCB, the National
Cricket Association (NCA—representing club
and junior cricket), the Minor Counties
Cricket Association and the MCC. The
Cricket Council, the NCA and the TCCB will
be replaced at the beginning of 1997 by an
England and Wales Cricket Board, which will
govern all domestic cricket.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages.
Throughout Britain there is a network of
cricket consisting of first class, minor counties
and club games with a variety of leagues.
The main competition in professional
cricket is the Britannic Assurance County
Championship, played by 18 first-class county
teams in four-day matches. There are three
one-day competitions: the Benson & Hedges
Cup, the National Westminster Trophy and
the AXA Equity & Law Sunday League.
Every year there is a series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
between England and one or more touring
teams from Australia, India, New Zealand,
Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West
Indies or Zimbabwe. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these
countries in the British winter.
The governing body of cricket for women
and girls is the Women’s Cricket Association.
Women’s cricket is played at local, county and
international level. In 1993 England won the
Women’s World Cup for the second time.
Schools cricket in England is organised by
the English Schools Cricket Association, to
which over 40 counties are affiliated. In 1996
England staged the first international
competition for the under 15 age group: the
Lombard World Challenge. Ten countries
took part and the winners were India.
Cycling
Cycling, one of Britain’s fastest growing
outdoor activities, includes road and track
racing, time-trialling, cyclo-cross (cross
country racing), touring and bicycle
moto-cross (BMX). All-terrain or mountain
bikes have grown significantly in popularity.
The British Cycling Federation has 16,000
members and is the governing body for cycling
as a sport. The Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC),
with 60,000 members and affiliates, is the
representative body for recreational and urban
cycling, and holds the CTC rally each year in
York. Scotland and Wales have their own
Cyclists’ Unions. Northern Ireland has two
federations for competitive cycling.
The World Cycling Championships were
held at the Manchester Velodrome in August
and September 1996. Chris Boardman won the
4,000 metres pursuit title and in doing so
broke the world record. His time of 4 minutes
11 seconds was around 8 seconds less than the
record before the championships. Later in
September he regained the world record for
the distance covered in 1 hour, when at the
Velodrome he rode for over 56.3 km, more
than 1 km further than the previous record. At
the Atlanta Olympics he had won a bronze in
the time trial, while Max Sciandri also won a
bronze, in the road race.
Equestrianism
The arts of riding and driving are promoted by
the British Horse Society, which is concerned
with the welfare of horses, road safety, riding
rights of way and training. It runs the British
Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh in
Warwickshire. With some 65,200 members,
the Society is the parent body of the Pony
Club and the Riding Club movements, which
hold rallies, meetings and competitions
culminating in annual national championships.
532
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Leading horse trials, comprising dressage,
cross-country and show jumping, are held
every year at a number of locations, including
Badminton (Avon) and Gatcombe Park
(Gloucestershire). In 1994 the British team
won the three-day event team title at the
World Equestrian Games in The Hague.
Show jumping is regulated and promoted
by the British Showjumping Association. The
major show jumping events each year include
the Royal International Horse Show at
Hickstead (West Sussex) and the Horse of the
Year Show at Wembley in London. Nick
Skelton rode Dollar Girl to win the Volvo
World Cup in 1995 and finished third in the
event in 1996.
The authority responsible for equestrian
competitions (other than racing) at
international and Olympic level is the British
Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates the
activities of the British Horse Society and the
British Showjumping Association.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
340 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs
to regional or district associations. The FA,
founded in 1863, and the Football League,
founded in 1888, were both the first of their
kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78
clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish
Football Association, and nearly 6,000
registered clubs.
A new FA Premier League was started in
England in 1992 and now comprises 20 clubs.
A further 72 full-time professional clubs play
in three main divisions run by the Football
League. During the season, which lasts from
August until May, over 2,000 English League
matches are played. A world record transfer
fee was established in July 1996 with the
transfer of Alan Shearer from Blackburn
Rovers to Newcastle United for ^15 million.
Three Welsh clubs play in the Football
League, while the National League of Wales
contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In
Scotland the Scottish Football League has 40
clubs, equally divided into four divisions. In
Northern Ireland, 16 semi-professional clubs
play in the Irish Football League.
Euro 96, the final stage of the
European Championship, was held in
June 1996. This was the biggest
football tournament to have been
held in Britain since the 1966 World
Cup. Sixteen teams—including
England (as hosts) and Scotland—
took part, and the final at Wembley
was won by Germany, who beat the
Czech Republic. England reached the
semi-finals, losing to Germany.
About 1.2 million spectators watched
Euro 96 and the event was televised in
195 countries. It is estimated that
over 250,000 people from overseas
attended the tournament, generating
over jCIOO million in extra revenue
from tourism. Following the success
of the event, the FA announced its
intention of putting in a bid to host
the World Cup in 2006.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Cup sponsored by Littlewoods and
the Coca-Cola Cup (the League Cup) in
England, the Tennents Scottish Cup, the
Coca-Cola Cup (the Scottish League Cup), the
Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup.
Gaelic Games
Gaelic Games, increasingly popular in
Northern Ireland, cover the sports of Gaelic
football, handball, hurling, camogie (women’s
hurling) and rounders. There are over 700
clubs in Northern Ireland affiliated to the
Gaelic Athletic Association and the Camogie
Council, the official governing bodies
responsible for Gaelic Games.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland and is ruled by the
Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R & A), which
is situated at St Andrews on the east coast of
Scotland. The Golfing Union of Ireland and
parallel unions in Wales, Scotland and
533
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England are the national governing bodies for
men’s amateur golf. These bodies are affiliated
to the R & A and are represented on the
Council of National Golf Unions, which is the
British co-ordinating body responsible for
handicapping and organising home
international matches. Women’s amateur golf
in Great Britain is governed by the Ladies’
Golf Union. Club professional golf is governed
by the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA)
and tournament golf by the European PGA
Tour and the Women’s PGA Tour. Women’s
golf in Northern Ireland is governed by the
Irish Ladies Golf Union.
The main event of the British golfing year is
the Open Championship, one of the world’s
leading tournaments. Other important events
include the Walker Cup and Curtis Cup
matches for amateurs, played between Great
Britain and Ireland and the United States, and
the Ryder Cup and Solheim Cup matches for
men and women professionals respectively,
played every two years between Europe and
the United States. In 1995 Europe regained the
Ryder Cup at Oak Hill in the United States.
There are about 1,900 golf courses in
Britain. Some of the most famous include St
Andrews, Royal Lytham and St Anne’s (which
hosted the 1996 British Open Championship),
Muirfield and Royal Birkdale. Nick Faldo won
the US Masters tournament at Augusta in
April 1996, his third win in the event and his
sixth ‘major’ title.1 In the women’s game Laura
Davies is ranked number one in the world.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of Britain’s most
popular spectator sports, with about 4.6
million spectators a year. There are 37 major
tracks. Meetings are usually held three times a
week at each track, with at least ten races a
meeting. The main event of the year is the
Greyhound Derby, run in June at Wimbledon
Stadium, London. There are also about 50
mainly small tracks which operate
independently. Like the major tracks, they are
licensed by local authorities.
’The golfing ‘major’ events are the US Masters, Open and
PGA events, and the British Open.
The rules for the sport are drawn up by the
National Greyhound Racing Club, the sport’s
judicial and administrative body. The
representative body is the British Greyhound
Racing Board.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into five main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics,
general gymnastics and sports aerobics.
The governing body for the sport is British
Gymnastics. Over the past decade the number
of affiliated clubs has nearly doubled. The
sport is particularly popular with
schoolchildren and young adults, and it is
estimated that between 3 and 4 million
schoolchildren take part in some form of
gymnastics every day.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions, including activities
such as dancing and piping competitions. The
main events include running, cycling,
throwing the hammer, tossing the caber and
putting the shot.
Over 70 gatherings of various kinds take
place throughout Scotland, the most famous of
which is the annual Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for athletic
sports and games at Highland and Border
events in Scotland.
Hockey
The modern game of hockey was started by the
Hockey Association (of England), which was
founded in 1886 and acts as the governing
body for men’s hockey there. The Irish Ladies
Hockey Union was the first women’s
governing body and assisted in the formation
of the controlling body of women’s hockey in
England, the All England Women’s Hockey
Association. Separate associations regulate the
sport in Scotland and Wales. Cup
competitions and leagues exist at national,
divisional or district, club and school levels,
both indoors (six-a-side) and outdoors, and
534
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
there are regular international matches and
tournaments. A National Hockey Centre in
Milton Keynes was opened in March 1996 and
is now the venue for all major hockey matches
in England.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing and
National Hunt (steeplechasing and hurdle)
racing. The main flat race season runs from
late March to early November, but all-weather
flat racing and National Hunt racing take place
throughout the year. Britain has 59 racecourses
and about 13,000 horses currently in training.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the 2,000 Guineas and
the 1,000 Guineas, both run at Newmarket;
the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster).
The most important National Hunt
meeting is the National Hunt Festival held at
Cheltenham in March, which features the
Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1839.
The British Horseracing Board is the
governing authority for racing in Britain. Its
responsibilities include the fixture list, race
programmes, relations with the Government
and the betting industry, and central
marketing. The Jockey Club, as the regulatory
authority, remains responsible for licensing,
discipline and security.
Ice Skating
Ice skating has four main disciplines: ice figure
(single and pairs), ice dance, speed skating and
precision skating. The governing body is the
National Ice Skating Association of UK Ltd.
There are 68 rinks in Britain, with plans in
hand for a number of new rinks.
British couples have won the world ice
dance championship 17 times, the most recent
being Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean,
who won four consecutive world
championships between 1981 and 1984. The
couple returned to amateur competition briefly
in 1994 and won a gold medal at the 1994
European Championships and a bronze medal
at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.
A second bronze at the Winter Olympics was
won by Nicky Gooch in indoor speed skating.
Judo
Judo is popular not only as a competitive sport
and self-defence technique, but also as a means
of general fitness training. An internationally
recognised grading system is in operation
through the sport’s governing body, the
British Judo Association.
Keep Fit
Keep fit encompasses various forms of
movement and exercise activities. The Keep
Fit Association (KFA), one of the largest
governing bodies in England, promotes
physical fitness and a positive attitude to
health. Its national certificated training scheme
for KFA teachers is recognised by local
education authorities throughout Britain.
Autonomous associations serve Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
In 1994 the Exercise Association of England
was established as an impartial advisory
authority for the organisations involved in
these activities.
Martial Arts
A broad range of martial arts, mainly derived
from the Far East, has been introduced into
Britain during the 20th century. There are
recognised governing bodies responsible for
their own activities in karate, ju-jitsu, aikido,
Chinese martial arts, kendo, taekwondo and
tang soo do. The most popular martial art is
karate, with over 100,000 participants.
Motor-car Sports
The main four-wheeled motor sports include
motor racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying
and karting. In motor racing the Grand Prix
Formula 1 World Championship is the major
form of the sport.
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport in Britain is the RAC (Royal
535
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Automobile Club) Motor Sports Association.
The Association issues licences for a variety of
motoring competitions. It also organises the
Network QRAC Rally, an event in the World
Rally Championship, and the British Grand
Prix, which is held at Silverstone as part of the
Formula 1 World Championship.
Britain has had more Formula 1 world
champions than any other country. Nigel
Mansell was champion in 1992, and in 1993
became the first person to win the IndyCar
World Series Championship in his debut year.
Damon Hill (son of Graham Hill, a previous
world champion) won the 1996 Formula 1
World Championship, during which he won
eight Grand Prix, bringing his total of Grand
Prix victories to 21.
British car constructors, including
Williams and McLaren, have enjoyed
outstanding success in Grand Prix racing and
many other forms of racing. British cars won
137 of the 159 Grand Prix held in the ten
years to the end of the 1995 Formula 1
season. The motor sport industry in Britain
is estimated to generate an annual turnover
of over £1,300 million and to employ more
than 50,000 people.
In 1995 Colin McRae became the first
British driver to win the World Rally
Championship. He is the youngest
driver to achieve this feat, winning at
the age of 27.
Motor-cycle Sports
Motor-cycle sports include road racing,
moto-cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing and sprint. It is estimated that there are
between 40,000 and 50,000 competitive motor
cyclists in Britain.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales, the
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and the Motor
Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern
Ireland). The major events of the year
include the Isle of Man TT races and the
British Road Race Grand Prix. The
Auto-Cycle Union also provides off-road
training by approved instructors for riders of
all ages.
Mountaineering
A recent survey estimated that there were
700,000 climbers in Britain. The
representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council, which works closely
with the Mountaineering Councils of Scotland
and Ireland. The main areas of work include
access and conservation. There are over 300
mountaineering and climbing clubs in Britain,
and three National Centres for mountaineering
activities run by the Sports Councils (see pp.
525—6). Organisations such as the Scottish
Mountain Safety Group help to promote the
safe enjoyment of the hills.
British mountaineers have played a leading
role in the exploration of the world’s great
mountain ranges. The best-known is Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other successful expeditions. Some of
the world’s hardest rock climbs are found on
cliffs in Britain.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball regularly
in England and a further 1 million participants
play in schools. The sport is played almost
exclusively by women and girls.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their own
governing bodies. The number of clubs
affiliated to the All England Association has
grown steadily in recent years and currently
stands at 3,700. The biggest growth has been
in the youth development programme.
National competitions are staged annually for
all age groups. The world championships are
held every four years; in 1995 they were staged
at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham,
with teams representing 27 countries.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, universities
and rowing clubs throughout Britain. The
main types of boats are single, pairs and double
sculls, fours and eights. The governing body in
England is the Amateur Rowing Association;
similar bodies regulate the sport in Scotland,
Wales and Ireland (Ulster Branch).
536
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
The University Boat Race, between
eight-oared crews from Oxford and
Cambridge, has been rowed on the Thames
almost every spring since 1836. The Head of
the River Race, also on the Thames, is the
largest assembly of racing craft in the world,
with more than 420 eights racing in procession.
At the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews
from all over the world compete each July in
various kinds of race over a straight course of 1
mile 550 yards (about 2.1 km). The 1996
World Rowing Championships were held at
Strathclyde Country Park in Scotland.
At the 1996 Olympics Steven Redgrave and
Matthew Pinsent won the gold medal in the
coxless pairs for the second consecutive
Olympics. This was the fourth successive
Olympics at which Steven Redgrave had won a
gold medal, a feat achieved by only a very few
people in Olympic history. The coxless
four—Greg Searle, Jonny Searle, Tim Foster
and Rupert Obholzer—won a bronze medal.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby
union (see below) of 22 clubs in the north of
England, where the sport is still concentrated.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League while the
amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association. The
major club match of the season is the
Challenge Cup Final, which is played at
Wembley Stadium in London. Rugby league’s
centenary world cup took place in England and
Wales in 1995, and England were runners-up
to Australia. A Great Britain team is touring
Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand in
autumn 1996.
Rugby league was revolutionised in 1996
with the creation of a summer Super League.
This consists of 12 clubs: ten from the north of
England, one from London and one
representing Paris. Under the new format,
there are also a First Division and a Second
Division, with 11 and 12 clubs respectively.
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game) is
thought to have originated at Rugby School in
the first half of the 19th century. The sport is
played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (RFU) in England and parallel
bodies in Wales, Scotland and Ireland (Ulster
Branch). Each of the four countries has
separate national league and knock-out
competitions for its domestic clubs.
An annual Five Nations Championship is
contested by England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland and France. Overseas tours are
undertaken by the national sides and by the
British Lions, a team representing Great
Britain and Ireland. Tours are also made to
Britain by teams representing the major
rugby-playing nations.
The Rugby World Cup is held every four
years. Wales has been selected by the
International Rugby Board to host the finals of
the 1999 World Cup. A major new stadium
will be built in Cardiff, with a significant
financial contribution from the Millennium
Commission (see p. 28). Other matches in the
competition will be shared among England,
Scotland, Ireland and France.
Major changes are occurring in rugby union
following the decision in 1995 to end its
amateur status. Players may now be paid, and
several top players have switched clubs to take
advantage of their new professional status.
Skiing
Skiing takes place in Scotland from December
to May and also at several English locations
when there is sufficient snow. The five
established winter sports areas in Scotland are
Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee, the Lecht and
Nevis Range. All have a full range of ski-lifts,
prepared ski runs and professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry
ski-slopes located throughout Britain, and 1.5
million people in Britain take part in the sport.
The governing body at the British level is the
British Ski Federation, with the home country
ski councils being responsible for the
development of the sport in their appropriate
country, mainly as a holiday activity.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India in
1875 and is currently played by approximately
537
BRITAIN 1997: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
7 million people in Britain. British players
have an outstanding record in the game and
have dominated the major professional
championships. The main tournament is the
annual Embassy World Professional
Championship, held in Sheffield. In the 1980s
Steve Davis won the world title six times.
Stephen Hendry equalled this performance in
1996 when he won the world title for the fifth
year in a"row.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association is
responsible for professional players, organises
all world-ranking professional events and holds
the copyright for the rules. The representative
body for women is the World Ladies’ Billiards
and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association;
there are separate governing bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The British
Open Championships is one of the major
world events in the sport.
The number of players in Britain is
estimated at over 2 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly.9,000
squash courts in England, provided mainly by
squash clubs, commercial organisations and
local authorities.
In 1995 England beat Pakistan in the final
of the world team championships in Cairo, to
record its first victory in the event. The
England team consisted of Mark Chaloner, Del
Harris, Simon Parke and Chris Walker. Del
Harris was runner-up in the individual event.
In July 1996 England won the world junior
team championships.
Swimming
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people
with a wide range of abilities from all age
groups. All forms of competitive swimming are
governed by the Amateur Swimming
Association (ASA) in England and by similar
associations in Scotland and Wales. These
three associations combine to form the
Amateur Swimming Federation of Great
Britain, which acts as the co-ordinating body
for the selection of Great Britain teams and the
organisation of international competitions.
Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish
Amateur Swimming Association. Instruction
and coaching are provided by qualified
teachers and coaches who hold certificates
awarded mainly by the ASA.
In the 1996 Olympics Paul Palmer won a
silver medal in the 400 metres freestyle and
Graeme Smith took the bronze medal in the
1,500 metres freestyle. Sarah Hardcastle won
the 800 metres freestyle at the 1995 world
short course championships in Rio de Janeiro
and took the bronze medal in the 400 metres
freestyle.
Table Tennis
Table tennis developed in Britain in the
second half of the 19th century. It is popular
with all sections of the community and widely
played in a variety of venues. The sport is also
a major recreational and competitive activity
for people with disabilities. The governing
body in England is the English Table Tennis
Association. There are separate governing
bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
England is to host the 1997 World Table
Tennis Championships in Manchester.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1872 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (ETA), to which
the Welsh and Scottish LTAs are affiliated.
Tennis in Northern Ireland is governed by
Tennis Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. Prize money totalled £6.5
538
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
million in 1996. An extensive redevelopment
of the All England Club is taking place. The
first phase, a new No 1 Court, will be
inaugurated in the 1997 Championships. Since
1981 the Championships have generated £153
million for British tennis.
In the 1996 Olympics Neil Broad and Tim
Henman won Britain’s first medal in tennis
since the event was reintroduced to the
Olympics. They were runners-up in the men’s
doubles. Martin Lee became the top-ranked
junior in the world in 1996.
The LTA has a five-year plan for
developing tennis in Great Britain in
the period to 2001. It will work in
partnership with county tennis
associations, clubs, schools, further
and higher education institutions,
and local authorities. The aim is to
expand participation, encourage
regular competition and produce
more world-class tennis players.
Players can take part in national and county
championships. National competitions are
organised for schools, and short tennis has
been introduced for children aged five and
over. The game is played in over 3,000 schools
and in leisure centres. In all, about 3 million
people play tennis in Britain.
Tenpin Bowling
It is estimated that about 4.8 million people
take part in tenpin bowling every year in
Britain. There are over 200 national
tournaments and an annual National
Championship. The 1996 World
Championships will be held at the Dundonald
Ice Bowl in Northern Ireland, involving
representatives from around 50 countries.
Britain has over 200 indoor bowling
centres, the first having opened in 1960. More
than 30,000 people belong to the sport’s
governing body, the British Tenpin Bowling
Association.
Volleyball
The English Volleyball Association and parallel
associations in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland act as the sport’s governing bodies. To
encourage more children to play volleyball, the
Association organises national, regional and area
championships for a variety of ages, from under
13s to under 19s. Mini-Volley is a three-a-side
version of the game adapted for children under
13. Grass and beach volleyball tournaments are
proving very popular with children and are
leading to an increase in the number of schools
playing volleyball.
Yachting
Yachting comprises sailing, powerboating and
windsurfing on both inland and offshore
waters. Racing in sailing boats takes place
between one-design classes or under handicap,
which provides level racing for boats of
different size and shape. Among well-known
ocean races are the Whitbread Round The
World Yacht Race and the Fastnet Race.
The Royal Yachting Association is the
governing body for all yachting in Britain. It is
estimated that about 3 million people
participate in the sport.
Silver medals were won in two events in the
1996 Oly mpics, by Ben Ainslie in the Laser
class and by John Merricks and Ian Walker in
the 470 (double-handed dinghy) class.

BRITAIN 1997
AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Encyclopaedic in scope yet easy to read, Britain: An Official Handbook gathers
information on every aspect of life in Britain from a wide variety of authoritative
sources and distils it into one handy volume. This 48th edition contains the
following additional features:
■ a special focus on the environment, with a new chapter that examines the
concept of ‘sustainable development’;
■ an introduction on tourism and the environment by the Earl of Bradford; and
■ an expanded colour section devoted to Britain’s action on the environment
at government, local and individual levels.
The in-depth and up-to-date coverage is illustrated
with a wealth of tables, maps, diagrams and
colour photographs, making Handbook
an essential work of reference
on Britain.
