Introduction
BRITAIN: an official handbook, 1963, is the fourteenth in
the series prepared and extensively revised each year by the Reference
Division of the Central Office of Information with the co-operation
of other Government departments and of many national organisations.
The handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities
provided by the British Information Services in many countries,
was at first only available overseas in a limited free edition. In 1954
it was placed on sale throughout the world and it has since become
widely known as an established work of reference.
This 1963 edition, which covers events up to September 1962,
gives, like its predecessors, a factual account of the administration
and the national economy of the United Kingdom. It describes the
activities of many of the national institutions, both official and
unofficial, and shows the part played by the Government in the life
of the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it
attempt to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world
affairs. The factual and statistical information it contains is compiled
from official and other authoritative sources, and, while most
sections of the book relate to the United Kingdom as a whole, facts
and figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are
also given separately when these are available.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult
the Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics,
issued by the Central Statistical Office, and also other Government
publications and standard works of reference, some of which are
listed in the bibliography at the end of the handbook. Readers are
asked to note that the Central Office of Information reference
documents listed in the bibliography as free and marked with an
asterisk are available free of charge only at British Information
Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United
Kingdom from the Reference Division, Central Office of Information,
on payment of a small charge.

THE LAND AND THE
PEOPLE
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with a total
area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great Britain proper
(comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland (comprising
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the southern coast of England is the
Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of Stilly; off North Wales is
Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are
the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative
counties or parts of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea
and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or Northern
Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border), has a total
area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into 40 geographical
or 49 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouthshire), with a total area of
8,017 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland, including its 186 inhabited islands, has
a total area of 30,411 square miles and is divided into 33 counties; and Northern Ireland,
consisting of six counties, has a total area of 5,459 square miles. Together, these
countries constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland with a
total area of 94,214 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom (excluding
inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England, 5o>°5I5 Wales and Monmouthshire,
7,966; Scotland, 29,795; and Northern Ireland, 5,206 square miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they refer to
England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for many
administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole. The position is further
complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth is sometimes included with
England. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the Isle of
Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles, which are strictly
not part of the United Kingdom, but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern
Ireland became independent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles
as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British mainland
(the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the Shetland Islands.
The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet Head, near John o Groats,
is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o° passes through the old Observatory
of Greenwich (London), while the easternmost point of England is nearly 1 45 East
1
2
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and the westernmost point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. It is just under
600 miles in a straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and
rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays and
inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less than
50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the north¬
west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 600 feet to 3,000
feet. These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish. The North Atlantic Current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal
movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Geology and Topography
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main geological
periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant to weather, and
have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south and east, and the island
can therefore be divided roughly into two main regions, Lowland Britain and Highland
Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern England
have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and rising to chalk
and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet above sea level. The
boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth of the Tyne in the north-east
of England to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and moors
of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands, which
extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the Lake District
in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the Pennines, almost the
whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of England coinciding approximately
with the counties of Devon and Cornwall. Highland Britain contains all the mountain¬
ous parts1 of Great Britain and extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This
high ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks
(archaean and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly
more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures which
have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops and shallow
seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found on the edge of the
plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of the present deep coal
workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors of present-
day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age, and at one period
or another during this time the whole of Britain north of a line joining the river Thames
and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally
accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern
England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that,
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon, 3,560 feet;
and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland), 3,210 feet. The highest peak
in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet.

when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels lay dis¬
tributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous drainage
channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of
sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by the ice
sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption of the previous
natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland are irregularly placed
around central lowlands; in the higher parts the moorland vegetation resembles that
of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety of scenery
and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, particularly on the coasts.
The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach the coast in towering cliffs; else¬
where the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along much of the west coast of Scotland.
Bold outstanding headlands are notable features in other parts of the varied coastline:
the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire
coast in South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides.
Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white
limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or the Needles
off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline have
beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the Humber and the
Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches
of it have been protected against the sea by embankments. These have occasionally
been breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was caused by the
abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of the sand
and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the short British rivers1
valuable as natural harbours.
Climate
Britain has a temperate and equable climate. It lies in middle latitudes to the north¬
west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but as the prevailing winds are south¬
westerly the climate is largely determined by that of the eastern Atlantic, although
occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring a cold, dry, continental
type of weather which, once established, may persist for many days or even weeks.
The weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from
the Atlantic which, moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over
or near the British Isles. During the summer months the Azores high pressure system
usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards north-west Europe, and the
depressions take a more northerly course, often passing entirely to the north of the
British Isles.
Winds. In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-westerly
ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the spring than at any
other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may differ markedly from the
general direction owing to local topography. Winds are generally stronger in the north

long respectively.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

than in the south of the British Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger
in the west than in the east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the
average speed at Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 22 m.p.h. in January
to about 14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about 7 m.p.h.
in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the north-west coast, with
over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east Midlands are the least stormy,
with gales occurring on about 2 days a year inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the
Channel coast.
Temperature. Near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from 470 F. in the
Hebrides to 520 F. in the extreme south-west of England; it is slightly lower in the
eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The mean monthly temperature in
the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 390 F. during the winter
(December, January and February) to 530 F. during the summer (June, July and
August): the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme south,
are 430 F. and 63° F. The average range of temperature between winter and summer
varies from 150 F. to 230 F., being greatest inland in the eastern part of the country.
During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 8o° F. in the south,
but temperatures of 90° F. and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum temperatures
depend to a large extent on local conditions, but 20° F. may occur on a still, clear
winter’s night, io° F. is rare, and o° F. or below has been recorded only during
exceptionally severe winter periods.
Rainfall. The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches, while
England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual rainfall
is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the mountainous areas
of the west and north having far more rain than the plains of the south and east.
Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis
during the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of England record less
than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year, but, on the average,
March to June are the driest months and October to January the wettest, the former
period of four months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of the latter. A period
of as long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to limited
areas. In successive years, however, remarkably contrasting weather conditions are
sometimes experienced.
Sunshine. The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general
decrease from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five and a half hours in western Scotland to seven
and a half hours in the extreme south-east of England; during the months of shortest
daylight—November, December and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an
average of half an hour a day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and in th e
Peak District (Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
Soil and Vegetation
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with the
result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of Scotland, the
Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of north-east and
south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valley lands and
6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the plains where soils are deeper and richer; villages and towns are often separated
by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the whole of
Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except where there
are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage systems have been
developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation the fertile soil of the
low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and similar areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of natural
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably covered the greater
part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, forests of Scots pine on
higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland. In the course of the
centuries the forest area was progressively diminished and, in spite of planting by estate
owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the establishment of large
forests by the Forestry Commission in the past forty years, woodlands now occupy
only about 7 per cent of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland
occurs in the north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in
Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be well wooded
because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most common trees are
oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of woods, fens
and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher slopes of mountains;
the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country, which consists mainly of
heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton grass in the wetter parts. Most of
Britain, however, is agricultural land, of which about a third is arable and the rest
pasture and meadow, a varied semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses
and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges or stone walls and, especially in the
mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a pattern of contrasting colour.
The cool temperate climate of Britain and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a
long growing season; streams rarely dry up, grassland is green throughout the year and
full of wild flowers from spring to autumn; there is scarcely a month in which some
flowers may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
Fauna
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western Europe,
though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals, including the wolf, the
bear, the boar and the Irish elk, have become extinct; but red deer, protected for
sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on Exmoor in the counties
of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of
southern England, and fallow deer (which are probably not indigenous) have been
introduced into parks and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is
rarely seen; there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers
and streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the coast,
though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles,
shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey more numerous than the
native red), hares, rabbits (a serious farming pest before their decimation by myxo¬
matosis in the years 1954 and 1955), weasels and stoats.
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About 230 species
are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The chaffinch and the blackbird
are probably the most numerous and are widely and evenly distributed, but sparrows
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
7
usually predominate near houses, and huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain
seasons, sometimes congregate in London and other large towns. In general, the
number of small birds has been on the increase for several decades owing to their success
in adapting themselves to a man-made environment and also to their more considerate
treatment by the public. The number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to
decline, except for game birds which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and
partridges, and the red grouse which is found in moorland areas.
The many species of gulls and other sea-birds which nest round the coast often fly
far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage and reclamation
of marsh lands have diminished the natural habitat of duck, geese and other aquatic
birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs, gravel pits and sewage farms
in addition to the nature reserves and bird sanctuaries which have recently been
established on an increasing scale. Many of the rarer species of birds are protected
by law.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three species of
snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of lizards, including
the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented by three species of newts
and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only one species of newt and the common
viviparous lizard are indigenous; the other species of reptiles and amphibians that are
now firmly established came to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace, grayling
and pike.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small, in the
British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to 4 inches) and
the stag beetle (2% inches). The insect fauna in Britain is less varied than that of
continental Europe and lacks a number of common European species. With modern
methods of pest control, extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious
outbreaks of diseases commonly spread by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after settling in
northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating the French language
and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the relative
importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and
the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots,
Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of England and the Lowlands
of Scotland the language which soon came to predominate was English, mainly a
marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages-
persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in
Ireland (see p. 19).
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of population
or of the extent or direction of population movement until the beginning of the
nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end of the eleventh century the
population of Great Britain was about two million, while at the end of the seventeenth
century a reasonable contemporary estimate put the population of England and Wales-

at 5^ million and that of Scotland at about one million. The main factor in this gradual
growth of population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by high death
rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration
from the continent of Europe was an influence at certain times, for example, that of
Flemish weavers in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British people
—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, marriages, occupa¬
tions, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and reliable. Most of it
is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of vital statistics, i.e. statistical
information based on statutory registration of births, marriages and deaths, and the
periodic census of population which gives a national snapshot at a particular moment
of time.
The Compilation of Vital Statistics
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is carried out
by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as registrars of marriages.
In England and Wales there are about five hundred superintendent registrars in charge
of registration districts and about twelve hundred registrars in charge of sub-districts.
Registrars and superintendent registrars are appointed by the county, county borough
and metropolitan borough councils but they act under the instruction of the Registrar
General for England and Wales, who is in charge of a central Government department,
the General Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of births,
deaths and marriages, with planning and carrying out population censuses, and with
the compilation and analysis of population and vital statistics. There are corresponding
authorities1 and similar arrangements (differing only in detail) in Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
In general, the legal obligations in connection with the registration of births,
marriages and deaths are as follows. The responsibility for giving information to a
local registrar about a birth is placed first on the parents of the child (the mother
where the child is illegitimate), then on the occupier of the house and any person
present at the birth, on the person in charge of the child or on any person finding a
new-born child. Similarly, information for the registration of a death must be given
by a relative present at the death or in attendance during the last illness or, in their
absence, by any other relative residing or being in the sub-district where the death
occurred, by the occupier or an inmate of the house or by any person finding or taking
charge of the body or arranging for its disposal. The doctor who attended the deceased
during his last illness must issue a certificate giving the cause of death and deliver it at
once to the registrar. Deaths of persons not receiving medical attention, deaths the
cause of which is unknown and unnatural, and accidental or violent deaths must be
reported to a coroner (a procurator-fiscal in Scotland).
Marriages are registered immediately after the ceremony. In general, marriages
according to religious rites are entered in registers held by the officiating clergyman or
some other person appointed by the religious body concerned. Some religious marriages,
and all civil marriages, are attended and registered by registrars of marriages. In
England and Wales civil marriages are solemnised in superintendent registrars’
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London; the
General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry of Finance
of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of Jersey, of Guernsey and its
associated islands, and of the Isle of Man.

offices. Certified copies of all entries of births, deaths and marriages are sent quarterly
to the General Register Office.
In Scotland there are no superintendent registrars but for each of nearly 1,000
registration districts there is a registrar of births, deaths and marriages. Some 300 of
these registrars may conduct civil marriages in their offices. Duplicate registers are
transmitted annually to the Registrar for Scotland after inspection by district examiners.
In the 184 registration districts of Northern Ireland, only live births are registered
(whereas both live and still births are registered in Great Britain) and certain supple¬
mentary information (collected in Great Britain primarily for fertility studies) is not
required. Roman Catholic marriages in Northern Ireland are registered on the authority
of a certificate completed at the time of the ceremony, instead of being recorded in a
bound register immediately the ceremony is over.
The Census
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every ten years
since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the war. In 1951 and 1961
censuses covering the whole of the British Isles were taken by the appropriate
authorities in England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the islands of the
British seas and the Irish Republic. All the reports based on the 1951 censuses have
now been published. The preliminary reports—straightforward counts of males and
females by area—of the 1961 censuses were published in 1961 and the first of the
final reports was due towards the end of 1962.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this chapter is
based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births, marriages and
deaths, though some use has been made of other special investigations, including the
Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.1
Total Population
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken on
23rd April, 1961, was 52,675,556, excluding persons in the Isle of Man and the Channel
Islands, which are not strictly parts of the United Kingdom.
The population had increased by nearly 2^ million since 195about 6^ million
since 1931, by about 8| million since 1921 and by about 45! million—or about seven¬
fold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a progressive reduction in
death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning of the twentieth
century.
The population density of the United Kingdom is one of the highest in the world.
It was approximately 564 persons per square mile at the time of the 1961 censuses.
Birth and Death Rates
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was about 35 per thousand
of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per thousand. Both
birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century, but the natural increase
of the population changed but little. It rose from 12 per thousand in 1851 to 15 per
thousand in 1881, and fell to n per thousand in 1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age groups,
produced a population of low average age. At each successive census the population
of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the preceding census, while the
1 This commission was appointed in March 1944; its main report was published in March 1949.
10
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
short expectation of life further reduced the ratio of older to younger persons. When,
therefore, death rates in all age groups fell by an average of about 33 per cent, as
they did between 1880 and 1910, the results were a very low general death rate, which
helped to maintain the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a
gradual increase in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth century
rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though its average age
rose more rapidly (see diagram below).

Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained nearly
stationary at around 12 per thousand of the population though death rates have
continued to fall heavily in every age group, particularly among pre-school children,
school children, and adults in their thirties and forties, with a consequent lengthening
of the expectation of life from about 50 years at birth in 1900 to 1910 to over 70
years at birth in 1958 to i960. Since 1933 the steady fall in the number of births has

ceased. During the second world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a
temporary post-war peak of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It then receded
again to slightly above the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but since 1955 it has
risen slowly and was 18-0 per thousand in 1961.
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH YEARs
Mortality Causes
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards of
living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities, improved
health measures, better working conditions, education in personal hygiene, public and
private schemes to make the health services generally available, and the smaller size
of the family, which has reduced the strain on mothers and enabled them to take
greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant and
maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main acute infectious
diseases of childhood is less than one-hundredth and mortality from tuberculosis is
12
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
less than one-thirtieth of the rate prevailing in the mid-nineteenth century. Infant
mortality (i.e. deaths of infants under one year old per thousand live births) has fallen
by about 80 per cent since 1900. Maternal mortality is now only about one-eleventh
of the 1934 rate. The reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle
and old age, such as cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen during the
twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in diagnosis,
is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective measures to combat
some of these diseases, and improvement in positive health does not always bring
increased immunity or resistance to them.
Marriage
Over the past thirty years the proportion of the whole population who are married
has risen from 43 to 51 per cent, while the proportion of single persons in the population
over 15 years of age has fallen from nearly a third to under a quarter. This change has
been due mainly to an increase in marriage rates among men and women in their
late teens and early twenties. In i960 fifty-five per cent of the young women aged 20 to
24 were married; in 1931 only twenty-five per cent were married. Earlier marriage
has led to a large increase in the number of children born to women under 30 years of
age and in recent years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of the total flow
of births into the population.
Fertility Trends
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part of the
twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family (i.e. the number
of children born per married couple) caused by the spread of deliberate family limita¬
tion. Couples married a hundred years ago produced on the average rather more than
six liveborn children. The decline seems to have set in with those married in the 1860s,
and continued steadily until, with the couples married in the late 1920s, the average
familv size had been reduced to between 2-2 and 2*i. The decline then stopped,
and the figure has remained stable in spite of the disturbance of the war years; the
latest data suggest a slight increase.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20 and 30
years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to replace the original
generation, while those born at the beginning of the present century had only about
70 per cent of the number of children needed for replacement. Since then the figure
has been rising again and may reach full replacement with the generation born during
the second world war. But the rise has been due more to the increased proportion of
children surviving to adult life and of women getting married than to the small
increase in family size.
At first the decline in family size was most marked among the professional and
salaried classes. Among couples married between 1900 and 193° the families of
manual workers were about 40 per cent larger than those of non-manual workers, but
this class difference appears to have been diminishing. The decline in family size has
been slower in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in England and W ales.
Age Distribution
The first effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the number of children,
and therefore the ratio of dependent population to working population. This ratio was
at a minimum in the 1930s. After 193^ the number of children leaving school for
work fell sharply owing to the drop in the birth rate after 1921, while the population
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
13
aged over 40 continued to increase and the population aged over 64, born during an
era of high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising numbers,
increased very rapidly. The higher birth rates after 1942 have arrested the compensating
fall in the number of dependent children and have further reduced the ratio of working
to dependent population.
At mid-1961 the age distribution of the United Kingdom was estimated as follows:
Under 15 ..
15 to 64 ..
65 and over
23 • 1 per cent
65-2 per cent
11 *7 per cent
An unusually large proportion of the population of the United Kingdom (about
14 per cent) is now between 45 and 55 years of age. Assuming a continued fall in
death rates and net emigration of 27,000 people a year from the usual age groups, it
can be estimated that between 1961 and 1975:
(1) the number of young people aged 15 to 29 will increase by nearly 16 per cent
to about 11-8 million;
(2) the population of working age will increase slowly;
(3) the number of old people (over 65) will increase by more than i| million.
Sex Ratio
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but stillbirth
rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so that in nearly
all countries—and in Britain since records began—women preponderate among
the elderly and outnumber men in the total population. Until recently indeed
women outnumbered men in the United Kingdom in every age group from adolescents
onwards. Actually, however, the reduction in stillbirths and infant mortality has made
the influence of these factors on sex ratio relatively unimportant so that the age at
which women begin to outnumber men has been advanced and is now about 30.
On the other hand, the lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather
more marked for women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women
among the elderly—there are now some five women over seventy years old to every
three men—and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
This increase in the number of elderly women, however, does not quite counter¬
balance the increase in the number of boys and young men so that the ratio of females
to males has fallen from 108 : 100 in 1951 to 107 : 100 in 1961.
Migration
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance of migration
was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over 20 million people left Britain
for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the Commonwealth and the United States.
Many emigrants later returned and large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians,
Poles, Germans and Hungarians, entered the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss
by migration from the present area of the United Kingdom amounted to some four
million between 1871 and 1931. Since then the balance of migration of Britain as a
whole has been inward, though Scotland and Northern Ireland have throughout
continued to have a net outward movement of population from the United Kingdom
as well as to England and Wales. The main net inflow to Britain as a whole was in the
years 1931 to 1940, when emigration was very low, many former emigrants returned
and there was extensive immigration from Europe, including about a quarter of a
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
H
million refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. There was also considerable net immi¬
gration from the Irish Republic. After the 1939-45 war emigration to Commonwealth
countries rose, but for the whole intercensal period 1931 to 1951 there was a net gain
by migration of about half a million for the United Kingdom as a whole. In the
intercensal period 1951 to 1961 the net balance of migration was again inward, but by
a smaller margin (97,000), though the gross migration flows were higher than before.
Emigration to the Commonwealth increased and total emigration was probably over
200,000 in the two peak years of 1952 and 1957. Immigration, however, was also
increasing—from the Commonwealth, from the Irish Republic and from the continent
of Europe; and from 1958 onwards the balance of migration was again markedly
inwards. The major factor in this change was the increase in immigrants from overseas
Commonwealth countries into the United Kingdom (very largely into England and
Wales). Over the two years i960 and 1961 there was a net intake of 194,000 of these
into the population, including a net inward movement of 116,000 British West Indians.
In these circumstances, the Government decided that it was necessary to take powers
to control immigration from the Commonwealth and, in principle, the Irish Republic.
The Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962 (see p. 454) empowered the Government
to restrict the number of persons from the Commonwealth and Irish Republic who
may immigrate into the United Kingdom without assured prospects of employment
or adequate means of self-support, and to deport unsuitable immigrants.
At the 1951 census some 1-7 million persons in the United Kingdom were reported
as having been born outside it. About a fifth of them had been born in other independent
Commonwealth countries or in United Kingdom dependencies, about a third in the
26 counties of southern Ireland (now the Irish Republic), and nearly half in foreign
countries, notably Poland, Germany, Russia and the United States. The number
born in the overseas Commonwealth and in the Irish Republic had increased by about
one-third and two-thirds, respectively, since 1931, and the number born in foreign
countries had approximately doubled. In view of the high levels of immigration, it is
probable that the number of persons living in the United Kingdom, but born elsewhere,
has increased further since 1951. An important factor in recent years has been immi¬
gration from the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent. Immigrants from those
countries at present living in Britain are estimated to number about half a million.
Nationality
Less than one per cent of persons were of alien nationality at the time of the 1951
census; the remainder were either citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or
of other Commonwealth countries or were British protected persons or citizens of
the Irish Republic.
Under the British Nationality Act, 1948, with insignificant exceptions, persons who
are born, or whose fathers w7ere born, in the United Kingdom or in a territory wdiich
was a colony of the United Kingdom on 1st January, i949> or °f birth if
later, or in a United Kingdom registered ship or aircraft, are citizens of the United
Kingdom and Colonies. Citizenship may also be acquired: by descent (subject to
certain requirements) from a paternal grandfather born in the United Kingdom or
Colonies or from a more remote paternal ancestor in the male line; by registration,
for citizens of Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor
children and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies;
in consequence of an adoption order; and by naturalisation. The requirements for
the grant of a certificate of naturalisation include five years’ residence in the United
Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service, good character, a sufficient
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE 15
knowledge of English and the intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a colony
or to remain in Crown service.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizenship by
acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another country; nor does a
woman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies lose her citizenship by
marriage to an alien. Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his
will except in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisa¬
tion or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is, how¬
ever, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the nationality
or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens. Until the passing of the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962, they were free to enter and remain in the
United Kingdom without restrictions of any kind. Similar treatment has been extended
to citizens of the Irish Republic who, in the United Kingdom, are not aliens.1
Regional Distribution and Trends
The distribution of the population of the British Isles by country and major adminis¬
trative region as enumerated at the 1961 census and at certain previous censuses back
to 1841 is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and of each of
the principal regions of England were in every case greater in 1961 than in 1951 and
in 1951 than in 1931, whereas in the period 1921-31 the populations of Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland had declined. Between 1931 and 1951, the greatest increases
were in the eastern, southern, midland and south-western regions of England, and in
Northern Ireland. The smallest increase was in Wales. Since 1951 the main increases
have been in the eastern, southern and north midland regions of England.
The population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly urban
and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour demands of newly
developing industry drew great numbers from the countryside to the towns, the urban
element continuously and rapidly outgrew the rural element. At the end of the nine¬
teenth century, 75 per cent of the British population was living within the boundaries
of urban administrative areas and the large conurbation2 was already the dominant
type of British community. By 1911 the economic and social limits of these conurba¬
tions extended far beyond the administrative boundaries of the cities which formed
their core, owing to the building of outer suburbs which linked up neighbouring towns.
Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the population has lived in the seven great conurba¬
tions whose centres are the cities of London, Manchester (South-East Lancashire),
Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside),
Leeds and Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon
Tyne (see Table 2).
1 Special transitional arrangements apply to citizens of South Africa, which ceased to be a
member of the Commonwealth in May 1961. Under the South Africa Act, 1962, South Africans,
unless they are also citizens of the United Kingdom or some other Commonwealth country,
became aliens, but South African citizens v/ho fulfil certain defined qualifications showing close
connections with the United Kingdom or a colony by descent, residence or employment can
become United Kingdom citizens by registration if they apply before the end of 1965.

(а) The boundaries of some of the administrative areas have been altered from time to time.
The population figures given relate in general to the areas as these were defined in the year noted
at the head of each column. The figures for conurbations, however, relate in general as nearly
as possible to areas as constituted in 1961.
(б) Area at the date of the 1961 census of population.
(c) 1926 and 1937 census figures.
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the popula¬
tion of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many people had
returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. At the 1951 census many
large cities and towns had larger populations than in i939> population of others
was smaller. Table 2 shows the distribution of the population by urban and rural
districts and the populations of the standard administrative regions, of the seven
major conurbations and the 17 largest cities, some of which are the principal cities
included in the conurbations. It should be borne in mind, however, that the statistics
of cities, relating to administrative areas, do not necessarily include all the con¬
tinuously built-up area of the city; in the case of large towns, development commonly
extends without a break across administrative boundaries and is likely to cover con¬
siderable areas which are administratively rural. The statistics for conurbations, which
consist of continuously built up and economically inter-dependent areas and include
developing suburbs of large cities, are in some cases more illuminating.
The greatest concentration of population in Britain is in the London area. Greater
London is variously defined but it certainly covers an area much larger than the
County of London (population about 3 million). The continuously built-up area
extends into the counties of Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Surrey, Essex and Kent, and
the area socially and economically dependent on the capital is still wider. As in other
urban concentrations, there is a long-established tendency for decreases in the number
of people who actually have their homes in the inner parts of the area—-especially the
centre itself—to be balanced by increases of population in and beyond the outer
suburban fringes. The war accelerated the pre-war fall of population in the inner
areas and retarded the rapid pre-war expansion of some of the outer areas. Between
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!9
1939 and 1951 the County of London lost about two-thirds of a million people and
the population of the official conurbation, which roughly corresponds to the continuously
built-up area, fell by some 380,000 to 8,350,000 in 1951.
Since 1951 there has been a further dispersal, facilitated in part by the improvement
in public transport and the spread of car ownership. The population of the inner areas
has continued to fall, the population of the conurbation outside London County is
almost static, while a broad belt of almost continuous population increase now com¬
pletely encircles the official conurbation, includes and passes beyond all London new
towns and extends along every major rail and road route from London. The contem¬
porary London region can be defined as a roughly circular area with a radius of
40 to 50 miles from central London and a population in 1961 of some 12,000,000
(an increase of half a million since 1951). The redistribution within this region has
resulted both from voluntary or private moves and from planned transfers of population
and probably from differences in natural increase. The increased population of the
outer areas includes both commuters, who have moved their homes but continue to
travel to work in inner London, and inhabitants of new towns and expanded existing
towns, who have changed both their home and their workplace.
The characteristic of urban dispersal, which has reached its largest scale in the London
area, has been a feature of post-war change also in many provincial cities and towns.
It has been most marked where the local economy has been prosperous, population
increase rapid, and land for development in short supply. Outward movement and
fringe development for one or more of these reasons has been noticeably large in outer
areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside conurbations and on the edges of Bristol,
Derby, Leicester, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield.
Apart from the feature of urban dispersal, the past decade has seen widely different
rates of population growth in various parts of the country. The general picture is that
many places in the Midlands and south-east England, some south coast retirement
areas and some economically prosperous parts of the north and west have experienced
increase above the national rate; they include in particular the London, Birmingham
and Southampton-Portsmouth areas, Coventry, Oxford, Gloucester-Cheltenham,
Bournemouth, Middlesbrough, Doncaster and York. There was comparatively little
increase or no change in the South-East Lancashire, West Yorkshire, and Tyneside
conurbations. Few places had any decrease of population; it was generally small in
amount and affected mainly some old industrial areas in Lancashire and south Wales
and a number of seaside towns. Rural districts, in total, had a high rate of increase,
but this was due largely to expansion on town peripheries.
Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language pre¬
dominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic, is the first
language of the majority of the population in most of the western counties and was
spoken by 29 per cent of the population at the time of the 1951 census. In Scotland,
in 1961, some 77,000 persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll,
and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few families in Northern
Ireland spoke the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic
are no longer effectively living languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is
spoken by a few people, and is used in addition to English for certain official
pronouncements.
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included in the
counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll.
20
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French patois is
still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official language of Jersey,
used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French and English are used in the
courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now used for almost all official proceedings.
SOCIAL PATTERNS
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the fore¬
going summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful, however,
to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British households and
the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide a background to the informa¬
tion given in later chapters on such matters as town planning, housing, and transport.
Number and Composition of Households
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of private
households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population was enumerated
by the censuses of 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1951 in institutions such as hotels, schools,
and hospitals. _
In 1911 there were about nine million private households1 in Great Britain. By
1951, according to the censuses of England and Wales and of Scotland, there were
about 14^ million households, an increase of about 60 per cent. This expansion was
much more rapid than the 19 per cent increase in the total population during the same
period because falling birth rates and a lengthened expectation of life meant more but
smaller families. The average size of households in Great Britain fell from 4-5 persons
in 1911 to 3-2 in 1951. In England and Wales the number of persons living in house¬
holds of one or two persons almost trebled between 1911 and 195I> ^ 1^ie en^
period such households constituted about 40 per cent of private households and com¬
prised about 20 per cent of the population in private households. In 43 per cent of
families of two persons, the head of the household was 60 years of age or over.
Of the 14^ million private households in Great Britain in 1951> IIi million were
estimated, according to the 1951 census one per cent sample tables (based on an analysis
of a representative one per cent sample of census returns in Great Britain), to be of the
simplest type, comprising married couples or widowed persons with their children,
if any, or persons living alone. More specifically, they comprised 3-2 million married
couples with no children, 900,000 widowed or divorced persons living alone, 6-9 million
married couples, widowed or divorced persons with children of any age and 600,000
single persons living alone. Some three-quarters of the single persons living alone and
almost all widowed and divorced persons living alone were over 40 years old, and
about two-thirds of all persons living alone were 60 years of age or over.
Altogether over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were estimated
in the 1951 census sample tables to be without children under 16, while another 3‘1
million contained only one child.
In the years since 1951 considerable changes in the numbers, size and composition
of households have taken place. According to the preliminary results of the 1961 census
of England and Wales, the intercensal increase in the number of households was about
12 per cent, compared with a 5 per cent increase in population and about 20 per cent
in number of dwellings. This further decrease in the average size of households is
consistent with the increase in the number of elderly people who tend to live alone
1 Counting persons living alone as one-person households.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
or in pairs and with the splitting of some households. Owing to the more rapid increase
in the number of dwellings there are now, however, fewer shared dwellings. Indeed
the total number of dwellings, including vacant dwellings, falls short of the number of
households by less than 0-4 per cent.
The small average size of households does not imply that wider family and kinship
ties are without strength and social significance. Indeed, a study, published in 1957,1
stressed the importance of the mutual help of relatives and neighbours in the long-
established and balanced communities living in the more crowded parts of East
London. The survey, which also covered a suburban area of Greater London, noted
the dangers of weakening such ties when households are moved out to more congenial
suburban surroundings.
Work and Leisure
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time gainful
employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in full-time gainful
employment. In many cases housewives also undertake part-time or even full¬
time employment. Nearly a third of married women have a paid job, and half the
women working for pay are married.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually from
42 to 46 hours a week. Actual weekly hours worked by men average a little longer owing
to overtime working, and actual hours worked by women and girls average a little less.
In addition, the journey to and from work is often long. The 1951 census showed that
three-quarters of the million persons working in central London lived outside it
and that many travelled in from the fringes of Greater London and some from farther
away. A sample survey of travel in Greater London, made in 1954, showed that 89
per cent of workers in Greater London made regular journeys to work and that 56
per cent used public transport. The average time taken by such persons was 39 minutes
each way, though for workers in central London it was 47 minutes each way. Both the
number of persons travelling daily to work in central London and the average length
of such journeys are tending to increase.
There is also often a long journey for housewives to the main shopping centre in
both urban and rural areas. In most areas there are, of course, a few shops much closer
at hand.
Probably less than five per cent of housewives employ any paid help and almost
certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant. The statistical evidence on this
matter is rather fragmentary, but suggests a continuing reduction in the number of
households with paid help, and confirms what can in any case be readily deduced from
everyday experience, that housewives have less leisure and considerably fewer periods
of continuous leisure of over one hour than other persons in Britain, in spite of
the growth of the habit of eating some meals away from home2 and the spread of
labour-saving devices. Three households in every four now have a vacuum cleaner,
two in five a washing machine and nearly one in three a refrigerator.
Compared with earlier generations, however, most people today have considerably
more leisure. In many industries and services, hours of work are usually arranged to
give a five-day week, and most employees are entitled to two weeks’ continuous holiday
a year in addition to the statutory public holidays. Over half the population take at least
a week’s holiday away from home every year, mostly in July and August. Traditionally

Such social changes often call for difficult adjustments. Many families of unskilled
and semi-skilled workers, for example, suddenly find themselves with more money
to spend when their children leave school for work at fifteen years of age; while the
families of most non-manual and many skilled manual workers forgo the extra income
in order to continue their children’s education. The increased earnings of young
workers, however, have influenced the status and outlook of adolescents generally.
‘Teenage’ society with sufficient coherence, independence and spending power to
establish its own customs, tastes and fashions is a feature of present-day Britain; and,
as in many other countries, the activities of groups of teenagers without adequate
parental control attract more attention than formerly and are a serious social problem
in certain areas.
The chief long-term effects of television, according to recent investigations, are
to widen tastes and stimulate new interests. Another result has been a fall in attendances
at cinemas, formerly the main entertainment of large sections of the community.
Cinema attendances are at barely a third of the rate of ten years ago, but the cinema
remains the most popular form of indoor entertainment outside the home, particularly
for young men and women and older children. About two-thirds of the unmarried
aged 15 to 24 go at least once a week.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller. There are probably only some 400
theatres compared with some 2,800 cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiastic
and growing public not only for plays but for ballet, opera and concerts.
Dancing is popular, especially with those under twenty-five years of age; it is
thought that about five million people go dancing every week and television audiences
for ballroom dancing competitions are rated at nearly five million households. There
are estimated to be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance halls, including public dance
halls and halls operated by the major dance schools, which are open at least three
times a week, and about 4,000 other schools of ballroom dancing. Public dances are
also often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and societies which abound in
Britain hold dances from time to time in their own or hired premises. In addition,
Scottish and English traditional dances have their own following while, since the war,
there has been a very large increase in attendance at ballet and other stage dancing
classes (mainly by young girls).
In addition to the perennially popular sports and pastimes, there are a number
which attain a transitory popularity and it is not possible to tell how permanent any
new trend will prove. A sport new to Britain and gaining popularity is ten-pin bowling.
Another recent amusement is bingo which has become very popular since the coming
into force of the Betting and Gaming Act, i960, which made some changes in the
laws restricting gambling.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some particular
purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and international organi¬
sations with branches throughout the country. Organisations of national importance
in social life and in the promotion of social gatherings include, in addition to those
connected with religious denominations, the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes,
the Townswomen’s Guilds and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,500 clubs,
with over two million members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working
Men’s Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recreational,
though they also arrange lectures and classes. Nearly 2,400 Townswomen’s Guilds,
with a total membership of about 203,000, are affiliated to the National Union of
Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are both educational and social in purpose, and
they co-operate in many public welfare activities. The declared objective of the
B
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
24
National Federation of Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; the
institutes make an important contribution to rural life by providing meeting places for
countrywomen and by organising social gatherings. There are in villages throughout
England and Wales some 4,526 institutes with nearly half a million members, while
in Scotland and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar
aims and interests.
In spite of the growth of social clubs, one traditional social rendezvous, the public
house, has maintained and even increased its popularity both in towns and in villages,
although there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness and in consumption of
alcohol per head since the nineteenth century; the recent rise in drunkenness among
adolescents, though serious, is on a relatively small scale. The public house attracts a
very wide circle of casual customers (both men and women) as well as many ‘regulars’
who meet for a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play some traditional public house
game or to watch television. A rival feature of urban life is the large number of small
restaurants, milk bars and coffee bars. A characteristic of many of the coffee bars,
which stay open until late at night and are popular as rendezvous for young people, is
their modern decor. On the other hand, many people, especially the married and the
elderly, spend much of their leisure at home—reading, listening to the radio, record-
player or tape recorder, viewing television, entertaining their friends,1 looking after
pets2 and pursuing hobbies. Hobbies are, of course, innumerable in their variety, but
many are practical and contribute to the improvement of the home. About four out
of five families do most of their own decorating, while the sales of hand-tools and the
rapidly increasing sales of small power-tools and powered garden implements testify
to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery and to the interest and initiative
that maintain Britain’s homes and gardens. In spite of the high proportion of the
population living in urban areas, at least every other family in Britain has some
garden, and the standard of both town and country gardens is high. Some 4,000 local
horticultural societies are affiliated to the National Allotment and Gardens Society
and there are a large number of unaffiliated societies; altogether there are probably
some 19 million spare-time gardeners. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held
in town and country are very popular, and there is a large attendance at those held in
London, particularly at the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in some form
of sustained group activity connected, for example, with the churches, trade unionism,
politics, social welfare and reform, or with cultural pursuits, especially amateur
dramatics and music-making (see the Arts section of Chapter 8). People with such
interests are still in a minority, but they constitute an important and characteristic
feature of British life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the working of British
democracy.
1 Indications of the rise in the scale and standard of home entertaining are provided by the
increasing sales of table wines (double those of the 1930s) and of expensive foods, and by the
frequent newspaper and periodical features and broadcast programmes devoted to cooking
recipes.
* A sample survey in 1959 suggested that about a quarter of all homes had a caged bird, slightly
over a fifth a cat, and slightly under a fifth a dog; there are probably some 4 million dogs in
Britain, over 6 million cats and 8 or 9 million pet birds (mainly budgerigars).

GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions are to be
found in the history of each of its four component parts: England, Wales, Northern
Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon king in the ninth century;
Wales became part of that kingdom and Ireland was joined with it under the same king
before the end of the thirteenth century; and the English and Scottish thrones were
dynastically united in the person of James I and VI in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for
the Union of England and Scotland provided that the two countries ‘should be forever
united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the Parliament of Great Britain)
became the supreme authority in both countries. In 1801 the Act for the Union of
Great Britain and Ireland, 1800, which joined the Irish Parliament to the Parliament
of Great Britain, established the United Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern
Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became a completely independent country, outside
the United Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, had enacted
a constitution for Northern Ireland which perpetuated Northern Ireland representa¬
tion in the United Kingdom Parliament as the supreme authority and, at the same time,
provided that country with its own legislature and executive, to deal with domestic
affairs.
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but methods of government are
flexible and, to some extent, adapted to the needs of the constituent countries. Thus
there is some measure of devolution in the administration of Welsh affairs under a
Cabinet Minister (who is Minister for Welsh Affairs), assisted by a Minister of State,
and advised by a Council for Wales as broadly representative as possible of all the
main aspects of Welsh life and thought. England and Wales on the one hand, and
Scotland on the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law,
a different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local govern¬
ment, national churches on a different footing, and, for most domestic matters, different
Government departments. The main Scottish departments are grouped under the
direction of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a member of the United King¬
dom Cabinet. In Northern Ireland the law is derived from and similar to the law of
England but the judiciary is separate; the Northern Ireland Government departments
are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man (which are Crown dependencies, not part of the United Kingdom) have their
own legislative assemblies and systems of local administration and of law, and their own
courts. At the same time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom
because of their proximity to the mainland and the antiquity of their connection
with the Crown. They are treated as part of the mainland for purposes of trade and
postal communication and are ‘territories for whose international relations Her Majesty’s
Government is responsible’. They are also formally subject to the United Kingdom
Parliament.

GOVERNMENT
2?
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the good govern¬
ment of a number of overseas dependencies within the Commonwealth, all of which
are administered by territorial governments and are at various stages of development
towards full self-government. The United Kingdom is also one of the independent
member nations of the Commonwealth,1 which all acknowledge the Queen as the
symbol of their free association and, as such, the head of the Commonwealth; several
of these independent countries owe allegiance to the Crown.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by common
law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions, which are not part
of the law of the land in that violation of them may lead to proceedings in a court
of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable to the machinery of government. The
rules of the constitution have never been codified; principles and practice are both
alterable, and the rules of the constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at
any time by the passing of an Act of Parliament, or by the general acceptance of a new
convention, without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
(1) the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the supreme
authority in the realm;
(2) the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other Ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(b) Government departments, most of them under the control of ministers
and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for administration at
the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer and manage many
services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards, which are severally
responsible for the operation of particular nationalised industries or public
services, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying degrees; and
(3) the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages will describe these three organs of government in some detail in
order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in spite of
interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon which
it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of the
Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the year 829, and of Malcolm II, whose
reign in Scotland (1005-34) was correspondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act, 1953, the royal title in the United Kingdom is:
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’. The form of the royal title is varied for the
other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to
suit the particular circumstances of each.
1 The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana,
the Federation of Malaya, the Federation of Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Jamaica,
Trinidad and Uganda.
28
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom, the Queen being represented
by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of royal functions in the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance
to the Crown the Queen’s representative is the Governor-General, who is appointed
by the Crown on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly
independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom depen¬
dencies the Queen is usually represented by Governors (but in some cases by High
Commissioners, Administrators or Residents), who are appointed by the Crown, have
varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible to the United Kingdom
Government for the good government of the countries concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, 1701, which provided
that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent Princess
Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Subsequent Succession to the
Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and although succession is not bound to
continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a provision of the Statute
of Westminster, 1931) except by common consent of the member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide that
the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne according to their
seniority or, if there are no sons, the daughters in order of their seniority. When a
daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are
vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the
consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not
apply and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession of
another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign is
proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor, aldermen and other
leading citizens of the City of London, and the High Commissioners in London of
the member nations of the Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
Coronation
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in substance
for nearly a thousand years although the details have frequently been modified to
bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The service used at the coronation
of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was derived from that used at the coronation of King
Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of repre¬
sentatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Commonwealth
countries and of representatives of foreign States.

GOVERNMENT

Acts of Government
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the executive,
an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales,
Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the temporal head of the established Church of England. In practice,
as a result of a long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the
monarchy has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her
ministers which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule.
The United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of
the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation during
the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers without any
necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule she
opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may be read by
the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and she must give Royal
Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament
becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the fountain of justice’, and as such, can
remit all or part of the penalties imposed on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain
of honour’, the Queen confers peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours,1
and makes appointment to all important State offices, including those of judges,
officers in the armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in
the established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are required
before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the realm of international
affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the State, the Queen has the power to
conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory, to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal prerogative2
which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally left in the
hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of this authority is
shown in the three constitutional ways in which the royal will can be expressed: by
Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice of the Privy Council’; by Order,
Commission or Warrant signed personally by the Queen and generally bearing the
signature of one or more responsible ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters
Patent, or other documents under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in
obedience to a Royal Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not detract
from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the smooth working of
government; for although the Queen has no personal authority and must show
complete impartiality in every field, she must be informed and consulted on
every aspect of the national life. The Queen holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and overseas,
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a few,
i.e. the Order of Merit, the Order of Companions of Honour, the Royal Victorian Order, the Most
Noble Order of the Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle, are
in the Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter; the
construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the administration of
charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries; the right to treasure
trove; and the right of printing or licensing others to print the Bible, the Book of Common
Prayer and State papers.
3°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State
papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has been
made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign
is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of eighteen on accession to the throne.
The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act, 1953—laid down that the first potential
Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh and thereafter the Princess Margaret and
then those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s
partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Coun¬
sellors of State (generally speaking, the wife or husband of the Sovereign, and the four
adult persons next in succession to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate
by Letters Patent certain royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for
instance, dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign),
nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the British
Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook of
both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are the same today
as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and
royal funerals are still marked by ancient ceremonial, although to a lesser degree than
in former days; and the birthday of the Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many
royal and public functions, is today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping
the Colour on the Horse Guards Parade. State banquets still take place when a foreign
monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures are still held at
Buckingham Palace; and royal processions continue to grace such social occasions
as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and to add significance to the
opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating from
the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal ordinances, ancient
usage, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other members of the
royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every year, and their presence at
the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial, and charitable works of national
importance ensures nation-wide interest and support. They also pay State visits to
foreign Governments and undertake lengthy tours in other countries of the
Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the House
of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate: they are constituted on
different principles; they do different work in different places and they meet together
only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the coronation, or the opening of
Parliament by the Queen in person, when the Commons are summoned by the Queen
to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however, Parliament is a
1 The Regency Act, 1953, provided that Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.
GOVERNMENT 31
corporate body and cannot legislate without the concurrence of all its parts (except
in the case of Bills passed under the Parliament Acts, 1911 and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the United
Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, for any of the constituent
countries separately, or for any combination of them. It can also legislate for the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these islands and in Northern Ireland it is
not the only legislature, for the Northern Ireland Parliament has power to legislate for
Northern Ireland on most domestic subjects (see p. 42), and the ancient legislatures
of the two Channel Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey)
and of the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) legislate on domestic matters.1 Never¬
theless, the Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical
limits there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, the life of a United Kingdom Parliament
was fixed at five years (although it is usually dissolved and a general election held
before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament cannot bind its successor
(for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not be sovereign or supreme), each
assembly has a period of time of up to five years during which it may legislate exactly
as it chooses. During its life, it can make or unmake any law; it can destroy by statute
the most firmly established convention or turn a convention into binding law; it can
legalise past illegalities and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has
power to prolong its own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five
years without consulting the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice, Parliament
does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Its members bear in mind the common
law which has grown up in Britain throughout the centuries and they act as far as
possible in accordance with precedent and tradition. Moreover, although the validity
of an Act of Parliament that has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published
by the proper authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be
likely to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of
party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its responsibility
to the electorate in mind.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with a pro¬
clamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council. Such a proclama¬
tion on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and, on the other, orders
the issue of writs for the election of a new one and appoints the day and place of
its meeting.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parliament.
Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, but since 1867 the duration
of Parliament has been independent of the demise of the Crown; both Houses stand
adjourned on such an occasion only until their members have taken the oath of
allegiance to the new Sovereign, which they do immediately after the Accession Council
has made the order for proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or dissolution
is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a commission under the Great
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member of the
Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure
before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Seal (see p. 29), which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new session.
The date so appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclama¬
tion. The effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate all business (with certain minor
exceptions) until Parliament is summoned again. A Bill not completed in one session
must be reintroduced in the next, unless it is to be abandoned.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A reassembly
of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by virtue of powers specially
conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about 160,
divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until Christmas
lasting 30-40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of 40-50 sitting days, one from
Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one from Whitsun until the end of
July lasting about 40 sitting days. Nowadays, the session is sometimes concluded
with a short period of up to 10 sitting days in October, after the long summer recess.
The House of Lords sits, on average, for about no days.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of just over 900 peers, as follows:
(1) The Lords Temporal, sub-divided into (i) all hereditary peers of the realm,1
except Scottish and Irish peers, (ii) all life peers created by the Crown under
the Life Peerages Act, 1958, (iii) sixteen representative peers of Scotland,
who are elected for each Parliament by all the holders of Scottish peerages in
accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Union, 1707, and (iv) nine
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (‘Law Lords’), who are appointed under the
terms of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, to assist the House in the
performance of its judicial duties and who remain members of the House
after their retirement from office.
(2) The Lords Spiritual, who are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the
Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21 most senior other
diocesan bishops of the Church of England, according to seniority of appoint¬
ment.
Temporal peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them, for men over
21 years of age, a right to a seat in the House of Lords,2 but, according to standing
orders promulgated by that House in 1958, holders are asked at the beginning of each
Parliament whether they will attend the sittings of the House as often as they reason¬
ably can or whether they desire to be relieved of the obligation to attend. If they do so
desire, they are requested to apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of the
Parliament or for a shorter period, during which time they are expected not to attend
the House.
1 Including peerages of Great Britain (those created between the Treaty for the Union of
England and Scotland in 1707, and 1800), and of the United Kingdom (those created after the
Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, 1800). By the Act for the Union of Great Britain
and Ireland, the Irish peers were entitled to elect 28 representative peers as life members of the
House of Lords, but no elections have been held since the creation of the Irish Free State (now
the Irish Republic) in 1922, and no Irish representative peers now survive.
2 Except for a peer who is disqualified as a person convicted of treason and felony who has
not yet served his sentence or been pardoned, a member expelled by the House sitting as a court
of law, unless pardoned, or a bankrupt.
GOVERNMENT
33
Peers in constant attendance at the House of Lords are generally elder statesmen
and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive no salary for their
parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to
the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend at least one-third of the number
of sittings), and (with the exception of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of
Committees and any member in receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office)
they may claim payment for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the
House (except for judicial sittings) within a maximum of three guineas a day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits on the wool¬
sack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by commission under the Great
Seal, appoints several peers to take their place on the woolsack as deputy speakers in
the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord
Chairman of Committees, who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all
committees, unless the House otherwise directs. The permanent officers include the
Clerk of the Parliaments, who is charged with keeping the records of proceedings and
judgments and who pronounces the words of the Royal Assent to Bills; the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, who enforces the orders of the House; and the Serjeant-at-
Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost universal
adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of the community.
There are at present 630 seats in the House of Commons (511 for England, 36 for
Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons receive a salary for their parliamentary work
and hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They are elected either at a general
election, which takes place after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election, which is held when a vacancy occurs
in the House as a result of the death of a member, or of his acceptance of office under
the Crown,1 or as a result of his elevation to the House of Lords.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected by the
members as president of the House immediately after a new Parliament is formed.
Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and
the Deputy Chairman, both of whom may act as Deputy Speaker; these officers are
elected by the House. Non-parliamentary or permanent officers of the House, i.e. those
who are not members of Parliament, include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who
is charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing orders;
the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker in the House; and the Chaplain to the
Speaker.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to Parliament. Permanent Boundary Commissions for
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland keep constituencies constantly under
review, submit periodic returns, and may, at any time, recommend changes in the
boundaries of any particular constituency or constituencies if, for instance, movement
of the population has made this necessary. Changes in the boundaries of constituencies

which came into effect for the 1955 general election increased the number of seats in
the House of Commons from 625 to the present figure of 630.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the Represen¬
tation of the People Act, 1949, which repealed and re-enacted in a single statute previous
legislation relating to the franchise, the conduct of elections and corrupt and illegal
electoral practices. Under the provisions of this Act, election to the House of Commons
is decided by secret ballot in which British subjects (except members of the House of
Lords) and citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (although voting is not
compulsory), provided that they are 21 years old or over, and are not subject to any
legal incapacity to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are
on the register1 of electors for the constituency and are resident there on a date fixed
by statute. Electors normally vote in person at polling stations especially established
for the purpose, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of the United
Kingdom employed overseas, and the wives of such persons if resident overseas with
their husbands may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain cases by proxy, may
also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for such reasons as physical
incapacity or the nature of his work. Any person, male or female, who is a British
subject of 21 years of age or over and is not otherwise disqualified, may be elected to
the House of Commons. Categories of persons disqualified for election include peers2
(other than certain Irish peers), clergy of the Church of England, the Church of
Scotland, the Church of Ireland, and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged
bankrupts, and those expressly precluded under the House of Commons Disqualifi¬
cation Act, 1957 (for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil servants, members of
the regular armed forces and the police forces, members of the legislature of any
country or territory outside the Commonwealth, and holders of other public offices
listed in the Act).
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. These
privileges apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown for the
Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of
each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil proceedings for a period
from forty days before to forty days after a session of Parliament; freedom of speech in
debate; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own proceedings
(so that it is able, for example, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right
to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat
vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of
its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest; freedom of
speech in debate; freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and
1 A register containing the names of all electors, prepared for each constituency and published
yearly by registration officers, who in England and Wales are usually the clerks of local councils
and in Scotland are the land valuation assessors.
2 A committee of both Houses of Parliament has been set up to consider the right of peers
inheriting titles to sit in either House and to vote in parliamentary elections.
GOVERNMENT 35
the right to commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the
Speaker as in the House of Commons; they exist independently without grant.
The Party System
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth century,
and has now become an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general election or a
by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any other citizen who
wishes may also stand.1 The electorate then indicates, by its choice of candidate
at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies it would like to see
put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the majority
of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority of supporters
in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of the
majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign, usually on the
advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding members in the House
of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments on the advice
of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official Opposition
with its own leader and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while
the members of any other parties or any Independents who have been elected may
support the Government or the Opposition according to their party’s or their own
view of the policy being debated at any given time.
In the general election held in October 1959, 78-7 per cent of the electorate voted,
compared with 83-6 per cent in 1950, 81-9 per cent in 1951 and 76-8 per cent in 1955.
The number of votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 3.

The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the general
elections of 1955 and 1959 is shown in Table 4.
TABLE 4
Members Elected at General Elections in 1955 and 1959
(a) A majority of 100 over all other parties. This was the first time since the establishment of
the modern party' system in Britain in the nineteenth century that a party had increased its
parliamentary strength in four successive general elections and the first time that a party had
retained office after being in power for the duration of two full Parliaments.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable extent
upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on by agreement:
that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must govern and therefore accepts
its decisions; and the majority agrees that the minority should criticise and therefore
sets time aside for that criticism to be heard. The detailed arrangements of Government
business are settled, under the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House (who may
be the Prime Minister or some other minister), by the Government Chief Whip in
consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief Whips together form the
‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of Commons when the question of
the possibility of finding time for debating some particular issue is being discussed. The
direction of the business of the House is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of
the House, and it is his duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate
matters about which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local organisations.
Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips (the Chief Whips and their assistants,
chosen within the party or by the Prime Minister for the Government party), whose
duties include maintaining the voting strength of their parties by ensuring the atten¬
dance of members at important debates. The Opposition Whips have no official
position, but the Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons is the Parlia¬
mentary Secretary to the Treasury and of the other Government Whips, five hold
titular posts as Junior Lords of the Treasury, three are officers of the Royal Household
and five are unpaid. There are also Government and Opposition Whips in the House
of Lords. The former, who hold offices in the Royal Household, sometimes act as
spokesmen for the Government in debates.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to make laws regulating the life of the
community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make available finance
for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds necessary for the services
of the State, and (3) to criticise and control the Government. By custom, Parliament
is also consulted before the ratification of certain international treaties and agreements

(in spite of the fact that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the
advice of the Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary approval).
Parliamentary Procedure
Both Houses of Parliament have their own standing orders, but procedure is based
on custom and precedent (much of which dates back to the beginning of the sixteenth
century and even earlier) rather than on the written orders, which merely supplement
the practice in each House. The system of debate is much the same in the two Houses:
for instance, every matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack
and resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; members speak from
wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum; and members do not read
their speeches. The main difference is that in the House of Commons the Speaker has
a far greater measure of control.
In the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent authority
to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general sense of the House.
In the Commons, on the contrary, the Speaker has full authority to give effect, promptly
and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House. He must carefully guard against
abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority rights, and it is his duty to allow
or disallow any closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end discussion so that the
matter may be put to the vote). He has certain powers to check irrelevance and
repetition in debate, and to save the time of the House in various other respects.
In cases of grave disorder, he has power to adjourn the House or suspend the sitting
on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the Speaker,
and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number of votes is cast, the
Speaker must give the decisive vote; he does this (if possible) in such a way as to avoid
change and leave the question to be debated on another occasion. The procedure on
voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the House of Commons, but the
Speaker or chairman has no casting vote. With the exception of questions relating
to Bills and delegated legislation, the House of Lords is governed by the principle that
unless there is a majority in favour, the question is decided in the negative. When the
House is sitting judicially (see pp. 85 and 88) the question is put in such a way that, if
the votes were equal, there would be no interference with the order under appeal.
As a rule, all proceedings of either House are public (the right to debate in secret
is exercised only rarely), and a full record is published daily in the official reports,
Parliamentary Debates {Hansard).
Legislation
Legislation can be initiated from either side of either House; but no Bill involving
taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far unless the Government
agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it. This has the effect of giving the
Government exclusive rights over a wide field of legislation, and as a result most
Public Bills are presented by the Government. However, private members (i.e.
members of the House who are neither office holders in the Government nor Opposi¬
tion leaders) can introduce Public Bills on their own initiative, and such Bills can be
debated on certain days expressly set aside for the purpose in each session.1 Peers can
1 Private members also have the right of moving for leave to introduce Bills after question
time (see p. 41) on certain days under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, i.e. the Standing Order which
allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before the House
decides whether or not to grant leave.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
38
introduce Public Bills in the House of Lords at any time during a session without
notice. In addition, persons and bodies outside Parliament can promote Private Bills
relating solely to matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless they deal with finance or representation
when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however, Bills likely to
raise political controversy go through the Commons before the Lords, while those of
an intricate but uncontroversial nature are frequently introduced and fully debated
in the Lords before being sent to the Commons.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of Lords as
in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading on introduction;
it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies between one day and several
weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it may be given a Second Reading after
the result of a debate on its general merits or principles. In the Commons, it is then
referred for detailed examination either to a standing committee or, if the House so
decides, to the whole House sitting in committee; and, in the Lords, to a committee
of the whole House. When the committee stage is finished, the Bill is reported to the
House, and a further stage takes place during which the committee’s amendments
may be altered, additional amendments may be suggested and incorporated, and,
if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted to committee. Finally, it is submitted for a
Third Reading and, if passed, it is sent on from the Commons to the Lords or from
the Lords to the Commons (depending on its place of origin), where it enters on
the same course again. Any amendments which the second House makes to the
Bill must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise reached, before the Bill
becomes law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment all financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing taxation,
and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the Supply Services
from the Consolidated Fund.1 As a general rule, these Bills are introduced upon resolu¬
tions in a committee of the whole House of Commons and they may be initiated only
by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are sent
to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, now usually given by commission. The Sovereign’s
power to refuse assent has not been exercised since the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they are then returned
to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent. However, should any Lords
Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would never reach the Statute Book, for no
debating time would be allotted to it—at any rate until a new government came into
power, when it might be revived. The Lords, on the other hand, are unlikely to be
able to prevent a Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In
the normal course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return
it unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for the
consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amend¬
ments made. The Lords cannot require the Commons to agree to amendments;
nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in respect of Money Bills;
and since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1949, any other Public Bill which has been
passed by the House of Commons in two successive sessions may be presented for
1 It is provided in the Parliament Act, 1911, that all Money Bills sent to the House of Lords
one month before the end of the session shall receive the Royal Assent notwithstanding, if they
are not passed by the Lords without amendment within the month.
GOVERNMENT
39
Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed
between the date of the Second Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on
which it is finally passed in that House. These limitations to the powers of the Lords
are based on the belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a non-elected
assembly, lies in bringing the wide experience of its members into the legislative
process, not in thwarting the elected House. In other words, proceedings in the House
of Lords give time for further reflection, and often elicit new points of view.
In substance, a Private Bill goes through the same procedure as a Public Bill, but
most of the work is done in committee where the promoters must prove the need for
the powers or privileges that they seek and where any objections raised by opposing
interests may be heard.
Parliamentary Committees
A committee of the whole House is the House itself, presided over by a chairman
instead of the Speaker. Its function is to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after
their Second Reading. The Committees of Supply and of Ways and Means are
committees of the whole House of Commons, which discharge the financial duties of
the House concerning the grant of public money and the levying of taxation.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of which exist
to a varying degree to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and
complex work. They are:
(1) Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons as
necessary, for the consideration of Public Bills and, in the case of the Scottish
and Welsh Grand Committees, other business committed to them. With the
exception of the Scottish Standing and Grand Committees1 (which deal with
Public Bills and other matters relating to Scotland), and the Welsh Grand
Committee2 (which considers the annual report for Wales and certain selected
subjects for debate), each standing committee consists of from twenty to fifty
members nominated by the Committee of Selection (a body normally consisting
of eleven members drawn from the main parties in the House at the beginning
of each session); in all cases the parties are represented in proportion to their
numbers in the House. The procedure of a standing committee is generally
similar to that of a committee of the whole House.
(2) Select Committees, including joint select committees of both Houses, which
are appointed to inquire into and report to the House on special matters.
Some of these, such as the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, and
on the nationalised industries, tend to be re-appointed each session; some are
set up automatically by standing order, such as the Committee of Public
Accounts and the Estimates Committee; others are set up as and when required.
Various other committees exist to deal with Private Bill legislation. There are
also a number of unofficial committees, consisting either of one party or of members
of all parties, such as study groups concerning themselves with particular issues,
e.g., the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee; and parliamentary party committees,
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of thirty members nominated from Scottish con¬
stituencies with up to twenty other nominated members; in its plenary form it is known as the
Scottish Grand Committee, with all the members for the Scottish constituencies and not more
than fifteen others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to 25 other nominated members selected in order to make the balance
of parties in the committee approximate to that in the whole House.

e.g., the Labour Policy Committee, and the Conservative and Unionist Members
Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee.
Delegated Legislation
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by the direct functioning of Parlia¬
ment, but by powers conferred on the executive by Act of Parliament (or, more rarely,
by royal prerogative), has been part of the parliamentary system for at least six hundred
years. Parliament, however, made but sparing use of its power to delegate legislation
(except during a period of social, political and economic change in the second half of
the fifteenth and most of the sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth
century, when a changing conception of the part that should be played by the State
in the life of the community made inroads upon parliamentary time and thus caused
the system to be adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing scope of
Government activity during the past sixty years, pressure on parliamentary time has
become even more acute; as a result, the system of delegated legislation created under
statutory powers has become generally accepted.
The system of delegated legislation empowers ministers and other authorities to
regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. Its advantages are said1
to be: (1) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before Parliament, thus enabling Parliament
to deal with a greater volume of business and to give fuller attention to matters of
policy and principle which are its primary concern; (2) that it encourages flexibility,
in that administrative details can be worked out as and when the necessity arises
‘with greater care and minuteness, and with better adaptation to local and other
special circumstances than they possibly can be during the passage of a Bill through
Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for it is ‘the means by which the
legislature can dispense with its own deliberative procedure and arm the executive
with power to take immediate action’; and (4) that it provides a speedy, convenient
and accurate means of giving effect to the policy of Parliament.
In order to minimise the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative
powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, such powers are
normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities directly responsible to
Parliament, i.e. to Ministers of the Crown, to Government departments for which
ministers are responsible, or to organisations whose legislation is subject to con¬
firmation or approval by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament
for it. Moreover the Act which delegates legislative power generally defines the precise
limits of this power and, in the more important cases, gives Parliament the right to
confirm or annul the statutory instruments2 by which delegated legislation is enacted.
Certain Acts also require direct consultation with organisations which will be affected
by delegated legislation before such legislation is made.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation by the
Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which is set up each session to report on
the unusual or unexpected use of statutory powers. The Special Orders Committee of
the House of Lords examines and reports on all Statutory Instruments requiring
affirmative resolution.
1 From an official minute written in 1893 and quoted in Concerning English Administrative Law,
by Sir Cecil Carr. Oxford University Press. 1942. pp. 33-34.
2 Statutory instruments are made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory Instru¬
ments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893. Instruments of
delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as ‘statutory rules and orders’
(‘S.R. & O.’).
GOVERNMENT
41
Parliamentary Control
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised in the
final analysis by the power of the House of Commons to pass a resolution of ‘no
confidence’ in the Government, or to reject a proposal which the Government considers
so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’, thus forcing the Govern¬
ment to resign.
The financial control necessary to ensure that money shall be spent only with the
authority of Parliament and for the purposes authorised by Parliament is described
in Chapter 13, Finance. Methods of general control are provided by:
(1) the institution of Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary
time during which ministers, in rotation, answer questions put to them on
matters for which they are responsible, thus focusing the attention of the
public on the day-to-day processes of government;
(2) the practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee of
Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements of
the Government and has become an occasion for the examination initiated
by the Opposition, of some aspect of the Government’s administrative policy
which has been included in the Estimates;
(3) the practice of bringing on a debate later in the same day by moving the
adjournment of the House, which is permitted only if the matter is deemed
by the Speaker to be definite, urgent, of public importance, and to be the
responsibility of the Government, and if 40 members rise in their places to
support the demand for a debate, or 10 members rise and the House grants
leave on a division;
(4) the right of members to raise any matter on the motion for the adjournment
of the House at the end of each day’s sitting; and
(5) the power of either House to confirm or annul some statutory instruments.
In addition, Government policy and action are fully discussed in the important
debates which take place during the proceedings at the opening of Parliament and
in the motion for the adjournment of the House before a recess.
Public Interest in Parliament
The public’s interest in the work of Parliament is shown by the queues which form
outside the Houses of Parliament for admission to the public galleries, by the growth
in the circulation of the daily official report {Hansard) which at present is between
three and four times the pre-war figure, and by the large audiences which listen to the
regular broadcast programmes about parliamentary proceedings.
The major news agencies and national newspapers have special parliamentary
correspondents to report on parliamentary activities. A television broadcast of the
State opening of Parliament was transmitted for the first time in 1958. The Hansard
Society for Parliamentary Government, an unofficial non-party educational society
which was founded in 1944, continues to promote interest in parliamentary affairs.
The Northern Ireland Parliament
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and a House
of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by a Governor,
who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her Majesty’s name; the
Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor
42
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of Londonderry) together with 24 senators who hold office for an eight-year term,
12 being elected by the House of Commons every four years according to the principle
of proportional representation; and the House of Commons consists of 52 members,
elected by a system of parliamentary franchise similar to that which operates in Great
Britain. The House, unless sooner dissolved, continues in existence for a period
of five years.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order and
good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters except those especially
reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, i.e. the Crown or succession to
the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the postal services; the Supreme Court;
customs and excise; income and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights and
measures; trade marks; submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and
lighthouses, buoys and beacons. Under the constitutional practices which have
developed since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the United
Kingdom Parliament does not legislate on matters within the powers of the Northern
Ireland Parliament unless the Government of Northern Ireland requests that this
should be done. But, because certain matters have been reserved to the United
Kingdom Parliament, provision was made in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,
for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland constituencies in the House of
Commons of the United Kingdom; in accordance with this provision, 12 members
are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was the
chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet government
developed, however, the Privy Council declined in importance; many of its powers were
transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
Government departments. The present-day Privy Council exists mainly to give
effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn of
the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council (which is
retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in some branch of
public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. There are usually about 300
Privy Counsellors.
Procedure and Functions
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is usually presided
over by the Sovereign. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but, as a rule, not
fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called together
only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for the submission for the Sovereign’s approval
of Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing fundamentally in con¬
stitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal prerogative, for example,
those embodying royal instructions to colonial Governors; and those which are
authorised by Act of Parliament and are a form of delegated legislation. Members of
the Privy Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not
thereby become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based;

this rests with the ministers in whose departments the draft orders were framed,
whether they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council must be
published in the London Gazette, which is an official periodical published by the
authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations, some
of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as summoning or
dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from those
of the full Privy Council in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally be present. These
committees, which have advisory functions, may be prerogative, such as the committee
which deals with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man, and the committees for medical research, scientific and
industrial research, agricultural research, overseas research, and nature conservation;
or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with applications for
the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in the Privy
Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the Council (see p. 45).
Judicial Committee
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from the
courts of the United Kingdom dependencies and certain member States of the Common¬
wealth, deriving its appellate jurisdiction in respect of such appeals from the principle
of English common law which recognises ‘the right of all the King’s subjects to appeal
for redress to the Sovereign in Council’ if they believe that the courts of law have
failed to do them justice. The Judicial Committee is also the final court of appeal
from the ecclesiastical courts of England, from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,
and from prize courts1 in the United Kingdom and colonies.
Appeals come to the Judicial Committee either where a right of appeal has been
specially created, for example, by statute, Order in Council or Letters Patent, or by
special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice of the Judicial Committee.
They are heard by a board of the committee, whose members are generally selected
from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
although other members of the Privy Council who have held high judicial office
(including Chief Justices and certain other judges from other Commonwealth countries
who have been sworn of the Privy Council) may also be asked to sit when business is
heavy. The Judicial Committee does not, in theory, deliver judgment. It advises the
Sovereign, who acts on its report and approves an Order in Council to give effect
thereto.

Composition
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time, both
in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The usual ministerial
offices may be classified under the following heads:
1. The Prime Minister, who is the recognised head of the Government but has
no department.
2. Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the First Secretary of State (a new
appointment in 1962) and the holders of various traditional offices—the Lord
President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,1 the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General (whose office is at present combined
with that of Chief Secretary to the Treasury) and a Minister without Portfolio.
These ministers have few or no departmental duties and are thus available to
perform any special duties which the Prime Minister may wish to entrust to
them. In the Government, as reorganised in July 1962, the First Secretary
of State, who ranks next to the Prime Minister, is responsible for the Central
African Office (see p. 52) and is the leader of the ministerial group charged
with the oversight of Common Market negotiations; the Lord President of
the Council has the general duty of promoting scientific and technological
development as Minister for Science; the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster is Leader of the House of Commons; the Lord Privy Seal handles
Foreign Office business in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs being a member of the House of Lords; the Chief Secretary
to the Treasury and Paymaster General, under the general direction of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, deals with the whole range of public expenditure;
and the Minister without Portfolio co-ordinates the Government information
services at home.
3. Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present six Secretaries of State—for the Home Department,
Foreign Affairs, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations and Colonies, War, and
Air. The more recently created posts usually have the formal title of Minister;
an exception is the Secretary for Technical Co-operation. A few of the older
posts have special titles: the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible
for the Treasury and for a number of other departments); the President of the
Board of Trade; the First Lord of the Admiralty; and the Postmaster General.
4. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor has depart¬
mental functions; he is also in a somewhat special position as a Minister of
the Crown who is also head of the judiciary in England and Wales. The four
Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland.
5. Ministers of State, who are additional ministers in Government departments
where the work is particularly heavy and complex, or when it involves frequent
travelling overseas. There are now two Ministers of State in the Foreign Office,
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed by the
reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately
administered by the Chancellor.

one each in the Home, Commonwealth Relations and Colonial Offices, and two
at the Board of Trade. In addition, the Secretary of State for Scotland is assis¬
ted by a Minister of State, and there is a Minister of State for Welsh Affairs.
6. Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by assisting in their
departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the
Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category as Government Whips.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are appointed
by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, since the
Government’s continuance in office depends upon the maintenance of a majority
in that House. There must, however, always be some ministers in the House of Lords,
partly because the House of Commons Disqualification Act, I957> limits the number
of ministers who may sit and vote in the Commons while receiving salaries from the
Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of spokesmen of stand¬
ing to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the House of Lords.
The Prime Minister
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during the
eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the holder of this
office derives from his status as leader of the majority party in Parliament and from
his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to obtain their
resignation or dismissal individually. In modern times the Prime Minister always
holds the office of First Lord of the Treasury, and may also hold another portfolio.
Since 1902 he has always been a member of the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general business
of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a general supervision
over departments, settling departmental differences and approving important depart¬
mental decisions where reference to the Cabinet is not required. The Prime Minister
speaks for the Government in the House of Commons on the most important topics
and answers questions on its general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s responsibilities include making recommendations to the
Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops, bishops and certain
other senior clergy and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as for
appointments to high judicial offices, such as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, Lord Chief
Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown on appointments of
Privy Counsellors, Lord Lieutenants of counties1 and certain civil appointments, such as
Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet
Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some university appointments which are
in the gift of the Crown. The Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for
appointments to various public boards and institutions, such as the National Assistance
Board and the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well as to various royal and
statutory commissions. In addition, he makes recommendations to the Sovereign for
1 The office of Lord Lieutenant in the county was first created in the sixteenth century.
Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
46
the award of many civil honours and distinctions and of Civil List pensions. He
selects the trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers (usually about 20) who are selected
by the Prime Minister personally. Its origins can be traced back to the informal
conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers, independently of the
Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from
an active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development of organised
political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards,
the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are1: the final determination of the policy to be sub¬
mitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with
the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co-ordination and delimitation
of the authority of Government departments. The exercise of these functions is
vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a group of party representatives, depend¬
ing for its existence upon the support of a majority in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its mem¬
bers are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose information about its
proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of Cabinet as well as of
other State papers, and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement involving
disclosure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign
through the Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet
decision is advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before the decision is
made public. From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential in the interests of
unprejudiced discussion, which can take place only if there is no risk of publicity for
every statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not sitting.
Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time, if a matter
urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet meetings decisions are
reached on major issues of Government policy, and the Cabinet settles any matters
which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
The Cabinet carries on much of its work by means of a committee system which
originated in the nineteenth century and has been developed to keep pace with
Government business during the past sixty years. The system involves the reference
of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee com¬
posed of the ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail and
either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations for
action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend Cabinet meetings when
matters affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be members
of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance of
documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and the conclusions,
are recorded; even these records have a strictly limited circulation. Responsibility
for the keeping of records lies with the Secretary of the Cabinet.

Committee), 1918, Cd. 9230.

Ministerial Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which ministers
share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual responsibility
of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the middle of
the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to act not as individuals
but (in the interests of stability of government) as a united group. It does not require
every Cabinet minister to be present at every Cabinet meeting; and the obligations of
individual ministers may be passive rather than active when the decision to be taken
does not relate to their spheres of administrative responsibility. At the same time,
every minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion beforehand, so
that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He may not repudiate,
either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have received Cabinet
approval, nor may he adopt policies that have not been agreed with the other depart¬
ments concerned (including the Treasury). A minister must also be prepared to vote
with the Government on all issues, and where necessary to speak in support or defence
of its policy; if he feels himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the
majority of his colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere he must resign. A minister who
does not resign in these circumstances cannot later reject criticism on the ground that
he did not personally agree with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is bound to
offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold identical
views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department means
that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its acts and omissions
and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any injustice to an
individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticised in Parliament, whether
he is personally responsible or not. Since the majority of ministers are members of the
House of Commons, they are available to answer questions and to defend themselves
against criticism in person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords
must be represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually their Parliamentary or Under-Secretaries.
Departmental ministers are expected to take the final decision on all matters relating
to their spheres of administration, unless these are of such political importance that
Cabinet sanction is required. If any departmental decision brings a minister under fire
of criticism in Parliament he may be upheld by the Cabinet, which will then treat the
matter as one of confidence in itself; or he may be disowned, when he alone will be
liable to lose office.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of bringing
government under public control, for the knowledge that any departmental action
may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the taking of arbitrary
and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to Government
policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may, and frequently
do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards, and government-
sponsored organisations operating under varying degrees of Government control.
48
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
As a rule a change of Government does not immediately affect the number or
general functions of Government departments, although a radical change in policy
may be accompanied by some organisational change. The widening scope of govern¬
ment activity in the past half-century has, however, led gradually to the formation of
many new departments. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, for instance the Post Office and the Board of
Customs and Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments, for
example the Ministry of Labour, cover Great Britain (England and Wales, and Scot¬
land, but not Northern Ireland); others, such as the Ministry of Health, cover England
and Wales only, and there are similar but separate departments for Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Some departments, for instance the Ministry of Education, make
special arrangements for Welsh affairs.
As a rule a department is headed by a minister. In the case of certain departments
in which questions of policy do not normally arise, the head is a permanent official,
and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament. For instance,
Treasury ministers are responsible for a number of departments, including H.M.
Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information, the Treasury Solicitor’s Depart¬
ment, the Department of the Government Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National
Debt Office, the Public Works Loan Board, and the National Savings Committee.
The staff of departments are all members of the Civil Service, a body of Crown servants
recruited into the service as a career.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their work.
Internal organisation varies from department to department since each makes its own
arrangements for discharging its duties, but certain features are common to most
departments: for example, the minister of a major department is likely to have at the
head of his officials a permanent secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary
of State in those departments where the minister is a Secretary of State), one or more
deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries.
In addition, major departments usually have a principal finance officer and a principal
establishments and organisation officer. A number of departments have their own
organisation and methods (‘O and M’) branch, the members of which act in an
advisory capacity. Many departments also have their own legal advisers or solicitors,
and their own information division.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have direct
contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Many Government departments are assisted by advisory bodies, which are of three
main kinds: consultative bodies, in which representatives of the Government meet
representatives of groups outside Government; expert bodies which formulate recom¬
mendations for action in a particular field; and bodies which have advisory status, but
in practice decide matters for themselves. The majority of these councils and com¬
mittees (of which there are several hundred) are permanent bodies attached to the
main departments; they are appointed by the relevant minister and their membership,
apart from civil servants, includes industrialists, trade unionists, university and
industrial scientists, local government officials and councillors, and experts from many
other walks of life.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies there are ad hoc committees which the
Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommendations on specific
matters. For certain important inquiries a procedure sometimes adopted is the appoint¬
ment (by Royal Warrant) of a Royal Commission, whose members are selected on the
grounds of their wide experience and diverse knowledge of the subject under con-
GOVERNMENT
49
sideration. A Royal Commission examines written and oral evidence from Government
departments and other interested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence
submits a report. The Government may accept the Commission’s recommendations
in whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action until a
later date. Public inquiries are also undertaken by departmental committees, appointed
by the head of the department concerned with the subject of the terms of reference.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the main
Government departments. Since much of their work is interconnected, they are not
grouped according to the subjects with which they deal, but are arranged in alphabetical
order, except for the Cabinet Office and the Treasury (which, in view of their central
position, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland departments (which
are grouped at the end of the section). Further information on the work undertaken
by the various departments is given in later sections of this handbook under the
relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, or Secretariat of the Cabinet, was instituted during the first
world war and has grown into an instrument of great importance in the co-ordination
of policy at the highest level. It exists primarily to assist ministers in the exercise of their
collective responsibility through the Cabinet and its committees: its functions include
the orderly arrangement of business, the recording of meetings and drafting of reports;
and it is responsible for the security of all Cabinet documents. Attached to the Cabinet
Office, and an integral part of it, is the Central Statistical Office, which is charged with
the collection from departments of statistics relating to the national economy, their
analysis, and their preparation as an agreed body of statistics to assist the Government
in formulating its economic and financial policy.
The Treasury
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First Lord
of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the Exchequer
and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never meet as a board
and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the Exchequer assisted by
the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (a Cabinet Minister) and two junior ministers,
the Financial Secretary and the Economic Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House of
Commons.
The Treasury is responsible for the co-ordination of economic policy and the control
of public expenditure; it is also responsible for the efficient management of the Civil
Service, and is involved in the management of other parts of the public service. Its
financial and economic work is divided into three functional groups dealing respectively
with: financial and monetary policy; public expenditure and resources; and co¬
ordination of economic policy. The first of these groups covers overseas finance, home
finance, aid to territories overseas, and the inter-departmental co-ordination of external
economic policy; the second deals with public income and outlay in general and with
the main items of public expenditure; and the third is concerned with the balance of the
national economy as a whole and deals with short-term economic trends, long-term
reviews of resources, problems of economic growth, and incomes policy.
On the management side, the Treasury is organised in two functional groups. The
first group is responsible for developing management services and supervising organisa¬
tion and methods of work, and includes specialised divisions concerned with recruiting,
50
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
training, manning and grading in the Civil Service; the second group comprises divisions
concerned with pay and conditions of civil servants, and a division which handles pay
questions relating to staffs in other parts of the public service.
Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel
is responsible for the drafting of all Government Bills, except those Bills or provisions
of Bills extending exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s
Department. The Office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills through Parliament;
it advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure; and it attends sittings
of both Houses of Parliament, and their committees. In addition, the Office of the
Parliamentary Counsel drafts delegated legislation when specially instructed, and
advises the Government on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling
within its special experience.
The Admiralty
The Board of Admiralty consists of a number of Lords Commissioners whose
responsibilities are, briefly, to build, direct, maintain and administer the Royal Navy
within the framework of the Government’s naval defence policy. The present Board
comprises nine members (two ministerial, six naval and one civil servant); the First
Lord is the ministerial head of the department and the other members are responsible
to him for specific duties. The Board is served by three departmental groups: (i) the
divisions of the naval staff, responsible for advising on general and technical policy,
strategy, tactics, operational planning, the disposition of the Fleet, methods of naval
warfare, and material requirements; (2) the departments responsible for advising on
personnel and material policy, for providing the men (and their training), for research
and development projects, for providing the ships (including their weapons and
equipment) and supplies, for the general organisation and administration of associated
naval establishments at home and abroad, and for stating (to the Ministry of Aviation)
naval aircraft requirements; and (3) the secretariat branches, which co-ordinate
business, provide advice on precedent and on general Government policy, supervise
the financial administration of the department, and receive, pay and account for all
money administered by the Department.
The Admiralty also administers the Royal Greenwich Observatory (now at Herst-
monceux) and the National Institute of Oceanography.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England and
Wales for administering Government policy for agriculture, horticulture and fishing.
In the operational control of certain diseases of animals its responsibilities extend to
Scotland.
In England and Wales the Ministry also deals with certain questions relating to the
supply and manufacture of food, including its composition, labelling and advertising;
its preservation and nutritional qualities; slaughterhouses; the quality and cleanliness
of milk; and the prevention of damage by pests. Ministerial responsibility for the
maintenance of reserve stocks of food extends throughout Great Britain.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign countries
interested in the United Kingdom as a market for their food exports, and is responsible
for schemes such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. It contributes to the work
of international bodies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United
Nations.
GOVERNMENT
51
Ordnance Survey Department. The Ordnance Survey is administered by the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, although it is itself responsible for its day-to-day
affairs. The department is responsible for the survey of Great Britain and the mainten¬
ance and publication of maps thereof; for drawing, printing and publishing maps and
plans from the survey on scales ranging from 1/1,250 to 1/1,250,000. It also undertakes
a considerable amount of agency work in compilation, drawing and printing for other
departments, particularly for the War Office, the Geological Survey and the Land
Registry.
The Air Ministry
The Air Ministry consists of the Air Council, which has administrative control of the
Royal Air Force (RAF) and is headed by the Secretary of State for Air, and the four
executive departments by which the council is served. These departments are: (1) the
department of the Chief of Air Staff, responsible for policy, planning and the fighting
efficiency of the RAF; advice on the conduct of operations and the issue of operational
orders; operational requirements, flying training, ground combat, navigational training;
defence, including the use of guided weapons; operational and defence research; flight
safety; (2) the department of the Air Member for Personnel, responsible for all matters
connected with the personnel of the RAF (except establishments) and technical,
command and staff training; (3) the department of the Air Member for Supply and
Organisation, responsible for internal organisation in the RAF in peace and war;
establishment of personnel, aircraft, marine craft, and mechanical transport; trans¬
portation; works and technical services; engineering; supply services; work study;
and (4) the department of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Air, responsible
for general control and co-ordination of Air Ministry procedure and the conduct of
official business; control of expenditure; establishment of Air Ministry headquarters
and outstations and all civilian staff matters; parliamentary and legal business; and the
general administration of the Meteorological Office.
The supply of airframes, aero engines, and certain other weapons and equipment
is arranged through the Ministry of Aviation and the War Office.
The Meteorological Office, for which the Secretary of State for Air is responsible,
provides the national weather service and meteorological library. It supplies the
material for sound and television forecasts and much of the weather data published by
the press. Local weather information centres have been opened in London, Glasgow,
Manchester and Southampton, from which inquirers may get facts and forecasts,
usually free of charge, covering most of the northern hemisphere. The Office is also
responsible for meteorological, climatological, and geophysical research.
The Ministry of Aviation
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for the execution of Government policy
relating to civil aviation and aircraft production. It also has a number of defence and
industrial responsibilities.
The Ministry’s civil aviation responsibilities include the regulation of flying, the
promotion of air safety and efficiency, the provision, administration and equipment of
State-controlled civil aerodromes and other ground services, the organisation of research
on, and development of, civil aircraft, the negotiation of international air transport
agreements, the registration of aircraft, the licensing of aerodromes and aircrew and
aircraft maintenance personnel, and research on air navigation. The Minister of
Aviation appoints the members of the nationalised airline corporations and deals with
52
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
various policy and financial questions covering them. He also appoints the members of
the Air Transport Licensing Board.
The Ministry’s defence responsibilities include the supply of military aircraft,
guided and ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, radar and other electronic equipment
for the fighting services; it is responsible for their design and development, and carries
out the necessary research.
The Ministry is also the department primarily responsible for carrying out Govern¬
ment policy in regard to the aircraft industry, the light metals fabricating industry and
the electronics industry (excluding telephones and telegraph equipment and electric
lamps).
The Central African Office
The Central African Office, which is concerned with the Federation of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland and with the affairs of its constituent territories, was set up in March
1962. The Office has taken over the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Relations
Office for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and for the self-governing
colony of Southern Rhodesia, and those of the Colonial Office for the protectorates
of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland; many of the services of those Departments
are, however, available to the Central African Office. Responsibility for Central
African affairs is vested in the First Secretary of State (see p. 44).
The Colonial Office
The Colonial Office is concerned with most of the dependent territories of the
United Kingdom. It does not directly administer them (since each territory has its
own administration), but until independence the British Government has final res¬
ponsibility for their good government and for their relations with other countries.
The staff of the Colonial Office advise the Secretary of State for Commonwealth
Relations and the Colonies on constitutional and other developments in the territories,
and organise the help they need. This includes advice on economic and financial
matters and defence; the provision of financial assistance under the Colonial Develop¬
ment and Welfare Acts and in other ways; the administration of certain senior staff
for the public services of the dependent territories; and the fostering of understanding
between the people of Britain and the people of the Colonies. In this work the Colonial
Office co-operates closely with other departments, particularly with the Commonwealth
Relations Office, the Foreign Office, and the Department of Technical Co-operation.
The Commonwealth Relations Office
The Commonwealth Relations Office links the United Kingdom Government with
the Governments of the other member nations of the Commonwealth.
The duties of the Office are: to advise the Secretary of State for Commonwealth
Relations and the Colonies on policy affecting the other members of the Common¬
wealth; to co-ordinate the work of the various United Kingdom departments in so
far as other Commonwealth countries are concerned; to arrange consultation with
other members of the Commonwealth on all matters of common concern; and to act
as the main channel of communication through which information is exchanged.
The Secretary of State also maintains relations with the Irish Republic which,
although no longer a member of the Commonwealth, is not treated as a foreign country.
The Board of Customs and Excise
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and administer
the customs and excise duties imposed from time to time in the annual Finance Acts
GOVERNMENT
53
or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters
connected with them. The Board is also responsible for preventing and detecting
evasion of the revenue laws, including smuggling and illicit distillation.
In addition to its revenue work, the Board undertakes a wide range of non-revenue
agency work for other departments, e.g., the enforcement of prohibitions and restric¬
tions on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods, exchange currency
control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade statistics from customs
import and export documents.
The Ministry of Defence
The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the formulation of defence policy and
the allocation of defence expenditure; it is also responsible for the execution of joint
Service operations. It co-ordinates, through the Chiefs of Staff and the Defence
Research Policy and other committees, the development of weapons and weapon
systems. The administration and day-to-day management of the armed forces is carried
out by the Service ministries.
The Ministry of Defence is also responsible for the administration of the Joint
Intelligence Bureau, the Imperial Defence College and the Joint Services Staff College
and is concerned with the United Kingdom participation in international defence
organisations.

Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Registry Office); the Scottish Record
Office; and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the direction
of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the
policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions
and needs.
The Law Officers and Legal Departments
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government on Scottish
questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation
in Scotland. The Lord Advocate, being the senior Scottish lawyer in the Government,
is also closely concerned with questions of legal policy and administration; he is himself
responsible for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in
Scotland, and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court.
In some of this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate's Depart¬
ment, the members of which also act as departmental advisers on Scottish questions
to certain Government departments who have no Scottish legal adviser of their own.
The work relevant to prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Lord Advocate is always a member of the House of Commons.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland are incorporated in the Lord Advocate’s
Department and are responsible to the minister concerned and to the Law Officers
for the drafting of all Government Bills in so far as they affect the law of Scotland.
Their responsibilities in this connection are similar to those of the Parliamentary
Counsel to the Treasury.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Executive and administrative powers in connection with matters over which the
Northern Ireland Parliament has jurisdiction are vested in the Crown, and exercised
by the Governor, acting on the advice of the Northern Ireland Cabinet, through a
number of departments. Each of the seven ministries (Agriculture, Commerce,
Education, Finance, Health and Local Government, Home Affairs, and Labour and
National Insurance) is under the control of a minister responsible to the Northern
Ireland Parliament. In addition, there are a National Assistance Board and an Ex¬
chequer and Audit Department which, together with the Ministries of Home Affairs,
Education, and Agriculture have functions indicated by their titles. The other depart¬
ments have duties of a varied nature, which are summarised below.
The Ministry of Commerce
The Ministry of Commerce is concerned with industrial information and statistical
services; the progress of industrial production and trade in Northern Ireland; the
development of existing enterprises and the attraction of new ones; and the administra¬
tion of schemes of financial assistance to industry. The department also has respon¬
sibilities in relation to electricity and gas undertakings; roads and bridges and inland
public transport; the Northern Ireland Road Fund; railways; harbours and inland
waterways; fisheries; the tourist trade; the regulation and inspection of mines and
quarries; mineral development; scientific development; weights and measures; the
registration of companies and friendly societies; and the administration of the Assurance
Companies Acts and the Industrial Assurance Acts.
GOVERNMENT
65
The Ministry of Finance
In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for matters connected with recruitment and staffing
of the Northern Ireland Civil Service; Government works services, including agency
services for certain departments of the United Kingdom Government; the preservation
of ancient monuments; valuation and ordnance survey; the Public Record Office;
the Registrar General’s Office; the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.
Other functions of the Ministry include the issue of Ulster savings certificates; the
collection of death duty, stamp duty and certain transferred excise duties; work in
connection with land purchase; statute law revision; the control of charitable donations
and bequests; the control of borrowing; and the payment of university grants. The
Office of the Parliamentary Draftsmen, which prepares Bills for introduction into
Parliament, is attached to the Ministry.
The Ministry of Health and Local Government
The Ministry of Health and Local Government is responsible for the general super¬
vision of the Health Service in Northern Ireland, which is broadly similar to the
National Health Service in Great Britain: the administration of the various aspects of
the service is in the hands of the Hospitals Authority, the General Health Services
Board, and the local health authorities. The Ministry also exercises functions under the
Housing Acts (Northern Ireland), supervising the house-building programmes of, and
distributing grants to, local housing authorities and the Northern Ireland Housing
Trust. It also supervises various other functions of local authorities, including planning,
public health, welfare, water, and sewerage services (many of which attract specific
grants-in-aid) and it controls the issue of central financial aid to local authorities.
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance is responsible for the administration
of the Factories Acts and other legislation connected with industrial health and welfare;
for the promotion in industry of joint machinery for negotiation and for assistance in
the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes; for the administration of the
Wages Councils Act; for the administration of local employment offices and training
centres and the machinery for dealing with employment questions of all kinds under
the Employment and Training Act, the Youth Employment Service Act, and the
Disabled Persons (Employment) Act; for the administration of the National Insurance
Acts and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, and of the Family Allow¬
ances Acts; and for carrying out certain statutory functions in connection with the
National Assistance scheme in conjunction with the National Assistance Board for
Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a political
or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose remuneration is
found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament. The number of civil
servants under this definition amounts to nearly a million, for it includes several
hundred thousand Government industrial employees in such establishments as Royal
Ordnance factories and Admiralty dockyards. The term ‘Civil Service’ is, however,
generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’ members of the staffs of the various
Government departments in the United Kingdom or working overseas either in the
66
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Foreign Service or for other Government departments such as the Commonwealth
Relations Office. On ist April, 1962, the total number of non-industrial civil servants
employed in all departments, at home and overseas, was 669,8001; more than one-third
(225,700) are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he serves
the minister in charge of the department in which he works, by advising on the formu¬
lation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions once they have been taken.
From time to time the minister changes but the civil servant remains to serve his
successor. In Britain changes of government do not involve changes in departmental
personnel, since it is considered that continuity makes for administrative stability.
Development of the Modern Civil Service
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years. Before
then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying standards were
unknown, there was no central supervision, and political jobbery was rife. Measures
of reform instigated during the nineteenth century included the substitution of open
competition for the practice of obtaining civil service appointments by favour or
purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, the Civil Service Com¬
mission, to organise recruitment to the service. The great expansion in State activity
which has taken place during the last fifty years, and the consequent expansion in the
numbers of civil servants and the scope of their duties, have led to further reorganisa¬
tion: recruitment competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system;
co-ordination between the various departments has been improved; and many
commissions and committees of inquiry have been appointed by the Government to
make recommendations for increased efficiency in the conduct of public business.
Moreover, civil servants, though they remain employees of their departments, have
become members of an integrated service with common conditions of employment
and common traditions and standards of conduct which belong, not to individual
departments, but to the Civil Service as a whole.
Control of the Service
Uniformity in the Civil Service derives mainly from the fact that the Treasury
exercises general control. One of the two Joint Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury
is the official head of the Home Civil Service and the principal adviser of the Prime
Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service as a whole, and in particular on appoint¬
ments to senior posts in the service. The Treasury is responsible for the salaries and
conditions of employment of civil servants; it controls total number of staff and the
creation of higher posts, maintains a central organisation and methods division which
serves all departments which do not maintain an organisation and methods branch of
their own, and deals with general questions relating to training after entry into the
Civil Service. It is also concerned with the number of departments and the distribution
of functions.
Civil Service Classes
Because modern government touches almost every aspect of life, the Civil Service
comprises officers with a wide variety of professional and technical qualifications.
Where officers of a particular type are required in more than one department they are
organised in general service or linked departmental classes. This ensures similar
1 Including part-time staffs—two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent to one
whole-time officer.
GOVERNMENT 67
grading and salary structures for the same type of officer in each department. The
main classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising ministers on policy,
for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out existing policy
and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures and regulations. This
relatively small class, which numbers about 2,550, is recruited largely from
university graduates.
2. The Executive Class (numbering some 73,000), which is responsible for the
day-to-day conduct of Government business, including the higher work of
supply and accounts, within the framework of established policy. Members of
this class may, after entry, train for specialist work such as that of auditor,
actuary or statistician.
3. The Specialist Classes, which number about 110,000 in a variety of different
categories for carrying out the wide range of specialised activities which are
now undertaken by the Government. These categories include accountants,
architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers, surveyors and scientists in all branches
of science. The professionally qualified staff are assisted by a large number of
technical and drawing office staffs.
4. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about 126,000
officers), which undertakes all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business, e.g., the preparation of accounts and the keeping of
records, the handling of particular claims in accordance with known rules, and
the summarising and annotation of documents for the assistance of senior
officers.
5. The Ajicillary Clerical Classes (with some 106,000 members), which include
clerical assistants, shorthand typists and typists, duplicator operators and a
rapidly increasing number of machine-operating grades.
6. Messengerial and Minor Classes (with some 34,000 members) which, in addition
to messengers, include paper keepers, office cleaners and similar workers.
In addition there are departmental classes where employment is peculiar to one
department. The main example is the Post Office with its postmen (112,000), telephone
operators (56,000), postal and telegraph officers (22,000) and a wide range of staff for
the installation, maintenance and development of the telephone, telegraph and wireless
systems. Other examples are the Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and
the Schools Inspectorate of the Ministry of Education.
The Northern Ireland Civil Service
The Government of Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals with
matters transferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.
Subject to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service is modelled on its
counterpart in Great Britain, but recruitment to permanent and pensionable posts is
effected through the medium of a separate Civil Service Commission. Interchange of
staff between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for
departmental agreement in individual cases.
The Foreign Service
Her Majesty’s Foreign Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides an interchangeable staff (numbering about 4,000, some of whom are
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unestablished) for service both at home and at United Kingdom diplomatic missions
and consular posts in foreign countries.1
The classes of the Foreign Service have their own nomenclature: Branch A corre¬
sponds roughly to the administrative class of the Home Civil Service; Branch B to the
executive and clerical classes; and Branch C to the typing class. Branch D carries
out security and guard duties at Foreign Service posts abroad, and Branch T technical
duties in the Foreign Office and at Foreign Service posts abroad. There are no equiva¬
lents of Branches D and T in the Home Civil Service. Members of Branches A, B
and C may be employed on any type of Foreign Service work—diplomatic, consular,
commercial and ‘information’. In addition, various specialists and advisers who are
seconded from the armed forces and from home Government departments (e.g.,
those concerned with financial, commeryial or labour matters) are often attached to
overseas posts. At many posts abroad some of the staff are locally engaged on a
‘temporary’ basis, i.e. they do not normally qualify for pensions.
Public Services of Overseas Dependent Territories
Overseas governments fill vacancies in their public services by the appointment of
suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but because not all vacancies can
be filled in this way, the Department of Technical Co-operation and the Crown Agents
for Oversea Governments and Administrations are asked to recruit other candidates,
principally from the United Kingdom.
Recruitment of Staff
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants in the Home Civil and Foreign
Services is in the hands of the Civil Service Commission which, in the selection of
entrants, is independent of both ministerial and parliamentary control; its members
are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Government. The normal method of
entry is by open competition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by
the Treasury and consisting of written examinations or interviews, or both. The
main points of entry into the main classes of the Home Civil Service are planned to
correspond to definite levels in the British educational system, and it is the Com¬
mission’s duty to study the requirements of the Civil Service in the light of the
education provided by the schools and universities.
Temporary civil servants, who do not qualify for pensions but are eligible for
gratuities, are normally recruited by the department concerned. No qualifying
examinations are required for entrance on a temporary basis to the general service.
Training after Entry
Each of the larger Government departments has a training officer and a number
of instructors, who organise both general and technical courses, ranging from courses of
systematic instruction for recruits in all classes to ‘refresher’ courses covering
technical subjects or broader subjects such as management and supervision for more
experienced staff.
Methods of training include discussion groups, case studies, instructional films,
and educational visits to enable civil servants to study the working of appropriate
outside bodies. Officers in the early years of their service may be transferred from
branch to branch and, more rarely, from department to department, in order that they

normally staffed from the Commonwealth Relations Office and (in respect of the Trade Commis¬
sioners’ Offices associated with them) from the Board of Trade.
GOVERNMENT
69
may gain as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service activities, and there are
openings for selected officers to travel abroad or to study at universities and other
educational establishments. Special facilities are also available for officers who take up
private studies, the degree of assistance depending upon the vocational value of the
subject.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division of the Treasury,
which also runs central courses for members of the administrative, professional and
scientific classes at different stages of their careers. In addition, the division trains
departmental instructors and other special groups, for instance, superintendents of
typists, audio-typists, and secretaries.
Promotion
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with exten¬
sions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent Civil
Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments; those from class to
class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open only to serving members
of specified Civil Service classes), and partly by departments themselves. All promotions
to the administrative class from other classes require Treasury approval. Promotions
to most of the highest positions in the Civil Service, i.e. permanent secretary, deputy
secretary, principal establishments officer and principal finance officer, must be
approved by the Prime Minister; he is advised in these matters by the official head of
the Home Civil Service.
Conditions of Service
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council,1 which is composed jointly of
official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections of the
service is provided through the various staff associations which civil servants are
encouraged to join (e.g., the Civil Service Clerical Association, the Union of Post
Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants), and through depart¬
mental Whitley Councils (of which there are about 70).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is intended to compare fairly
with that paid for similar work outside the service, and usually he receives annual
increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to which he belongs. In addi¬
tion, although a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of the Crown and may there¬
fore be dismissed at any time, in practice he enjoys a considerable measure of security
of tenure. Thus every permanent civil servant may reasonably expect a full career in the
public service, and a pension on retirement—though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘conditioned’ to a given number of hours of attendance
a week. Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary groups if they work
longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard working week for office staffs is
42 hours in London and 44 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies according to
grade up to a maximum of six weeks, i.e. 30 working days, a year. Sick leave on full
pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be granted to permanent civil

managements and staffs; the councils are named after Mr. J. H. Whitley, former Speaker of the
House of Commons and chairman of a committee which investigated industrial unrest from
1916 to 1919.

servants for up to six months in any twelve months, and on reduced pay up to a
maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Political and Private Activities
Officially, the position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which a civil servant, as a
private individual, is free to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are completely
free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities (although if they
intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their appointment before nomination
day1); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the need for discretion and with
the permission of the department, to take part in most activities except parliamentary
candidature; and those who are debarred from national political activities though they
may seek permission to take part in local government and political activities in the
local field. In the non-industrial Civil Service, the completely free groups are the
manipulative grades of the Post Office, and the minor grades such as cleaners and
messengers. The intermediate group comprises those who have standing permission
to engage in politics (other than parliamentary candidature) and those who must seek
permission from their department. The group includes mainly clerical and typing
grades, and the granting of permission depends, broadly, on the work that they do.
The group which is not allowed to take part in national political activities includes the
executive, the professional, the scientific and technical, and the administrative grades.
In general, because the reputation of the service must be closely guarded, permission
to take part in local political activities will be refused to members of this group if the
local activities are conducted on the same party lines and through the same party
organisations as national political activities. Where permission is granted, it is subject
to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the department of election or
co-option to a local council.
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all citizens to
register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions, for instance, at general
elections or at local authority elections.
The private political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of
official concern, but there are duties in which secrecy is so vitally important to State
security that the Government does not feel itself justified in employing any one to
carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this reason no one who is known to be
a member of, or actively associated or in sympathy with, the Communist Party or with
Fascist organisations is employed in connection with secret work. Otherwise, every
civil servant may engage in such private activities as he wishes, provided that these
do not in any way conflict with his official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1906. A civil
servant must not, however, use his official position to further his private interest;
and he is therefore subject to restrictions in matters of commerce and business from
which the ordinary citizen is free, e.g., he may not hold private interests in public
contracts; and he may not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing
without the express approval of his department. Above all, a civil servant is expected
to conform to the high standards of integrity which characterise the service to which
he belongs.
1 Any civil servant not elected will be reinstated in his previous capacity on application within
a week of the declaration of an election result.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has been defined as government by popularly elected bodies
charged with administrative and executive duties in matters concerning the inhabitants
of a particular district or place and vested with powers to make by-laws1 for their
guidance.
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape it dates back to the late
nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive system of locally elected
councils to manage various services provided for the benefit of the community was first
incorporated in statute law. The large increase in population since that time, and the
equally massive transformation in the range, complexity and scale of local authority
functions, have made it necessary to review local government throughout England and
Wales, and proposals have been made in some areas (see p. 78) for a new structure
more closely related to contemporary and possible future needs.
Relationship between Central and Local Government
As the supreme authority in the United Kingdom, Parliament controls local
authorities through Acts of Parliament, which require or permit elected local councils
to implement policies prescribed and defined in those Acts. The scope of local govern¬
ment is limited by the same means; no council may go beyond the bounds fixed for its
activities by an Act of Parliament.
Legislation is supported by departmental supervision: Parliament makes certain
ministers responsible for securing the efficient functioning of local government
services. Departmental supervision is exercised by means of inspections, inquiries,
examinations of statistics, authorisation of loans, the issue of advisory circulars and
statutory instruments, the approval of by-laws, and the administration of Exchequer
grants. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England and Wales; in Scotland the
Scottish Development Department is responsible for general policy in regard to local
government; and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
Principal Types of Local Authority
For purposes of local government, England and Wales and Northern Ireland are
divided into county boroughs and administrative counties. Administrative counties
(outside London) are further divided into three types of county district: non-county
boroughs; urban districts; and rural districts. Rural districts are themselves sub¬
divided into parishes (except in Northern Ireland). Scotland is divided into counties
(including four counties of cities) which are independently administered; large and
small burghs; and districts. Each local authority division is administered by a different
council, as follows:
England and Wales2 3
county councils (61)
county borough councils (83)
non-county borough councils (318)
urban district councils (564)
rural district councils (474)®

parish meetings (some 3,300).

town councils (198, consisting of: the authorities for counties of cities, 4; other

district councils (199: two counties are not divided into districts).
There are, in addition, the local authorities for London, which are unlike those in the
rest of the United Kingdom. They are:
the London County Council
the Corporation of the City of London
metropolitan borough councils (28).
Constitution and Election of Councils
Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some cases,
aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who has varied
ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work on the council. In
most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern Ireland the chairman is the
Mayor; in the City of London and certain important boroughs, the Lord Mayor;
in the Scottish counties, the Convener; and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government
is three years; aldermen hold office for six years. In some local authority areas the
whole council retires every third year and another is elected immediately; in other
areas elections are held annually, when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure
at local government elections is governed by rules laid down by the Representation
of the People Act, 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at a
local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age or over on the
qualifying date, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not subject
to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for the area for
which the election is held. In Great Britain a person qualifies for registration as a local
government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annually), he
or she is resident in the area or occupies as owner or tenant any rateable land or
premises in the area of a yearly value of not less than £10. In Northern Ireland, in
order to qualify for registration as a local government elector a person must have been
born in Northern Ireland, or alternatively, have resided continuously in the United
Kingdom for seven years immediately prior to the qualifying date and must have either
a resident occupier’s qualification, or a general occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned, and under
the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the purpose. The procedure for
local government voting in Great Britain is similar to that for parliamentary elections,
although facilities for postal voting are more restricted.
Every candidate for election as a councillor stands either as a representative of one
of the national political parties, or as a member of an association representing some
local interest, or as an independent. Each must be nominated by two electors, as
GOVERNMENT
73
proposer and seconder; and in England and Wales (except in elections for metropolitan
borough councils, rural district councils and parish councils) eight other electors for
the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland each county and district council
candidate requires two proposers and each town council candidate a proposer and five
assenters. Candidates must be of British nationality, over 21 years of age, and must (1)
be registered as local government electors in the register of electors for the area for
which they seek election, or (2) have resided within that area during the whole of the
twelve months preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils),
or (3) in England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the area. Candidates are
also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuit¬
able persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by electoral
regulations made by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland. These
regulations are, in general, similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though differ¬
ing in certain particulars; for example, the town clerk or the clerk to the council is
the returning officer for all elections to the authority; there is no postal voting and
the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
Just as Great Britain as a whole is divided into constituencies for the purpose of
parliamentary elections, so, for local council elections, most local authority areas
are divided into electoral districts. Administrative counties are split up, in accordance
with orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Minister of
Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland, into ‘electoral
divisions’. Boroughs, urban districts and rural districts in England and Wales, and
burghs in Scotland, are either divided into ‘wards’, or, if they are small, left as single
units. In rural districts the wards are based on parishes which, if large enough, may
themselves be split into parish wards.
Outside London, county divisions each return one member. The LCC electoral
divisions (which cover the same areas as the London parliamentary constituencies)
return three members each; in other types of local authority area each ward may return
one or more members.
Functions and Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
environmental and social services as Acts of Parliament require it to provide and
administer. It may provide additional services under the permissive powers of a
general Act or under powers granted to it by Adoptive Acts or by local or Private Bill
legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows: in
England (outside the County of London) and Wales county borough councils are
all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county district councils have
particular functions allotted to them1, which they exercise independently to a
considerable extent, although there is a certain degree of delegation from county
councils to county district councils, especially of duties connected with town and
country planning and the education, health and welfare services. Parish councils or
parish meetings have a few functions which they may exercise of right. In Scotland the
town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities; elsewhere, the county
councils, the town councils and the district councils all share in local government work.
1 For instance, county councils are generally responsible for the police, fire and civil defence
services, while the district councils administer most of the environmental and sanitary services.
74
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Northern Ireland the position is broadly similar to that in England and Wales, but
the local authorities are not called upon to provide or administer police, civil defence
or (except in Belfast) fire services; and county councils do not in general delegate any
of their functions to county district councils.
The broad principle underlying the distribution of powers and duties between the
London County Council (LCC) and the metropolitan borough councils is that all those
powers and duties which require uniformity of action throughout the whole of London
should be administered by the LCC, while those that can be locally managed should be
vested in the borough councils. In the City of London (an area of approximately one
square mile in the centre of the metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general
powers administered and duties performed by the metropolitan borough councils, and
also a number of functions which, in the rest of London, devolve on the LCC. The City
Corporation is not, however, an all-purpose authority, since certain services in the
City (for instance, education) are administered by the LCC.
Local authority services are generally classified under three heads: environmental,
protective and personal. The environmental services are designed to secure and main¬
tain satisfactory standards in the citizens’ surroundings, and include the inspection and
abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing, refuse collection and
disposal, litter control, rodent control, the supervision of water supplies, measures for
ensuring food hygiene and for preventing air pollution, and the provision of baths and
washhouses. They also include the services for bridge and highway construction and
maintenance, for street lighting, public safety on the roads, the provision of amenities,
and town and country planning. The protective services are the fire service, the civil
defence service and the police service, while the personal services range from health
services, education and housing to the provision of entertainment.
Local services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the provision of
ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some residential and day nurseries;
the provision and supervision of midwifery services, health visitors and home nursing
facilities; measures for the prevention of illness and the aftercare of physically or
mentally sick persons; the provision of domestic help where necessary; the ambulance
service; the provision of facilities for vaccination and immunisation against certain
infectious diseases; and the services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for
the aged and infirm and for children deprived of a normal home life. Education and
culture are promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types of schools;
by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical colleges; by the award
of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds; and by the provision of libraries,
art galleries and museums. Local authorities provide living accommodation by building
new houses or by acquiring and converting suitable existing ones. Most houses owned
by local authorities are for letting, but they may, in certain cases, be offered for sale.
Councils may also make loans to persons wishing to buy privately owned houses; and
they are responsible for ensuring that houses unfit for human habitation are demolished
or closed.
Some local authorities also engage in trading services, such as passenger transport,
water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services, but to a lesser extent than in the past.
The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller information is
given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters of this book.
Internal Organisation of Local Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own internal
arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they will discharge
GOVERNMENT
75
their responsibilities. Questions of policy and principle are usually decided by the
whole council, which appoints committees to carry out the detailed administration of
its various services. The more important of the committees of the larger authorities
divide their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee in a
relation similar to that of the main committees to the whole council. The execution
of the policy decided upon by the council and the committees rests with salaried officers
and employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small rural
district to several thousands in the large counties and in the larger county boroughs
and burghs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of specialists
on committees and the length of time certain members may hold office, committees
of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those known as ‘statutory’ committees
are constituted according to individual requirements and not according to any set
pattern laid down. For purposes of classification, however, they may be divided into
two kinds: ordinary committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be
further divided into statutory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; standing committees, which are appointed in accordance
with the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis according to the extent
of the council’s business; and special committees, which a council may set up for a
limited period to deal with a particular problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than one authority.
They are usually established for services that can be more effectively administered
over a wider area than that controlled by a single council, e.g., town and country
planning, water supplies and the police service.
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers and
duties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders or, in the
case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s administrative scheme.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in connection
with raising loans, levying rates, or raising precepts (financial demands) which are
legally reserved to the council as a whole.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and of some
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the council
resolve that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to the public interest.
Officers and Employees
Generally speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as they deem
necessary for carrying out their work, although certain posts (for instance, the clerk,
the treasurer, and the medical officer of health) are compulsory in almost all councils.
Choice of personnel is also left to a great extent to the individual council; in theory,
the appointment of certain chief officers is subject to some central control but, in
practice, the nominee of the council is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, officers are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief officers,
whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind; subordinate
officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers
who are employed to do the physical work for which the council is responsible. Senior
staff appointments are usually made at the instance of the committee or committees
particularly concerned; most junior appointments are made by heads of departments,
who are also responsible for engaging the manual labour required. Appointments and
engagements are always made in conformity with a set establishment and committees
are informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
76
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the jurisdic¬
tion of the employing council (except where the proposed salary of an officer requires
the approval of a Government department, as in the case of the clerk of a county
council in England and Wales). They are based on recommendations made by the
Whitley Councils, of which there are several, including the National Joint Council
for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical Services,
the National Joint Industrial Council for Local Authorities’ Non-Trading Services
(Manual Workers), the National Joint Council for County Council Roadmen, and, in
Scotland, the Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities
(Scotland) and the Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In England
and Wales conditions of service and salary scales for senior local government
officers are determined by special negotiating machinery. The local government
service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating machinery at various
levels.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of conduct;
as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must be beyond the
reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
Local Government Finance
Local authority income derives from Exchequer grants (paid in Northern Ireland
by the Government of Northern Ireland), from local rates, from loans, from trading
receipts, rents, fees and other miscellaneous sources.
Government grants finance about one-third of local authorities’ net expenditure.
The largest single grant is the general grant which is paid in aid of local revenues
by the Minister of Housing and Local Government to county and county borough
councils in England and Wales, and by the Secretary of State for Scotland to county
and town councils in Scotland. The total grant is fixed in advance for a period of two
or more years and allocated among the authorities according to a formula based mainly
on such factors as size and distribution of population and numbers of school children.
In fixing the amount the Government takes into consideration the current rate of
expenditure on the services concerned, any probable fluctuation in the demand for
those services, the need for developing services, and the extent to which, having regard
to the state of the national economy, it is reasonable to develop them. If, during any grant
period, an unforeseen rise in the general level of prices, costs or remuneration occurs
and its effect on the cost of providing the services covered is so great that it is felt that
the increase ought not to fall entirely on local authorities, the ministers concerned are
empowered to adjust the amount of the grant. They also have power to reduce the
allocation of any authority (subject to parliamentary confirmation) if they are satisfied
that that authority has failed to achieve or maintain services of reasonable standards
compared with those provided in other areas. In Northern Ireland, instead of the general
grant, there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific services (for example,
education, roads, housing, health and welfare, water supplies and sewerage), supple¬
mented by a general Exchequer contribution which compensates for derating and
takes account of the needs and resources of individual authorities.
Other government grants are: percentage grants, of which the two principal
examples are those for the police service and highways; unit grants, for instance,
housing subsidies; rate deficiency grants (Exchequer equalisation grants in Scotland),
which are contributions to the general revenues of the poorer local authorities to enable
them to bring their services up to a higher level of efficiency; and assigned revenues,
which are the proceeds of certain national taxes handed over to local authorities, such
GOVERNMENT 77
as game and gun licences and licences for hawkers, pawnbrokers, money-lenders and
refreshment houses and, except in Scotland, dog licences.
Rates, which are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers of land and buildings
as contributions to the cost of local services, provide about one-third of the total
income of local authorities. They are levied by a poundage on the rateable value of
property, which in England and Wales is equivalent to the rent which the property
might reasonably be expected to command if let from year to year with the tenant
bearing the rates and the cost of insurance and repairs. Valuation for rating is under¬
taken by valuation officers of the Board of Inland Revenue, who prepare valuation
lists every five years for each rating area. New valuation lists are due to come into force
during 1963 when, except in Northern Ireland, rates for domestic property will be
based, generally, on current rental values and industry and freight transport will be
fully rated.
Appeals from valuation may be made to local valuation courts, each consisting of
three members of an independent local valuation panel, and thereafter to the Lands
Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation on a basis similar to that in England and Wales came into
force in 1961; formerly, it had been based, primarily, on the rent actually payable.
Valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and counties
of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of each valuation area and there¬
after to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation
Advisory Council has been established by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In
Northern Ireland the valuation authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose
department is part of the Ministry of Finance. The basis of valuation is broadly
similar to that of England and Wales, except that industry and freight transport are
rated at a quarter of their net annual value.
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales lies
with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London, with the City
Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. County councils finance them¬
selves by issuing a precept on the county districts (in London the metropolitan
borough councils and the City Corporation) for the sums of money required; parishes
are financed by rates levied by the appropriate rural district council on property within
the parish as an addition to the general rates. Rates in Scotland are levied by the town
councils in burghs and by county councils elsewhere; to cover their expenditure,
district councils issue a requisition each year to the county council; a town council
has to meet an annual requisition from the county council in respect of the burgh’s
share of the expenditure on functions exercised by the county council throughout the
county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland county councils are responsible
for making, levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts of the county as
fall within the jurisdiction of the county borough, borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for financing capital expenditure,
subject to the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the
Secretary of State for Scotland, who are guided by the recommendations of the Govern¬
ment department responsible for the service for which the capital is required. In
Northern Ireland the Government department responsible for the service also issues
the appropriate loan approvals. Borrowing powers for specific purposes are sometimes
included among the provisions of local Acts; the London County Council seeks
parliamentary sanction every year to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure.
Loans may be raised by issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange, by internal borrow¬
ing, by private mortgage, or from the Public Works Loan Board which is financed
?8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by the Exchequer and acts as lender of last resort to local authorities which cannot
borrow on reasonable terms on the market.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned by a
finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of the council
under constant review. In England and Wales an external audit is carried out (except
for certain general accounts in most of the county borough and about two-thirds of
the borough councils) by district auditors appointed by the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government. County borough and borough councils must use the services of
the district auditor for accounts which relate to education, national assistance, children,
local health services, coast protection, motor tax, rate collection, fire, civil defence and
town and country planning, but they may employ other auditors to do the remaining
work. In Scotland all accounts are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the
Secretary of State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern
Ireland by special local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of Health and
Local Government.
Proposals for Reform
In the seventy years since the existing local government structure was set up, the
population of England and Wales has grown by nearly 14 million, the greatest con¬
centration of people being in the London area and the six other conurbations of
England (see p. 17). At the same time, the number and scope of local authority
activities have progressively increased: local authorities are nowadays responsible not
only for most of the environmental and personal welfare services, but also for important
functions in relation to a number of services of nation-wide concern.
In contrast to all this, the basis of local government has remained virtually unchanged.
In some areas, and more especially in those with a high density of industry and popula¬
tion, developments have inevitably led to some confusion and loss of efficiency, since
the structure is no longer in balance with the work that modern councils have to do.
For this reason a Royal Commission was appointed in 1957 to study the problems of
local government in Greater London. Shortly afterwards two Local Government
Commissions were established to carry out a similar function for England and for
Wales respectively, though working in a different way.
The proposals of the Royal Commission on Greater London1 were published in
i960; the main recommendation was that the primary units of local government in the
area should be Greater London boroughs with a population range of 100,000 to
250,000, and that there should be a Council for Greater London (which should
supersede the existing county councils in the area) to exercise those functions which
could not be effectively exercised by individual boroughs. This was accepted as the
basis of reorganisation in a White Paper2, published in 1961, in which the Government
broadly endorsed the Commission’s overall design although it considered that larger
(and therefore fewer) boroughs would be better equipped to carry out the important
duties with which they would be charged. It is the aim of the Government to introduce
legislation in time for the new authorities to take over in the spring of 1965, but there
is to be prior consultation between Government departments and local authorities
upon many matters, and further study will be necessary before the Government is
in a position to set out detailed proposals on the financial aspect of the changes proposed.
The Local Government Commission for England, which is investigating the
circumstances of local government in the counties and county boroughs (outside

GOVERNMENT

Greater London) and in special review areas (Tyneside, West Yorkshire, South-East
Lancashire, Merseyside and the West Midlands) has published final reports on three
review areas, and provisional proposals for a further three. Draft proposals for Wales
have been published by the Local Government Commission for Wales. Before making
their proposals (which, in general, envisage substantially larger and therefore fewer
administrative units), the Commissions are required to consult the local authorities
concerned and other interested bodies or persons. The final reports have to be sub¬
mitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government and cannot be put into effect
(with or without modifications) except by order of the Minister, which must be laid
before Parliament with the Commission’s report.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a measure
of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England and Wales) and the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in Northern Ireland are controlled
by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority,
which are responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United
Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
FIRE SERVICES IN GREAT BRITAIN
There are 135 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and 11 in Scotland.
Fire Authorities
In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act, 1947, separate fire brigades
are administered by the county or county borough councils, which are the fire authori¬
ties for their areas and have powers and duties which they exercise either separately or
as combined authorities where neighbouring councils care to make such arrangements
in the interests of the efficiency of the service. The London County Council is in direct
control of the London Fire Brigade. In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in
eleven areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the town
council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered by a joint
committee representative of the councils of the counties and large burghs in the area.
Central Control
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are empowered to
make regulations prescribing such matters as the maintenance of discipline, training,
and pensions in local fire brigades, and their approval is necessary for certain reductions
in establishment schemes. In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding
discipline and similar matters), each minister is advised by the appropriate Central
Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the local authority
associations, representatives of the chief officers (firemasters in Scotland) and other
members of the brigades, and other persons having special qualifications. The advisory
councils are not concerned with the conditions of service of members of the brigades;
on these subjects the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in
Great Britain and the National Joint Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’
Fire Brigades in Great Britain are the negotiating bodies.
Central control is also exercised through the inspectors of fire services, whose
duties include advising the ministers on technical matters.
8o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Establishment Schemes
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and location
of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered necessary for the
provision of an all-over cover of its area. Establishments vary considerably according
to the fire risks in the area concerned and are not always up to strength, but in the
whole of England and Wales there are about 21,000 whole-time and 14,200 part-time
firemen, operating more than 3,500 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable
ladders, water tenders, and emergency and salvage tenders) housed in some 1,600 fire
stations. In Scotland there are approximately 2,300 whole-time and 2,600 part-time
firemen, 600 fire-fighting appliances, and 320 fire stations.
It is the duty of each fire authority to purchase such vehicles and equipment as are
required under the establishment scheme. Equipment is standardised, and appliances
are bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications, which ensure that essential
standards are maintained and yet allow sufficient freedom of design to meet local
requirements.
Operational Methods
Each fire authority is required to appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the head administrative and executive officer for its fire services. The appointment
must be ratified by the Home Secretary or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The chief fire officer or firemaster is responsible to the fire authority for seeing that
both the fire brigade and the fire department (which is the administrative centre and
staff headquarters for the fire brigade) are organised and managed in accordance with
policy laid down.
There is a central headquarters for operational control, which is exercised on a local
basis by divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which most areas
are divided. Each divisional officer has at his disposal a small staff of whole-time, and a
varying number of part-time, officers and men; and he is responsible for mobilising
this force in the strength necessary for dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division.
Constant communication is maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters,
and if at any time an outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional
force, help is sent from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from the
area of another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire
authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless of area
boundaries.
In England and Wales the average number of fire calls a year totals about 250,000,
including false alarms and special service calls for such purposes as rescuing persons
and animals trapped in dangerous situations, dealing with crashed aircraft, and
pumping and salvage operations. Some 500 people are rescued each year through fire
service operations. In Scotland the average number of fire calls a year, including false
alarms and special services, is 28,000, and the average number of persons rescued from
fires and other occurrences each year is 200.
Firemen
About two-thirds of the total number of firemen work on a whole-time basis. The
part-time firemen include: retained firemen who, in return for a retaining fee, under¬
take to attend fires if called upon; volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration;
and auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as members of individual fire brigades but with
restricted duties. In addition, there are the fire-fighting organisations outside the
GOVERNMENT
8l
national service, for example, those maintained by the Admiralty, the War Office, the
Air Ministry, the Ministry of Aviation, and by some large industrial and commercial
concerns.
Ranks in the fire services (for men) are chief fire officer, assistant chief fire officer
(firemaster and assistant firemaster in Scotland), divisional officer, assistant divisional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman, and fireman. Ranks in the women’s
branch, which is mainly concerned with controls and with administrative and clerical
duties are (for Great Britain as a whole) group officer, assistant group officer, senior
leading firewoman, leading firewoman, and firewoman. Promotion in the lower ranks
of the fire-fighting forces is by examination and by merit, and in the higher ranks by
merit only.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive practical
training in basic firemanship at training schools run by fire authorities and refresher
courses arranged by fire departments. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a
central training school which is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health
Department. Advanced and specialised training courses, including fire prevention
courses, are provided for the higher ranks at the Fire Service College, Wotton House,
near Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home and Health Department as the central training institution for the fire services.
The Home Office Fire Service Department arranges facilities for properly accredited
officers from overseas fire services to study the organisation, current training methods,
appliances and equipment of the British fire brigades.
Finance
The fire authorities bear the cost of maintaining the fire service. There is an
Exchequer contribution which is included in the aggregate amount of the general
grant. For the purpose of arriving at the amount of this contribution, the Government
receives from fire authorities (at the time when the grant is to be considered) details
of the last known actual expenditure for a year, together with estimates for the im¬
pending general grant period.
Research
Research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire-fighting, and in particular into
the relationship between the fire-fighter, the availability of fire equipment and fire
losses, is undertaken mainly by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under the
direction of the Fire Research Board. The costs of the organisation are shared equally
between the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the fire insurance
companies who, jointly, nominate the members of the Fire Research Board. The
organisation operates from a fire research station at which practical tests are carried
out. Problems of fire protection are also studied by the Fire Protection Association,
established by the Fire Officers’ Committee1 as the national advisory centre for
industry and the general public on the protection of life and property against fire.
FIRE SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade and
is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
1 The Fire Officers’ Committee is representative of some, but not all, of the fire insurance
companies in Britain.
82
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an establishment
of 225 officers and men manning 13 appliances, while the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry and 44 other stations through¬
out the remainder of the area, and an establishment of 113 whole-time officers and men
and 700 part-time firemen, manning 72 appliances.
Ranks of Firemen
The ranks of firemen in Northern Ireland are: for the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority—fire force commander, deputy fire force commander, divisional officer,
assistant divisional officer, senior company officer, company officer, cadet officer,
section leader, leading fireman, and fireman; and for the Belfast Fire Brigade—chief
officer, assistant chief officer, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer, station officer,
sub-officer, leading fireman, and fireman. There are only a few women in the Northern
Ireland Fire Service, all of the rank of firewoman.
Finance
The Fire Services (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1956, provides that the
amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire Authority should be
50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure which do not exceed
£60,000 and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which the loan charges exceed
.£60,000, together with 50 per cent of the first £150,000 of other net expenditure and
25 per cent of the excess over that amount. Expenditure in excess of the fire service
grant is apportioned among the local authorities liable to contribute to the funds of
the Authority. Under the Fire Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify
for the payment of fire service grant.
3
LAW AND ORDER
THE LAW
In the United Kingdom the maintenance of public order depends on the obedience
which the public accord to the law. Individuals obey the law out of a sense of private
conviction or public duty, or, in the last resort, because they know that if they fail to do
so they will be penalised by the authorities of the State. On the other hand, the use
of penal measures by State authorities must be, and in fact is, confined to what the
law allows.
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single body of
law applicable universally within its limits; and in England and Wales, Northern
Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, separate systems are in force (see p. 25). There
are, however, similarities between the systems. As between England and Wales on
the one hand and Northern Ireland on the other the similarity is general, due to the
closeness of the association between these countries since the twelfth century. As
between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom the differences are more
extensive, although the existence, during the past 250 years, of a common Parliament,
a common public opinion on broader issues, and a common court of appeal for civil
cases has resulted in substantial identity at many points.
A feature which is common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom
(and differentiates them from some continental systems) is that there is no complete
code. The sources of law in all the systems include statutes dealing with particular
subjects, and a large amount of unwritten or ‘common’ law, which can be gathered
from numerous decisions of the courts and from other sources.
The common law of England originated in the customs of the realm and was built
up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law, known as ‘equity’,
came into being during the Middle Ages to provide and enforce more effective protec¬
tion for existing legal rights. It was administered by a separate court and later became
a separate body of legal rules. In 1873 the courts of equity were fused with the courts
of common law, so that all courts now apply both systems, but where they conflict,
equity prevails.
In Scotland the basis of the modern common law is embodied in the writings of
certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century lawyers of great repute
who, between them, described systematically almost the whole field of private and
criminal law as existing in their times. Broadly speaking, the principles enunciated
by these lawyers, together with the many judicial decisions which have followed and
developed those principles, form the body of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has
never had a separate system of equity—equitable principles having always permeated
the ordinary rules of law.
Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate legislation
made under powers conferred by Parliament. It is absolutely binding on all courts
of the United Kingdom, taking precedence over any other source of law.
83
84
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Another feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the distinc¬
tion made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal law is concerned with
wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law is concerned with the rights,
duties and obligations of individual members of the community between themselves.
CRIMINAL LAW IN ENGLAND AND WALES
Criminal Courts
The courts of ordinary criminal jurisdiction in England and Wales include:
magistrates’ courts, which try the less serious offences and conduct preliminary
inquiries into the more serious offences; courts of quarter sessions, which try most
of the more serious offences; and courts of assize (including the Central Criminal
Court in London and the Crown Courts in Liverpool and Manchester) which try the
gravest offences and cases of special difficulty. All trials at quarter sessions and
assizes are conducted with a jury (see p. 97).
Magistrates' Courts
Most magistrates’ courts consist of two to seven lay magistrates who are unpaid
and do not normally possess any legal qualifications but obtain advice on points of
law, when required, from the clerk to the justices. In central London, however, and
some of the other larger cities, there are also paid, or ‘stipendiary’ magistrates, who
are professional lawyers; they usually sit alone. The great majority of offences (over
97 per cent) committed in England and Wales are disposed of in magistrates’ courts.
Specially qualified magistrates sit in juvenile courts to hear cases involving young
persons under 17 years of age who are charged with any offence except homicide or
are brought before the court as being in need of care and protection, as beyond control,
or as persistent truants. These courts also deal with many applications for the adoption
of children. Consisting of not more than three justices (normally including at least one
man and one woman), they sit either in different rooms or buildings from those in
which other courts are sitting, or on a different day; only persons within certain
specified categories are admitted and only limited publicity is allowed.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of whom one
should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic proceedings is separated
from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the public is excluded.
Quarter Sessions
Courts of quarter sessions sit at least four times a year; in the busier places, they
meet much more frequently than this.
All counties have courts of quarter sessions and 96 boroughs also have separate
courts which exercise jurisdiction within their own boundaries. In counties the courts
are generally presided over by a bench of lay magistrates under a legally qualified
chairman. In London, Lancashire and Middlesex, where the courts have continuous
sittings, the chairman and deputy chairman usually preside alone. In boroughs the
courts are presided over by a single judicial officer, the Recorder, who is a barrister
specially appointed to act part-time in this capacity.
Assizes
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court presided over by High Court
judges and held at assize towns—generally in the county town of each county and in
certain of the other larger towns and cities. The judges go round ‘on circuit’ three
times a year—on the autumn, winter and summer assizes. Each town is visited once
LAW AND ORDER 85
on each circuit; the larger towns are visited twice. After the trial of criminal cases in
each town, the judges deal with civil cases.
Crown Courts
Because of the heavy concentration of court work in Liverpool and Manchester,
two Crown Courts have been set up to act both as quarter sessions for the two cities
and as assize courts for South Lancashire. The courts are presided over by the
Recorders of Liverpool and Manchester, who are whole-time judicial officers.
The Central Criminal Court
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey in the City of London acts as the
court of assize for the criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts of the other
home counties. More than one court sits at a time, each presided over by a salaried
judicial officer. The judges sitting at the Old Bailey include one High Court judge and
the Recorder of London.
Criminal Appeals
Appeals may be brought on a point of law by either the prosecutor or the defendant
direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more usual appeal is
that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence, which may be heard
by quarter sessions for a borough, or by the appeal committee of quarter sessions
(consisting of between three and twelve magistrates) for a county.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or Crown
courts go to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Appeals on questions of law may be
brought as of right, but on other grounds only by leave. The Lord Chief Justice
usually presides in the Court of Criminal Appeal, which consists of three or, in special
cases, five judges of the Queen’s Bench Division.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords can be
brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public importance is involved
and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be
considered by the House.
Proceedings Before Trial
Prosecutions
In theory, there is no restriction on the right of a private citizen to institute criminal
proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales are initiated and conducted
by the police. In some cases the consent of the Attorney General or the Director of
Public Prosecutions or, less frequently, a Government department is required. The
Director of Public Prosecutions is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more
serious classes of indictable offence (i.e. involving formal written accusation); in courts
where a substantial number of cases with which he is concerned are tried, standing
counsel are appointed by the Attorney General to appear on his behalf. At the Central
Criminal Court in London, for instance, there is a panel of counsel known as Treasury
Counsel, who are retained to prosecute in the Director’s cases.
Arrest
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on information laid before it or, in certain cases, without a warrant. In the
latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defendant on bail, that is to say,
he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his entering into a recognisance, with
86
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or without sureties, for a reasonable sum of money, to appear in court at the time
appointed for the trial. Magistrates also have discretion to grant bail, and this dis¬
cretion is liberally exercised in accordance with well-established principles. An
arrested person must be charged at once with the offence of which he is suspected,
the Judges Rules1 forbid anything in the nature of cross-examination by the police
once a charge has been preferred and if an arrested person wishes to make a statement
he must first be cautioned that anything he says may be used in evidence. Unless the
offence of which an arrested person is suspected is serious, he may be granted bail
if he cannot be brought before the court within a day.
If anyone is detained in custody otherwise than upon lawful grounds2 he (or, if he
is unable, someone acting on his behalf) may sue out a writ of habeas corpus against
the person who detained him, this person then being required to appear before the
court on the day named to show cause for detention. The writ of habeas corpus may
be granted by a single judge of the High Court but may be refused only by a Divisional
Court of the Queen’s Bench Division.
Trial
Most indictable offences (see p. 85) are tried in a superior court before a jury,
although some may be dealt with in magistrates courts, if the defendant consents.
Conversely, a criminal case which would ordinarily be dealt with in a magistrates’
court must’usually be heard before a jury if the offence is punishable by more than
three months’ imprisonment and the defendant elects to be so tried.
Since criminal law presumes the innocence of the accused until his guilt has been
conclusively proved, care is taken to deny to the prosecution any advantage, apparent
or real, over the defence. Every accused person has the right to employ a legal adviser
for the conduct of his defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal
aid at the public expense (see p. 98). Anyone remanded in custody may be visited in
prison by his legal adviser. During the preparation of the case, it is customary for
the prosecution to inform the defence of any relevant documents which it is not
proposed to put in evidence and to disclose them if asked to do so.
All criminal trials are held in open court and the rules of evidence (which are
concerned with the proof of facts and much the same in civil and criminal trials) are
rigorously applied. For instance, although the uncorroborated evidence of one witness
is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, conviction in criminal cases solely on the
evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is, in practice, never allowed unless the
judge has warned the jury of the danger of convicting without corroboration.
During the trial the accused has the right to hear and subsequently to cross-examine
(normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the prosecution; to call his^own
witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own free will, may be ‘sub¬
poenaed’, or legally compelled, to attend; and to address the court either in person or
through his counsel. But he cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be
sworn as a witness in his own defence. The right to cross-examine the accused, even
when he is so sworn, is limited by law, with the object of excluding inquiry into his
character or into past offences not relevant to the particular charge on which he is
1 These Rules, formulated in 1912 and at present under review by the judges, do not have
the force of law but carry very great weight.
4 These are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of either House of
Parliament- for civil debt; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered; detention of
children by their parents or guardians. The writ of habeas corpus runs in both criminal and
civil cases.

being tried. Furthermore, although confessions made in the course of previous
judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been made upon oath, no
confessions made in any other circumstances are admissible unless it can be proved
that they were made voluntarily, i.e. without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
In criminal trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to determine
questions of law, to sum up the evidence for the benefit of the jury, and to acquit the
accused or pass sentence, according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone
decides the issue of guilt or innocence. The verdict of a jury must be unanimous; if its
members are unable to reach agreement, the case must be tried before a new jury.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of appeal
and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a defence of insanity
is accepted by the jury the verdict will amount to an acquittal, but the accused will be
detained in a suitable institution. From a verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal
on the part of the defendant to the appropriate court.
CIVIL LAW IN ENGLAND AND WALES
Civil Courts
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in England and Wales are the county courts,
which are the courts for the lesser cases, and the High Court, where the more important
cases are tried. Most appeals go to the Court of Appeal and from there may go to the
House of Lords.
County Courts
County Courts (of which there are nearly 400) are so located that no part of a county
is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. They are presided over by a paid
judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may sit with a jury if either party
wishes it and the court makes an order to that effect. There are 76 county court judges
now in office, each having a circuit, which is either one court, or a group of courts,
depending on the amount of work to be done. In districts where the pressure of
business is exceptionally heavy the Lord Chancellor may, on representations made to
him by the judge of the district, appoint a person (who must previously have held
office as a judge or have been a barrister of at least seven years’ standing) to act for
the judge at any sitting of the court.
Generally speaking the jurisdiction of the county courts includes all civil actions
where the amount claimed is not more than £400 or where, in actions for the recovery
of land, the rateable value of the land is not more than £100 a year. Cases outside these
limits may be tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or may be transferred
to the High Court. Some actions, in particular actions for libel and slander, cannot be
brought in the county court.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval borough
courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time, but the Liverpool Court
of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the Mayor’s and City of London Court
are still well used.
The High Court of Justice
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. Its
jurisdiction is both original and appellate, and covers virtually all civil causes and
some criminal causes.
D
88
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The High Court is divided into the Chancery Division, the Probate, Divorce and
Admiralty Division, and the Queen’s Bench Division. The work is distributed between
them in accordance with the Rules of Court (see p. 95) and the practice of the courts.
Although the rules do not give exclusive jurisdiction in any matter to any one division,
in practice each division has a separate field of jurisdiction and the judges are attached
to a particular division.
The High Court is staffed by 52 puisne1 judges. The Lord Chancellor is, in strict
law, the president of the whole High Court (although, in practice, he does not sit in
any Division); he is also nominally head of the Chancery Division, of which the
Master of the Rolls2 is another nominal member; there is a President for the Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division; and the Lord Chief Justice of England presides
over the Queen’s Bench Division. For the hearing of cases at first instance, High
Court judges sit singly. Appellate jurisdiction is exercised either by divisional courts
consisting of three (or sometimes two) judges, sitting in one of the three Divisions of
the High Court or, in some cases, by a single judge.
Appellate Courts
Nearly all appeals from magistrates’ courts,3 ministerial decisions and the decisions
of judges sitting in Chambers4 are heard in the first instance in the appropriate
divisional court of the High Court, but all the more important appeals in civil actions
come before the Court of Appeal, which is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature,
and some (with leave of the Court of Appeal or of the House of Lords) before the
House of Lords, which is the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases in the whole United
Kingdom.
The Court of Appeal hears appeals from the High Court, the county courts and
assizes in civil cases (see p. 85). The Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, the Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary are all members of the court, but its effective head is the Master of the
Rolls, who is assisted by eleven Lord Justices of Appeal, sitting in four divisions.
The judges in the House of Lords are the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who must
have a quorum of three, but often sit as a group of five, and sometimes of seven. Lay
peers may not attend the hearing of appeals (which normally takes place in a committee
room and not in the legislative chamber), but peers who hold or have held high judicial
office may sit. The president is the Lord Chancellor.
Civil Proceedings
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required. The most
common form of proceedings is an action commenced by a writ served on the
defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant that the plaintiff has a claim
on him and states the nature of the claim. If the defendant intends to contest the
claim, he ‘enters an appearance’ by informing the court to this effect and documents
setting out the precise question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the
court.

2 Originally keeper of the records and assistant to the Lord Chancellor, the Master of the

4 Decisions reached during proceedings which, under the rules of the court, do not require
to be heard in court.
LAW AND ORDER
89
Because civil proceedings are a private matter, they can at any time be abandoned
or compromised without leave of the court,1 and in fact, in the great majority of cases,
the parties to a dispute are able to settle their differences through their solicitors
before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that are brought to court are usually
tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases involving claims for defamation, false
imprisonment, unlawful arrest, seduction, or breach of promise to marry, when either
party may insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the person charged
may also claim this right. In trials where a jury is present, it is responsible for
deciding questions of fact (as in criminal trials) and also the amount of damages to
be awarded to the injured party.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court. Refusal
to obey a judgment directing the defendant to do something or to abstain from doing
something may result in imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order
of committal may be effected only on a warrant of the court.
As a rule, the court awards the costs of an action (the solicitor’s charges and essential
disbursements) to the winning party, although in practice he always pays part of
them. In certain circumstances (for instance, extravagance or negligence in the con¬
duct of the case), the court may, in its discretion, refuse to order that one party’s costs
should be borne by the other.
CRIMINAL LAW IN SCOTLAND
Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, that is, where
proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury, or under summary
procedure, where the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High Court of Justiciary
and the more serious ones in the sheriff court are tried under solemn procedure.
Proceedings are taken under summary procedure in the more minor cases in the
sheriff court, and in the justice of the peace and burgh (or police) courts.
Burgh (or Police) Courts
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who are
serving (or have served) in the office of the magistrate of the burgh. In Glasgow a
stipendiary magistrate acts as judge of one of the courts.
Justice of Peace Courts
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges being
the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Any court of summary jurisdiction sits as z juvenile court when hearing charges only
against persons under 17 years of age. Special justice of the peace juvenile courts
have been established in three counties and in the city of Aberdeen.
The Sheriff Court
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combination of
counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court districts. A
sheriffdom has a sheriff and a number of sheriffs-substitute and these act as the judges
of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil jurisdiction, as well as a
criminal jurisdiction.
1 Matrimonial causes are exceptional in that all cases (whether defended or undefended) must
come before a judge.
9° BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The High Court of Justiciary
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance. Any
one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice
General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session), the Lord Justice
Clerk, or any one of the thirteen Lords Commissioner of Justiciary who are also
judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the judges
go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns.
Criminal Appeals
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment may appeal
to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any ground which involves
a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court or upon the certificate of the
judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit case for appeal, on any ground, and (b)
against his sentence, with the leave of the High Court, unless the sentence is one
fixed by law. Appeals are heard by three or more judges, and there is no further appeal
to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on questions
of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
Proceedings Before Trial
Prosecutions
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime dis¬
covered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor concerned
(the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in the sheriff court,
and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in the justice of the peace and
burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or not to prosecute and, in the case of the
Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether to proceed summarily or to charge the accused
by Petition with a view to proceedings on indictment.
Arrest
The police in Scotland have the same powers of arrest as have the police in England
and Wales. The Judges Rules do not apply in Scotland, but when an accused person
is arrested, he should be cautioned and have the charge read over to him. Thereafter,
only the accused’s voluntary statements may be used in evidence at his trial, and the
court will reject any statements made by him unless it is satisfied that they have been
fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, a person apprehended in Scotland must be brought
before the court competent to deal with his case with the least possible delay. There
is no equivalent in Scotland to the public preliminary investigation before examining
magistrates held in England and Wales before committal for trial. Where a prosecution
on indictment is contemplated, the accused is brought before a magistrate for judicial
examination. The magistrate then commits the accused for trial, but he may first
commit him for further examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for
further examination and commitment for trial.
Persons in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may be
liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction of a summary
court other than the sheriff court, by that court or the police. Even in the case of
murder or treason, bail may be accepted at the discretion of the Lord Advocate or the
High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of appeal to the High Court by the accused
LAW AND ORDER
91
person against the refusal of bail, by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by
either party against the amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court of Justiciary
has power to release persons unlawfully detained and accused persons must, in any
event, be brought to trial within no days of committal.
Trial
In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff court,
when the accused is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty,
the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the appropriate court. If he pleads
guilty, and it is a case which is to be dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may
dispose of it at once. If it is a High Court case it is continued to the second diet in the
High Court for disposal only.
The second diet is held at least nine days after the pleading diet, either before the
sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without opening speeches)
and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for the defence, followed by the
judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’,
both of which result in acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case
the court proceeds to the question of sentence. The verdict (unlike that of an English
jury) may be by a majority. Fairness to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with
a few minor exceptions, no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least
two witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which
clearly implicate the accused person in the crime.
At summary trials the accused is asked to plead to the charge at the first calling of
the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the case. Where the plea is
‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it may appoint a trial diet for a
later date.
CIVIL LAW IN SCOTLAND
Civil Courts
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which, in
their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England and Wales,
and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court in Scotland.
Sheriff Courts
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is un¬
limited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff-substitute,
against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal or directly to
the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding £5 in value) may be
tried by justices of the peace.
Sheriff courts in their civil capacity correspond roughly to county courts in England
and Wales, but they have a wider jurisdiction unlimited by the value of the case.
The Court of Session
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and has
sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into two parts:
the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House which is mainly an
appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions of equal status, each
consisting of four judges—the first division being presided over by the Lord President
and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. From the Inner House an appeal
may lie to the House of Lords.
92 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Scottish Land Court
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and dignity
of a judge of the Court of Session.
Civil Proceedings
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of a writ
or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer seeks, a state¬
ment of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a statement of the legal
propositions upon which the pursuer maintains he is entitled to the remedy which he
seeks. In Court of Session actions the next step is the calling of the summons, which
is the publication of the action in the court lists. If the defender intends to defend the
action, he must ‘enter appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge
defences to it. In the sheriff court ‘entering appearance’ precedes the ‘tabling’ of
the case. It is much more common in Scotland than in England and Wales to have
legal debates in court as to the competency or relevancy of the written pleadings prior
to the proof.
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial case, at any
time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement of the proof or
trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action in Scotland is much
more common than in England and Wales, being the usual form of proof in actions
for damages for personal injuries.
COURTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England
and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller community. The superior
courts comprise the Supreme Court of Judicature (consisting of the High Court of
Justice and the Court of Appeal) and the Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court
is the superior court of first instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the
Queen’s Bench Division (including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings)
and the circuit courts (assizes) and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as president,
and two judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, is constituted
of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). Courts of quarter sessions have been amalgamated with the county
courts, which now exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction and are presided over
by county court judges, of whom there are five (two of them having the title of Recorder
—of Belfast and of Londonderry). At least four sittings of the court are held annually
in each division. Petty sessions courts are composed of one resident magistrate (who
corresponds to a stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except
in some specific cases, for instance in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate.
Juvenile courts are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members, one
of whom must be a woman.
SPECIAL COURTS
Coroners’ Courts
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears to have
died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the cause is unknown, and
LAW AND ORDER
93
in certain other circumstances. In such cases, it is the duty of the local coroner (who
may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical practitioner of not less than five years’
standing, appointed by a county or a county borough council) to hold an inquiry into
how, when, and where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this
purpose, and he must do so if he has reasonable cause to believe that the deceased
has died a violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for
which an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. A jury must be
summoned in certain cases, including those in which there is reason to suspect that
the death was due to murder, manslaughter, or infanticide, or was caused by an acci¬
dent arising out of the use of a vehicle on the public highway. If the jury returns a
verdict of murder, manslaughter or infanticide by a particular person, the coroner must
commit that person for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden death of which
the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest, but may order a post¬
mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal inquires
privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may report the result
of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown Counsel may consider what
proceedings, if any, are required.
Administrative Tribunals
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or quasi¬
judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule, they are set
up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by statute, which also govern their
constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and responsibility for the general
well-being of the community has greatly multiplied the occasions on which the
individual may find himself at issue with the administration, or with another body of
persons or an individual; consequently there has been a substantial growth in the
number of tribunals (there are over 2,000 in existence) and in the range of their
activities during the past fifteen years. Their constitution follows a fairly general
pattern: all, for instance, consist of an uneven number of persons so that a majority
decision can be reached; members are usually appointed by the minister concerned
with the subject but other authorities (for instance, the Crown, the Lord Chancellor
and the Master of the Rolls) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases and
the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland,
makes appointments in all cases where a lawyer chairman or member is required;
and, with some exceptions, members of tribunals hold office for a period specified in
the warrant or instrument by which they are appointed.
Administrative tribunals may be broadly classified as follows:
(i) those which have permanent members appointed for their special knowledge,
and a chairman who must be a lawyer of experience: for instance, the
Transport Tribunal, which has jurisdiction over fares and rates charged by
the British Transport Commission (see p. 369) and the Lands Tribunal,
which has jurisdiction in a variety of matters relating to the value of property;
(ii) those which are purely administrative: for instance, the Special Commissioners
of Income Tax, who hear appeals on income tax matters from the rulings of
the Inland Revenue officials;
(iii) those which deal exclusively with matters of interest to one Government
94
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
department or public authority: for instance, the Pensions Appeal Tribunals,
which hear appeals against the rejection by the Minister of Pensions and
National Insurance of war service pension claims; and
(iv) those which consist of ordinary people appointed by a minister to arbitrate
between individuals: for instance, the Rent Tribunals, which have jurisdiction
in the determination of rents of certain properties.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the General
Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society, but these are
entirely different in constitution from the statutory tribunals and are of no concern to
the general public.
There is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory tribunals. Where
appeals exist, they may lie to a specially constituted appeal tribunal; to a Minister of
the Crown; to an independent referee; or, either fully or on a point of law, to a
divisional court of the appropriate High Court Division. An advisory body known as
the Council on Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary
of State for Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over the tribunals and reports on
particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish com¬
mittee of the Council.
Military Courts
Generally speaking, courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the
armed forces in connection with the system of military law enforceable under provisions
of the Army Act and Naval Discipline Act. (Non-military offences committed by
members of the armed forces are dealt with in the ordinary criminal courts.) A
military or air force court martial may be convened by any officer authorised to do so;
a naval court martial may be ordered either by the Admiralty or by any authorised
officer.
At every general court martial, and in important cases at district courts martial, an
officer, known as a judge advocate, must be present to advise the court upon law and
procedure and ensure that the accused is afforded a fair trial. The Judge Advocate
General’s Department acts for the Air Force as well as the Army, but the Navy has a
separate Judge Advocate of the Fleet.
Appeals lie to the Courts-Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to the House of
Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public importance is involved
and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point is one that ought
to be considered by the House.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. Responsibility for the
administration of the judicial system in England and Wales, when it does not rest
with the courts themselves, lies partly with the Lord Chancellor and partly with the
Home Secretary. The former is concerned with the composition of all courts, both
criminal and civil, with parts of criminal procedure and with everything relating to
civil law, and the latter with criminal law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders,
part of the process of trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The
Prime Minister is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the
Crown the highest judicial appointments (see p. 45).
1 Excluding supervision of the professional disciplinary tribunals.
LAW AND ORDER
95
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the appoint¬
ment of the officers of the court (for instance, the masters, registrars and clerks) is
partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the hands of the appropriate
judges. The Lord Chancellor is concerned with legal procedure in that he is a member
of the Rule Committee which makes the rules of the Supreme Court, appoints the
County Court Rule Committee and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by
it. He is concerned with law reform in that he refers questions on this subject (save
in the field of criminal law, where the Home Secretary is primarily responsible) to
the Law Reform Committee and the Private International Law Committee, and that
the reports of these committees, which often become the basis of legislation, are
presented to him.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves, chiefly
through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees; but the local authorities,
with financial assistance from the government, are responsible for meeting their costs,
and the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has certain specific
responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes, approval of the appoint¬
ment of justices’ clerks, and deciding disputes on financial matters.
In Scotland the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session are administered
by the Clerk of the Justiciary and his staff and the principal Clerk of Session and his
staff respectively. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for the staffing
and general organisation of the sheriff courts.
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts has been reserved to
the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by the Crown and are
removable only on an address of both Houses of that Parliament. The Minister of
Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible for the staffing and general organisa¬
tion of the county and petty sessions courts; the judges of the county court and
resident magistrates are appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
THE PERSONNEL OF THE LAW
The administration of the law requires the co-operation of judges with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests; of the officers of
the court, who have general or specialised functions of an administrative (and some¬
times of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are attached; and of the barristers
(advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are entrusted with representing the
interests of the parties to a dispute.1
Judges
All judicial officers, from those of the House of Lords and the superior courts to
the stipendiary magistrates and justices of the peace, are independent of both the
legislature and the executive. Under existing law, they are free to administer the law
without fear or favour; although the courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s
Courts (since the Crown is the historic source of judicial, as of executive power), it
has been established since the end of the seventeenth century that the executive cannot
disturb or delay the course of common justice, or attempt to force the judges to act
otherwise than impartially.
The Crown, acting on the advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments
1 The law allows full liberty to the individual to conduct his own case, both in its initial and
final stages, if he thinks fit. The more usual practice, however, is to be legally represented.
96
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to the judiciary. In England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division—are made on the recom¬
mendation of the Prime Minister, while the Lord Chancellor recommends the
appointment of the puisne judges, the county court judges (except in Lancashire
where they are nominated by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster), the chairmen
of quarter sessions, the recorders of boroughs, and the metropolitan and other
stipendiary magistrates. Justices of the peace are appointed on behalf of the Crown
by the Lord Chancellor,1 who is advised, as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant2
with the assistance of a local advisory committee, and as to the boroughs by separate
advisory committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment of
the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord Justice Clerk.
Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies with the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible for the appointment and
removal of justices of the peace.
Judges are not engaged in politics, except in the case of the Lord Chancellor who,
as well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the Government in
power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges have always been appointed
from practising barristers or advocates and neither their training nor their career is in
any way influenced by the State.
Once appointed, judges normally hold office for life or until statutory retiring age.
However, in certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or proven
incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and Wales may be removed from
their position by the Lord Chancellor. In Scotland the Secretary of State may issue
an order for the removal from office of a sheriff-principal on a report prepared by the
Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk, on the grounds
of inability, neglect of duty or misbehaviour, but this order is required to lie before
both Houses of Parliament for a period of four weeks. A sheriff-substitute may similarly
be removed from office, but in his case no parliamentary procedure is necessary.
In England and Wales all superior judges (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as
a Cabinet Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a power of removal
only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament.3 Since
1701 only one such address has been moved (against a judge convicted of misappropria¬
tion of funds, in 1830); and it can be stated with confidence that Parliament would
never use this means to attempt to interfere with judicial independence. Similarly,
although no court in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act
of Parliament which had been legally promulgated and published it might, through
its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the policy of the
Government which introduced the Act. In such a case it would be open to the Govern¬
ment to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute by new legislation. It
would not be open to it to penalise the judge or to try to influence the court in any
other way.
j Except in Lancashire, where the Chancellor of the Duchy acts on behalf of the Crown in
this matter.
2 The office of the Lord Lieutenant of the county was first created in the sixteenth century.
Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.
3 There is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High Court
of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be required to effect
such a dismissal.
LAW AND ORDER
97
Juries
A jury in England and Wales consists of twelve persons duly summoned by the
court. In Scotland the jury consists of fifteen persons in criminal cases and twelve in
civil cases and in Northern Ireland of twelve in criminal and seven in civil cases.
Most householders (men and women alike) are liable for jury service if they are
British subjects over the age of 21, but persons following certain occupations can
claim exemption. A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the
executive. In criminal cases the accused can have a number of jurors changed without
giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object for cause shown (for
instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the jury have been sworn, they
are protected from interference of any kind. It is an offence to assault, threaten or
attempt to corrupt a juryman either before or during a trial.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts (see p. 92) in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland, a jury is required to be present to return a verdict on how, when and where
a deceased person died. The jury in this instance consists of from seven to eleven
jurors. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether
objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The Legal Profession
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in Scotland)
and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake legal business for
lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through solicitors and
conduct proceedings in the higher courts—though certain functions are common to
them both.
A barrister in England is required to have reached an accepted educational standard,
to have passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of Legal Education
and to have become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s
Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple. A barrister with a substantial junior
practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him Queen’s
Counsel—a proceeding that is known as ‘taking silk’. Most of the higher judicial
appointments are made from among barristers who have become Queen’s Counsel.
The professional conduct of a barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council
of the Bar; but disciplinary powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns
of Court.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by the
appropriate committee of the Law Society (the professional organisation of solicitors)
and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising solicitor of not less
than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional career. The term of
articles lasts for three or five years, depending upon the educational qualifications of
the student. An articled clerk must pass the necessary examinations held by the Law
Society and, unless he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is
generally required to attend a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a
solicitor is qualified, he may become a member of the Law Society.
In Scotland an advocate requires to have an arts degree or its equivalent. The
conditions applying for the admission of solicitors are similar to those applying in
England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations are the Faculty of
Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The pro-
98
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
fessional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of Northern
Ireland.
LEGAL AID AND ADVICE
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources have
existed for centuries in some courts—to a limited extent in England and Wales, and to
a somewhat greater extent in Scotland. The Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, and
the corresponding Legal Aid (Scotland) Act, 1949, were introduced to improve
existing arrangements in civil proceedings so that no one would be financially unable
to prosecute a just and reasonable claim or to defend a legal right, and also to make
the facilities already available in criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those
who needed them.
Owing to the financial situation at the time, the 1949 Acts could not be fully imple¬
mented and, at first, only those clauses relating to legal aid in civil proceedings before
the High Court and the Court of Appeal in England and Wales, and before the Court
of Session and the sheriff courts in Scotland, were brought into force. The scheme
is still not in full operation but, in England and Wales, legal aid has now been made
available for appeals to the House of Lords, for civil cases in county courts and for
certain civil proceedings (mainly in connection with matrimonial and affiliation
matters) in magistrates’ courts and courts of quarter session. The sections in both the
English and Scottish Acts providing for legal aid in matters not involving litigation
and for oral legal advice have also come into force.
Legal Aid in Civil Cases
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those in slightly higher income and capital groups.
The legal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by the Law Society under the
general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. It is operated by 12 area committees and a
network of local committees composed of barristers and solicitors (who may be paid
a fee), with a salaried staff. The cost is met from the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from
three sources: contributions from assisted persons; costs recovered from opposite
parties in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
Applicants for free legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds for
asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select from a panel
a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case is then conducted in the
ordinary way. Certain types of action, including libel and slander, are excluded from
the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of Scotland
through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court committee and sixteen
local committees. An applicant is required to show ‘probable cause’ and produce in
support of his application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of
Scottish law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House of
Lords from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court of Session and
the sheriff courts and in matters not involving litigation.
Legal Aid in Criminal Courts
Free legal aid is available in the criminal courts in England and Wales under the
Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, 1930, which provides for the granting of either a legal
aid certificate which entitles the recipient to the services of a solicitor (or, in the case
of a preliminary inquiry into a charge of murder, of a solicitor and counsel) in defending
LAW AND ORDER
99
a charge heard summarily or at committal proceedings in indictable cases, or a defence
certificate which provides both solicitor and counsel in a trial on indictment. The
granting of these certificates is in the discretion of the justices or judge before whom the
applicant is to be tried, except in the case of a person committed for trial on a charge
of murder, when a defence certificate must be granted if the defendant has insufficient
means.
Free legal aid for an appeal to quarter sessions is provided for in the Summary
Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933, which lays down that, in proper cases, an appeal aid
certificate may be granted by a magistrates’ court or quarter sessions. The granting
of legal aid in appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal rests with a judge of that court
who may also grant legal aid for the purposes of a further appeal to the House of
Lords.
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid Fund. In
the higher courts payments are made in the first instance out of local authority funds
and the cost is reimbursed by the central government.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act,
there is no provision for legal aid in criminal cases in Scotland, but a ‘Poor’s Roll’
exists to provide a legal defence, free of charge, for those in need.
Legal Advice
Oral advice on legal matters is available, both in England and Wales and in Scotland,
free of charge to persons in receipt of national assistance and at a very reasonable cost,
i.e. at 2s. 6d. for an interview of up to thirty minutes, to those of limited means.
Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out of the legal aid funds of the two
countries. The scheme is administered by the two Law Societies, which also run
voluntary schemes (for a fee of ^1) for those who do not qualify for statutory assistance.
Legal Aid in Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945, the cost being met from
public funds.
Legislation providing for a comprehensive system of legal assistance (covering legal
advice, preliminary legal aid and legal aid by way of representation by solicitor and
counsel in all courts and tribunals) to persons within the income and capital ranges
specified in the Legal Aid Act, i960, has been recommended in a majority report of a
committee appointed by the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are to deter the potential
law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of deterrence lies in
the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility of punishment rather than in the
severity of the punishment itself. The treatment of offenders today is based increasingly
on the recognition that the community has a responsibility not simply to punish or
reject the law-breaker but to prevent him from returning to crime.
Penalties
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a fixed
penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty (within maxima prescribed
by law) that it considers most suitable in the light of the circumstances of the offence
and the offender. In general, the courts have power to impose either imprisonment
IOO
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or a fine for serious offences (both in certain cases); while most minor offences are
punishable by a fine only, with the alternative of imprisonment if the fine is not paid.
Moreover, the court has discretion, instead of sentencing an offender, to discharge
him absolutely, to place him on probation or (in England and Wales only) to discharge
him conditionally (i.e. subject to the condition that he commits no offence during a
specified period not exceeding twelve months). There are special provisions governing
the treatment of young offenders: for instance, the Criminal Justice Act, 1961, pro¬
vides for the eventual abolition (in England and Wales) of sentences of imprisonment of
less than three years (or less than eighteen months in the case of persistent offenders)
for persons under 21 years old. Summary courts are subject to a similar restriction
in sentencing adult first offenders to imprisonment.
Two special types of treatment—corrective training and preventive detention—have
been devised to deal with the persistent offender. The purpose of a sentence of
corrective training is to enable training to be given to a prisoner whom the court
considers to be in need of it, and it is designed to stop his criminal tendencies and
encourage him to become a responsible citizen. The range of the corrective training
sentence is from two to four years (seven years in Northern Ireland). A sentence of
preventive detention, which is primarily for the protection of the public in those cases
where the offender has a long record of previous offences and whose response to previous
institutional training has been unsatisfactory, runs for not less than five years (three
in Northern Ireland) or more than 14 years, as the court decides.
Since 1957 the death penalty in Great Britain for murder has been limited to
murders classified as ‘capital murder’. These are not necessarily the type of murder
regarded as the most wicked, but are those which strike especially at the maintenance
of law and order and on which the deterrent effect of capital punishment is believed to
be most likely to operate, i.e. murder done in the course or furtherance of theft,
murder by shooting or by causing an explosion, murder committed to escape lawful
arrest or to effect or assist escape or rescue from legal custody, murder of a police
officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty, or murder by a
prisoner of a prison officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his
duty. The penalty for murder not in capital categories is imprisonment for life, except
that the death penalty continues to apply where a person who is convicted of murder
has previously been convicted of another murder committed in Great Britain on a
different occasion. Murderers under the age of 18 years at the time that the crime was
committed are not sentenced to death or to life imprisonment, but ‘to be detained
during Her Majesty’s pleasure’. If it can be proved that a person accused of murder
was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental
responsibility at the time he committed the murder, he is entitled to be convicted of
the lesser offence of manslaughter.
It is the long-established practice for the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State
for Scotland to review every capital case before the law is allowed to take its course
and to consider whether there are grounds for advising the Crown to exercise the
prerogative of mercy. Where a reprieve is recommended, the sentence of death is
commuted to one of imprisonment for life. A person subject to a sentence of life
imprisonment is liable to be detained for the rest of his life, but the Home Secretary
may, if he thinks fit, release him on licence at any time. In recent years, the average
period served by persons whose death sentences have been commuted has been about
nine years, but the period varies according to the circumstances of the particular
case and the question of whether the prisoner’s discharge would be likely to involve
risk to the public.
LAW AND ORDER
101
The Homicide Act, 1957, is not applicable to Northern Ireland where sentence of
death is passed in all cases of murder. The exercise of the prerogative of mercy in
such cases is considered by the Northern Ireland Cabinet, which tenders advice to
the Governor in his capacity as representative of the Crown.
Administrative Authorities
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally responsible for
legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical and other
information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing the advantages and
defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and for bringing information about
these methods to the attention of the courts. He is specifically responsible for super¬
vising the approved schools, for promoting the efficiency of the probation service,
and for providing, maintaining and managing prisons and borstal institutions.
The Home Secretary is advised in the discharge of his duties as the central authority
for all questions relating to the treatment of offenders by the Advisory Council for the
Treatment of Offenders, which also acts as the National Working Party Group for
the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, and as the National Committee
of the International Penal and Penitentiary Commission.
The general supervision of penal institutions is the responsibility of visiting com¬
mittees, appointed by the justices, for those prisons to which convicted persons are
committed direct from their courts, or of boards of visitors, appointed by the Home
Secretary, for the other prisons and institutions. The main functions of the committees
and boards are: to act as the superior disciplinary authority of the prison or institution;
to constitute an independent judicial body to which any prisoner or inmate may make a
complaint or request; and to report direct to the Home Secretary, both by formal
annual report and as occasion may require, on every aspect of the administration of
the prison. In borstal institutions and central prisons for prisoners sentenced to
preventive detention, the boards also advise on the release on licence of the inmates.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. The Secretary of State for Scotland is
advised in the discharge of his duties by the Scottish Advisory Council on the Treat¬
ment of Offenders. In Northern Ireland the system is the responsibility of the Ministry
for Home Affairs.
Prisons
The rising trend in the total number of indictable offences known to the police
has led to severe overcrowding in prisons and has strained the resources of other
agencies, such as borstals, approved schools and the probation service. Measures to
deal with the problems include plans for a substantial increase in the number of
prisons and the other institutions mentioned above, and the reconstruction or replace¬
ment of a number of old prisons.
Prisons in England and Wales are of the following types: local prisons of the ordinary
type, which receive all classes of prisoners direct from the courts; local prisons of a
special type, which may be open or walled, for short-sentence prisoners, chiefly first
offenders; young prisoners’ centres for the reception of youths under 21 years of
age with sentences of three months or over, as far as accommodation permits; "regional
training prisons (some of which are open) for first offenders and trainable prisoners
of other categories, including those sentenced to corrective training; and central
prisons for habitual law-breakers, prisoners sentenced to preventive detention and
long-term first offenders—one for the latter class is an open prison.
102
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Scottish system of classification of prisoners is broadly the same as that of
England and Wales; but each prison in Scotland, except the open prison, accommo¬
dates more than one classification group. In Northern Ireland, with its smaller popu¬
lation, the necessity for several kinds of prison to separate the various classes of
prisoners does not arise to the same extent.
Classification of Prisoners
Every person committed to prison is received in the local prison serving the court
from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his whole sentence
at the local prison or be sent to another institution, depending on his age, the length
and nature of his sentence, and his personal history and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of young
persons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners and of civil
prisoners from criminal prisoners; secondly, to prevent contamination, among con¬
victed prisoners, of the better by the worse; and thirdly, to provide training appropriate
to their needs for those among convicted prisoners who seem likely to benefit therefrom.
Training
In prison training, efforts are being made to provide (i) work of a kind likely to
help fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training in skilled
trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities, and (3) opportunities for
the development of a sense of personal responsibility, including (for suitable persons)
training in open conditions. A system of vocational training courses in skilled trades,
designed to enable the trainees to take the examinations of recognised examining
bodies, is being developed in central and training prisons.
Employment
New problems in the organisation and management of industries in prisons have
arisen as the result of changes that have taken place both in industrial methods and
in the prison system during the past thirty years, and because of the substantial
increase in the number of prison inmates for whom employment must be found.
The whole subject is therefore being studied by a standing Advisory Council on the
Employment of Prisoners, appointed by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The Council has so far made two reports: the first deals with
work for prisoners, including suitable kinds of work, job training and earnings; the
second deals with the employment and industrial training of borstal inmates.
Except in local prisons in England and Wales, where the hours are shorter, most
prisoners spend about 40 hours a week in the prison workshops or in other employment
such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening in the prison precincts. A
few prisoners are employed outside the prisons on various projects of public value,
such as agriculture, land drainage, road works and forestry.
In England, Wales, and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for the work
they do, and good work is rewarded by payments above the minimum; in Northern
Ireland there is a progressive system of earnings, which is not related to output nor
to work done.
Education
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the Government departments
responsible for education in their respective countries, and in Northern Ireland by
the Ministry of Home Affairs. In England and Wales the local authorities also provide
LAW AND ORDER
IO3
tutor organisers and most of the instructors; in all cases the full cost of their ser¬
vices is reimbursed. Evening classes and a wide range of correspondence courses
are available for those who have a serious desire to improve their education and
qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays, concerts,
and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison library, which in most
cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough library committee.
Medical Services
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers whose
duties include not only the care of the physical and mental health of prison inmates,
but also the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
A few prisons and borstals have their own psychiatric clinics (with qualified medical
staff, visiting psychotherapists and psychiatric social workers) to which inmates may
be transferred where necessary. The hospital facilities of the National Health Service
(see Chapter 5) are also available for the treatment of inmates in appropriate cases.
Arrangements may be made for prisoners serving short-term sentences to receive
treatment after release. In England and Wales a new psychiatric prison for the treat¬
ment of abnormal and unusual types of inmates, with accommodation for 350 people,
was opened in 1962. There is also a psychological service for prisons in England and
Wales, whose officers are employed to assist governors and medical officers in their
work of examining and classifying prisoners, and to advise on methods of treatment.
Religion and Welfare
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland, of the Church of Scotland and
in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church) and a Roman
Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the Methodist Church and
of other denominations are either appointed or specially called in as required. Regular
services are held, and chaplains and other ministers may visit prisoners in their cells.
Welfare is the general concern of the prison staff, particularly of the chaplains and
assistant governors but all prisons have resident or visiting welfare officers.
Prisoners may be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals and
by prison visitors specially appointed for the purpose. The voluntary work of prison
visitors is co-ordinated and guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Privileges and Discipline
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to preventive
detention or to imprisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their
sentence (one-fourth in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than two years),
provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days).
A prisoner sentenced to preventive detention becomes eligible for release on licence
after serving two-thirds or five-sixths of his sentence (in Northern Ireland, two years,
or one-half of his sentence, whichever is greater) according to an assessment of his
character, conduct and prospects, which is made after he has served a substantial
part of his sentence and a life prisoner may be released on licence by the Home
Secretary (see p. 100). All prisoners become entitled to certain personal privileges at
successive stages in their sentence.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the prison governor, the visiting committee
or the board of visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission (or postponement
of the date of release) and forfeiture of privileges.
104 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Discharge and After-Care
Pre-release courses, at which experts hold open forum with prisoners nearing their
release on the domestic, social and industrial problems with which they are likely to
be faced, are conducted at all prisons in England and Wales. Specially selected men
amongst those sentenced to preventive detention, long-term imprisonment and, in
Scotland, corrective training are allowed to work, as free men, in ordinary civilian
jobs outside prison during the months immediately preceding their discharge; hostels
for this purpose have been established at several prisons. Home leave, allowing five
clear days at home, is extensively granted to many categories of prisoners with sentences
of two years or over towards the end of their sentences to enable them to make family
adjustments and contacts with potential employers.
On discharge from local or regional prisons, certain classes of prisoners serving
sentences of less than four years (three years in the case of most women) are assisted
by local discharged prisoners’ aid societies (voluntary bodies supported partly by
private and partly by public funds) or by the National Association of Discharged
Prisoners’ Aid Societies (a central co-ordinating body, maintained by grants from
public funds for its administrative expenses). The local societies are advised by prison
welfare officers, employed by the National Association, who work at the prisons. In
Scotland the prison welfare officers are employed by the Scottish Home Department.
The National Association is also responsible for welfare and after-care arrangements
at regional training prisons and special local prisons.
Statutory supervision in England and Wales applies, generally speaking, to persistent
offenders and those serving sentences of four years or more, to young prisoners, and
persons discharged from borstals. The sanctions for failure to observe the conditions
of supervision are recall to prison or borstal. Statutory supervision is the responsibility
of the Central After-Care Association, a voluntary body financed from public funds
and governed by a council appointed by the Home Secretary, which includes in its
membership representatives of the Ministry of Labour, of the National Assistance
Board and of the probation service. The After-Care Council, appointed by the Secre¬
tary of State for Scotland, carries out similar duties in Scotland.
The Central After-Care Association works through local associates, usually
probation officers, and the National Association also works through the after-care
officers of local aid societies. The After-Care Council in Scotland uses the services of
voluntary guardians. The officers of the local organisations make all arrangements
for the reception of the prisoner after his discharge, and will advise, assist and befriend
him for as long as is necessary, or as required by statute.
In Northern Ireland the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the discharged
prisoners’ aid societies with the help of probation officers.
Treatment of Young Offenders
Under the English and Scottish legal systems, a child under the age of eight cannot
be charged with an offence. A child between eight and 14 years old, who is charged
with an offence other than homicide, must be dealt with in a juvenile court unless
charged jointly with an adult.
In England and Wales a young person between 14 and 17 years of age charged
with an indictable offence may be dealt with summarily (as is usually the case) or
committed for trial by jury. In certain cases young persons may claim to be tried by
jury, though this right is rarely exercised. In Scotland and Northern Ireland all young
persons up to the age of 17 years who are charged with offences must be dealt with
in juvenile courts, unless they have been charged in conjunction with adult offenders.
LAW AND ORDER
I05
The following methods of treatment are available in law for dealing with children
and young persons who have been found guilty of committing an offence: absolute
discharge; conditional discharge (in England and Wales only); fines imposed upon
the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents; probation; committal
to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until the age of
18; or a period of detention in one of the different types of institution which are
available when institutional treatment is considered necessary. In Scotland, and under
the Criminal Justice Act, 1961, in England and Wales, no young person under the
age of 17 may be sentenced to imprisonment.
Remand
In England, Wales and Scotland remand homes are provided by local authorities
for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their appearance in court,
or between court appearances (while inquiries are made as to the best method of
treatment for them), while they are awaiting vacancies in approved schools, or for a
short period (up to a month) of punitive detention. In Northern Ireland the respon¬
sibility for providing or arranging for the provision of remand homes rests with the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
In addition to remand homes, remand centres are being established in England and
Wales (and are planned for Scotland), to which a court may send young persons
between the ages of 17 and 21 who would otherwise be remanded to prison, and those
under 17 years old who are unsuitable for remand homes.
The system of remand offers valuable opportunities for observation, the results of
which are included in reports for the guidance of those responsible for the future of
young offenders.
Approved Schools
Approved schools are residential schools for children and for young persons between
the ages of 14 and 17 wrho, the courts consider, need not only removal from home
but also a fairly long period of training. Children and young people may be sent to
approved schools because they have committed an offence or are in need of care or
protection or on certain other grounds not involving the commission of an offence. The
schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary organisations concerned
with the welfare of children and young people on a national scale, or by local com¬
mittees formed by people interested in such work. In England and Wales the schools
must be approved by the Home Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for
Scotland; and in Northern Ireland, by the Minister of Home Affairs.
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are classified according to
age on admission, and include separate schools for Roman Catholics. Assignment
to a school in the appropriate age group is determined by such considerations as the
location of the school in relation to the home, the type of training provided, and the
probable reaction of a child or young person to the individual personalities of the staff.
The main ingredients of approved school training are education in the formal sense,
religious education and guidance, craft training (for the older groups), attention to
health and to the use of recreation and leisure, social training and personal case work.
Its primary object is the re-adjustment of children and young persons for their return
to the community; contact is maintained with their homes while they are in approved
schools and after they have left help and supervision are given.
The period during which a child or young person may be detained in an approved
school is determined by law. In Great Britain it is three years, except for boys and
girls under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal, who may be kept
io6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
until the age of 15 years and 4 months, and those over the age of 16 on committal,
who can be detained only up to the age of 19, or 19J if they have been found guilty
of absconding or of serious misconduct in an approved school. In England and Wales
young people over the age of 15 who present a threat to the discipline of a school
may be temporarily transferred on a justice’s warrant to another establishment.
Those who are thought to be more suitable for borstal training may, with the consent
of the Home Secretary, be brought before a magistrates’ court, which has power to
order removal to borstal. Managers of all approved schools are under an obligation to
review the progress of each boy or girl in their charge with a view to granting a release
as soon as they are fit for it; release within the first six months of the detention period
requires the consent of the Home Secretary. Statutory responsibility for after-care of
boys and girls released from approved schools rests on the school managers who are
assisted in this work by welfare officers and the probation and child-care services.
Attendance Centres
A number of attendance centres have been established in England and Wales to
deal with boys between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for which an
adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment is designed to teach
young offenders a respect for the law and to give them some instruction in the proper
use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must do so during their spare time on Saturday
mornings or afternoons; they may be required to attend for up to three hours on any
one occasion and for a total of not less than twelve hours (with certain exceptions) and
not more than twenty-four. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts,
or a lecture (for example, on first aid) and a period of physical training or disciplinary
tasks under supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys to join a
youth club or other suitable organisation.
There is also a centre for youths aged 17 to 21 in Manchester. This operates on
similar lines to those adopted at the juvenile centres, but the activities have been
adapted to meet the needs of the older age group.
Detention Centres
Detention centres provide a means of treating young offenders for whom a long
period of residential training in an approved school or borstal does not seem necessary
but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such measures as fines or probation.
The sentence is short; the intention is primarily deterrent; and the life of a centre is
therefore strict and vigorous, demanding a brisk tempo and the highest possible stan¬
dard of discipline and behaviour in every aspect of training. The routine provides a
normal working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to physical
training, and experience has shown that much positive training can be given within
the limits of this framework. Boys of compulsory school age receive full-time education,
and classes of further education are provided for others in the evenings. A number
of centres (both junior and senior) are already in operation, more are planned and,
in due course, detention will replace short-term imprisonment for young offenders.
The Criminal Justice Act, 1961, provides for statutory after-care for up to 12 months
after discharge from a detention centre.
Borstal Institutions
There are various types of borstal institution, which aim to provide suitable con¬
ditions and training courses for different types of young offenders between the ages
of 16 and 21 years: training borstals, reception centres (where allocation is made),
correction centres and recall centres. The period of the sentence ranges from six
LAW AND ORDER
IO7
months to two years and is followed by supervision for two years from the date of
release. In Scotland, where there is no minimum period of detention, the maximum is
three years and the supervision period is for one year from the date of release from
the institution. The system is essentially remedial and educational, based on personal
training by a carefully selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in
skilled trades; there is much freedom of movement, and many borstals are conducted
in open conditions. An initial period of classification ensures that each young offender
is sent to the institution best suited to his or her requirements.
Probation
The probation service is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while
he remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation officer, whose duty
it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature of the service is that it
relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before making a probation order, the court
must explain its effects and make sure that the probationer understands that if he fails
to comply with the requirements of the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the
original offence. A probation order cannot be made without the consent of the person
concerned unless (in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only) he is under 14
years of age. The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with
the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may
also require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to treatment for his mental
condition. A probation order is made for not less than one year and not more than
three years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available the services
of probation officers of both sexes. In London the appointment of probation officers is
the responsibility of the Home Secretary, and in Northern Ireland of the Ministry of
Home Affairs; elsewhere it is the responsibility of probation committees appointed by
magistrates in England and Wales, and by local authorities in Scotland (except for
certain ex officio members), but first appointments are subject to confirmation by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively. Training facilities
in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the advice of the Probation
Advisory and Training Board and are made available, by arrangement, to Northern
Ireland officers. In Scotland training is provided during the first year of appointment
and before the officer enters on the duties of the service.
Research
Research into the causes and prevention of crime and into various methods of dealing
with offenders is increasingly recognised as of vital importance in dealing with the
problems of delinquency, more especially in view of the continued rise in crime which
has been a disquieting feature of the social scene since the end of the second world
war. Such research is being undertaken by the Institute of Criminology in Cambridge
University, which, in addition to its research activities, conducts advanced courses in
criminology for people engaged in work relating to the treatment of offenders and the
administration of the criminal law, and a postgraduate course in criminology. A
number of other academic organisations, including the Tavistock Institute of Human
Relations, the London School of Economics, Birkbeck College, the Institute of
Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital, Denmark Hill, the Department of Social Ad¬
ministration at Manchester University, the University of Oxford and, in Scotland, the
Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, are also studying various aspects of the
problem. The research unit at the Home Office, which is associated with some of
the academic projects, also has its own programme of research.
io8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Special Inquiries
In addition to research, special inquiries into particular questions are conducted as
necessary, by advisory bodies or specially appointed committees. Reports have been
issued by the Advisory Councils on the Treatment of Offenders (see p. 100) on such
matters as alternatives to short-term imprisonment, the after-care and supervision of
discharged prisoners, the treatment of young offenders, and corporal punishment.
Among other committees which have submitted reports are the Home Office
Departmental Committee on Children and Young Persons, which made 125 recom¬
mendations on various legal and administrative aspects of the working of the law in
England and Wales concerning young delinquents and children in need of care or
protection; and the Interdepartmental Committee on the Business of the Criminal
Courts, which recommended a number of changes in the present arrangements in
England and Wales for bringing to trial persons charged with criminal offences and for
providing the courts with the information necessary to enable them to select the most
appropriate treatment for offenders. Many of the recommendations of the latter
committee have already been given effect in the Criminal Justice Administration
Act, 1962.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised and controlled on a local basis under
the guidance of those ministers of the Crown who are responsible for the maintenance
of law and order in their respective countries. In England and Wales the responsible
minister is the Home Secretary; in Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland. In
Northern Ireland the police force is controlled by an Inspector-General, who is
responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
POLICE IN GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
There are 158 regular police forces in Great Britain: 125 in England and Wales
and 33 in Scotland. Each of these forces (between which there is close and constant
co-operation) is responsible for a separate police district. In England and Wales the
forces are defined according to area of responsibility as: county forces; borough forces;
combined forces, which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over neighbour¬
ing counties or boroughs; the Metropolitan Police Force, which is responsible for an
area of approximately fifteen miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding the City
of London; and the City of London force. In Scotland there are county forces, burgh
forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland police forces vary considerably in size according
to the area and population which they serve. Thus the Metropolitan Police Force has
a strength of approximately 17,000, while that of the smallest force in Scotland is 18.
The actual strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approximately
85,000, including women. This is somewhat below the desirable figure, but recruitment
has improved.
Part-time special constables assist the regular police. There are also police forces
maintained by certain public services: these include the British Transport Commission
police, the civil aviation constabulary, the Port of London Authority police and other
dock and harbour forces (having duties and powers analogous to those of ordinary
constables but limited to the premises and immediate neighbourhoods of their employ¬
ers), and the police of the Service departments—the Admiralty constabulary, the
War Department constabulary which guards War Office lands and military property,
LAW AND ORDER
IO9
the Royal Marine police, who are employed chiefly in dockyards, and the Air Ministry
constabulary.
Police Authorities
In the counties of England and Wales the police authority is the standing joint
committee, half of whose members are members of the county council while the other
half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs the police authority is known as the
‘watch committee’ and is elected by the council from among its members. The police
authority of a combined force is made up of representatives of the constituent areas as
prescribed in the scheme under which they combine.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary. In
the City of London, the Court of Common Council is the police authority, although it
usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county or joint county
council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain efficient
police forces for their areas. They are responsible for the appointment of the chief
officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary in the
provinces of England and Wales, of the Crown in the City of London, and, in Scotland,
of the Secretary of State. In the Metropolitan Police district, the chief officer of police
and his immediate subordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation
of the Home Secretary.
The police authorities are also responsible (with the approval of the Home Secretary
or the Secretary of State for Scotland) for the size of their forces; for paying the
members of the forces their salaries; for providing and maintaining police premises;
and for exercising disciplinary functions in relation to the most senior officers.
Central Authority
Co-ordination in the administration of the police service is exercised through detailed
police regulations which are made by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State
for Scotland under the Police Act, 1919, the Police (Scotland) Act, 1956, and under
the Police (Pensions) Acts. The police regulations cover such matters as organisation,
discipline, pay, allowances, pensions, clothing, and conditions of service of the mem¬
bers of all police forces to which the Acts apply.
The Police Council for Great Britain, which is representative on the one side of all
ranks of the police service and on the other of the local police authorities, the Home
Office and the Scottish Home Department, has power to reach agreement on conditions
of service in the police forces, including police pay, and on certain procedural matters.
It also advises the ministers on police pensions and any other matter which may be
referred to it by the ministers or any other body concerned. In their supervisory
responsibilities the ministers are assisted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary.
Each inspector is responsible for a certain number of forces, and satisfies himself of
their continuing efficiency by annual inspection, ad hoc visits and consultations when
particular problems arise. The inspectors report to the ministers on the condition of
all the forces, with the exception of the Metropolitan Police Force, for which the
Home Secretary has responsibility as police authority and which is not inspected.
All police authorities receive a Government grant equal to half their net expenditure
reckoned in accordance with the provisions of orders made under the Miscellaneous
Financial Provisions Act, 1950 (as regards England and Wales), and the Police (Scot-
no
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
land) Act, 1946 (as regards Scotland). These orders empower the Home Secretary
and the Secretary of State for Scotland to withhold the grant, in whole or in part,
permanently or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a
police area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Police Officers
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular police
officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension;
members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost entirely of police
pensioners or men with previous police experience who are prepared to give whole¬
time paid service to a particular force in an emergency, whether national or local;
and special constables, who are volunteers who perform short periods of duty without
pay in their spare time from their normal occupations.1
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages of 19
and 30, although an exception may be made, in special circumstances approved by the
ministers and on the recommendation of the appointing authority, in the case of men
of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between the
ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and 30 years old. The standard police
ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan Police district, are: chief constable,
superintendent, inspector, sergeant and constable. The following ranks may also be
adopted in areas where varying degrees of responsibility make intermediate ranks
necessary: assistant chief constable, chief superintendent, chief inspector and, in
England and Wales only, station inspector, station sergeant and acting sergeant. In
the Metropolitan Police district the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis. He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners.
Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders; thereafter (i.e. from chief
superintendent downwards) the ranks are the same as in the rest of the country. In the
City of London the ranks are the same as in the provinces, except that the chief officer
is the Commissioner of Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political bias,
but must also be seen to be free of it. The Police Act, 1919, however, laid it down
that the police should have statutory representative organisations of their own. There
are now several organisations representing the various police ranks, including the
Police Federation in England and Wales and the Scottish Police Federation, to which
all inspectors, sergeants and constables belong. Any branch or committee of the
federations may make representations to the chief officer or police authority concerned
or to the appropriate minister. Delegates from the joint central committees of the two
federations sit on the police councils.
Police Cadets
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among youths between 16 and 18
years of age, so that prospective constables shall have had some training and have
gained sufficient insight into police duties to make reasonably certain that they wish
to stay in the police service before they undergo constable’s training. A few forces
also recruit girl cadets.
1 In Scotland the employment of special constables, other than in emergencies, is subject
to strict limitations.
LAW AND ORDER
III
Civil Staff
A number of police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switchboard
operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release uniformed person¬
nel for police duties.
Traffic Wardens
Traffic wardens are employed in London and several other areas to assist the police
in dealing with the problems created by parked vehicles. In specially designated areas
traffic wardens have power to give motorists who have committed certain parking
offences an option to pay a fixed penalty to the clerk of the appropriate magistrates’
court instead of having their cases tried.
Police Duties
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office.
His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common law, are
exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself. Thus, a police officer is personally answerable at law for
any wrongful act. He is not the servant of the police authority, and in discharging his
duties must rely on his own good sense, discretion and knowledge of the law.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from the pro¬
tection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic control to criminal
investigation, the apprehension of offenders, and, in England and Wales, the prepara¬
tion and presentation of straightforward cases in magistrates’ courts.
All police forces have their own criminal investigation departments, and many
have other specialised departments, including motor patrols, river police (in districts
which include long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted branch (for main¬
taining order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
Centrally Run Services
During recent years a number of common services have been established to supple¬
ment those provided by the police authorities for their own use. In England and Wales
such services include a training service, which provides eight residential district
training centres and a central police college; an installation and maintenance service
of wireless equipment for the police; a forensic science service, which provides labora¬
tories for the use of regional groups of forces; and arrangements for conducting
centralised police promotion examinations. In Scotland there is a central police
college, which provides training courses for recruits and courses of higher training;
but the installation and maintenance of wireless equipment is a direct charge upon
the police authorities concerned and there is no centrally run forensic science service.
The resources of the Glasgow police force’s criminal investigation department (which
includes an extensive laboratory service) are, however, made available to other forces,
and the universities render assistance when required.
A number of national services are provided by the Metropolitan Police Force, whose
functions in this respect include: (i) the maintenance of criminal records1 and finger¬
prints, which are available to all police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain
foreign forces; (2) the publication of the Police Gazette,2 which contains particulars
1 There are, in addition to the Criminal Record Office at New Scotland Yard, a Scottish Criminal
Record Office in Glasgow, and regional criminal record offices in parts of England and Wales.
2 The Scottish Criminal Record Office in Glasgow is responsible for the publication of the
Scottish Police Gazette.
112

of people wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without
charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Common¬
wealth and foreign forces; (3) the organisation and control of the special branch of the
criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard, whose duties include the
physical protection of royalty, some ministers, and distinguished foreign visitors;
and (4) the carrying out of extradition orders made by the courts. The Metropolitan
Police Force also provides the United Kingdom bureau of the International Criminal
Police Organisation (Interpol). For certain of these services, the Metropolitan Police
Force receives an additional Exchequer grant.
Royal Commission on the Police
A Royal Commission on the Police was appointed in i960 to review the constitu¬
tional position of the police throughout Great Britain and the arrangements for their
remuneration, administration and control. The commission issued an interim report
in November i960, recommending substantial increases in the pay of constables, on
which the Government took immediate action. The final report, issued in May 1962,
included recommendations for a reduction in the number of separate police forces;
for greater uniformity in the composition and functions of local police authorities;
for an extension of the responsibility and powers of the Home Secretary and the
Secretary of State for Scotland in regard to the efficiency of the police services; for
the appointment of a chief inspector of constabulary for the whole of Great Britain
and of additional regional inspectors; and for the establishment of a new central unit
for planning and research.
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector General,
who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. In undertakes the policing of the
whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the Northern Ireland Exchequer
with a nominal contribution from the county borough of Belfast.
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 3,000. The Inspector
General has, under his immediate command, a deputy inspector general, a commissioner
for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector for each of the six counties. The area is
further sub-divided into districts, each district coming under a district inspector and
each sub-district under a head constable or a sergeant. Conditions of service and pay
follow closely on the lines of the police service in Great Britain, and the general
duties pertaining to the various ranks are much the same. Although the more senior
ranks bear different titles, the ranks of head constable, sergeant and constable are
broadly equivalent to the three junior ranks in the police service of Great Britain.
The Ulster Special Constabulary also comes under the direction of the Inspector
General. In the main, this force is a part-time body and, apart from training, its duties
consist in affording assistance to the Royal Ulster Constabulary on special occasions;
if necessary, however, its part-time personnel may be mobilised for full-time duty.

DEFENCE
An adequate general survey of the principles which govern United Kingdom
defence policy is possible only in the wider context of the United Kingdom’s inter¬
national relationships, its place in the Commonwealth and in world affairs, and its
responsibilities towards British dependent and protected territories—subjects which,
as explained in the Introduction, fall outside the scope of this handbook. This chapter,
therefore, can attempt little more than an outline of the present pattern of the
development of Britain’s armed forces.
DEFENCE POLICY
The national defence policy has been increasingly based on the realisation that no
country can protect itself in isolation and the defence of Britain is possible only as
part of a system of collective defence. Policy is therefore determined largely by Britain’s
obligations to contribute to the collective defence organisations of which it is a member
—the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Western European Union
(WEU), the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO, formerly the Baghdad Pact), and
the SEATO defence system in South-East Asia—and to contribute to the long-range
nuclear forces of the West, as well as to discharge its own special responsibilities in
many parts of the world; and defence planning is carried out in close co-operation
with Britain’s partners in these organisations.
Close liaison is maintained with other Commonwealth countries, between whose
forces there is considerable standardisation of equipment, weapons and training
techniques and interchange of personnel.
At the same time the United Kingdom continues to work for the attainment of
international agreement on disarmament under effective control.
Machinery of Higher Defence Planning
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests, under the ultimate control of
Parliament (which makes annual financial provision for defence needs), with the
Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Subject to this supreme responsibility, defence
problems which engage the collective responsibility of the Cabinet are normally handled
on the Cabinet’s behalf by the Defence Committee, meeting under the chairmanship
of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister determines which members of the Defence
Committee should attend particular meetings of the committee, according to the
subjects to be discussed and the ministerial responsibilities involved. The Minister
of Defence, who is a member of the Cabinet and of the Defence Committee, has
authority to decide (subject to the responsibilities of the Cabinet and the Defence
Committee) all major matters of defence policy affecting the size, shape, organisation
and disposition of the armed forces, and their weapons and war-like equipment and
supply (including defence research and development). He is also ministerially responsible
to the Prime Minister for the execution of military operations approved by the Cabinet
113
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
II4
or the Defence Committee. Recommendations for the more important Service appoint¬
ments are submitted by the Service Ministers (the First Lord of the Admiralty, the
Secretary of State for War, who deals with the Army, and the Secretary of State for
Air) for the approval of the Minister of Defence, who, in appropriate cases, seeks the
covering approval of the Prime Minister.
The Service Ministers, working through the Board of Admiralty and the Army
and Air Councils, are responsible for the efficiency and administration of the three
Services. The Minister of Aviation is responsible for the supply to the Services of
aircraft, guided and nuclear weapons, and electronic equipment. All these ministers
are members of the Defence Committee; consultation on defence policy between them
and the Minister of Defence and discussion of inter-Service problems take place at
meetings of the Defence Board, of which the Minister of Defence is chairman.
The Chiefs of Staff Committee, which comprises the Chief of the Defence Staff
(who is principal military adviser to the Minister of Defence), as chairman, and the
professional heads of the three Services, is collectively responsible to the Government
for professional advice on strategy and military operations and on the military implica¬
tions of defence policy generally. Its collective advice is given to the Minister of
Defence by the Chief of the Defence Staff, who tenders his own advice, together with
the views of the other members of the committee, if the committee cannot reach
agreement. The Chief of the Defence Staff is responsible for issuing operational
orders, and he is entitled to call on the respective Chiefs of Staff for assistance from
the services of the Naval, General and Air Staffs. The Chiefs of Staff are members
of the Defence Board, are in attendance at meetings of the Defence Committee and
may be invited to attend meetings of the full Cabinet as necessary; they have at all
times a right of access to the Minister of Defence and, when necessary, to the Prime
Minister. A new Joint Service Staff at the Ministry of Defence was set up in 1962 to
advise the Chiefs of Staff on all aspects of joint Service operations and training.
Britain’s defence policy is reviewed each year in a White Paper presented to Parlia¬
ment by the Minister of Defence immediately before the detailed Estimates of the
Service Departments.
The Five-Year Programmes
After the end of the second world war the strength of the United Kingdom armed
forces was drastically reduced. It was not until growing world tension made it inevitable
that this trend was first halted and then reversed. Following the outbreak of war in Korea
the United Kingdom embarked on a programme for building up its defence forces.
During the next three years annual defence expenditure was nearly doubled, absorbing
some ten per cent of the gross national product in 1953; the period of compulsory
national service was lengthened; and the total strength of the active forces increased
to a peak of over 800,000. With the end of hostilities in Korea, and in the face of
rising costs, the programme was revised somewhat, but in the years that followed
the maintenance and equipment of the forces continued to impose a very heavy
burden on the economy in terms of manpower and financial commitments, including
expenditure in foreign currencies to maintain British forces overseas.
The White Paper for 1957—Defence: Outline of Future Policy (Cmnd. 124)—set out
a five-year plan for the reshaping of the defence forces in the light of changes in the
international situation, the rapid progress in military technology, and the need to
relieve the burden which defence requirements had been imposing on the country’s
financial and economic strength. The progress of this programme, described in the
White Paper as involving ‘the biggest change in military policy ever made in normal
DEFENCE
JI5
times’ was reviewed in the four following White Papers. The 1962 White Paper, The
Next Five Years (Cmnd. 1639), set out tlie second five-year plan.
The basic objectives of Britain’s defence policy, the 1962 White Paper stated, will
remain:
{a) ‘to maintain the security of this country;
(b) ‘to carry out our obligations for the protection of British territories overseas
and those to whom we owe a special duty by treaty or otherwise;
(c) ‘to make our contribution to the defence of the free world and the prevention
of wrar in accordance with the arrangements we have with individual countries
and under collective security treaties’.
‘We seek to exercise military power’ the statement continued, ‘only when and where
it is essential for the furtherance of these objectives, to do this with forces whose total
claims on our resources are consistent with the maintenance of a sound economy, and
to devise a deployment and a strategy that can rapidly be adapted to changing cir¬
cumstances.’ 4
The plans provided for smaller, more closely integrated, highly trained, all-regular
forces with increased mobility, equipped with the most modern weapons and organised
on up-to-date lines, and for a central strategic reserve to be maintained in Britain
with means of transport, including airlift, to take it rapidly to the scene of any trouble.
Deployment Overseas
The deployment of United Kingdom forces is world-wide, in fulfilment of responsi¬
bilities under the regional defence organisations of which the United Kingdom is a
member, and for the defence of United Kingdom dependencies. A considerable part
of these forces is committed to NATO on the continent of Europe. Forces are also
maintained in the Near, Middle and Far East; East, Central and North Africa; and
the Caribbean.
Where appropriate, unified commands are being established overseas. In October
1959 a unified command (with headquarters in Aden) was established for all United
Kingdom land and air forces in the Arabian Peninsula, Persian Gulf and East Africa,
together with the naval forces allotted to the Persian Gulf, and in 1962 it was decided
to introduce a similar arrangement, as soon as practicable, for all three Services in
Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong (with headquarters in Singapore). The main base
for the support of CENTO is in Cyprus and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief
is responsible for all British forces in the Near East. In the Mediterranean there are
Army garrisons for local defence and naval and air operating facilities in Malta and
Gibraltar.
THE DEFENCE BUDGET
In recent years defence has accounted for about a quarter of all central Government
ordinary expenditure. The cost of the defence programme for 1962-63 was estimated
at ^i)72I-°6 million, or 7 per cent of the gross national product. Britain’s contribution
to the Western nuclear deterrent accounts for some 10 per cent of this total.
Britain’s contribution to the NATO shield forces involves a deployment of forces
overseas and a consequent heavy burden on the country’s balance of payments. The
agreement reached in 1962, whereby the Federal Republic of Germany will contribute
£54 million in each of the two years 1962-63 and 1963-64 towards the support costs
n6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), has somewhat relieved this strain. This
figure represents three-quarters of the foreign exchange expenditure on British forces
in Germany. In 1961 the expenditure in foreign currency for the maintenance of
British forces abroad amounted to some £227 million.
The allocation of finance between the various Services is shown in Table 5.

million.
MANPOWER
The 1957 five-year plan provided for the ending of National Service and for a
reduction of about 300,000 in the combined strength of the three Services, which
stood at nearly 700,000 (adult United Kingdom males) in 1957. The present aim is
for a defence force of between 390,000 and 400,000 professional Service men, with
the highest possible proportion in effective combat units, backed up by an equal
number of civilians, to whom have been transferred many duties formerly performed
by uniformed members of the forces.
Under the National Service Acts, 1948-55, fit male British subjects between the ages
of 18 and 26 ordinarily resident in Great Britain were liable to serve for two years’
whole-time service in the regular forces, and thereafter three and a half years’ part-time
service in an auxiliary force. Deferment of National Service was granted in certain
cases (for instance, for students, trainees, those employed in certain occupations in the
national interest), while postponement of call-up could be granted on grounds of
exceptional hardship.
There has been no call-up of National Service men since November i960 and it was
intended that by the end of 1962 the armed forces should be composed entirely of
regulars. The growth of international tension over the Berlin crisis and the temporary
shortage of manpower created during the transition to an all-regular army, however,
led to the passing of the Army Reserve Act in 1962. This provided, in addition to the
creation of a new form of volunteer reserve, known as the Territorial Army Emergency
Reserve (the ‘Ever-Readies’), within the Territorial Army (see p. 127), for permissive
power to retain serving National Service men for up to six months and to recall ex-
National Service men for a similar period during their statutory period of 3^ years’
part-time reserve. An analysis of the strength of the forces in April 1962, with estimates
for 1963, is given in Table 6.

Arrangements for recruitment and training of regulars are summarised for each
Service separately later in this chapter. Pay and pensions are reviewed at intervals of
not more than every two years and other steps are being taken to improve the conditions
of Service life, including an extensive building programme.
A Regular Forces Resettlement Service, set up by the Minister of Labour in 1957,
assists regular officers and other ranks to find civilian employment on leaving the
forces (see Chapter 15, Labour).

or Andover (Hampshire), go to the Joint Services Staff College at Chesham (Bucking¬
hamshire), where they live and work together and where particular attention is paid
to the inter-Service aspects of staff work. This college caters for about 150 students
a vear from the Navy, Army and Air Force, the Civil Service, and other Common-
wealth countries. Finally, there is the Imperial Defence College in London, to which
are sent a few specially selected and more senior officers from the Services, the Civ
Service, and from other Commonwealth countries.
SUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for the supply to the Services of aircraft
guided weapons (including ballistic missiles), nuclear weapons, and certain radar and
other electronic equipment. The individual Service departments are responsible for the
procurement of other weapons, stores and equipment, except that responsibility for
such stores and equipment when used by more than one Service normally rests with
the War Office, which in many cases is the largest user.
Production and Researcli
Production for the Services is carried out to a great extent by private industry
on a contract basis, but also by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards
and other establishments operated by the Ministry of Aviation, the Admiralty and the
War Office. The Ministry of Aviation’s research establishments carry out research and
development on behalf of the War Office and the Air Ministry, and also forcertam
aspects of Admiralty requirements, in particular naval aviation. Among the mos
important of these establishments are: the Royal Aircraft Establishments, Farnborough
and Bedford; the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern; the National Gas Turbine
Establishment, Farnborough; the Guided Weapons Establishment (an outstation of
the Royal Aircraft Establishment) at Aberporth, Cardiganshire; the Rocket Propu
Establishment, Westcott, Buckinghamshire; and the Aircraft and Armament Exper-
mental Establishment, Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. War Office control ed research
establishments include the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment,
Sevenoaks, Kent; and the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Estab1^
ment Chobham, Surrey. The Admiralty research establishments (see p. 121) c y
out research on ships, maritime equipment and weapons and also on certain kinds of
electronic equipment on behalf of all three Services. Current production and develop¬
ment programmes are summarised later in this chapter in the sections dealing with the
^Development1 and production of nuclear warheads to meet Service requirements
are carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 215) under contract from
the Ministry of Aviation, which is responsible for the .completed weapons. The Atomic
Energy Authority is also co-operating with the Admiralty m research on t e e p
m^LntSrend0n^seP8 at^he Alomic Energy Research Establishment
Harwell, and have also been attached to industrial firms manufacturing guided

gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing surface-to-surface missiles has been

set up on South Uist in the Hebrides. There is close collaboration with the United
States in the exchange of information and visits by technical personnel.
Some military equipment, including guided weapons, aircraft and radar equipment,
is being supplied to Britain by the United States under the Mutual Security Programme.
Part of this equipment is manufactured in the United Kingdom and financed by the
United States under the ‘off-shore procurement’ programme. Under this programme
the United Kingdom is also making equipment for other NATO countries in Europe.
Wherever possible, weapons and other military equipment are standardised with
NATO allies. Ihe United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, for
example, are co-operating in the development of tanks, light tracked vehicles and
anti-tank weapons.
In addition to any orders for warships that may be placed from abroad with British
yards, ships of the Royal Navy which have become surplus to United Kingdom
requirements are made available to the Governments of other Commonwealth
countries and to those of other friendly nations.
Nuclear Weapons
During the second world war British research workers played an essential part
in the allied project that led to the production of the first atomic bombs in the United
States. After the war the exchange of information on atomic weapons was for a time
prohibited by an Act1 of the United States Congress (later amended), and the United
Kingdom therefore developed its own independently. The first test explosion of a
British atomic weapon was carried out in 1952 in the Monte Bello Islands, off the
north-west coast of Australia; further tests took place a year later near the Woomera
rocket range, in central Australia, and early in 1954 it was announced that delivery of
atomic weapons to the armed forces had begun. Further series of tests were held in
1956 and 1957, in the Monte Bello Islands and at the weapons proving ground at
Maralinga, in the South Australian desert. Britain now has a substantial stockpile of
kiloton weapons.
In 1955 the Government announced its intention to proceed with the development
of thermonuclear weapons. The first test explosions were successfully carried out in
May and June 1957 near Christmas Island in the central Pacific, and further tests
were carried out in the same area later in 1957 and in 1958. The production of British
megaton weapons is now proceeding steadily and the exchange of information with
the United States2 has enabled important technical advances to be made in the design
of nuclear warheads which will permit a significant increase in the rate of production.
In March 1962 a further underground test took place in Nevada (USA).
The chief means of delivering these weapons are at present the RAF’s medium
bombers of the V-class. The development is proceeding of Blue Steel propelled stand¬
off bombs which will greatly reduce the vulnerability of a bomber aircraft by enabling
it to release its bombs a long distance from the target. In accordance with an agreement
signed between the United Kingdom and United States Governments in 1958,
1 Atomic Energy Act, 1946 (known as the McMahon Act), subsequently replaced by the
Atomic Energy Act, 1954. Substantial relaxations were made by amending legislation passed in
1958.
2 An Anglo-American agreement, signed in July 1958, made possible the exchange of informa¬
tion on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. This agreement was amended and
supplemented by a further agreement, signed in May 1959, which contained provisions to enable
the United Kingdom to buy from the United States component parts of atomic weapons and
weapons systems, other than actual warheads, and to make possible the exchange of nuclear
materials between the two countries.
E

launching sites have been provided for US Thor intermediate-range ballistic missiles;
it was stated in August 1962, however, that this arrangement would be ended during
the next year. The possibilities of mobile launchers (aircraft or submarines) for
long-range delivery of nuclear warheads are being investigated. The United States
air-launched missile Skybolt, which is under development in the United States, will
be introduced into Bomber Command by an agreement reached in i960 between the
United Kingdom and the United States Governments. The missile, which will have
a British nuclear warhead, is expected to be in service by 1965 and will be carried by
the Vulcan Mark 2 bombers. Research is in progress into defensive measures against
ballistic missiles and, under agreements between the United Kingdom and United
States Governments signed in i960 and 1961, a joint Ballistic Missile Early Warning
Station, which will come into operation during 1963, is being built at Fylingdales
Moor in Yorkshire and a Missile Defence Alarm Station (using space satellites to
detect missiles) is to be established at Kirkbride, Cumberland. The United States is
providing the equipment for these stations. The United Kingdom provides facilities for a
depot ship in the Holy Loch (Firth of Clyde, Scotland) for United States Polaris nuclear
submarines, as part of the British contribution to strengthening the NATO alliance.
THE ROYAL NAVY
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty, which has three civilian
and six naval members. The First Lord of the Admiralty is the minister responsible
to Parliament for the Navy. The other civilian members of the Board of Admiralty
are the Civil Lord, a junior minister, and the Permanent Secretary, who is a civil
servant and responsible for the general conduct of Admiralty business, including
finance. The naval members are the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff; the
Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel; the Third Sea Lord and Controller
of the Navy, whose responsibilities include ship construction and repair, research and
the provision and repair of naval aircraft; the Fourth Sea Lord, Chief of Supplies and
Transport and Vice-Controller, who is also responsible for maintenance and dockyard
organisation; the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, who assists the First Sea Lord; and the
Deputy Chief of Naval Staff and Fifth Sea Lord, responsible for stating requirements
for ships, aircraft and weapons and for laying down Admiralty policy on aircraft
research and development.
The Shape of the Fleet
The new Navy that is coming into being is smaller than that of the past but highly
mobile and flexible. The aircraft carrier will continue to be the core, and grouped round
the carriers will be supporting ships carrying the latest weapons for dealing with air,
surface and underwater attacks and capable of acting by themselves on detached
service. Seaborne task forces will include commando ships and assault ships designed
to carry a striking force of troops with their tanks, guns and logistic backing.
During 1962 there were 140 ships in the operational Fleet (including 3 aircraft
carriers, 2 commando ships, 4 cruisers, 52 destroyers and frigates and 30 submarines),
together with 37 engaged on trials and training and 71 support ships and auxiliaries.
The modern carriers are equipped with the angled flight deck, the steam catapult,
the automatic aircraft positioning device, and the mirror and ‘Audio’ landing aids
(all British inventions), and the most advanced type of air warning and direction
system. A new carrier, the Hermes, equipped to carry the latest aircraft now in pro¬
duction for the Fleet Air Arm (see p. 122), joined the Fleet in i960. Two former
aircraft carriers, the Bulwark and the Albion, have been converted into commando
DEFENCE
121
carriers, designed to carry a Royal Marine commando (some 750 men), together with
helicopters, landing craft and vehicles.
Three ‘Tiger’ class cruisers, with fully automatic armament and the latest control
equipment, have been completed. Of six ‘County’ class guided missile destroyers on
order, two are due to commission by the spring of 1963 and the construction of two
more is well advanced. Their armament includes the Seaslug missile, a most effective
weapon for the interception of attacking aircraft, and the shorter range Seacat missile
for close air defence.
The last of eight fast long-range conventional submarines of the ‘Porpoise’ class was
completed in 1961-62 and the ‘Oberon’ class began to come into service in the same
year. The Navy’s first nuclear-propelled submarine, the Dreadnought, was launched in
i960 and is due to commission in 1962-63. It incorporates a United States nuclear
propulsion unit. Three all-British nuclear submarines, of which the first will be the
Valiant, have been or are to be ordered. The speed, range and endurance of these
submarines will enable them to operate independently of fixed bases.
One of the main purposes of Reserve ships is to have ready, at short notice, ships
to replace those in the Active Fleet which are damaged or withdrawn for refit or
modernisation. Under the new defence policy the number of Reserve ships is smaller
than in the past, but they are being maintained at a higher state of readiness.
Afloat support to the Fleet for replenishment at sea, or in harbours or anchorages,
is provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service, comprising tankers, store-issuing
ships, tugs and salvage vessels. These ships fly the Blue Ensign and are manned by
Merchant Navy officers and seamen.
Research and Development
Much experimental work has been carried out, with the Atomic Energy Authority,
on nuclear propelled submarines and a nuclear submarine power unit prototype under
construction at Dounreay (see p. 215) will enter its final stage in 1962-63. Fundamental
investigations are also in hand for the development of counter-measures against
submarines with increased underwater speed. The nuclear submarines, with their
sensitive detection gear and armament of homing torpedoes, will be specially effective
anti-submarine weapons. To provide the Navy with facilities for basic education in
nuclear engineering and research, a low-power training reactor is being installed at the
Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Research is proceeding with the aim of providing
automatic means for handling tactical information in warships.
Research and development work to meet the Navy’s modern requirements for
weapons is now concentrated in two establishments. At Portsdown (near Portsmouth),
the design and development of ship-borne gunnery and guided missile systems is
carried out. At Portland (Dorset), all aspects of work on underwater detection are
co-ordinated with work on underwater weapons.
Commands and Naval Dockyards
The Navy’s main home commands are Portsmouth, Plymouth, Scotland (Rosyth)
and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. In the North Atlantic and Mediterranean
area, United Kingdom naval forces (assigned to NATO) are equipped predominantly
for an anti-submarine role, and consist of two aircraft carriers, two cruisers and a
number of destroyers, frigates and submarines. In the Far East, the fleet (based on
Singapore) is an all-purpose force of one aircraft carrier, one commando carrier and
one cruiser, together with destroyers, frigates and smaller vessels. Smaller naval forces
operate under the Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic and South America Station;
122
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Senior Naval Officer, West Indies Station; and the Flag Officer, Middle East,
who is also Naval Deputy to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Command.
The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth provide the Navy
with major supplies and repair facilities at home. Singapore and Gibraltar are the
main dockyards overseas.
Fleet Air Arm
The Supermarine Scimitar, which can carry an atomic bomb and which is fitted,
owing to its high speed, with a ‘flap-blowing’ system to facilitate landing on carriers,
and the de Havilland Sea Vixen, with armament which includes an air-to-air guided
weapon, the Firestreah, provide the main strike and fighter strength of the Fleet Air
Arm. The new long-range strike aircraft, the Buccaneer, which can carry an atomic
bomb, will embark in Ark Royal early in 1963. The United States air-to-surface
missile, Bullpup, has been adopted for use in naval fighter and strike aircraft.
The anti-submarine turbo-prop Fairey Gannet, in service since 1954, has now been
replaced in that role by helicopters; Gannets are still used in the search role. Reinforcing
the Whirlwind and the Dragonfly, a more powerful all-weather helicopter, the Wessex,
which came into service in the autumn of 1961, is in front line service as the Navy’s
main anti-submarine aircraft. It carries both homing torpedoes and dipping asdic.
During 1962 it embarked in carriers and in the guided missile-carrying destroyers,
and a commando troop-carrying version armed with the SS11, a French anti-tank
guided missile, came into service for the commando ships. Initial orders have been
placed for the Wasp, a light torpedo-carrying helicopter (formerly known as the
Westland P 531).
Royal Marines
The Corps of Royal Marines is a body of men trained for service on sea or land.
Its official existence dates from 1664. The present-day functions of the corps are:
(1) to provide personnel for Commandos;
(2) to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties required
for amphibious assault; and
(3) to supply detachments for H.M. ships, which {a) play their part in the routine
duties of their ship, {b) provide emergency landing parties, and (c) carry out
guard duties and the like.
Women’s Royal Naval Service
The Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) is an integral part of the Navy. Its
members serve both at home and overseas. It has its own disciplinary code. Nursing
services for the Navy are provided by Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service
(QARNNS).
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Navy
The main entry for naval officers is the Cadet Entry. Cadetships on the General
List (Seaman, Engineer, Electrical1 and Supply) are available to young men between
1 The Electrical and Engineering specialisations were amalgamated into the one Engineering
specialisation in the summer of 1961. The amalgamation will be progressively implemented as
officers trained or experienced in the new departmental responsibilities become available for
Fleet appointments. The organisation of all units of the Fleet will take from two to three years,
the cross-training of individual officers will continue for about six years and the initial Engineering
training of General List officers is being adjusted; the first officers so trained reached the
Fleet during 1962.

the ages of approximately 17 and 19! years. A number of scholarships are awarded
to boys between the ages of 15 and 17I; these give help with maintenance and school
fees for the two years before a boy goes to Dartmouth. Those selected enter Britannia
Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in September each year. Here they spend a year
doing Basic Naval Training, ashore and afloat, followed by a year as midshipmen
at sea in the Fleet. The Seamen and Supply Officers then return for a further year at
Dartmouth for academic training, followed by specialist courses and a further year
at sea. The Engineer and Electrical Officers study for a degree, for which specially
selected officers go to Cambridge, the others reading for an external London degree at
the Royal Naval Engineering College, Manadon. There is an entry into the Engineering
specialisation of the General List for graduates in mechanical or electrical engineering.
Candidates must be under the age of 25. A few direct entry permanent commissions
are also available to graduates as Instructor Officers.
Short service commissions on the Supplementary List for Seaman duties, for air¬
crew duties with the Fleet Air Arm or in electrical specialisation are available to young
men with appropriate qualifications. Doctors, dental surgeons and instructor officers
can enter on short service commissions after completing their professional training;
cadetships leading to short service commissions are being introduced in the Medical
Branch. Permanent commissions are awarded according to the vacancies available.
Ratings may qualify for a commission on the General List, on the Supplementary
List for Seaman and aircrew duties, and on the Special Duties List.
Commissions in the Royal Marines are gained through similar procedures as for
Royal Navy Cadet Entry. Age limits for entry are approximately 17^—19^. Successful
candidates are given a special training, part naval and part military, which lasts three
and a half years. Other ranks may qualify for commissions on the Royal Marines
General or Special Duties Lists.
The age limits for entry as a rating in the Navy are as follows: seaman, engineering
mechanic, electrical mechanic and naval air mechanic branches, and stores and cook
ratings in the supply and secretariat branch, 15 to 28 years; communications and naval
airman branches and writer and steward ratings in the supply and secretariat branch,
i6£ to 28; artificer apprentices, 15 to 17^; mechanician apprentices, 17^ to 23; sick
berth branch, 17^ to 28; artificers (trained), up to 28 years. The initial engagement is
for a period of 9 years over the age of 18, plus a period of three years in the Royal Fleet
Reserve. Exceptionally, for artificer apprentices it is 12 years over the age of 18. Age
limits for entry into the ranks of the Royal Marines are: marines, 17 to 28 years; junior
entry (general service duties), 16 to 17; boy buglers, 15 to i6|; junior musicians, 14 to
17I; musicians (trained), 17^ to 28 years. Women may enter the Women’s Royal
Naval Service between the ages of 17! and 28 years for an initial period of 4 years;
most WRNS officers are selected from serving ratings.
On entry, all naval and WRNS ratings and Royal Marines other ranks are given
a basic training at the appropriate school or shore establishment and, in most branches,
are given further training during their careers to fit them for promotion within their
branch, to qualify them for the award of a higher specialist qualification or to prepare
them for Special Duties which are not covered by the standard promotion courses.
Reserve and Auxiliary Forces
The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) consists of volunteer reserves—serving at sea
in the Merchant Navy or the fishing fleets or in civilian employment ashore—who
carry out training in time of peace to meet the Navy’s mobilisation requirements.
Other reserves include the Royal Fleet Reserve (RFR), composed of men who have

completed their service as regulars; the Royal Naval Special Reserve (RNSR), which
includes most of the National Service men who are discharging their liability for part-
time service; the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve (RMFVR); and the Women's
Royal Naval Reserve (WRNR).
Mine watching Service
The Minewatching Service, a civilian organisation composed of men and women
volunteers, is responsible in time of war for manning posts around the coast and
overlooking the main navigable waterways for the purpose of spotting, plotting and
reporting the position of mines dropped from aircraft. It would also provide Port
Parties, i.e. the basic local organisation for Resident Naval Officers and Naval Officers-
in-Charge who would be appointed to minor ports. Some of the duties entail service
afloat in small craft.
Sea Cadet Corps
The Sea Cadet Corps, which is administered by the Navy League in conjunction with
the Admiralty, is a voluntary youth organisation for boys between 12 and 18 years of
age. Its origin dates from the time of the Crimean War in the mid-nineteenth century.
It aims at developing in the cadets qualities which make for good citizenship, and
through its discipline and sea training it greatly assists those boys who wish to make
their career at sea, whether in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines or Merchant Navy.
THE ARMY
The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary of
State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council are the Parlia¬
mentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial Secretary of the War Office
(who is a minister and vice-president of the Council), and the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for War, a civil servant who acts as secretary to the Council. The
Service members of the Army Council are the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,
who is assisted by the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, responsible for
strategic policy and plans, operations and intelligence, and the Deputy Chief of the
Imperial General Staff, reponsible for organisation, equipment, weapons and training;
the Adjutant-General to the Forces, responsible for manpower, personnel, discipline,
medical services, welfare, education, and the women’s services; the Quartermaster-
General to the Forces, responsible for supplies, transport and, jointly with the
Permanent Under-Secretary, works services; and the Master-General of the Ordnance,
responsible for research into, and the design, development, production and procure¬
ment of, Army stores.
Organisation of the Active Army
The active Army is organised in 30 arms and services,1 which include the Household
Cavalry, the Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry
Regiments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Corps
of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides land and wireless
communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Brigade of Guards), the regi¬
ments of the Infantry of the Line (grouped into brigades and the Parachute Regiment),
the Army Air Corps (which operates light aircraft on reconnaissance and undertakes
aerial observation and liaison work), the Royal Army Service Corps (responsible for
1 These arms and services include the women’s corps.
DEFENCE
125
the provision of food and fuel supplies and transport vehicles), the Royal Army
Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (responsible for most equipment and
stores), and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
The Women’s Royal Army Corps (formerly ATS) and the Queen Alexandra’s
Royal Army Nursing Corps (formerly QAIMNS) are both corps of the Regular
Army, their officers and other ranks being subject to military law and the Queen’s
Regulations in the same way as members of the other corps.
Within the United Kingdom, the Army is organised into Scottish, Northern,
Southern, Eastern, Western, and Northern Ireland Commands, and London District.
There are five main commands overseas: Near East Land Forces (Mediterranean),
Middle East Land Forces (Arabian Peninsula), East Africa Command, Far East
Land Forces, and the British Army of the Rhine (which forms part of Britain’s con¬
tribution to the NATO forces).
As the strengths of overseas garrisons are reduced, increased importance is being
attached to a central strategic reserve, based mainly in the United Kingdom.
Equipment
The weapons of the second world war have almost entirely disappeared and the
Army is being completely rearmed with a new range of weapons, vehicles and other
equipment.
Increasing emphasis is being placed in current plans on transportability by air, in
order to secure strategic mobility. Certain bulky items of equipment, such as heavy
tanks, cannot be transported by air but, apart from these items, air portability is a
major feature of the Army’s new equipment. Equipment transportable by air in service
or being planned includes the Wombat recoil-less anti-tank weapon, improved mortars
and light vehicles for the infantry, the Ferret scout car and the Saladin armoured car
in service with the Royal Armoured Corps, the Malkara guided missile anti-tank
system, the Thunderbird surface-to-air anti-aircraft guided weapon for the Royal
Artillery and the advanced infantry anti-tank guided weapon Swingfire. Air-portable
howitzers have also come into service.
For tactical mobility within a theatre of operations, new engineer equipment for
rapid construction and repair and new bridging equipment are on order. To assist
in achieving mobility on the battlefield itself, the Centurion tank has been equipped
with more powerful armament, pending the entry into service of its successor, the
Chieftain, now undergoing trials, and it has been decided to adopt the Vigilant anti¬
tank guided weapon system, which is small enough to be carried by its crew; certain
infra-red devices to facilitate movement and viewing by night without the aid of
visible light, are being introduced; radio communications in the field are being greatly
improved with new equipment which includes the manpack portable set, a radio
relay set, and a new set for armoured vehicles; new radar equipment to detect enemy
mortars was introduced into service in 1961; and a self-propelled gun of increased
range and performance and an improved type of armoured personnel carrier are under
trial. The Canadian Beaver, a light liaison aircraft, started coming into service in 1961.
The Regular Army has been re-equipped with the British version of the FN self¬
loading rifle, a weapon of Belgian origin adopted by the United Kingdom in the
interests of standardisation with other NATO forces; the FN general purpose machine
gun is replacing the Vickers and the Bren.
Progress is being made in the introduction of surface-to-surface guided weapons.
In the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) two artillery regiments have been equipped
with the Corporal. A number of composite regiments armed with the United States
126
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Honest John missile and the eight-inch howitzer have been introduced into BAOR.
Two of the Army’s heavy anti-aircraft regiments have been equipped with the Thunder-
bird surface-to-air missile. The Australian Malkara air-portable anti-tank guided
weapon is being delivered and training has started on the Vigilant anti-tank weapon.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Army
The normal method of entry for a regular commission in the Army is through the
Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey), where selected cadets
undergo a course lasting two years before receiving their commissions. This course
gives a general military and academic background for all arms and services, and
young officers on leaving Sandhurst then attend special arm courses to prepare them
for their own arm, some attending technical courses at the Royal Military College of
Science, Shrivenham (Berkshire) and at Cambridge University and a limited number
of Arts courses at Oxford. Cadets may enter Sandhurst direct from school or after
they have enlisted in the Army. Up to 40 scholarships are awarded each year on the
results of a competitive examination held twice a year. University graduates may be
accepted for direct regular commissions without previous service in the ranks.
The War Office also maintains a boarding school, Welbeck College, at Worksop,
Nottinghamshire, where 150 boys are educated for two years between the ages of 16
and 18 years. These boys pass into the Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Army Ordnance
Corps or the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. A few may be commissioned
into the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and Royal Army Service Corps.
Regular commissions may also be granted to officers already serving on National
Service commissions or on short service commissions. Candidates for National
Service and short service commissions are trained at the Officer Cadet School, Mons
Barracks, Aldershot. At this school the course, which consists of purely military
training, lasts for four months. Entry to the school for short service commissions is
either directly from civilian life or through the ranks.
Men wishing to enlist in the ranks must be British subjects between the ages of
17J and 30 years, of good character, medically fit and able to pass an intelligence
test. Those with certain trade qualifications may be accepted up to the age of 33 years.
Men can sign on for 22 years (with the option of finishing their Colour Service at the
end of six years or at the end of any consecutive period of three years thereafter,
provided they give six months’ notice in writing). Recruits may choose the corps in
which they wish to serve and their wishes regarding trade training are met as far as
possible.
On entry into the Army, other ranks are trained at the depots or with the training
units of the arms or services for which they have been selected. This initial training
consists of six weeks’ basic military training common to all arms and services, and a
further period of training which is special to the arm or service concerned. This latter
training varies in length of time, e.g., infantry, four weeks; Royal Signals electronic
technician, 22 weeks.
A boy can enlist in the Army as an apprentice tradesman, between the ages of 15
and 17; a junior leader, between the ages of 15 and i6|; and a drummer band boy,
piper or tailor, between the ages of 15 and 17! years.
After the age of 18 years, Army apprentice tradesmen serve nine years with the
Colours and three years in the Reserve. Boys enlisted for training with junior leaders’
units may serve either for nine years with the Colours and three years in the Reserve,
or six years with the Colours and six years in the Reserve. The object of the junior
leaders’ units is to produce long-term regular warrant officers and senior non-commis-
DEFENCE
127
sioned officers, and that of the apprentice schools is to produce warrant officer and
non-commissioned officer tradesmen for the Regular Army, some of whom may
become specialist commissioned officers.
Women may enlist into the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps or
into the Women’s Royal Army Corps between the ages of 17^ and 33 years.
The Reserve Army
With a smaller Regular Army, the Reserve Army, consisting of the Regular Reserve,
the Army Emergency Reserve and the Territorial Army, including the newly formed
Territorial Army Emergency Reserve, will have an increasingly important part to play.
The Regular Reserve consists of officers and other ranks who have served in the
Regular Army and are liable to be called out to reinforce the Regular Army in an
emergency.
The Army Emergency Reserve has as its main function to provide essential com¬
munications and the technical and administrative services required on mobilisation by
the Regular Army. It consists of specialist units and pools of skilled men—both
volunteers and part-time National Service men—who can be called upon at short
notice to fill gaps in regular units. A special category of the Army Emergency Reserve
consists of units and individuals willing to be called for service with the Regular
Army on the authority of the Secretary of State for War before a proclamation of
mobilisation has been issued.
The Territorial Army consists of volunteer officers and other ranks (including
women) and the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers; plus, until the end of National
Service, officers and men carrying out the statutory obligation of 3^ years’ part-time
service. Its main role in the event of war would be the defence of the United Kingdom
but some units might be needed overseas and all its members are liable for service in
any part of the world when the Army reserve is called out by proclamation. Volunteers
are required to attend annual camp and to carry out a minimum number of training
periods. Selected units undergo civil defence training each year and attend a civil
defence camp once every four years. While the military authorities are responsible
for policy, training and discipline, local administration of the Territorial Army is
carried out largely by county territorial and auxiliary forces associations.
The Territorial Army Emergency Reserve (the ‘Ever-Readies’) provided for in the
Army Reserve Act, 1962, is designed to provide a trained reserve ready to supplement
the Regular Army at short notice and to increase the deterrent power of the conven¬
tional Army in time of serious tension short of actual hostilities. Volunteers, who are
paid a bounty and would receive Regular rates of pay on call-up, sign on for a period of
one year, which is renewable, and are liable to be called up for a period not exceeding
six months during any individual contract.
Cadet Forces
The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and the Army Cadet Force (ACE) provide training
on Service lines for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The CCF provides
training in schools in which education is continued to the age of 17 years or above.
Cadets receive a general basic training and then specialised training in the Royal Navy,
Army or Royal Air Force sections. Contingents are affiliated to regular units and
establishments of the Services. The ACE is recruited from schools which do not raise
contingents of the CCF, and from boys who have left school. Like all the pre-Service
organisations, these forces provide citizenship and character training as well as
128
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
specifically military training. There is a training centre for the CCF and ACF at
Frimley Park, Surrey.
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council, composed of the Secretary
of State for Air, who is president, and seven other members. The Parliamentary
Under-Secretary for Air is vice-president and the Permanent Under-Secretary of
State for Air, who is a civil servant, is secretary of the Council. The Service members
are the Chief of the Air Staff, who is responsible for strategic policy and the fighting
efficiency of the RAF; the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for inter-Service
policy, operations, intelligence, liaison with other air forces, standardisation and ground
defence; the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for the preparedness for war
of the RAF, for command, staff and air training, and for policy regarding future
aircraft and weapons; the Air Member for Personnel; and the Air Member for Supply
and Organisation.
Commands
The Royal Air Force is organised into commands administered by the Air Council:
At Home: Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training, Technical
Training, Maintenance and Signals Commands.
Overseas: The Near East Air Force (headquarters in Cyprus), Air Forces, Middle
East (headquarters in Aden), the Far East Air Force (headquarters
at Changi, Singapore) and Royal Air Force, Germany (Second
Tactical Air Force, stationed in Germany as part of Britain’s con¬
tribution to the NATO forces).
Aircraft and Equipment
The spearhead of the RAF is the force of Valiant, Vulcan and Victor four-engined
jet bombers. Stocks of nuclear weapons are increasing, together with Bomber Com¬
mand’s ability to carry them. The Mark 2 versions of the Vulcan and Victor bombers
can carry the Blue Steel propelled stand-off bomb, brought into service in 1962, and
are capable of being refuelled in flight, giving them an increased range. The Vulcan 2
is being modified to carry the United States air-launched ballistic missile Skybolt
equipped with a British nuclear warhead (see p. 120). The V-bombers will thus
continue to provide an effective deterrent under independent United Kingdom
control during the next decade.
In addition to their strategic role, the V-bombers provide reconnaissance aircraft
of great range and accuracy. The present reconnaissance force is composed mainly of
Valiants, but these are being replaced by Mark 2 Victors.
The tactical force in Bomber Command is equipped with Valiants. The Canberra
light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft continues to give good service in Germany
and the Near East. A tactical strike reconnaissance aircraft of great versatility, the
TSR.2, is being developed for Army support and other tactical operations. Both the
Canberra and the TSR.2 will be able to carry the French AS30 guided bomb.
Air defence missile squadrons are now equipped with Bloodhound 1, a semi-active
homing type, and orders have been placed for Bloodhound 2, a more advanced type
which will have greatly improved performance and which will be air transportable
for overseas reinforcement. Manned fighters will, however, continue to be needed to
deal with manned aircraft, the stand-off bomber and radar-jamming aircraft, to prevent
reconnaissance and to investigate unidentified movements. Fighter Command is largely
equipped with Lightning and Javelin aircraft. Both carry the air-to-air guided missile
DEFENCE
129
Firestreak. The Lightning, the RAF’s first supersonic fighter, in service since i960,
is fitted with an electronic computer to aid bomber interception and is equipped for
flight-refuelling to augment Fighter Command’s capacity for overseas reinforcement.
The system of control and reporting, which has been built into a highly efficient
organisation, is closely linked with the radar systems of Continental allies. A recon¬
structed radar chain now covers the whole of the United Kingdom. The high perform¬
ance of the latest system makes it possible to have greatly improved cover with a
smaller number of stations. Work has begun on a new high-performance radar system,
which will include computers and data-handling equipment for the interception of
supersonic aircraft. The Royal Air Force will command and operate the joint UK-US
ballistic missile early warning stations being constructed in Yorkshire and Cumberland
(see p. 120).
Coastal Command’s long-range maritime reconnaissance force, which is committed
to NAIO, is wholly equipped with Shackleton aircraft. An improved version—the
Shackleton Mark 3—is now in service, and earlier marks are being progressively
modernised to an equivalent standard.
Transport Command is being re-equipped to provide increased mobility for the
strategic reserves of both land and air forces. Its carrying capacity has increased three¬
fold over the past ten years. A Comet 2 squadron formed in 1956—the first all-jet
transport squadron in any air force—has proved very successful, and the first Comet
4CS came into service in 1962. Two squadrons of Britannia aircraft are in service for
long-range transport and VC10 troop carriers are on order. The Beverley freighter,
now in service, is a versatile aircraft which can lift large loads. The Belfast (formerly
known as Britannic) aircraft is on order to supply the need for a strategic freighter
able to carry large military loads quickly over long distances. A military version of the
Armstrong Whitworth Argosy will be used as a tactical freighter for dropping para¬
chutists as well as for normal movement of troops and stores. Twin Pioneer short-range
aircraft are now in service and the Avro 748 has been ordered as a close support aircraft.
Increasing use is being made of helicopters for operations in support of the Army
in the field and for the Search and Rescue Organisation of Coastal Command, which in
peace time also operates for the rescue of civilians involved in shipping accidents or
other difficulties in coastal waters. The twin-fotor Belvedere and the gas-turbine
engined Whirlwind are both in service. Production orders have been placed for a
twin-engined version of the Wessex, with a greatly improved load capacity, particularly
in tropical conditions and at high altitudes.
Basic flying training schools have been largely re-equipped with the Jet Provost
trainer and an order has been placed for a training version of the Lightning-, the Gnat
trainer is replacing the Vampire for advanced jet training. The RAF was the first air
force to adopt all-jet training.
Women’s Royal Air Force
Women play an important part in the work of the Royal Air Force and of its reserve
and auxiliary formations. The WRAF is an integral part of the Royal Air Force and its
members train with and work alongside airmen in the same trades, serving both in
the United Kingdom and overseas. Nursing services are provided by Princess Mary's
Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Air Force
Pilots, navigators and air electronics officers are appointed to commissions in the
General Duties Branch, the flying and executive branch of the RAF. They enter either
130
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on the General List, with an assurance of a pensionable career to the age of 55, or on
the Supplementary (Flying) List. Appointment to commissions on the General List
may be obtained through a cadetship at the RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire
(pilots and navigators only), by entry as a university graduate, or under a special
arrangement for other well-qualified entrants. The majority, however, are appointed to
the Supplementary (Flying) List, either to short service commissions or to permanent
commissions which offer a pensionable career initially to about the age of 38, with the
possibility of leaving with a gratuity at an earlier stage and with opportunities of
serving to the age of 55 either on the General List or on the Supplementary (Flying)
List. Except for those entering through Cranwell, where the course lasts three years,
flying training takes about 18 months for pilots and one year for navigators and air
electronics officers.
Officers in ground branches are usually found from people in civil life, some of
whom already hold professional qualifications, who enter the Royal Air Force on short
service or permanent commissions. Short service officers may be selected for permanent
commissions while in the Royal Air Force.
Permanent commissions may also be obtained through cadetships at the Royal Air
Force Technical College, Flenlow, Bedfordshire (Technical Branch), or the RAF
College, Cranwell (Secretarial and Equipment Branches and RAF Regiment).
University graduates are also eligible for permanent commissions under special
conditions. Some technical cadets proceed after one year at Henlow to a three-year
degree course at a university.
Applicants for enlistment for service as airmen or airwomen must be British subjects
of good character and medically fit. Men between the ages of 17J and 39 years may
be enlisted as trained tradesmen if they can pass the appropriate trade test, or otherwise
for training in any RAF trade for which they may be suitable, subject to vacancies.
Enlistment is for one of specified periods within a maximum of 12 years (reckoned
from the age of 18 or the date of attestation, whichever is the later). Subject to
requirements, airmen may re-engage to serve for 22 years’ reckonable service for
pension and towards the end of that period may apply to continue to serve to the age
of 55. A recruit training course of 8 weeks is followed by trade training where necessary
and posting for duty.
Boys may enlist between the ages of 15 and 17 as apprenticed advanced tradesmen
or between the ages of 15! and i6| as boy entrants for training in skilled trades.
Apprentices and boy entrants enlist for 12 years or 9 years plus 3 years’ reserve service
from the age of 18.
Women between the ages of 17 and 39 may enlist for normal service as airwomen
for periods of 3, 4, 5 or 6 years. Subject to requirements, women, like airmen, may
subsequently extend their engagements to a maximum of 12 years, or re-engage to
serve for 22 years’ service reckonable for pension and towards the end of that period
may apply to continue in the Service until the age of 55. Women between the ages of
17 and 52 may enlist for local service as airwomen for 2 years, which period may be
extended by one or two years at a time. Women of at least 18 years of age and of the
requisite educational standard may be selected for short service commissions. Oppor¬
tunities exist for both short service officers and airwomen to gain permanent commissions.
Auxiliary and Reserve Forces
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of three maritime headquarters units and
a maritime support unit. The units are raised and maintained by local Territorial and
Auxiliary Forces Associations and functionally controlled by Coastal Command. In
DEFENCE
!3I
addition the Royal Auxiliary Air Force General List comprises officers specially ear¬
marked for service in war appointments.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists mainly of officers and airmen who have served
in the Air Force. It includes the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, whose members,
like the officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, have a liability
to carry out training on a part-time basis. University air squadrons (established at
17 universities) form part of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.
Ex-regular airmen with a liability for reserve service carry out this liability in Class E
of the Royal Air Force Reserve. Part-time National Service men serve in Class H
of the Royal Air Force Reserve or they may volunteer instead to join the Volunteer
Reserve or the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.
Royal Observer Corps
The Royal Observer Corps, a predominantly civilian and voluntary organisation,
now administered by Fighter Command, originated during the first world war and was
officially established in 1925. Its present strength is over 15,000 men and women, who
have the specialised tasks of identifying and reporting the movements of low flying
aircraft, and of measuring and reporting on radioactivity in the event of nuclear attack.
Eventually some 1,500 underground operation centres will have been built for the
corps.
Air Training Corps
The Air Training Corps provides pre-Service training for boys between the ages of
14 and 20 years. Like the other pre-Service formations, it seeks to inculcate good
citizenship as well as training for the RAF.
HOME DEFENCE
The second world war showed the importance of having trained and organised
bodies of men and women ready to mitigate the effects of enemy air attacks on the
civil population; and the Civil Defence Act, 1948, recognised that a permanent system
of civil defence was essential to national safety. The development of nuclear weapons,
whilst creating many new problems for civil defence and calling for much replanning,
has increased rather than lessened the need for an efficient civil defence organisation.
Civil Defence remains an integral part of the country’s defence plan.
In the event of nuclear attack, the problems of rescue, fire-fighting and welfare
operations would be greatly intensified by the presence of radioactivity, which would
have to be detected and its extent and intensity measured. The first call would have
to be met by the civilian services on the spot, and these would be supported by the
armed forces in the country at the time, whether regular or reserve, which were
not immediately required for combat operations. The Minister of Defence is charged
with planning the part which the armed forces would play in home defence, and with
co-ordinating the plans of the military authorities with those of the civil authorities.
The country’s economic capacity limits the effort which can be devoted to home
defence preparations; and the main defence objective must be to maintain the nuclear
deterrent—not to prepare for war but to prevent it. In home defence the main task in
peace time is to keep a local organisation in being as a framework for expansion if
necessary, to provide training equipment and to proceed with essential research. The
Government has declared its conviction that, if the deterrent were to fail, countless
lives could be saved by civil defence preparations made in advance. An example of
132
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
this is the scheme which is being worked out with the local authorities for dispersing
mothers and children and others in priority classes from major centres of population,
should circumstances warrant it.
Orgamsation of Civil Defence
Civil defence planning in the United Kingdom is the responsibility of a number of
ministers each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a
natural extension of his peace-time functions. As the development of effective civil
defence services involves much detailed planning at local level, the central Government
has enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of industry and commerce
and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organisations such as the
Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Voluntary Service.
In addition to his direct responsibilities under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the
Home Secretary is responsible for co-ordinating the defence plans of all the civil
agencies of the Government. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for
civil defence matters in Scotland.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary supervises the civil defence activities
of the police and fire services, the Civil Defence Corps and the Industrial Civil Defence
Service as well as such matters as shelter policy and the national air attack and fall-out
warning and monitoring systems. Other Government departments have direct respon¬
sibility for the civil defence applications of the services which they control; for
example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital and first-aid services,
and the Post Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland the Scottish Home and Health Department deals with questions
corresponding to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales, and is
responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid services.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, places
responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs, which may
arrange for other departments to undertake some functions on its behalf.
The co-ordination of civil defence planning in Great Britain necessarily involves
much work by interdepartmental committees, on which all departments with civil
defence responsibilities are represented, in order that plans and programmes may be
constantly reviewed to take account of changes in the scale and nature of possible attacks.
England is divided into ten civil defence regions in charge of Regional Directors
of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Office, and there is also a Director of Civil
Defence for Wales. Their duties include liaison with the armed forces and the planning
of combined exercises. There is no corresponding regional organisation in Scotland,
where planning is carried out centrally, although the country is divided into three
zones for operational purposes.
The Civil Defence Services
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks, the following
services, in which in times of peace only part-time service is required, are raised in
Great Britain by voluntary recruitment of civilians, both men and women:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which helps local and other authorities to carry out
their civil defence functions.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence units
formed in industrial and commercial premises for the protection of the personnel
of their undertakings and to assist the public civil defence services.
DEFENCE
I33
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, which reinforces the fire services maintained by
local authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947. Auxiliary firemen are
enrolled by the fire authorities (see p. 79) as members of the individual
brigades, but the Fire Service would become a national organisation in time
of war.
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained nurses
and persons willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries reinforces the National
Hospital Service in England and Wales. In Scotland there is also an Ambulance
Section of the Reserve to provide the additional manpower for the war-time
operation of the Scottish Ambulance Service.
In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence Corps, the
Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service, and the Hospital Service Reserve.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed forces,
recruits for all services are drawn from men and women volunteers who will undertake
to train regularly.
Strengths in Great Britain on 31st March, 1962, were:

The Civil Defence Corps is recruited and organised by certain local authorities
(mainly the councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales, or
counties and large burghs in Scotland) in local divisions. The local divisions are
subdivided into five sections as follows:
Headquarters:
Wardens:
Rescue:
Ambulance
and First Aid:
Welfare:
control of civil defence operations, communications, recon¬
naissance (including scientific matters).
public guidance and control, reporting of damage and radio¬
active fall-out, organisation of immediate self-help measures,
and the local control of life-saving operations,
rescue of trapped persons and rendering first aid to them,
first aid, conveyance of casualties to Forward Medical Aid Units
and to hospital, and the organisation of stretcher-bearers,
escort and welfare of evacuees, care of homeless, assistance with
billeting, rest centres, emergency cooking and feeding, public
information centres.
In Scotland there is no separate Ambulance and First Aid section, ambulance
services being provided by the National Hospital Service Reserve, and casualty
collecting being a warden duty.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Corps, which is organised directly by the
Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authorities, consists of three sections
only—Headquarters, Wardens and Welfare; the Ambulance Service forms part of the
Hospital Service, and the Rescue Section has been integrated with the Auxiliary Fire
Service to form the Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service.
Training
Members of the Civil Defence Corps are required to undertake a standard training.
Advanced training at two levels is offered, and to those prepared to assume the greater
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
I34
responsibilities bounties of between j£io and ^15 ^re paid. Those who take the standard
training only will form a new Civil Defence Corps Reserve who will be called upon in
emergency. Serving members who have not entered under these regulations, which
were introduced in July 1962, will have two years in which to undergo training and
tests.
Units of the Industrial Civil Defence Service are trained and organised in much
the same way as the Civil Defence Corps and in war would operate in close association
with it.
Civil defence instructors are trained either at one of the three Home Office Civil
Defence Schools or locally under arrangements made by local authorities, in accordance
with directions given by the Home Office or the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment. Courses and studies for senior officials are held at the Civil Defence Staff
College at Sunningdale, Berkshire, and in Scotland, at the Civil Defence School at
Taymouth Castle, Perthshire.
Auxiliary firemen are trained by officers and men of the regular brigades, who
themselves receive special training in emergency fire-fighting at the Home Office
Fire Service Training Centre at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. They are
encouraged to gain practical experience of fire-fighting by performing stand-by duty
at fire stations to enable them to respond, with regular members of the brigade, to
calls to fires. Exercises are also held, involving the control and operation of large
numbers of pumping and other fire-fighting appliances. New regulations similar to
those for the Civil Defence Corps were introduced in the Auxiliary Fire Service in
July 1962.
The Police
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the prevention of
crime, for the maintenance of law and order and for the control of essential service
routes. They are also likely to have duties in connection with evacuation, care of the
homeless and other specialised civil defence tasks. In all these duties they would have
the aid of the Special Constabulary.
Role of the Armed Forces
There are two main ways in which the fighting Services within the country can
render assistance: by helping the civil authorities to maintain control; and by the
direct employment of units on various tasks such as aid to the police in the maintenance
of law and order and traffic control, aid to the fire service, assistance in the reception
and care of the homeless, in the treatment and evacuation of casualties and in the
clearance of radioactive fall-out zones, the provision of guards, the maintenance of
road, rail and water communications, light rescue, reconnaissance and the provision
and running of camps.
All units of the Regular and Reserve Armies are trained in peace time for the civil
defence tasks they may be expected to perform in war. In addition, a number of men
of the Royal Air Force have been trained in emergency fire-fighting operations at
Home Office training centres to enable them to serve as firemen in a National Fire
Service.
There is close liaison in peace time between the civil and military authorities at
all levels. Joint exercises are continually being held and everything possible is being
done to align the civil and military chains of command.

SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local government
authorities, for a range of services covering subsistence for the needy, education and
health services for all, housing, employment or maintenance, the care of aged or
handicapped persons, the care of children, the nutrition of mothers and children,
and sickness, maternity and industrial injury benefits, widow’s and retirement pensions
and family allowances. Public authorities in the United Kingdom are spending over
£4,000 million a year on social services; that is, about £80 a year per head of the
population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all
the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and social
and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They made them¬
selves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the homeless
and the handicapped, before it was generally accepted that the whole community
had a responsibility towards these people. Where the services and the facilities they
provided were adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The State now
supplements these voluntary services and provides financial .assistance, sees that
essential services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures that the
necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services surround and supplement the State services. The
two types are complementary, not competitive, and they merge into each other.
State services often work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
individual or special needs. The officers of central and local government, in carrying
out their duties, co-operate with the workers of many voluntary social service societies,
while the institutional provision made by the State and by local authorities for the
care of the chronic sick and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various
types for the care of the sick and elderly, most of whom receive State pensions or
benefits.
The Charity Commission, a Government department, gives free advice to trustees
of charities, making schemes to modify their trusts and purposes when necessary.
The Commission was reconstituted by the Charities Act, i960, which gave it additional
powers in order to meet modern needs of promoting co-operation between charities
and State services and directed the establishment of a Central Register of Charities
in which, for the first time, information about all the charities in England and Wales
is being gathered together.
Voluntary Organisations
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain runs into
thousands; they range from national organisations to small individual local groups.
135
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
136
Most organisations, however, are members of larger associations or are represented on
local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly concerned
with giving personal service, others are mainly interested in the formation of public
opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and misfortunes include
the voluntary family casework agencies, of which the Family Welfare Association,
working mainly in London, is the best known; marriage guidance centres affiliated to
the National Marriage Guidance Council; and the Family Service Units.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British Red
Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the St. Andrew’s Ambulance Association,
but a number of societies exist to help sufferers from particular disabilities, such as the
Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, the
National Association for Mental Health, and the constituent members of the Central
Council for the Disabled.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Committee on Social
Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s Society, the
Church of England Council for Social Work, the Young Men’s Christian Association,
the Young Women’s Christian Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of
Rescue, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council
and the Jewish Board of Guardians.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Voluntary
Service, which ‘lends a hand’ in every kind of practical difficulty, brings ‘meals on
wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, minds children, and visits the sick in
hospital, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
A central link between different voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned
with social welfare is provided by the National Council of Social Service, which brings
together most of the principal voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action,
either as a whole or in groups of organisations concerned with particular aspects, such
as youth work and old people’s welfare, in England and Wales; by the Scottish Council
of Social Service and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service. It was the
National Council of Social Service which set up the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of
which there are now about 430 in the United Kingdom. The role of the bureaux is to
give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt about his rights or who does
not know about the State or voluntary service which could help him.
Social Workers
While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done pioneer
work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an essential part, social
services of all kinds increasingly depend for their operation chiefly on the professional
social worker, that is, the full-time salaried worker trained in the principles and tech¬
nique of social work. Training for many forms of social work consists of a basic
university degree, diploma or certificate course in social science followed by a
university course in applied social studies or specialised training for a particular service.
The latter is sometimes organised by the profession concerned. The Health Visiting
and Social Work (Training) Act, 1962, provides for a Council for Training in Social
Work to be set up to promote the training, in the first instance, of workers in the
local authority health and welfare services and similar services run by voluntary
organisations. Full-time general courses in social work (lasting two years) are now
being provided by eight colleges of further education.
SOCIAL WELFARE
I37
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training of social
workers, but Government departments and local authorities now employ a considerable
number of trained social workers, for example, in child care, youth work, almoning,
psychiatric social work, and the probation service.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and National
Assistance together constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United
Kingdom which ensures that in no circumstances need any one fall below a certain
minimum standard of living.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the first three of
these services in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are administered by the
Ministry of Labour and National Insurance. National Assistance is administered by
the National Assistance Board in Great Britain, and in Northern Ireland by the
National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for
war pensioners and their dependants are the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions
and National Insurance throughout the United Kingdom.
Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits, family allowances or war pensions,
or to applications for assistance, are not decided by the Ministry or the Board but by
independent authorities appointed under the Acts.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain can be
traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may be regarded as its
starting point in England and Wales), the modern system of comprehensive provision
is a creation of the twentieth century. Non-contributory old age pensions were intro¬
duced in 1908, and the first contributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans
in 1926. A contributory National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and
in the same year a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920
was extended to cover the great majority of employed persons. By the beginning of
the second world war the social security services in Britain were among the best in the
world, but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their piecemeal development,
and not everyone came within their scope. In the immediate post-war years a series
of Acts introduced the present comprehensive system which became fully operative
on 5th July, 1948. Adjustments have been made by a number of subsequent Acts.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable income
on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of dependants.
Reciprocity
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a single
system. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man as well as Great Britain are party to
most of the agreements with other countries. Reciprocal agreements on national
insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances are in operation with Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, Jersey, Norway, Western Germany and Yugoslavia. Agreements
with France, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland
and Turkey cover national insurance and industrial injuries insurance. With Australia,
Canada and New Zealand there are agreements on national insurance and family
allowances. There is an agreement with Guernsey on family allowances only, with
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
138
Cyprus on national insurance, and an agreement with the Irish Republic which covers
national insurance and contains some industrial injuries provisions relating to seafarers.
Other agreements are under negotiation.
FAMILY ALLOWANCES
Family allowances have been provided by the State since August 1946, under the
Family Allowances Act, 1945, in Great Britain and by the Family Allowances Act
(Northern Ireland), 1945, in Northern Ireland. Just over 5^ million allowances are
being paid in Great Britain to over 3! million families with two or more children
and over a quarter of a million in Northern Ireland to over 116,000 families. An
allowance is paid for each child other than the first or only child below the age limits.
The age limits are 15 years for children who leave school at that age, 16 years for certain
handicapped children, and 18 for children who remain at school or are apprentices.
The rate of the allowance is 8s. a week for the second child below the age limits and
1 os. a week for the third and each subsequent child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit the
family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to the mother
or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for title to the allowances, but
there are certain residence conditions.
The corresponding scheme in Northern Ireland makes similar provision for family
allowances.
NATIONAL INSURANCE
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th July, 1948.
It has been amended by the National Insurance Acts, 1949-60, and the Family
Allowances and National Insurance Acts, 1952 to 1961. The Acts apply, in general, to
everyone over school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The National Insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies to
insured persons who have paid the required contributions. The benefits are paid for
partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by the contributions of employers
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by the Exchequer out
of general taxation. Up to April 1961 the rates of contributions and benefits were
standard amounts varying only with the sex and insurance class of the insured person
(with lower rates for those under 18). In April 1961 the scheme was modified by the
introduction of the graduated scheme. This applies to all adult employed persons
earning a minimum of £9 a week and not ‘contracted out’ of the graduated scheme and
provides for them to earn additions to flat-rate retirement pension (but not to any
other benefit) in return for graduated contributions, related to earnings, paid normally
in addition to the flat-rate contribution. Employees whose job provides them with a
secure occupational pension at least as good as the maximum State graduated pension
can be ‘contracted out’ of the scheme. About 4^ million have been contracted out.
The Insured Population
The National Insurance scheme applies, in general, to everyone over school-leaving
age and under pensionable age. Contributors are divided into three classes:
Class 1. Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a contract
of service or are paid apprentices—about 22J million. This class falls into two
SOCIAL WELFARE
139
groups: those who are, and those who are not, participating in the graduated
pension scheme.
Class 2. Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—nearly ij million.
Class 3. Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in class 1 or 2
—just over a quarter of a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by regulations,
to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in their own house¬
hold duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’ insurance and need not
pay contributions. They can choose to pay contributions provided they were insured
persons when they married. (Those who were already married when the scheme began
to operate on 5th July, 1948, cannot be insured in their own right unless they were
then insured under the old scheme and continued to pay contributions as non-
employed persons, or unless they have since taken up paid work.) Employed married
women may choose whether to pay separate contributions themselves or to rely on
the cover provided by their husbands’ contributions, which make them eligible for
maternity and home confinement grants, retirement pension at lower rate, widow’s
benefit and death grant, but they must pay graduated contributions if they are employed
in a participating employment and their earnings are over ^9 a week. Students
receiving full-time education and unpaid apprentices need not pay contributions.
Up to the age of 18, contributions are credited to them. Over that age they may, if
they wish, pay as non-employed persons (class 3) and thus safeguard their title to
widow’s benefit and to retirement pension at full rate. Self-employed and non-
employed persons whose income is not more than £208 a year can apply to be exempted
from liability to pay contributions.
Contributions
The main weekly rates of flat-rate contribution (including the National Health
Service contribution which for convenience is paid with it, though the two services
are separately administered) in force since July 1961 are shown in Table 7.
Contributions are normally paid on a single contribution card by national insurance
stamps bought from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place
to see that the class 1 contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employee’s share
from his or her wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own
cards. Contributions are usually ‘credited’ for weeks of unemployment, sickness or
injury, or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
Graduated contributions are payable by employed persons earning over £9 a week
who are not contracted out, at the rate of approximately 4^ per cent of their weekly
pay between ^9 and £15. The employer pays the same amount. The contributions are
collected through the same machinery as is used to collect Pay As You Earn (deduction
at source) income tax.
An insured person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions at the
age of 70 for men, 65 for women, or when he retires, or is deemed to have retired, from
regular employment after reaching minimum pension age (65 for men, 60 for women),
whichever is the earlier. If such a person does any work as an employed person
thereafter, he must pay an industrial injuries contribution; his employer’s liability
remains the same as shown in Table 7.

Benefits
The main contingencies in which the scheme provides payments to contributors
are: unemployment (if normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally
working for an employer or self-employed), confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-employed and
paying national insurance contributions at the full rate). Widows receive help in the
first 13 weeks after bereavement and subsequently while they have young children or
if they have reached the age of 50 when widowed or when their children have grown
up; there are two kinds of allowances in respect of orphan children where a widow’s
pension is not payable; and pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for
women) and who, if under 70 (65 for women), have retired from regular work. The
scheme also provides cash grants for three expensive contingencies—the birth of a
SOCIAL WELFARE
I4I
child, a confinement at home (or elsewhere, otherwise than at public expense), and
a death (though not for the death of someone already over minimum pension age when
the scheme started).
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before benefit
can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must actually have been paid
since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless a
specified number of contributions have been paid or ‘credited’ over a specified period.
There are special rules to help a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s
pension at widowhood or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness
or unemployment benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established
herself in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help
divorced women who were not paying contributions during their marriage.
Amounts
The basic standard rate of the majority of benefits is now £2 17s. 6d. a week for
men and women alike, which may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been
paid, but is not affected by other unearned income or the previous level of earnings.
Earnings made while the benefit is in payment, however, may cause its reduction or
withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a person earning more than a
specified amount from a secondary occupation; widows, and retirement pensioners
under the age of 70 (65 for women), have their pensions reduced in step with earnings
over certain specified amounts; sickness benefit, though not affected by continued
payment of wages, is terminated if the person receiving it does more than a negligible
amount of paid work. Exceptions to the basic standard rate are the higher rate of £4
a week payable to widows, without regard to any earnings, during the first 13 weeks
after bereavement, the increased retirement pension payable to someone who has
continued at work beyond minimum pension age, and the lower rate of £1 19s. a week
unemployment or sickness benefit payable to a married woman who is not separated
from her husband and unsupported by him or else maintaining an invalid husband, i.e.
who is the second not the first breadwinner in the household. The standard rate of
retirement pension for a woman on her husband’s insurance is £1 15s. a week. Standard
increases are payable for dependants at the rate of £1 15s. for an adult (generally a
wife), 17s. 6d. for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits and
9s. 6d., over and above any family allowances payable, for other children. However,
the amounts payable to widows for their children are larger: £1 5s. for the first or only
child and 17s. for others.
Graduated contributions add 6d. a week to retirement pension for each £7 10s.
of graduated contributions paid by a man, with the matching ^7 10s. paid by his
employer, and for each £9 paid by a woman, with the matching £9 paid by her employer.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of whom must
have been insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a guardian’s allowance of
£1 12s. 6d. a week. It is paid to the person in whose family a child is, for the time being,
included. For certain orphan children a child’s special allowance is provided: it is
payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled, on the death of her
former husband, for any children of that marriage below the family allowance age
limits to whose support he has been contributing. The weekly rate of the allowance
is £1 5s. for the first or only child and 17s. for each other child.
The rates of grants are varied: £14 maternity grant is payable for a confinement
and a further grant for each additional child born at the same confinement living 12
hours after its birth; £6 is paid for a confinement at home or elsewhere other than at
142
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
public expense; and ^25 death grant on the death of an adult (less for a child, or for
an adult who was within 10 years of minimum pension age when the scheme started).
All these amounts have been increased since the scheme came into operation; the
last increases were in April 1961.
Duration
In general, National Insurance payments are paid as long as the situation requiring
them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than a year if less than
156 contributions have been paid (possible within three years for a contributor con¬
tinuously at work) and unemployment benefit is payable in the first instance for 30
weeks, after which it may be continued for up to 19 months in all, according to the
person’s record of contributions paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in
recent years. Maternity allowance begins 11 weeks before the expected week of
confinement and ends after the sixth week following the expected week or the actual
confinement if this is later.
Similarly, widowed mother’s allowances at the full rate cease when the children
reach family allowance age limits, though a mother can continue to receive £2 17s. 6d.
a week for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter above the age limits
but under 18. The widow’s pension payable to the childless widow, provided she is
over 50 (and had been married at least three years when her husband died), and the
similar pension normally paid to the widowed mother who has reached 50 when her
widowed mother’s allowance ends, continues until she has reached minimum pension
age and retired, or at most till age 65. If she has satisfied the conditions she then
becomes entitled to a retirement pension.
NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES)
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which, in July 1948, replaced the Work¬
men’s Compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s Compensation Act
of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused by accidents arising out of, and
in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases due to the nature of employ¬
ment. It covers practically everyone in class 1 of the National Insurance scheme and
certain others. Like the National Insurance scheme, the Industrial Injuries scheme is
financed partly from contributions (see Table 7) and partly from taxation. The relevant
Acts are the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, 1946 to 1961. Similar
cover against industrial injuries and diseases in Northern Ireland is provided by the
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts (Northern Ireland), 1946 t° 1962.
Benefits
Injury Benefit
Injury benefit for an adult is £4 17s. 6d. a week plus 15s. for an adult dependant
and 17s. 6d. for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits and 9s. 6d.
for each other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance payable. It is paid
when the insured person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or
prescribed disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning
on the date of the accident or development of the disease.
Disablement Benefit
Disablement benefit may be paid if, after the payment of injury benefit has ceased,
there remains some loss of physical or mental faculty as the result of the industrial
accident or prescribed disease. The amount depends on the extent of the disablement
SOCIAL WELFARE
I43
as assessed by a medical board; it varies from ^4 17s. 6d. for 100 per cent disablement
to 19s. 6d. a week for 20 per cent disablement. For disablement of less than 20 per
cent a gratuity is normally paid, ranging up to £320.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as follows:
unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of ^2 17s. 6d.; constant attendance
allowance of up to £2 weekly, or at a special rate of ^4 a week in exceptionally severe
cases; a special hardship allowance of up to ^1 19s. for a person who is unfit to return
to his regular job or work of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowances
which raise the benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment
for the industrial disability. Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with
unemployability supplement and hospital treatment allowance.
Death Benefit
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit may be
paid to the dependants.
For widows living with their husbands at the time of death, a pension of ^4 a week
is payable for the first thirteen weeks of widowhood. Thereafter, if the widow (1) is
entitled to a child’s allowance or was over the age of 40 on ceasing to be so entitled, or
(2) was over 50 years of age or was permanently incapable of self-support at the time
of her husband’s death, or (3) is not entitled to child’s allowance, but has residing with
her a young person under the age of 18 who was or could be treated as being in her late
husband’s family, or (4) is over 40 years of age when (3) ceases to apply, or (5) is preg¬
nant by her late husband, she is entitled to a pension of £3 4s. a week. If none of these
conditions is satisfied, the widow may receive a pension of jfi a week.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances age limits.
For widows, these allowances are normally at the rate of ^1 5s. a week for the first or
only child and 17s. a week for each other child. For other beneficiaries, the rate is
17s. 6d. and 9s. 6d. a week respectively.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be entitled to
pensions, allowances or gratuities. The amounts vary with the closeness of the
relationship and the extent to which the dependants were maintained by the deceased
during his lifetime.
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE
i he National Assistance Act, 1948, abolished the existing Poor Law and, in place
of the various services for the relief of need previously provided from both central
and local government funds, established for the first time a comprehensive State
service of financial assistance according to need which is administered by the National
Assistance Board.
Application to the Board for financial assistance can be made, with certain exceptions
relating to persons in full-time work or involved in a trade dispute, by anyone over
the age of 16 who is in need. The need for assistance is decided by reference to general
standards (which are amended from time to time) laid down in regulations approved
by Parliament. These regulations contain rules for estimating the requirements of the
person or family group for whom assistance is to be provided and rules for the treat¬
ment of their resources, whether of income or capital (for instance, national insurance
benefits and family allowances are taken fully into account, while some part of other
specified resources may be disregarded).
The regulations make special provision for higher rates for blind persons and
certain tuberculous persons, and also allow the Board’s officer to adjust the amount
144
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
payable to suit the particular circumstances of every case. The help given is in this
way related directly to the needs of the individual or family. There is a right of appeal
if the person is dissatisfied with the officer’s decision.
There are few conditions attached to the grant of assistance, but help given to
able-bodied men or women of working age will normally be conditional on their
registering for work at an employment exchange of the Ministry of Labour; the
assistance will then be paid at the exchange. Otherwise assistance is normally received
as a weekly cash payment at a post office.
WAR PENSIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Pensions to persons disabled or bereaved through the wars are paid under Royal
Warrants and other instruments administered by the Ministry of Pensions and National
Insurance.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
£4 17s. 6d. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of disable¬
ment. The latter is assessed by comparing the disabled person with a normal healthy
person of the same age and sex, without taking earning capacity into account. Allow¬
ances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic pension and there are
various supplementary allowances, the main ones being for unemployability (£3 3s. a
week), constant attendance (up to £2 and, exceptionally, £4 a week), comforts (10s. or
£ 1 a week), and lowered standard of occupation (up to £1 19s. a week). There is an
allowance (at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a week) for persons drawing disable¬
ment pensions who are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary payments are free of
income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any allowance payable
under the Family Allowances Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war orphans and to war widows. The standard rate of
pension for war widows of private soldiers is £2 16s. a week, an addition being made
for higher rank, and they also receive allowances for their children (£1 9s. for each
child), and, in certain cases, an allowance for rent (up to £1 9s. a week). There is an
additional allowance of 10s. a week for widows aged 70 or over. Parents or other
relatives who were dependent on a person whose death resulted from the wars may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans, and war pensioners have
priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of their war disabilities in
National Health Service hospitals.
Many voluntary associations, such as the British Legion and other ex-Service
organisations, give financial aid and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and
women and their families. The Ministry and these bodies work in co-operation.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of the
years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half of the nine¬
teenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental or public health
services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal of refuse and cleaning of
streets, and the first half of the twentieth century for the development of publicly
provided personal health services, as distinct from environmental services, culminating
SOCIAL WELFARE
H5
in the introduction in 1948 of a comprehensive National Health Service available to
every citizen. The scientific discoveries, especially of new drugs, and the improved
services of the last fifty years, including maternity and child welfare, school health
services and school meals, are reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 11.) and
improved physique.
PUBLIC HEALTH
The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and consolidated preceding Acts;
it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and Wales. Local
authorities are mainly responsible for its implementation and they have extensive
powers for the making and administration of by-laws relating to matters of public
health. The local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of county and non¬
county boroughs, urban and rural district councils, and, to a limited extent, parish
councils. Local authorities also have power to secure clean air by establishing smoke
control areas (see p. 188).
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed on much
the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on separate Acts and
there is a different allocation of services between the various types of local authority.
The Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, and the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892,
constitute the basic legislation for Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the
councils of counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and
non-county boroughs and urban and rural district councils are mainly responsible for
administering the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland), 1878-1955.
Control of Infectious Diseases
Local authorities are responsible for the investigation of outbreaks of infectious
diseases by their Medical Officers of Health, and for disinfection and other measures
advised by them for preventing the spread of infectious diseases in the area. They are
also responsible to the Ministry of Health (or the Welsh Board of Health or the
Secretary of State for Scotland or the Ministry of Health and Local Government for
Northern Ireland) for recording notifications of the prescribed infectious diseases.
The same departments have a general responsibility for supervising the operation of
health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of which is to prevent the
introduction of infectious disease into the country. This health control is undertaken
by health authorities using the services of medical officers, public health inspectors,
rodent inspectors and others.
Pure Food
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation now
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for Scotland
in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act, 1956, and for Northern Ireland in the Food
and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland), 1958. In England and Wales the Act and regulations
made under it are, in general, carried out and enforced by food and drugs authorities
(i.e. county councils, county borough councils and, generally, the larger borough and
urban district councils) in relation to composition, adulteration and description, and
by local authorities (i.e. county borough, borough, urban district and rural district
councils) in relation to purity and hygiene; the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for advising
and for making regulations under the Act. Premises where food for sale for human
consumption is prepared, sold or stored are required to conform to certain hygienic
146 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
standards. Authorised officers of food and drugs authorities and of local authorities
are empowered to take samples of any food for sale for human consumption for
analysis or for bacteriological or other examination. Special regulations are in force
for certain foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of counties and
large burghs; the central department is the Scottish Home and Health Department.
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and county
borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry of Health and
Local Government.
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health Service Act,
1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act, 1947, and the Health Services Act
(Northern Ireland), 1948—came into force simultaneously on 5th July, 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act, 1946, is ‘to promote the establish¬
ment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure
improvement in the physical and mental health of the people of England and W ales
and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and for that purpose to provide
or secure the effective provision of services’. The National Health Service (Amendment)
Act, 1949, and the National Health Service Acts, 1951 to 1961, made some modifications
in the scheme for Great Britain and provided for charges to be made for certain parts
of the service, which is otherwise available free of charge to all according to medical
need without regard to any insurance qualification, although all national insurance
contributors are required to pay a separate weekly national health contribution under
the National Health Service Contribution Acts, 1957 to 1961 (see Table 7).
Reciprocity
Arrangements have been made between Britain and Denmark, New Zealand, Nor¬
way, Sweden and Yugoslavia under which nationals of these countries may receive
treatment under the National Health Service and British nationals may receive health
benefits under the legislation of those countries. Visitors from other countries who
come to Britain for treatment are expected to pay for it, but treatment can be given
under the emergency provisions of the National Health Service to any who have the
misfortune to fall ill during a visit to Britain.
Health Service Administration in Great Britain
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has direct responsibility for the
provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, including those for
mental disorder. He has power to conduct, or assist others to conduct, research work
into matters relating to the causation, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or
mental disorder, and he provides a public health laboratory service and a blood
transfusion service. He has indirect responsibility for the general practitioner services
and local health authority services. He is advised by the Central Health Services
Council and by standing advisory committees on various aspects of the service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through regional hospital boards
and hospital management committees and, in the case of teaching hospitals, by boards
of governors. The hospitals are administered in groups; these consist sometimes of
several formerly independent hospitals and sometimes of one. There are nearly 400
such groups under the control of hospital management committees, which are in turn
SOCIAL WELFARE
I47
under the control of 15 regional hospital boards. The regions are arranged so that
the hospital and specialist services can conveniently be associated with a university
having a school of medicine.
The members of a hospital management committee are appointed by the appropriate
regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution, reflect the communities
concerned, for they usually include not only medical practitioners but members of local
authorities, trade unionists and others. The regional hospital boards are appointed
by the Minister of Health and are similarly constituted. The boards of governors of
teaching hospitals are appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being
nominated by the teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and
the medical and dental teaching staff. All appointments to hospital management
committees, regional hospital boards and boards of governors are honorary. Medical
and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister; but it is his responsibility
to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical students. The universities are
responsible for the provision of teaching.
The general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary ophthalmic
services are administered by 138 executive councils, each covering the area of a county
or county borough. In a few cases two areas are combined under one council. Each
council has an ophthalmic services committee responsible for administering the sup¬
plementary ophthalmic service. Doctors, dentists and pharmacists are represented
on the executive councils and each profession also forms a local committee. Councils
of counties and county boroughs are the 146 local health authorities in charge of local
health services.
In Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible minister; 31
county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health authorities;
hospital and specialist services are administered by five regional hospital boards
appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 83 boards of management (the equiva¬
lent of hospital management committees in England); and there are 25 executive
councils, each serving the area of one or more local health authorities. The teaching
hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the regional hospital boards, but
special medical education committees consider matters relating to medical teaching.
The Scottish Health Services Council and the standing advisory committees advise
the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central Health Services
Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 155.
Health Service Finance
Annual expenditure on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom amounts
to about 3! per cent of the total national income. The greater part of the cost falls on
the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation, and a small part is met from local
rates. Other income is derived from the national health contribution paid with the
national insurance contribution and from the payments for those parts of the service
for which charges are made. These charges, first introduced in 1951 and since increased,
are designed to help to limit rising costs without reducing the services offered.
There is a charge of 2s. for each item entered on a prescription form. Charges are
also made for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at school, and expectant
and nursing mothers) and spectacles (except children’s spectacles in standard frames),
for elastic hosiery supplied in the family doctor service or hospital out-patients’
department, for certain appliances supplied to out-patients, for treatment in the dental
service (but not for examination only or for treatment given to persons aged under 21
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
148
years or to nursing or expectant mothers), and for some local health authority services.
Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the National Assis¬
tance Board for help in meeting any of these charges. Under the 1946 Act, a limited
number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided
that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Charges for these ‘amenity’ beds are fixed by statutory regulations. Provision is also
made at certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private patients’ accommo¬
dation on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation and treatment. Such
patients may make private arrangements for treatment by a doctor of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-time
medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept private
patients. General medical practitioners in public service are remunerated mainly by
capitation fees according to the number of persons on their lists.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale
of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists dispensing on
their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they dispense. Doctors
and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the supplementary ophthalmic service are paid
prescribed fees for each sight test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid
according to the number and type of pairs supplied.
The General Practitioner Services
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to individuals
by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those enrolled in the service.
Doctors and dentists normally work at their own surgeries; in a few places they practise
in health centres established under the National Health Service Acts. About 25,000,
or almost all, general medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in Great Britain
take some part in the service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the service at its start in the
place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice have to apply
through their executive councils to the central Medical Practices Committee, so that a
better distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated. The maximum
number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,5°°;
the average number in England and Wales is about 2,300. It is normally through the
patient’s own doctor that access to most other parts of the health service is obtained.
There are over 10,000 dentists in England and Wales and over 1,000 in Scotland
in the general dental service.
Nearly 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,000 ophthalmic and dis¬
pensing opticians in England and Wales, and over 7° ophthalmic medical practitioners
and nearly 800 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland, are engaged in the
supplementary ophthalmic service. This service provides for the testing of sight and
provision of spectacles. Cases requiring treatment are dealt with through the hospital
eye service.
Almost all chemists (nearly 16,000 in England and Wales and about 2,850 in Scotland)
are taking part in the service.
Hospital and Specialist Services
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all kinds,
including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic facilities both for
in-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity departments, infectious disease units,
SOCIAL WELFARE
149
psychiatric hospitals and units, convalescent homes, and rehabilitation centres; all
forms of specialised treatment; and the services of specialists and other staff required
for the hospitals.
Hospitals
A large proportion of the 3,000 hospitals in the National Health Service in Great
Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier
charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s and St. Bartholomew’s
Hospitals in London. Restrictions on capital investment required by the economic
position just after the second world war and, after 1948, claims on the available
financial resources by other parts of the National Health Service, have meant that a
full-scale post-war hospital building programme was not launched until 1956. Between
1956 and 1961, 16 new hospitals were brought wholly or partially into use and major
extensions or modifications were made to many others. In 1962 ten-year hospital
plans were published (one for England and Wales and one for Scotland) setting out
the lines on which the Government intends to modernise systematically the hospital
service. For the purposes of the plans expenditure of £570 million (£70 million of it
for Scotland) over the ten years has been assumed. The plans specify that work should
start on the building of no new hospitals (20 of them in Scotland) and the substantial
reconstruction of an even greater number of existing hospitals.
About 2,640 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are in England
and Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually groups of hospitals
comprising about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes, or treatment
centres) and the 10 teaching hospitals elsewhere in England and Wales (comprising
some 70 hospitals and other establishments). They have over 469,000 staffed beds and a
nursing and midwifery staff of 163,000 full-time and nearly 50,000 part-time nurses
and midwives. There are 385 hospitals in Scotland with about 63,600 beds and over
23,500 full-time and over 6,600 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons. Most
of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and French Hospitals,
serve a special group of patients; others are maintained for the chronic sick or for
convalescents by charitable organisations. There are also private nursing homes,
which must be registered.
Rehabilitation
The importance of rehabilitation as a facet of medical treatment is firmly established
and today hospital treatment is not limited to the relief of pain, or alleviation or cure
of pathological conditions, but aims at restoring the individual’s functional capacity
without delay. Special rehabilitation facilities are provided, for those requiring them,
in the departments of physical medicine and occupational therapy at the main hospitals,
and in a few special rehabilitation centres which are not attached to any hospital.
The work is carried out under the guidance of the appropriate medical specialist by
physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and social workers,
working as a team. Experience has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces
the stay in hospital, the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity
for full work. The departments work in close association with the Disablement Resettle¬
ment Service of the Ministry of Labour. Rehabilitation methods have been applied
with advantage in the care of the chronic sick, the mentally disabled, the aged and the
handicapped and have enabled many patients to become self-sufficient or to be dis¬
charged from hospital and to resume an independent life in their own homes.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Blood Transfusion
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered by
the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service. Each region maintains
an organisation for collecting blood from voluntary donors in the region, who give
their blood without payment. The blood is kept in the regional blood bank, or issued
to area blood banks maintained at general hospitals in each region. Each regional
transfusion centre acts as a reference centre for all transfusion problems arising in the
region. There are two central laboratories administered by the Medical Research
Council on behalf of the Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory,
which prepares grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to
it, and the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma
fractions. In Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is under the direction of the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association, an independent voluntary body set
up in 1940, which is supported partly by voluntary contributions, but in the main by
a grant from State funds, made by the Scottish Home and Health Department. A close
liaison is maintained with the National Blood Transfusion Service, the Blood Group
Reference Laboratory and the Blood Products Laboratory.
Mass Miniature Radiography
Mass miniature radiography was introduced in 1943 as a means of early diagnosis
of tuberculosis. About 100 units in England and Wales and 10 in Scotland operate
under the regional hospital boards in close co-operation with the local health authorities.
They examine about 3! million people a year, concentrating increasingly on areas
with a bad record for tuberculosis, on specially susceptible groups in the population,
and on adults in regular contact with organised groups of children.
Medical and Psychiatric Social Work
Many hospitals have an almoners’ department staffed by medico-social workers
trained to apply the principles of social casework to the problems of the hospital
patient. The almoners’ main function is to co-operate with the medical staff in their
treatment of the patient j to limit, by social action, the personal anxieties, family
difficulties and other problems which arise during illness; and to arrange, if necessary,
for after-care and help with adjustment to normal life or continuing disability.
Psychiatric social workers are specially trained for work in the mental health services
and in child guidance clinics. They make an invaluable contribution, not only to
hospitals but also to the local health and education services, in assessing the environ¬
mental factors in mental abnormalities and in helping patients to make the necessary
adjustments.
Bacteriological and Virological Laboratory Services
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct research and
assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic diseases. Its largest establish¬
ment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, in north-west London,
which includes the National Collection of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Labora¬
tory, and reference laboratories specialising in the identification of infective micro¬
organisms.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no separate public health
laboratory service, bacteriological work is mainly done in hospital laboratories.

Mental Health Services
Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health Service.
Patients who are suffering from mental illness can consult the family doctor and
receive specialist advice at hospital out-patient clinics as they would for any other kind
of illness, and if they need to enter a hospital for treatment, whether a general or a
psychiatric hospital, they can do so without formalities. If patients, or their relatives,
are unable or unwilling to make the necessary arrangements for admission to a
psychiatric hospital, it is the duty of a mental welfare officer of the local health authority
to do so.
Where necessary in the interests of society or of the patients themselves, mentally
disordered patients can be compulsorily detained in hospital. Compulsory admission
to hospital is regulated in England and Wales by the Mental Health Act, 1959, and in
Scotland by the Mental Health (Scotland) Act, i960. There are procedural safeguards
to protect the patient from unnecessary detention and he, or his relatives, may appeal
against detention, in England and Wales to a mental health tribunal, and in Scotland
to the sheriff.
Local health authorities have a duty to take preventive measures against mental
disorder, and arrange for the care of people suffering from mental disorder, and for
their after-care. Arrangements may include facilities for training or occupation, and
residential accommodation. If necessary, the local health authority can place a mentally
disordered person under guardianship within the community. In Scotland education
authorities share the responsibility for providing training or occupation.
Welfare Foods Service
Under the welfare foods service5 expectant mothers, children under five and handi¬
capped children under 16 who are unable to attend a school or training centre can
obtain a pint of milk a day at the reduced price of 4d. Beneficiaries get tokens from
the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance to enable them to get supplies from
their usual milk retailer at the special price.
The welfare foods other than liquid milk provided for expectant mothers and young
children under five at cost prices are distributed by local health authorities; they are
free to families who cannot afford to pay. These foods are national dried milk as an
alternative to liquid milk and at an equivalent price, orange juice, cod liver oil and
vitamin A and D tablets.
Local Health Services
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough councils
(county and large burgh councils in Scotland) consist of the maternity and child
welfare services, including welfare centres, maternity care, dental care and day
nurseries, the services for the prevention of illness, care, and after-care, including
vaccination and immunisation, health visiting, home nursing and domestic help; the
ambulance services (in Scotland the responsibility of the Secretary of State, and in
Northern Ireland of the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority); and the provision,
equipment and maintenance of local health centres (the responsibility of the Secretary
of State in Scotland).
1 The service began as a war-time measure with the National Milk Scheme in 1940, but in
1946 the Government decided to continue the extended scheme as part of the peace-time social
services.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Welfare Centres
Maternity and child welfare centres have existed for many years. They are part of
the advisory and preventive services of the local health authority; they offer regular
supervision by doctors and nurses to expectant and nursing mothers and young
children. Special sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for early testing
of babies for deafness and other defects, and a feature of the service is the education
of mothers by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and classes. About
three babies out of four are taken to the centres.
Maternal Care
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital according
to the advice given by the doctor or midwife, or according to her own preference if
sufficient hospital beds are available over and above those required for priority cases,
i.e. those for whom domiciliary confinement is inadvisable for medical or obstetric
reasons or because of adverse home conditions. The proportion of confinements taking
place in hospital varies considerably between different areas; the national average has
increased continuously over the past 25 years and is now 64 per cent for England
and Wales and 75 per cent for Scotland.
For a home confinement the services of either a general practitioner obstetrician or
her own family doctor, if he is willing to undertake her maternity care, besides those of
a trained midwife in the domiciliary service of the local health authority, are now
available to every mother. The doctor carries out ante-natal and post-natal examina¬
tions, attends at the confinement and gives any other medical care required. The
services of a consultant obstetrician are also available if the doctor wishes for his
advice. Routine supervision and advice is given by the midwife, who visits regularly
before the confinement to examine the mother and give her advice and help generally.
In addition, the expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction in
preparation for motherhood and in some cases for interim ante-natal supervision.
Frequently it is the midwife who undertakes the actual delivery. Both she and the
doctor attend during the 10 days after confinement. Midwives work in close touch
with the welfare centres in the care of the mother both before and after the birth of
the child.
Other Maternity and Child Welfare Services
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature babies
remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing experienced
nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are some 450 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain provided
by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with them. The National
Health Service Act, 1952, gave local authorities power to make charges for the use of
day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries (of which there are about 600 altogether)
must be registered with the local health authorities; this regulation applies also to
persons who mind for payment more than two children, not all of the same family.
Most local authorities contribute to the cost of the work done by voluntary denomina¬
tional and other bodies which care for unmarried mothers and their babies; a few
authorities make direct provision for their special needs through their health depart¬
ments. The voluntary associations employ specially trained workers to help the
unmarried mother in making plans for herself and her child. Most homes and hostels
for the ante-natal and post-natal care (and, in some cases, the confinement) of these
mothers are provided by such organisations.
SOCIAL WELFARE
Health Visiting
Health visitors are State Registered Nurses who have received training in midwifery
and had a special course of training in health visiting. They are employed by local
health authorities to visit people in their own homes to give advice on the care of
young children, expectant and nursing mothers, people suffering from illness,
including mental illness, and any injury or disability requiring medical or dental
treatment, and on measures necessary to prevent the spread of infection. Their duties
include health education and attendance at ante-natal and child welfare clinics. They
may also undertake tuberculosis visiting and school nursing. A Council for the
Training of Health Visitors is to be set up under the Health Visiting and Social Work
(Training) Act, 1962, for the whole of the United Kingdom to promote the training
of health visitors.
Home Nursing
The employment of nurses to attend patients who require nursing in their own
homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Although many authorities
employ nurses directly for this purpose, others have arranged for voluntary district
nursing associations to provide a service on their behalf.
Domestic Help
Local health authorities (welfare authorities in Northern Ireland) have the power
to make arrangements for domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) in households
where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or the presence of children, old people
or the mentally disordered. This service is mainly used in the care of old or chronically
sick people, in maternity cases and, to a lesser extent but increasingly, for families
where such help is needed to prevent children having to be cared for away from home,
for example, during the absence of the mother. It is not one of the free services, and
authorities may recover from those assisted such charges as the authorities consider
reasonable, having regard to the person’s means.
Ambulance Services
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and hospital
or clinic is provided, where needed, by local authorities either directly or by arrange¬
ment with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service (organised by the
St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, and the Women’s
Voluntary Service) augments the ambulance service in many areas for the conveyance
of sitting patients. In Scotland ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance
Service (St. Andrew’s Ambulance Association and the Scottish branch of the British
Red Cross Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland they are
run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
Prevention of Illness: Care and After-Care
Measures for the prevention of tuberculosis, such as BCG vaccination and detection
and treatment of infectious cases, are the responsibility of all local health authorities.
Facilities for diagnosis and treatment are the responsibility of the hospital service and
are provided through hospitals and chest clinics. The chest physicians staffing these
clinics are often employed jointly by the hospital authorities and local health authorities,
to ensure that diagnosis and treatment are properly co-ordinated with prevention and
after-care. Among the duties of these officers are those of making recommendations for
residential treatment, visiting the homes of patients, and examining and advising
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
I54
‘contacts’. They are assisted in this work by tuberculosis health visitors and nurses
and by almoners or other social workers. Most local health authorities have statutory
or voluntary tuberculosis care committees. BCG vaccination is available to children
of 10 and upwards, to students at universities and colleges, and to various other
persons specially exposed to risk.
Care and after-care of patients is supplemented by general advice and assistance
to the households in which they live. Local health authorities send suitable patients
to the village settlements for tuberculous persons which are run by voluntary bodies
or by local health authorities of other areas; training for employment is carried out
in conjunction with the training and resettlement schemes of the Ministry of Labour.
Care and after-care arrangements are made by all local health authorities for other
types of illness, including mental disorder, to varying extents; in particular, there are
a number of different services for people being nursed at home, such as the loan of
special equipment or the laundering of bed linen. A chiropody service is provided in
many areas. As part of their preventive work, local health authorities may give help
and advice to families, particularly those which may be in difficulties and in danger of
breaking up, or where there is a danger to the physical or mental health of the children.
A charge may be made for some of these services if the person wishing to make
use of them can reasonably be expected to contribute towards their cost.
Vaccination and Immunisation
Arrangements for vaccination against smallpox and immunisation against diphtheria,
without charge, as part of the National Health Service, are made by all local health
authorities; in addition, most local health authorities have similar arrangements for
immunisation against whooping cough and tetanus.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis is also available through local health authorities
for persons under 40; those over 40 may be vaccinated by their general practitioner.
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis is available to certain adults and children (see
above).
Health Centres
Fifteen health centres which provide primarily for the association of general medical
practice with maternity and child welfare services and the school health service have
been set up by local health authorities in England and Wales. This is one form of
co-operation between the different elements in the health service. Other forms of
co-operation are growing, such as the siting of group practices adjacent to local health
authority clinics, the attendance of midwives for ante-natal sessions at general
practitioners’ surgeries and the attachment of health visitors to particular practices
for the whole or part of their time. The provision of the two health centres in Scotland
is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland and not of local health
authorities.
Problems of the National Health Service
The National Health Service is not without its difficulties and shortcomings. For
example, the original ideal of comprehensive free treatment for all has to some extent
been breached by the introduction of charges for some parts of the Service which the
majority of the users have to pay. In spite of these, the total cost of the Service has
continued to rise, because of such factors as increases in prices and in staff salaries,
the high cost of many new drugs and of modern equipment, the increased use made by
the public of the services provided, extensions and improvements of the service and an
SOCIAL WELFARE
J55
increased rate of capital expenditure. More doctors, dentists, midwives and nurses are
needed by an expanding service. There is also some disparity between different parts
of the country; some areas have more family doctors than others, more hospital beds
for confinements of mothers who would prefer to have their babies in hospital though
they do not need specialist medical care, and more extensive local authority services.
On the credit side of the balance may be set the steady improvement in the country’s
vital statistics to which the National Health Service has largely contributed, the
decrease in invalidity from neglected ailments, and the removal of anxiety about the
cost of treatment from which many of those who now use the service previously suffered.
HEALTH SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland the historical development of the health services has taken
broadly the same course as in other parts of the United Kingdom, and the health
services established under the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, corre¬
spond fairly closely to the medical care system established under the National Health
Service in Great Britain. The essential principle is that the same range of services
shall be available to citizens in Northern Ireland as in England, Wales and Scotland.
The services in Northern Ireland are financed as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
The hospital and specialist services are administered by the Northern Ireland
Hospitals Authority (which corresponds approximately to a regional hospital board in
Great Britain) through hospital management committees. In hospital administration
the role of the central government is not quite so immediate and direct as in Great
Britain: hospital property, for example, is vested not in the Minister of Health and
Local Government but in the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority, which has under
its control 75 hospitals containing in all about 17,000 beds. The administration of the
general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary eye services is in the
hands of the Northern Ireland Health Services Board, which takes the place of the
executive councils in Great Britain. Local health services are administered by the six
county councils and the two county borough councils in Northern Ireland. The range
of local authority services and the arrangements made by the Northern Ireland
General Health Services Board for the provision of services, and for the remuneration
of the persons providing them, are similar to those already described for the rest of
the United Kingdom.
VOLUNTARY AID FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive welfare services for sick and
handicapped people in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision made by
central and local authorities. Many convalescent homes and homes for the infirm and
for people with specific handicaps are, or were originally, provided by voluntary effort.
In many areas invalid children and others needing care in their own homes are visited
and helped by voluntary organisations. Though the need for material aid from private
sources becomes less as public provision extends, many forms of help to meet individual
needs that would not otherwise be met are given by voluntary agencies. Their most
valuable role is probably to provide small personal services and the continued personal
interest that can mean so much to a sick or handicapped person. These voluntary
agencies usually depend largely on the work of part-time or full-time unpaid volunteers.
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual voluntary
helpers. The majority of the hospitals in England and Wales have their own Leagues
of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who organise and undertake a variety
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
156
of services for their hospitals. Many hospitals also have help from the British Red
Cross Society, the Order of St. John, the Women’s Voluntary Service, or a similar
organisation. The operation of canteens for out-patients, and trolley-shops and book
and picture library services for in-patients, visiting in the wards, receiving new patients,
and mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken.
THE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from registered medical practitioners, only
persons whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise dentistry in Britain. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’ train¬
ing in medical school and hospital, plus one year as an intern; for a dentist, four or
more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profes¬
sion is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is the
General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956. The British
Medical Association is the doctors’ professional association; that of the dentists is
the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration as a
general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick children’s, mental,
and mental deficiency nursing. The course for an enrolled nurse is a two-year one. The
governing body of the nursing profession is the General Nursing Council, set up in
1919. Midwives must have the certificate of the Central Midwives Board. Most pupil
midwives are already state registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them
the two-year midwifery training period is reduced to one year and, for state enrolled
nurses, to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Mid¬
wives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives.
Only registered pharmaceutical chemists may practise as pharmacists or describe
themselves as such, and qualifications requiring four to five years’ academic study
and practical training are necessary for registration. The Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain is the governing body of the profession. Under the Opticians’ Act, 1958,
a General Optical Council regulates the profession of ophthalmic optician and only
registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners) may test sight.
Training takes three years followed by a year under supervision.
For the professions of chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory technician, occupa¬
tional therapist, physiotherapist, radiographer, remedial gymnast and speech therapist
a good general education is required, followed by professional training, mostly of
two or three years. Only people with approved qualifications may be employed in
these professions in the National Health Service. Except for speech therapists, these
professions will shortly have their own professional boards, supervised by the Council
for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. The length and nature of the training
varies according to the profession and may be as long as three years.
Almoners must obtain the certificate of the Institute of Almoners, or have taken a
recognised university course to qualify them for membership of the Institute.
Psychiatric social workers are required to have a certificate showing they have attended
the mental health course provided at certain universities.
MEDICAL RESEARCH
The Medical Research Council (see p. 157) is the main governmental organisation
engaged in medical research in Britain. A considerable amount of research, however,
SOCIAL WELFARE
I57
is carried out by the universities and their associated medical schools and in hospitals
in the National Health Service for which the Minister of Health and the Secretary of
State for Scotland are responsible.
A valuable contribution to research in various branches of medicine is made by
private organisations, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the Nuffield
Foundation are probably the largest. There is close co-operation between the Medical
Research Council and these organisations to ensure the best allocation of their
respective resources.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council’s programme of work is carried out both in its
own research establishments and by independent investigators, in the universities
and elsewhere, with support from the Council in the form of research grants. The pro¬
gramme includes fundamental studies of the structure and natural processes of the
body; clinical and laboratory studies of disease; the development and evaluation of
special methods of treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of
social and occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.
In planning and carrying out its programme, the Council is assisted by special
advisory committees which it appoints. Two of the more important of these are the
Clinical Research Board, set up in consultation with the health departments to assist
the development of clinical research, and the Tropical Medicine Research Board,
appointed in consultation with the Department of Technical Co-operation, to advise
on the promotion and co-ordination of research in this field.
WELFARE SERVICES
Welfare Services for the Blind, the Deaf and the Disabled
All local welfare authorities provide services for the blind, either directly or through
voluntary organisations acting as their agents. They are also providing, or arranging
for, welfare services for the deaf and other handicapped people, including the mentally
disordered of all descriptions; voluntary organisations also play an important part in
this work by supplementing local authority services. Local authorities are required
to keep registers of the blind in their areas and of deaf and other physically handicapped
people who wish to register.
Services for the blind include a home visiting and teaching service, employing
qualified home teachers, to assist the blind to adjust themselves to their blindness
(special attention is given to the newly blind and to those with more than one disability,
such as the deaf-blind); instruction in craft work and in the use of embossed symbols
for reading and writing; social clubs, holiday and other recreational facilities; the
supply or loan of apparatus, such as wireless sets, embossed and recorded books,
adapted tools and games; residential social rehabilitation and placement in employ¬
ment; and an advisory service on the special financial and other benefits available to
the blind (including preventive and medical treatment, special education, and training
for employment). Voluntary organisations for blind welfare include local blind
societies and also national bodies, notably the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
the National Library for the Blind, St. Dunstan’s (for those blinded in the wars),
the Scottish National Federation for the Welfare of the Blind and the Scottish National
Institution for the War Blinded.
Progress is being made with services similar to those available for the blind for
other severely and permanently disabled people. The teaching of handicrafts, training

I58
for employment either in open industry or sheltered workshops, the organisation of
social centres, clubs and other social activities, the adaptation of premises to meet
individual disabilities, and the arrangement of holidays, are some of those most
generally provided.
Old People’s Welfare
A number of home services for old people are provided by statutory and voluntary
bodies to help them to go on living in their own homes for as long as possible. Local
health authorities supply, under the National Health Service, home nursing and
domestic help (see p. 153); over half the district nurses’ time is spent on the aged or
the chronic sick and the same group makes the heaviest demands on the home help
service.
Local authorities are enabled by the National Assistance Act to provide meals and
recreation for old people either directly or through the agency of voluntary organisa¬
tions. They also have power to assist voluntary organisations by contributing to the
cost of the services, giving or lending furniture, vehicles or equipment, permitting
organisations to use premises belonging to the local authority and making available
the services of local authority staff in this connection.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees have been formed and are aided by the
National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated group of the National Council
of Social Service widely representative of voluntary and statutory bodies having direct
contact with old people, or by the Scottish Old People’s Welfare Committee, a com¬
mittee of the Scottish Council of Social Service. A National Corporation for the Care
of Old People was established in 1947 by the Nuffield Foundation1 to stimulate and
to give financial support to schemes for the welfare of the aged, to maintain an expert
technical advisory service, and to encourage and undertake research and experiment
for the welfare of old people. It is now concentrating its main effort on home services.
The King George VI Foundation, which was financed from the fund raised in
memory of the late King, spent nearly £600,000 on schemes for old people, by way
of grants for the development of existing clubs, the establishment of new clubs, and
the training of workers to help old people.
Residential Accommodation
Local authorities provide residential accommodation, under the National Assistance
Act, for the aged, infirm and others, and temporary accommodation for people who
lose their homes, for example, in some disaster such as fire or floods. The newer
homes provided by local authorities for aged and other infirm persons usually have
accommodation for 40 to 60 residents; over 1,360 have been opened in Great Britain
since the end of the second world war. County welfare authorities in Northern Ireland
have provided 27 similar homes. These smaller homes are gradually replacing the
larger institutions which were previously maintained by local authorities. There are
also about 2,000 small homes for old and disabled people run by voluntary bodies or
by private individuals.
1 The Nuffield Foundation was established by Lord Nuffield in 1943 for the advancement of
health and the prevention and relief of sickness; the advancement of social well-being; the
care and comfort of the aged poor; the advancement of education; and such other charitable
purposes as might be declared by Lord Nuffield in his lifetime and by the trustees after his
death. Prominent among the foundation’s many activities are the promotion of medical, scientific
and social research and the development of medical services and of technical and commercial
education. Its resources consist of a fund of £10 million provided by Lord Nuffield and of gifts
and bequests from other persons.
SOCIAL WELFARE
159
1 he National Assistance Board, which is responsible for influencing ‘persons
without a settled way of living’ to lead a more normal life, provides temporary accom¬
modation for them in reception centres, sometimes through the agency of local
authorities. For men who have become demoralised by long unemployment and who
are in receipt of national assistance grants or are using reception centres, it runs one
non-residential and two residential re-establishment centres where they are given help
to fit them again for work.
Welfare Services in Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the services provided under the Welfare Services Act (Northern
Ireland), 1949 (as amended), are broadly similar in scope to those provided in Great
Britain under the National Assistance Act, the only notable exception being the
inclusion of domestic help services, which in Great Britain are provided under the
National Health Service Act. Local welfare services are provided by the six county
and two county borough councils. The cost of the services is shared, as in Great
Britain, between local taxation and the Exchequer.
CHILD WELFARE
Care of Children Deprived of Normal Home Life
The Children Act, 1948, which came into force with the ending of the Poor Law,
places upon local authorities in Great Britain a duty to receive into their care any
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been abandoned
or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or permanently. Local
authorities must keep a child in care until he is 18 years of age or until he no longer
requires it. Under the Children and Young Persons Acts, 1933-52, as regards England
and Wales, and under the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Acts, 1937 and 1956,
local authorities are required also to accept children committed to their care, until the
age of 18, by juvenile courts, as needing care or protection. Both categories of children
are to be treated so as to further their best interests and to afford them opportunity for
the proper development of their characters and interests.
Children in care are, if possible, boarded out with foster parents, who receive an
allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home cannot be found for a
child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may be placed in a children’s home
managed by a local authority or a voluntary organisation. Many children’s homes are
now provided in small houses, on housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group
of twelve or fewer children live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the
husband following his normal employment. Other children may be placed in hostels
or lodgings or in other accommodation specially suited to their needs. The desirability
of returning a child to his family circle as soon as possible is fully appreciated, and work
is carried out to rehabilitate the family where this is necessary.
To carry out its functions under the Children Act, each local authority (county
council and county borough council or, in Scotland, council of a large burgh) is
required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s officer to be responsible
for the care and upbringing of children in the authority’s care. Children’s officers are
assisted by a staff of child care officers who undertake inquiries and who supervise
children placed in foster homes. Regulations for England and Wales safeguarding
the boarding out of children by local authorities and voluntary organisations and the
conduct of children’s homes have been made by the Home Secretary. In Scotland
similar regulations have been made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The cost of
i6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the local authorities’ child care service, including the provision of training for house-
parents and child care officers, is shared between the local authorities and the
Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland), 1950,
gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county borough (under the general
direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) the duty of caring for homeless and neglected
children. Legislation relating to children and arrangements for their care follow the
same general principles as in Great Britain.
War orphans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insur¬
ance (see p. 144).
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue to
play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as Dr. Barnardo’s, the
Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic Child Welfare Council, are
constituent societies of the National Council of Associated Children’s Homes, to
which a large number of smaller voluntary homes are also affiliated. In Scotland a
valuable contribution is also made by the Children’s Homes and Hostels under the
auspices of the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other
voluntary organisations, including the Quarriers’ Home (formerly the Orphans’ Homes
of Scotland). Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations (of which there are
about 620 in Great Britain and 23 in Northern Ireland) are required to be registered
under the Children Act (in Northern Ireland under the Children and Young Persons
Act). The boarding out of children and all children’s homes, whether local authority
or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by Inspectors of the Home Office
Children’s Department, of the Scottish Home and Health Department or of the
Northern Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs.
Adoption
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926, in
Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. Over 15,000 adoption orders are
made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 250 in Northern Ireland;
there are always more would-be adopters than children available for adoption.
Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act, 1958, in Great Britain and by the
Adoption of Children Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, in Northern Ireland. The Registrars
General keep registers of adopted children; adoption societies (there are over 80
societies which arrange adoptions) must be registered with the local authority (in
Northern Ireland with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
Welfare of Children Living in Their Own Homes
To safeguard the welfare of children living with their own parents or guardians, the
children’s departments have a duty to cause inquiries to be made in any case in which it
is reported that a child may need care or protection, unless they are satisfied that such
inquiries are unnecessary. In addition, local authorities, at the request of the Govern¬
ment departments concerned, have appointed local committees to co-ordinate local
authority and voluntary services dealing with unsatisfactory families; one of their
officers is designated as co-ordinating officer for the purpose of calling meetings of
interested bodies to discuss particular ‘problem families’ and to decide on a course of
action. These problem families, a very small minority in the community, are the focus
of much attention from health, housing, education, children’s and welfare authorities
and voluntary bodies. The voluntary Family Service Units undertake intensive and
prolonged casework with such families and there are several voluntary recuperative
SOCIAL WELFARE l6l
centres to which mothers, with their children, can be sent for a period of residential
training, sometimes as a condition of a probation order.
The old-established National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
and its Scottish counterpart between them maintain inspectors and visitors throughout
the United Kingdom for the investigation of cases of reported cruelty to, or neglect of,
children in their own homes; when necessary they resort to law for the protection of
such children, but they prefer to achieve their purpose by warning and advice.
EDUCATION
There are nearly nine million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, training colleges or technical colleges in the United Kingdom.
Over 90 per cent of school children attend publicly provided or aided schools. The
universities are independent, self-governing institutions but are aided from public
funds. Most technical colleges and other centres of further education are publicly
maintained. Many schools and colleges continue to benefit from the endowments
provided by benefactors in past centuries.
The bulk of the expenditure on education in the United Kingdom therefore comes
from public funds. Total public expenditure on education, including university
education, exceeded £1,000 million in the year 1961-62.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary educa¬
tion dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning of the present
century. In 1833 Government had begun to make annual grants to the voluntary
societies which were providing schools, and the Elementary Education Act of 1870
accepted the principle of compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century
elementary education had become virtually both compulsory and free of charge.
Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England
under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public education in
England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational opportunities at
every stage.
The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems both have long histories
independent of that of education in England, but the same general policy is now
being implemented throughout the United Kingdom, with some national variations.
Educational Administration
Administration of publicly provided education in Britain is divided between the
central Government departments (the Ministry of Education for England and Wales,
with its separate Welsh Department, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland), local education authorities, and various
voluntary organisations. The relation between these three groups is based on consulta¬
tion and co-operation, both by direct contact between the parties and through Her
Majesty’s Inspectors of Education who act as liaison officers, particularly between local
education authorities and the departments.
The local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate provision
is made in their areas for the two stages of school education (primary and secondary),
and that those pupils who would profit by proceeding to a university are not deterred
by lack of financial means. They are also responsible for the provision of all forms of
‘further education’, i.e. post-school education outside the universities.
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher of each
school and the individual teachers. In England and Wales teachers are not subject
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
l62
to direction from the central department on questions relating to curricula or methods.
Her Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools includ¬
ing independent schools, review and report on the content and value of the education
provided and, during their visits, are available as advisers. Local education authorities
also employ inspectors to advise on the schools which they maintain. In Scotland
the broad outline of schemes of work in primary and secondary schools is subject to the
approval of one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors. In Northern Ireland the curriculum of
each grant-aided school is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Education, but
considerable latitude is afforded both in the scope of the curriculum and in the
methods employed.
SCHOOLS
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 15. The school¬
leaving age is to be raised to 16 as soon as enough teachers and adequate accommoda¬
tion become available to allow of this being done without thereby increasing the size
of classes; this, however, is unlikely to be possible for some years to come. In England
and Wales nearly 7 million children are attending publicly maintained schools, besides
121,000 others who are at schools receiving direct grants from the Ministry of Educa¬
tion. There are also 495,000 children of all ages at about 4,000 independent schools.
In Scotland 887,000 children are attending publicly maintained or aided schools and
about 17,000 are at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 285,000 children are
attending publicly maintained or aided schools; independent schools are few. The
number of school children in Britain is increasing; as the exceptionally large numbers
of children born shortly after the second world war passed from primary to secondary
schools, reduced numbers of primary school children have been more than offset by
larger numbers in secondary schools, especially as more children each year stay on
beyond the minimum school-leaving age. Moreover, while there was a certain drop in
the birth rate after 1949, the rates for 1958 and 1959 rose again sharply, so that primary
school numbers will again be very high in 1963-64. There is, therefore, a continuing
demand for more teachers and more school buildings.
In England and in Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to be taught
together in primary schools, but rather more than half the secondary schools are
for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales; and in Scotland
all but a few city schools take both boys and girls.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except in classes
for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are co-educational.
In England and Wales three kinds of school are supported from public funds:
county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained by local education
authorities, i.e. their full cost falls on public funds; voluntary schools (mostly ‘aided’
or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a voluntary body, usually of a
religious denomination, but which are maintained by local education authorities1; and
direct grant schools which are completely independent of local education authorities
but receive a grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education. These last (the smallest
group) mostly provide education of the grammar school type; they include some schools
of ancient foundation.
1 Aided schools have more independence than controlled schools, but they are partly responsible
for maintaining their buildings (see p. 169) whereas controlled schools are not. Over a third of
the schools maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools
and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are some 2,000 Roman Catholic
voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.
SOCIAL WELFARE
163
In Scotland most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by educa¬
tion authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type
of independent school of which there are also a few in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
see p. 165). There are also a few grant-aided schools (some of ancient foundation)
conducted by voluntary managers and receiving grants direct from the Scottish
Education Department.
In Northern Ireland there are county schools, managed by local education
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under voluntary
management. J
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending schools
maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment are supplied
free. Direct grant schools still charge fees but must offer each year, to pupils who
have at any time previously attended a grant-aided primary school for not less than
two years, free places to the extent of not less than 25 per cent of the previous year’s
admission; and a further 25 per cent of the places must be put at the disposal of the
local education authorities if they require them. Pupils occupying these latter places
need not previously have attended a grant-aided primary school. Day pupils not hold-
ing free places are entitled to claim a remission of fees in accordance with an approved
income scale, and the Ministry of Education pays the governors of the school the
amount of the fees so remitted. Local education authorities also pay for some free
places in independent schools which normally charge fees. A number of independent
schools are able to offer some scholarships from endowments.
^ In Scotland education authorities may charge fees in certain schools provided
tnat this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all who desire it.
In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending any
county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school; qualified pupils attend¬
ing both county and voluntary grammar schools receive scholarships from the local
education authorities which cover the whole or most of the fees charged by the school.
Primary Schools
A child’s primary education continues until about the age of n in England, Wales
and Northern Iieland and 12 in Scotland. There are some nursery schools and classes
for children between 2 and 5 years old. In England and Wales there are infant schools,
or departments, for all children between 5 and 7 and junior schools for those aged 7 to
11, while in Scotland there are primary departments for children aged 5 to 12 years.
In Scotland primary pupils must be taught reading, writing, arithmetic, English,
music, art and handwork, nature study, physical training and, at the appropriate
stage, history, geography, and written composition; girls must learn needlework.
Religious instruction is also given. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the
curriculum is similar in scope, with the addition in Wales of the teaching of Welsh.
(Children who speak Welsh at home normally receive the early stages of their primary
education in Welsh and are taught English as a second language.)
Secondary Schools
Public provision of secondary education is being greatly extended with the aim
of giving all children an education suited to their particular abilities.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Since the organisation of schools is a responsibility of local education authorities
in England and Wales, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Education, the type
j64 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of provision made for secondary education varies to some extent between areas. In
some areas, different types of school specialise, in particular in the later years, in
different types of course, with arrangements for the transfer of pupils between schools
where desirable; in others, flexibility is achieved by an overlap of the courses provided
in different types of school. There are, however, two main types of publicly maintained
secondary schools in England and Wales: grammar schools and secondary modern
schools.
Grammar schools take children who hope to reach a university and others likely
to profit from an academic type of education. A large proportion of university students
are recruited from these schools which, in England and Wales, are attended by about
one secondary school pupil in four. Secondary modern schools form the largest group
of secondary schools. They give a general education with a practical bias, closely
related to the interests and environment of their pupils. There is also a small group
of secondary technical schools \ these schools offer an education related to industry,
including commerce, and agriculture, but still general, and not vocational, in purpose.
Each local education authority decides how the selection shall be made for its
secondary schools: generally speaking, this selection depends upon an assessment
of the child’s ability as shown in the primary school, often coupled with objective
tests taken at about eleven years of age, which are commonly known as ‘the eleven-
plus’. There is provision for an appeal to the Minister of Education in the event of
a dispute between a local education authority and a parent, and authorities reconsider
original decisions when subsequent events prove this to be necessary. Both the system
of allocating children to different types of secondary school at the age of eleven and the
selection methods used have been the subject of much public discussion and critical
thought. Local education authorities are constantly experimenting with methods of
selection which will minimise any strain on children or their parents. At the same
time, the authorities are seeking to organise their schools in such a way that every
child will have, and feel that he has, the opportunity to develop his talents to the full.
For those pupils who can profitably follow them, many modern schools now offer
courses of the type found in grammar and secondary technical schools.
The London County Council and some other local education authorities have
established comprehensive schools providing all types of secondary education for all, or
most of, the children of a district. In urban areas such schools tend to be largei than
the other types of school and may have as many as 2,000 pupils.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools, secondary intermediate schools,
which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England and Wales,
and technical intermediate schools, which offer the same facilities as secondary technical
schools in England and Wales.
The number of pupils remaining at school beyond the minimum leaving age has
been increasing steadily for some years. Thirty-one per cent of the 15- to 16-year-old
age group is now still in full-time education at schools or technical colleges, and
nearly 16 per cent of the 16- to 17-year-old age group. Most grammar school pupils
remain at school until they are 16 years old, some until they are 17, 18 or 19 years old.
Most secondary modern pupils at present leave at the age of 15, but the number
staying on until the age of 16 is increasing.
Scotland
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing courses
extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary schools, and those
providing courses of four, five or six years, known as senior secondary schools. In
SOCIAL WELFARE
i65
each type of school the courses are intended to provide a general education, but
they are differentiated in character to suit the varying needs and abilities of the pupils,
and include literary, commercial, boys’ technical, domestic and rural courses. While
some schools are purely junior secondary and some purely senior secondary, there
are also many schools of the comprehensive type, traditional in Scotland, in which all
kinds of courses, both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Over
one-third of all pupils go on to senior secondary courses on reaching secondary
school age.
Promotion from the primary to the secondary school takes place usually between the
ages of nj and i2-|-. The fitness of pupils to profit from the various types of secondary
course is assessed on the basis of teachers’ estimates of attainment, intelligence tests,
and attainment tests, with due regard to the wishes of the parents. There is provision
for an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the event of a dispute between
the education authority and the parent and also for the reconsideration of original
allocations if, later, transfer to another course appears to be necessary.
Special Schools
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is provided
between the ages of five (or less) and 16 for children who require it on account of
any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment. There are about 970
special schools in the United Kingdom, including hospital schools, day and boarding
schools, and boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are ten categories of handicapped
pupils for whom local education authorities must provide special educational treatment:
blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially deaf, delicate, educationally subnormal, epileptic,
maladjusted, physically handicapped, and children suffering from speech defects.
(There is not a separate category for the delicate in Scotland.)
Independent Schools
The largest and most important of the independent schools are known in England
as public schools, although not all schools classed as public schools are independent
(those which are not are mostly direct-grant schools) and public schools form only a
minority of all independent schools.
The public school is a characteristic English institution which has made a notable
contribution to English education. Many public schools date from the sixteenth
century, some are older (e.g., Winchester, founded in 1382, and Eton, founded in
1440), and most have some income from endowments. Each is controlled by its
own board of governors. Public schools have emphasised the importance of character¬
building, and in these schools were developed the prefect system, whereby day-to-day
discipline is largely maintained by the pupils themselves, and the house system,
whereby a school is divided into groups of about 50 pupils, each under the care of a
housemaster. The public school is also characterised by a high staffing ratio and a
high proportion of pupils doing advanced work. A public school is often, although
not necessarily, a boarding school; day boys are also taken at some of these boarding
schools. The usual age of entry to the independent public schools for boys is 13 and
the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public schools modelled to a certain
extent on the public schools for boys.
Independent schools also include preparatory schools, many of them boarding
schools, for boys aged from about 8 to 13 years most of whom are intending to enter
public schools; some similar schools for girls; and a wide range of other day and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
166
boarding schools covering every age group and grade of education and every variety
of educational method. Some of these schools are owned and managed, often under
a trust deed, by independent non-profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned by
proprietors for whom the running of the school provides a living. All independent
schools must be registered with the Ministry of Education, or, in Scotland, with the
Registrar of Independent Schools.
Secondary School Examinations
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils and candidates not attending school may take an examination known as
the General Certificate of Education (GCE). This examination, which is on a single
subject and not a grouped subject basis (i.e. no subject is obligatory and individual
subjects may be taken at different times), is conducted at ‘ordinary’ and ‘advanced’
levels. Most candidates for the ordinary level are about 16 years of age, although
many take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most grammar school
pupils and an increasing number from other secondary schools take the ordinary
examination, and passes in various subjects are widely accepted for entry to courses
of vocational training. The advanced examination is at university entrance level
(supplemented, from 1963, by special papers to help university authorities in selecting
students) and is accepted also for purposes of entry to many forms of professional
training.
In Scotland courses in senior secondary schools lead to examinations conducted by
the Scottish Education Department. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary grade
of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth year can obtain passes
on the Higher grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education at a standard equivalent
to that of the former Higher grade of the Scottish Leaving Certificate. Examinations
at both grades are open to candidates who have left school.
In Northern Ireland the Junior Certificate Examination is taken at about the age
of 15 and the Senior Certificate Examination, which is conducted at two levels, at
about 17 years of age.
Teachers
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing bodies
or managers. In 1961 there was one full-time teacher to 24 pupils in publicly main¬
tained primary and secondary schools in England and Wales and Scotland; the figure
was 26 for Northern Ireland. The high birth rate at the end of the second world
war is the chief of several factors in the present need for more teachers and, as more
teachers enter the profession, the Government’s first aim in educational improvements
is to reduce the size of over-large classes in England and Wales to the statutory
maxima of 40 for a primary school and 30 for a secondary.
There are 158 teacher-training colleges in England and Wales; in the academic
year 1961-62 there were nearly 34,43o students in these colleges, and the number is
expected to rise to 54,000 by 1966-67; many colleges are being extended and several
new ones are to be built. Until recently the usual training course has lasted for two
years, with three-year courses for women taking housecraft or physical education,
but the ordinary course was extended to three years in September i960. The courses
are generally residential but since i960 eight colleges have been opened for ‘day’
students only, with the object of attracting students, often older than average, whose
domestic responsibilities would prevent their living in college. There are 24 university
SOCIAL WELFARE
167
departments of education providing a one-year course for graduates. In Scotland
all teacher training is provided in four general colleges of education, two denomina¬
tional colleges and a college for training women teachers of physical education.
Courses are normally of one year’s duration for graduates or the equivalent, and
of three years for non-graduates. During 1961-62 there were over 5,500 students in
these colleges and a programme of extension and new building has been started to
relieve pressure on accommodation. Northern Ireland has three general teachers’
training colleges, one university training department and three specialist colleges—
one for training teachers of physical education, one for teachers of domestic science
and one for teachers of art. The basic course in the general training colleges lasts three
years. The education departments, the universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short courses for practising teachers.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland; and these scales influence the salaries paid to teachers in
independent schools. There are also national superannuation schemes which are
administered by the central departments.
In England and Wales agreed salary scales are submitted to the Minister of
Education by joint committees of representatives of local education authorities’ and
teachers’ associations. The best known of these committees are the Burnham
Committees dealing with the salaries of teachers in primary and secondary schools and
in establishments of further education. The Minister can accept or reject (but not
modify) the committees’ recommendations and make the approved scales mandatory
on local education authorities.
Over 2,500 teachers leave Britain annually for posts in schools, teacher-training
colleges, technical colleges and universities in other parts of the Commonwealth,
including 600 who go to serve in the developing countries of the Commonwealth.
Steps taken by the Government to encourage teachers to serve for a period overseas
have included the establishment of a National Council for the Supply of Teachers
Overseas and the introduction of special measures to safeguard teachers’ interests
both while abroad and on their return home.
Interchange schemes, under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a year
with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another with Common¬
wealth countries, whereby each year over 100 British teachers exchange posts with
teachers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Official
schemes also operate between Britain and several European countries for exchanges
and temporary assistants’ posts for language specialists.
Broadcasting and Visual Aids
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out 59 sound transmissions a week which reach more than 29,000 schools in
the United Kingdom, over 70 per cent of the possible total. Television broadcasts
to schools were begun in 1957 by both the British Broadcasting Corporation and
Associated Rediffusion Limited. In June 1962 over 3,000 schools were equipped to
receive the television programmes. The BBC broadcasts eleven television series a
week to schools and, with repeat broadcasts, a total of 24 transmissions each week;
Associated Rediffusion’s output is similar. Neither sound nor television broadcasting
attempts to cover the whole school curriculum or to replace the teacher; the purpose
is to supplement existing work in the schools. Other visual aids to education—films, film
strips, wall charts, pictures, and models—are being used increasingly in Britain’s schools.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
168
Since the autumn of 1962 the BBC has broadcast special sound and television
programmes for students taking general courses at technical colleges and colleges of
further education.
Religion in Schools
In England and Wales all children in county or voluntary schools receive religious
instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless their parents object.
In county schools, and in certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruc¬
tion of an undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary
school there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In county schools in
Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access to give religious instruction to children
of their denomination for a limited period each week. In Scotland, subject to safeguards
for the individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruction are in the hands
of the school managers, but there are a number of denominational schools conducted
by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part of the
life and education of the independent public schools and most of these schools are
linked to some religious denomination.
Health and Welfare of School Children
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum of all
schools.
The School Health Service provides regular medical examination and certain free
treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local education authorities.
Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child guidance centres. (There are
also child guidance clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern Ireland the
School Health Service is operated by the health authorities.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all school children who
wish to have it, and the School Meals Service provides a daily dinner at a subsidised
price (remitted where there is need) to just over half the pupils in county and voluntary
schools. Education authorities have power to provide free transport for children who
live more than a reasonable distance from the schools which they attend; this distance
is defined as two miles for those under eight years and three miles for those over eight
years (11 years in Northern Ireland).
School Building
Local education authorities are responsible for providing the schools and other
buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central departments exercise
control by approving annual building programmes, framing regulations, fixing cost
limits and approving or rejecting the authorities’ plans; they also offer guidance to
authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
An extensive building programme for education has been undertaken in Britain
since 1947. Many war-damaged schools had to be repaired or rebuilt. Entirely new
schools, both primary and secondary, were needed to provide for the increased
number of children of school age, for the many post-war housing estates and for the
new towns; new buildings were also needed to replace or improve those which were
out of date and ill-equipped by modern standards. By the end of 1961 over 6,000 new
post-war schools had been completed in Britain, over 700 more were under construc¬
tion, and extensions had been made to a very large number of existing schools; but
much remains to be done. In 1959 the Government announced a school building
SOCIAL WELFARE
169
programme for the five years 1960-65 amounting in value to about £300 million in
England and Wales and ^65 million in Scotland. In Northern Ireland 358 new schools
had been completed by the end of 1961.
To help voluntary schools to keep pace with county schools in the standard of
their buildings, the Education Act, 1959, raised the rate of grant for alterations,
improvements and external repairs to 75 per cent of the approved cost. With a few
exceptions, the schools affected are Church of England or Roman Catholic aided
schools. Grants may also be made for building new aided secondary schools needed
for children from aided primary schools which existed on 15th June, 1959. Similar
provisions for grants of 65 per cent of the approved costs of voluntary schools’ building
and repairs have existed in Northern Ireland since 1948.
Advantage is being taken of the opportunity afforded by the extensive school
building programme to introduce new ideas and methods in the design and construc¬
tion of schools. Several education authorities have successfully developed systems
employing prefabricated structures and component parts. New schools are light and
airy, with an imaginative use of colour and generous provision of practical rooms and
space for outdoor games.
UNIVERSITIES
There are 24 universities in the United Kingdom: 18 in England, four in Scotland,
the University of Wales, and the Queen’s University of Belfast in Northern Ireland.
The English universities are: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, Exeter,
Hull, Keele (until 1962 the University College of North Staffordshire), Leeds,
Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Sheffield,
Southampton, and the new University of Sussex which admitted its first students in
October 1961. The only other degree-giving institution (in Arts and Theology) is
St. David’s College at Lampeter, Wales. Plans have been approved for the establish¬
ment of universities in York, Norwich, Canterbury, Coventry, Colchester and Lan¬
caster. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the other universities were
founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are each composed of a number of
residential colleges. These colleges are corporate bodies governed by their own Fellows
and distinct from the university. Most of the Fellows of the colleges are university
teachers or officers and the majority of university teachers are also Fellows of colleges.
The universities, as distinct from the colleges, own the main libraries, laboratories,
and other buildings used for teaching and research.
The other universities in Britain are in the main non-residential and most are non-
collegiate. Those composed of groups of largely autonomous colleges are London,
which, with over 20,000 students, is by far the largest of Britain’s universities; Durham,
which includes King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne1; and St. Andrews, which con¬
sists of colleges in St. Andrews itself and in Dundee. The University of Wales com¬
prises the University Colleges of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff and Swansea, and the
Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff.
The education departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and their
relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school teachers, the
1 A proposal to separate King’s College from Durham and establish it as an independent
university is under consideration.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
170
provision of extra-mural education, and the award of scholarships from public funds.
The universities receive aid from the State mainly in the form of direct grants from the
Treasury which, in Great Britain, are made on the advice of the University Grants
Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer from persons
with wide experience of schools and universities, or experience in industry.
The proportion of university income provided by the Exchequer is increasing and
in 1960-61 was 72-7 per cent for Great Britain. Another 2-0 per cent was contributed
by local authorities, 9-4 per cent by fees, and the balance by endowments and other
sources. Expenditure from public funds on the universities, including capital grants
and awards to university students, has doubled in the past five years and now exceeds
£100 million annually.
Students
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no religious
test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with men, but at Cambridge
their numbers are limited by statute. The general proportion of men to women
students is three to one; at Oxford it is six to one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
All universities limit the number of undergraduates. Despite recent expansion
programmes, applications for places still exceed the number available. In 1962 details
were announced of a ‘clearing house’ scheme to simplify university entrance which
will come fully into operation with applications for admission in October 1964 after
a trial year in 1963 when it will deal with applications from students of technology
only. Prospective candidates will then apply for places through the Universities
Central Council on Admissions instead of to individual universities and the ‘clearing
house’ will automatically pass on rejected applications to the next university of the
candidate’s choice. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, the medical and dental
schools of London University, and the Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Belfast will not participate in the ‘clearing house’ and will retain their existing
methods for admission.
At the beginning of the academic year 1961-62, there were 115,000 full-time
students at universities or university colleges in the United Kingdom. This total,
more than double the pre-war figure, is to be still further expanded (see p. 171).
Scholarships and Other Awards
Scholarships and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the national
educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by lack of means from
taking an advanced course at a university or elsewhere. About 80 per cent of university
students in Great Britain are now aided from public or private funds.
Until 1962 the Ministry of Education offered 2,000 state scholarships annually
which were competed for by prospective students wishing to take honours courses at
universities or courses of comparable standard at technical colleges. Over 16,000 other
students entering comparable courses received awards from local education authorities
in England and Wales. As a result of the recommendations of the Anderson Committee,
in 1961 the Government introduced the first of a series of measures to improve and
simplify the awards system and establish it on a national basis. Since October 1961 in
England, Wales and Scotland all British students with certain qualifications have been
eligible for an award from public funds in order to attend full-time at a university,
teacher-training college or other major further education establishment. In England
and Wales state scholarships were abolished after 1962 and under the Education Act,
1962, local authorities have the duty of providing all new grants for university
SOCIAL WELFARE
171
students and students taking comparable courses. In Scotland students’ allowances for
university and comparable courses are awarded by the Scottish Education Department.
An award, as in the past, depends upon the income of the student or his parents.
A certain number of studentships for postgraduate study in arts subjects are offered
annually by the Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department.
Postgraduate awards to scientists and technologists are made by the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research and the Research Councils, which awarded 1,300
studentships in i960.
University scholarships in Northern Ireland are awarded by the local education
authorities. The Ministry of Education awards state exhibitions. Scholarships awarded
by the universities and state exhibitions may be supplemented by local education
authorities. Postgraduate awards and teacher-training scholarships are given by the
Ministry of Education.
Studies and Degrees
Courses in arts and science are offered by all universities and at nearly all universities
courses are available in one or more applied sciences. At the beginning of the academic
year 1961-62, 40 per cent of full-time university students in Great Britain were taking
arts courses and 60 per cent were studying science or technology (including medicine).
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though in
medicine five or six years are required. The first degree of Bachelor (Master in Scotland)
is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on satisfactory examination
results. In most universities an ordinary (or pass) degree or an honours degree can
be taken, although the majority of students in England and Wales take honours courses.
Further study or research is required at the modern universities for the degree of
Master and by all universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according
to the practice of each university; some differentiate between the arts and sciences
and some do not. Diplomas and certificates are awarded after shorter courses in
some subjects.
The tutorial system of individual tuition to supplement the lecture system is a
traditional and valued feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; it is now
being developed in the other universities and colleges of Britain.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all universities
there are postgraduate students engaged in research. There has been an expansion
particularly of research in science and technology in recent years (see p. 206).
University Expansion
The universities of Britain are expanding rapidly to meet the greatly increased
demand for university education and also the need of a modern democracy for a highly
educated population and the particular need, in a technical age, for scientists and
technologists. The number of full-time students in universities in Great Britain is
being increased from 100,000 in 1958-59 to 150,000 by 1966. It is planned to provide
another 20,000 places by 1973-74. About two-thirds of the additional students who
are expected to be in the universities will be students of science or technology. In
Northern Ireland the number of full-time students increased from 2,392 in 1948-49
to 3,752 in 1961-62.
An extensive building programme is in progress to provide for the increased number
of students. Building projects in Great Britain to the value of £104 million were begun,
or have been authorised to begin, in the six-year period 1958-63, and universities have
been authorised to make further plans on the basis of projects to the value of £30 million
172
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to start in each of the years 1964 and 1965. These figures exclude the expansion of the
Imperial College of Science and Technology in the University of London which is
costing over £15 million. These amounts, together with additional sums for the purchase
of sites and properties, for professional fees and for the provision of equipment for
new buildings, are met from Exchequer funds administered by the University Grants
Committee. Further sums are raised by the universities themselves.
Of the major projects included in the annual programmes for the period 1960-63
about 56 per cent of expenditure is for buildings to accommodate teaching and research
in the various faculties, including about 44 per cent for science subjects and technology.
The remaining 44 per cent is for general service buildings, such as halls of residence,
student unions, refectories and libraries.
In Northern Ireland over £3 million was spent on building projects between 1955
and 1962 and further expansion at the rate of £750,000 a year is planned.
FURTHER EDUCATION
Outside the universities there is a great variety of further education, full-time
and part-time, for those of all ages who have left school. Local education authorities
are required to secure such provision either directly or by aiding voluntary bodies
and institutions. Vocational and non-vocational courses at all levels and in all subjects
are available in technical, commercial and art colleges1 and in agricultural and evening
institutes. These courses may lead to a wide variety of qualifications ranging from
external university degrees and the highest technological awards to craftsmen s
certificates, or they may offer opportunities for pursuing leisure-time interests. In the
year 1960—61 there were some 133,000 full-time students at the technical and com¬
mercial colleges (excluding art colleges and agricultural institutes) in the United
Kingdom and about million part-time students. Nearly a million other students
attend evening institutes.
Technical and Technological Education
Within the field of further education, facilities for technical and technological
education have been greatly expanded recently and the Government is promoting
further development. A five-year programme for the expansion of technical colleges
carried out in 1956-61 provided for an increase of about half as many again in the
number of students completing advanced courses and increased the numbers released
by their employers for part-time courses during the day. I he cost of the programme
for buildings and equipment during this period was nearly £100 million, comprising
£70 million spent on buildings and £15 million on equipment in England and Wales,
and £10 million for buildings and £2 million for equipment in Scotland. A further
£15 million a year in England and Wales and £2 million in Scotland is to be spent on
buildings for technical education in each of the three years from 1961 to 1964. The
expansion of advanced courses of further education is being helped by sharing the
cost among all local education authorities. In 1961 the Government proposed measures
for a major reorganisation of education in technical colleges in Great Britain, providing
for greater continuity between school and technical college education, a broadening
of technical education and a closer adaptation of the system to the needs of industry.
The largest group of students attending technical colleges (524,058 in the United
Kingdom in 1960-61) are young employees and apprentices who are released by

employers for study, usually on one day a week; day release study is often supplemented
by attendance at evening classes. A wide variety of craft courses is available for young
workers in various trades and occupations leading to appropriate qualifications at the
end of a course of three to five years. Courses of a more professional character which
are suitable for technicians or for those who aim ultimately at membership of a pro¬
fessional institution are also provided, leading to the National Certificates approved by
joint committees representative of the education departments and the appropriate
professional body (e.g., the Institution of Mechanical Engineers). Such courses are
normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. Under schemes now being worked out
most courses for the Ordinary Certificate are to last two years and students usually
follow them between the ages of 16 and 19. The Higher Certificate requires a further
two years’ part-time study and is generally considered to reach a level corresponding
to a pass degree in the subject concerned.
Full-time courses are taken by large numbers of younger students who leave school
to enter secretarial or clerical work and also as an introduction to apprenticeship.
But the most important group of full-time students are those following advanced
courses leading to an external degree of the University of London, to the Higher
National Diploma (awarded by joint committees in the same way as the Higher
National Certificates) or to the Diploma in Technology (a national qualification first
awarded in 1958). The Diploma in Technology (Dip. Tech.) is granted on the
successful completion of an approved course in a technical college and is equivalent
in standard to a university honours degree. It is administered by the National Council
for Technological Awards, an autonomous body set up by the Minister of Education
in 1955. The council has also instituted an award higher than the diploma—Member¬
ship of the College of Technologists (MCT).
The form of advanced full-time course which is rapidly gaining favour is the ‘sand¬
wich course’. This lasts from three to five years and consists of periods usually of three
or six months spent alternately in studying full-time in a technical college and in
gaining practical experience in industry; the majority of Diploma in Technology
courses are sandwich courses. In the academic year 1961-62 there were some 12,900
sandwich course students. It is through a major increase in the number of students
taking sandwich courses that the technical colleges are expected to achieve a 50 per
cent increase in the output of advanced students.
There is a growing demand for courses of postgraduate standard, whether in tech¬
nical subjects or in management studies, in technical colleges for students who have
already obtained a first degree, a diploma, or a Higher National Certificate. A wide
range of advanced short courses of a very specialised nature is also offered for senior
technical staffs engaged in industry.
Under this system there is great flexibility in the arrangement of courses. As a
result, young people can start courses at various ages on leaving school and can attain
the highest qualification to which their abilities entitle them.
Technical colleges in England and Wales vary greatly in size, range of subjects,
level of work and type of course. The largest has a total of some 14,000 students on
the roll. The large colleges usually offer a wide variety of subjects, covering the basic
technologies and the fundamental sciences. The colleges are organised in four
broad groups:
(1) Local Colleges (350), providing mainly part-time courses, some (lasting two
to five years) leading directly to craftsman and technician qualifications such
as Ordinary National Certificates and City and Guilds of London Institute
Certificates;
i?4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(2) Area Colleges (165), providing also some advanced courses from two to four
years in duration for students starting at 18 or 19 years of age, and leading
to Higher National Certificates and Diplomas;
(3) Regional Colleges (25), covering wider areas than the local and area colleges,
and doing a substantial amount of advanced work, including full-time and
sandwich courses; and
(4) Colleges of Advanced Technology concentrating entirely on advanced work,
including postgraduate and research work, and comprising the following
ten colleges: the Birmingham College of Technology; the Bradford Institute
of Technology; the Welsh College of Advanced Technology, Cardiff; Lough¬
borough College of Technology; the Royal College of Advanced Technology,
Salford; the Bristol College of Technology; and, in London, the Battersea,
Brunei, Chelsea and Northampton Colleges of Advanced Technology.
At present, in England and Wales there are 432 technical colleges (other than ait
colleges) that provide for full-time students, besides 162 others which take part-time
students only. There are also National Colleges, which have been established to pro\ ide
advanced courses for the particularly specialised techniques of certain industries.
These include colleges such as those for Rubber Technology and Food Technology
and the National Foundry College; they are managed by independent bodies with
grants direct from the Ministry of Education.
Scotland has 16 Central Institutions for further education, of which seven are
technical colleges. Six of these have full-time courses leading to their own diploma
or associateship and in some the greater part of tne work is full-time. The full-time
courses are of three or four years' duration and comparable in scope and standard
to university degree courses. There are close ties between the central institutions
and the universities. The central institutions, working on a regional basis, are sup¬
ported by some 80 local technical colleges, offering full-time and part-time day courses,
and by evening classes at local centres. Twenty-four new colleges are expected to open
in the early 1960s; of these, five had been opened b)^ July 1962.
In Northern Ireland the system of technical education is similar to that in England
and Wales and includes courses leading to National Certificates. The Ministry of
Education for Northern Ireland awards junior and senior trade scholarships to appren¬
tices, to enable them to follow full-time courses of study at the Belfast College of
Technology and the Lisburn Technical College. The junior course lasts five months
and the senior course eight months.
Most of the technical colleges and other further education establishments in the
United Kingdom are either maintained or aided from public funds. 1 uition fees are
therefore moderate, and often nominal for young people under 18 years of age. Many
full-time students are helped by awards from local education authoiities. The awards
are generally based on the results of the General Certificate of Education or a coi re¬
sponding examination; they are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance
grant, but parents who can afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so.
There are also some scholarships available from endowments, and others are awaided
under schemes organised by particular industries or companies for the most promising
of their young workers.
Commercial and Management Education
Commercial education is provided in local authority commercial and technical
colleges, in independent colleges and by bodies organising correspondence courses.
SOCIAL WELFARE 175
More than half the candidates taking professional examinations in commercial subjects
do so through correspondence courses.
Until recently provision for commercial education was almost entirely by part-time
evening courses, few of which were above intermediate level. In line with recent
developments in other spheres of technical education, in October 1962 new commercial
courses were introduced in technical and commercial colleges in England and Wales.
These lead to the Ordinary and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies; a
more advanced course for full-time or sandwich course students leads to a new qualifi¬
cation, the Higher National Diploma in Business Studies, which is equivalent in
standard to a university pass degree. The Scottish Council for Commercial Education
awards senior and advanced commercial certificates to students aiming at a professional
career in commerce in Scotland.
Management studies are provided by universities and technical colleges, by indi¬
vidual companies or by trade and industrial federations. Certain independent colleges
specialise in management training. Several universities have introduced business
studies into the curriculum and throughout the country over 100 technical colleges
provide courses under the schemes administered jointly by the British Institute of
Management and the Ministry of Education (in England and Wales) and the Scottish
Education Department respectively. In Scotland the Scottish Education Department
and the British Institute of Management administer a course leading to the Certificate
of Business Administration designed for students in junior supervisory positions.
At postgraduate level there is now a Diploma in Management Studies.
An Advisory Council on Management Education for the United Kingdom was
established in 1961 to keep under review provision for management education and to
advise interested bodies.
Adult Education
Adult education (non-vocational study, outside the universities, for those who
have left school) is organised by local education authorities (sometimes in association
with voluntary bodies) in evening institutes, schools of art, adult education centres,
community centres and youth clubs. Many of the classes are practical, but there are
also wide opportunities for academic study at all levels. Voluntary organisations, such
as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes and the National Union of Towns¬
women’s Guilds, offer courses in handicrafts and other subjects to their members;
the local education authorities usually supply the teachers.
In general, courses at the highest levels in arts subjects are provided by the extra¬
mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time staff appointed
for this purpose and can call on the services of other members of the university staff;
by the Workers’ Educational Association, which also employs organising tutors and in
many regions works in close collaboration with the university extra-mural departments;
and by other voluntary bodies. In 1960-61, 179,000 students in England and Wales
attended such courses, which are grant-aided directly by the Ministry of Education and,
in many cases, are assisted financially and in other ways by local education authorities;
3,800 students attended similar courses in Northern Ireland.
Voluntary bodies with a particular view-point, such as the National Council of
Labour Colleges and the Co-operative Union, also organise adult education courses
without grant-aid. Six residential colleges (five in England and Wales and one in
Scotland) directly aided by the education departments offer one-year or two-year
cultural, non-vocational courses for adult students. In addition, there are about 30
other residential colleges where students can take short courses of a similar kind lasting
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
176
for a few days or a few weeks. Most of these latter colleges are maintained or aided
by local education authorities.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of informa¬
tion and research for adult education, as well as a channel of co-operation and
consultation for the many organisations in England and Wales which are interested
in the subject. It is assisted by a grant from the Ministry of Education. There is a
corresponding body in Scotland, the Scottish Institute of Adult Education.
Local education authorities can provide community centres for urban areas; these
centres normally supply facilities for both vocational and non-vocational classes
for the further education of young people and adults. The centres are usually managed
by community associations, many of which are affiliated to the National Federation
of Community Associations. Similar classes in rural areas are held in village halls and a
variety of other premises by local education authorities and voluntary bodies; in
Cambridgeshire there are nine ‘village colleges’, which combine facilities for secondary
and adult education, and a similar ‘college’ was opened in Derbyshire in 1958.
Financial assistance is given by the education departments to local voluntary
organisations towards the capital cost of community centres, village halls, playing
fields and similar facilities for social and physical recreation for adults.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS IN BRITAIN
Opportunities for students from overseas to come to Britain to study in universities
or other educational institutions have increased greatly during the last few years.
In 1962 there were about 60,000 overseas students in Britain, of whom about one
quarter wTere at universities, another quarter at technical colleges and the remainder
training as doctors and nurses, for the law, or in industry, borne two-thirds of all
overseas students were from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced study
in Britain are awTarded annually to students and research workers from other Common¬
wealth countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the
Governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards available to
men and women from other Commonwealth countries at universities, colleges and
other institutions of higher learning in the country of offer. The United Kingdom
Government has allocated nearly £3^ million for the five-year period 1960-65 to
enable a maximum of 500 scholars in any one year to study in Britain; some 400 others
take teacher-training courses. An example of smaller schemes is the Athlone Fellowship
Scheme, under which since 1951 the United Kingdom Government has awarded
38 fellowships a year to engineering graduates in Canada for up to two years further
study, training and research in institutions or industries in Britain.
About 400 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one year in the United
Kingdom, are awarded annually to graduates of overseas universities. Twenty-four
Marshall Scholarships for university study in Britain are offered annually by the

committee are nominated bv Government departments; it is financed mainly from public tunds.
It is usually designated as the Government’s principal instrument for the implementation ot
cultural conventions to which the United Kingdom is a party. The Council maintains stans who,
in some 80 overseas countries, foster English studies, provide regular information on British
life and thought and promote knowledge of the educational, scientific, literary, artistic and other
developments and achievements of the United Kingdom. It arranges study programmes in the
United Kingdom for scholars, teachers and other professional visitors from overseas.

United Kingdom Government to graduates from the United States of America and
over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to Commonwealth and United
States graduates for two years of study at the University of Oxford. Other universities
and colleges themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate students of any
nationality are eligible.
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are available under
the Central Treaty Organisation, the Foundation for Mutual Assistance in Africa
(South of the Sahara) and the British Technical Assistance Programmes for Ghana,
Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Tanganyika. Large numbers of awards for study or training
in Britain are made under the United Nations Programmes of Technical Assistance
and the Colombo Plan.
Arrangements for Overseas Students
Responsibility for overseas students in Britain rests with the institutions of higher
education to which they are attached and with the students’ own national representa¬
tives in Britain (High Commissions or Embassies). The British Council, by agreement
with various Governments, acts as agent for the overseas departments of the British
Government on matters affecting students’ welfare.
Students from overseas are given many opportunities to get to know more of
Britain in their leisure time and to make friends with British people. The British
Council offers a wdde range of activities. The Council has overseas students’ centres in
London and in other university cities, which organise a varied programme of lectures,
discussions and social and other activities. Many British people like to invite students
to their homes and the British Council arranges introductions. In the vacations there
are courses in many parts of the country which offer opportunities for getting to
know more about British life in town and country. In term time there are visits to
various places of interest, and theatre and concert parties are arranged. The British
Council assists many students to find accommodation and about 10,000 are met
annually on arrival and helped to settle down quickly in their new environment.
Recently the Government has announced that £2 million wall be spent on increasing
hostel accommodation and other facilities for overseas students in Britain.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas students
are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table, the Victoria League,
the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Union
of Students, the English-Speaking Union and Churches of all denominations. The
London Conference on Overseas Students, for which the British Council provides
the secretariat, co-ordinates their work in the metropolis. In some London boroughs
there are committees which help students to make contact w'ith local residents and
organisations. Similar conferences have come into being in other large cities in Britain.
British Students Overseas
It has been estimated by UNESCO (Study Abroad, 1962) that there are some 3,260
students from the United Kingdom at institutes of higher education in 18 countries
overseas.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit, set up after the Commonwealth
Education Conference of 1959, supplements normal direct dealings on education
between the countries of the Commonwealth. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan, a number of scholarships are made available annually to United
Kingdom students by the governments of other Commonwealth countries for study
in their universities, colleges and other institutions of higher learning. At present
jyg BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commonwealth Scholarships are being held by United Kingdom students in Australia,
Canada, Malaya, New Zealand, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Nigeria
and Pakistan, and others are being offered for competition to United Kingdom students
with tenure in Ceylon, East Africa, Hong Kong, India and Malta.
For many years the United States have offered awards for British students, the
best known being the Fulbright travel grants for postgraduate study at American
universities. Students of British nationality are also offered scholarships (mostly for
one academic year) at institutions of higher education in 20 European countries
including the USSR, and in Brazil, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Japan.
YOUTH SERVICE
The object of the youth service in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time activities
of young people and to offer them opportunities—complementary to those of home,
formal education and work—for discovering and developing their personal resources,
so that they may be better equipped to be responsible members of a free and civilised
society. There is no regimentation of young people; they are free to join any of the
youth organisations and the aim is to offer facilities sufficiently varied to appeal to
every type of boy and girl.
State and Voluntary Partnership
Responsibility for youth service in the United Kingdom is shared by the education
departments, local education authorities, voluntary organisations and the Churches.
There is no attempt to impose uniformity or to create any national youth organisation,
but a number of youth organisations have spontaneously developed over the last
century, mainly by voluntary effort. Between the two world wars, some of the local
education authorities tried to help and co-ordinate voluntary work in their areas through
Juvenile Organisations Committees; in the 1930s the State also began to promote
social and physical training and recreation and in 1939 brought into being what is now
called the Youth Service as a partnership of voluntary organisations, local authorities
and central Government.
The status of youth services as an essential part of the educational system ot Great
Britain was confirmed by the Education Act of 1944 and the Education (Scotland)
Act of 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth welfare work was promoted by the Physical
Training and Recreation Act of 1938, the Youth Welfare Act of 1944 and the Youth
Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Acts of 1947 and 1962.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative and training
work of national voluntary youth organisations, towards the expense of training full¬
time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises and equipment of youth clubs
provided by voluntary bodies. .
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in their areas:
most give some financial help and lend premises and equipment; most also employ
youth organisers to help in the promotion and encouragement of youth work; where
voluntary services are considered inadequate, local authorities themselves organise
youth centres and clubs. Most local authorities have appointed youth committees on
which official and voluntary bodies are represented.
In addition to such grants as are received from the State and local authorities,
voluntary organisations may receive help from charitable trusts for the furtherance of
special projects, notably from the King George’s Jubilee Trust (see p. 180) and,
during the years 1953-60, the King George VI Foundation, which distributed nearly
SOCIAL WELFARE 179
j£i-2 million from the memorial fund in remembrance of the King. The greater part of
the funds of the voluntary organisations is, however, raised by their own efforts.
In 1958 the Minister of Education, aware that the Youth Service needed to do more
to assist young people, appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of the Countess
of Albemarle, to review the situation and advise on steps to be taken. The Minister
accepted in principle the committee’s recommendations, published in its report in
February i960, and announced immediate increases in financial help for the head¬
quarters of national voluntary organisations, a building programme of £7 million to be
started in the next three years, more grants to voluntary projects, including experi¬
mental ones, and immediate steps towards increasing the number of trained full-time
leaders. In January 1961 a National College for the Training of Youth Leaders was
opened at Leicester. The Minister is advised by a Youth Service Development Council.
The Albemarle Committee’s inquiry extended only to England and Wales, youth
provision in Scotland having already been the subject of reports by advisory bodies;
but some of its main recommendations applied to Scotland, while others reflected
the existing Scottish position. A Standing Consultative Council on Youth Service in
Scotland, with functions similar to those of the Youth Service Development Council
for England and Wales, was set up by the Secretary of State for Scotland in December
1959. Between i960 and 1962 two one-year training courses in Youth Leadership for
full-time youth leaders and organisers were held at Moray House College of Education.
More money is being made available from central funds to national voluntary organisa¬
tions in Scotland and, as in England and Wales, increased expenditure on youth
services by Scottish education authorities is taken into account in calculating the
Exchequer general grant.
A White Paper on the development of the Youth Service was presented to the
Northern Ireland Parliament in 1961. This did not propose any change in the general
pattern of the Youth Service but local education authorities were urged to take a more
active part in youth work than they had previously done. Such changes as required
statutory authority were given effect in the Youth Welfare, Physical Training and
Recreation Act (Northern Ireland), 1962. The Youth Committee which was set up
in Northern Ireland in 1944 was retained but its functions were extended to reflect
the larger part to be played in youth welfare by the local education authorities and
sports organisations.
The Voluntary Organisations
The backbone of the youth services is the voluntary organisations. Although their
programmes vary greatly, most of them provide educational and religious activities
as well as social and recreational pursuits for their members, and all of them seek to
inculcate high ideals of personal conduct and service to the community.
Twenty-six large national voluntary youth organisations are constituent members of
the Standing Conference of National Voluntary Youth Organisations, a consultative
body which takes action only in the name of its member bodies and with their consent.
A further 22 bodies are associate or observer members, for example, the Church of
England Youth Council, which represents some 200,000 young people who are
members of clubs sponsored by the Church of England. These major organisations
have a total membership of some 3 million young people under 21. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary Youth Organisations,
and in Northern Ireland the Standing Conference of Youth Organisations.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose are the
Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s Christian

Association (YWCA), with approximately 36,000 and 20,500 members under 21
respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (164,000), the Church Lads’ Brigade (16,000), the
Girls’ Life Brigade (64,000), the Girls’ Friendly Society (23,000), Girls’ Guildry

Christian Workers (17,000), the Grail (13,000), and the Association of Jewish Youth
^ The Boy Scouts Association and Girl Guides Association have world-wide affilia¬
tions; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded by Lord
Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good citizenship in boys and
girls. They have various sections, based on age groups, but the largest number are
under 16 years. Their total United Kingdom membership is about 518,000 scouts and
530,000 guides.
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs, with over 2,000 affiliated clubs and 149,000
members, and the National Association of Youth Clubs, with over 2,500 affiliated
clubs and 163,000 members, are concerned mainly with the 14 to 20 age-group.
Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all try to give their members opportunities
to take part in physical, mental and social activities, to develop their capacities and
grow to maturity as individuals and members of society. Representatives from clubs
form local committees and these send representatives to the national members
councils. ,
The National Association of Training Corps for Girls, with about 8,000 members,
comprises the Girls’ Training Corps, the Women’s Junior Air Corps and the Girls’
Nautical Training Corps; all wear uniform and formal discipline is encouraged. The
pre-Service organisations for boys (the Combined Cadet Force, Sea Cadet Corps,
Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps), combine social, educational and physical
development with training for possible entry into the armed forces; their combined
membership is about 170,000. . , , ,
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales has
nearly 38,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish Association of
Young Farmers’ Clubs has nearly 7,000 and Northern Ireland Young Farmer Clubs
over 5,500 members: in addition to encouraging interest in agriculture and appreciation
of country life, the clubs provide training in the arts of citizenship and develop ability
to serve the community.
The Welsh League of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership of about
48,000; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among the youth of Wales’,
and its’work takes full account of the Welsh background of its members.
The Youth Hostels Associations in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland have a network of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particularly intended for
young people of limited means. They seek to promote knowledge and love of the
countryside, and are closely linked with each other and with similar organisations in
other countries. . . , ™ 1 o • ^
Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross Society,
St. John Ambulance Brigade and the leading political parties.
Other Organisations Concerned with Youth Work
King George's Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 to advance the welfare of the
younger generation: the Trust Fund is applied for the benefit of the young people of
the United Kingdom. King George V sanctioned the inauguration of the Trust by the
SOCIAL WELFARE
l8l
then Prince of Wales, and the dedication to it of the nation’s gift of approximately
£i million, subscribed as a thankoffering to mark his silver jubilee. The income is
augmented by gifts and legacies, including £80,000 raised during the Silver Jubilee
Appeal in i960, and the Trust has made grants of well over £1 million for the benefit
of young people.
The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme for boys is operated by local authorities,
schools, youth organisations, industrial firms and other bodies, and is designed as a
challenge to boys between the ages of 14 and 19 to reach standards of achievement
in three progressive stages in leisure-time activities comprising public service, expedi¬
tions and pursuits and physical fitness. A similar scheme for girls between the ages of
14 and 20 is in three progressive stages covering the following sections: design for
living, interests, and adventure and service.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains five schools for boys which offer 26-day
character-building courses, based on adventure and testing experience. A similar
school for girls, with modified courses, will open in the summer of 1963. There will
then be accommodation for some 800 boys and the same number of girls.
The aims of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish Council of
Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association bring them into touch
with many youth organisations: their activities are described in Chapter 18: Sport.
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large number of
town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for general or particular
purposes; photographic societies, folk dance, table tennis or jazz clubs, for instance.
In small communities social clubs may not be specifically for young people but those
with the more strenuous activities (for example, tennis clubs) usually have a high
proportion of young people as members.

PLANNING AND
HOUSING
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and it is essential to
plan land use if a satisfactory national distribution of employment and population is
to be secured, agriculture safeguarded, the amenities of the countryside preserved, and
the improvement of the places where people live and work sustained.
From 1909 onwards, successive Acts of Parliament recognised the principle of the
planned use of land, but because the pattern of development over much of the country
had already hardened into large unplanned urban concentrations the powers granted
to planning authorities were inadequate for the task in hand. . .
The twenty years between the two world wars were decades of expansion in industry
engineering, house-building, and motor transport; the population was increasing and
becoming more mobile; there was a general movement towards better standards o
living and consequently a greater need for systematic planning than had hitherto been
required. At the beginning of the nineteen-thirties a major effort was made to con¬
solidate and strengthen planning law and to extend the planning powers or central
and local authorities to the point at which they could exercise effective control. This
resulted in the Town and Country Planning Acts of 1932 which remained the basis of
planning law for fifteen years. , . , . .
Although inter-war planning legislation improved sanitary and environmental con¬
ditions and did something to preserve amenities, its general effect was less satisfactory
than might have been expected, mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the
problems involved in the payment of compensation to land and other property owners
who stood to lose by the introduction of positive planning schemes. Local authorities
often hesitated to exercise their powers effectively for fear of being involved in financial
liabilities beyond their means, and as a result much unregulated urban development
and spoliation of the countryside continued to take place. .
Renewed efforts to tackle these problems were made immediately before and
during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert committees were
appointed to study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth and spread of industry
(2) the hampering of planning by the financial and administrative difficulties of
compensation and betterment and (3) the encroachment of urban development upon
the countryside. After the war other committees studied the question of new towns

and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957; the Local Employment Act, i960;
and the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, i960. Town and country
planning in Northern Ireland is governed by the Planning and Housing Act (Northern
Ireland), 1931; the Planning (Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944;
and the Planning Acts Amendment Act (Northern Ireland), 1944.
Planning in Great Britain
The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and Country Planning
(Scotland) Act, 1947, are the principal Acts that govern the pattern of land use in
Great Britain. They provide for the co-ordination of planning by means of develop¬
ment plans drawn up by local planning authorities and approved by the Minister of
Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland; and they
control development by making it subject, generally, to the permission of a local
planning authority or of a central Government department. They also give extensive
powers to public authorities to acquire and develop land for planning purposes,
and deal with certain questions of amenity, for instance, the preservation of buildings
of special historic or architectural interest, and of trees and woodlands, and the control
of advertisement display.
Compensation for loss of development value through the refusal of planning
permission is paid by the Government according to a formula laid down in the 1954
Town and Country Planning Acts. Compensation to owners whose land is compul¬
sorily purchased is paid by the acquiring authorities, the amount being based (under
the Land Compensation Act, 1961, and, in Scotland, the Town and Country Planning
Act, 1959) on the price the land might have fetched if sold in the open market, with
safeguards for local authorities against paying for value brought about by their own
activities and for owners against depreciation which the threat of public acquisition
might cause. In general, expenditure on planning purposes (other than schemes of
major redevelopment) is taken into account in the amount of the general grant paid
to local authorities under the Local Government Act, 1958, and the Local Government
and Miscellaneous Financial Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1958.
Development Plans
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, local planning authorities (in
England and Wales, the councils of counties and county boroughs and, in some areas,
joint planning boards; and in Scotland, councils of counties and of large burghs, and
the councils of the two small burghs of St. Andrews and Thurso) were required to
prepare and submit development plans covering the whole of their areas to the Minister
of Housing and Local Government and to the Secretary of State for Scotland res¬
pectively. Each development plan includes maps and a written statement describing
the major projects in the plan and may be supplemented by a report or survey giving
the background to the plan in terms of existing land use, communications and similar
matters. Plans normally cover a period of about 20 years; they must be reviewed at
least once in every five years, and may be extended and altered at any time, so that they
are kept up to date. Development plans for the whole of Great Britain (except the
remoter parts of Scotland) have now been submitted to the appropriate ministers, and
almost all have been approved.
Many local planning authorities have submitted amendments and additions to their
original plans and a number have completed their first five-yearly review. In recognition
of the need to check the further growth of large built-up areas (1) to prevent adjacent
towns from merging into one another, and (2) to preserve the character of a number of
G
184
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
towns, proposals have been put forward for the incorporation of green belts into
many development plans. It has been generally accepted that this necessitates the
provision of more land for development beyond the green belt and the more intensive
use of land within existing towns.
Local planning authorities’ proposals for altering or adding to their development
plans must be advertised and the ministers concerned must consider objections and
representations from the public. Usually a public local inquiry has to be held before
the proposals are decided. A development plan or its amendment can be legally
challenged only on the ground that it is ultra vires or that statutory requirements have
not been fulfilled, and such a challenge must be made to the High Court within six
weeks of publication of the approval or amendment of the plan.
The Location of Industry
The Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, and the Local Employment Act, i960,
contain provisions relating to the location of industry. General problems of industrial
development are dealt with jointly by a number of Government departments, but the
consent of the local planning authority is, as a rule, required for any new industrial
building, any extension of a building or any change in the use of an existing building.
These powers, together with the more positive powers of the Board of Trade to inhibit
the expansion of industry in some areas and encourage it in others, have had a con¬
siderable effect on the location of industry; during the past decade new smaller and
more widely dispersed centres have grown up, notably in southern England (see p. 261).
New Towns
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Minister of Housing and Local Government
and the Secretary of State for Scotland, power to make an order designating any area
of land (which may include as its nucleus the area of an existing town) as the site of a
proposed new town. The appropriate minister must consult the local authorities
concerned on the proposal and must be satisfied that it is in the national interest that
the land should be developed as a new town. Once the site has been designated, the
minister appoints a development corporation (consisting of a chairman and up to
eight other members) to be responsible for the development of the new town. A master
plan showing how the town is to be built is then prepared, and this becomes the basis
for development proposals, each of which covers a part of the town. Each proposal is
submitted to the responsible minister, who must consult the local planning authority
and, together with the Treasury, be satisfied with the proposal on economic grounds
before giving approval.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland)
to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any land or property in the designated
areas which is necessary for their purposes, and they may provide houses, flats, com¬
mercial and industrial premises, estate roads and other buildings or services essential
for the development of the towns. In England and Wales the Minister of Housing and
Local Government has made a special development order to exempt the development
corporations from having to obtain planning permission from the local planning
authorities; in Scotland the Secretary of State has made a similar order in respect of
Cumbernauld new town.
The capital cost of developing the new towns (many of which are now making a
profit) is advanced to the corporations from public funds and must be repaid on terms
approved by the ministers with the concurrence of the Treasury. The corporations
PLANNING AND HOUSING
l85
submit annual reports (which include copies of their audited accounts) to the Minister
of Housing and Local Government or to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who lay
them before Parliament.
As each new town in England and Wales is substantially completed the development
corporation will be dissolved and, under the terms of the New Towns Act, 1959, its
assets and liabilities will be handed over to a central agency—the Commission for New
Towns. The Commission, which came into being in 1961 and will operate during the
whole period of new town consolidation, has already assumed responsibility for
Crawley and Hemel Hempstead, where large scale immigration from London is at
an end. It is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the value of the land entrusted
to it; in discharging its functions it is required to have regard to the purpose for which
the towns were established, and the convenience and welfare of the people working and
living in them. No new towns central authority has been proposed for Scotland,
where new town development is at a less advanced stage.
Seventeen new towns have been established in Great Britain: thirteen in England
and Wales and four in Scotland. Eight of the new towns in England and Wales
(Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Hemel Hempstead, Stevenage, Hatfield, and Welwyn
in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and Bracknell in Berkshire) are designed to help
in absorbing excess population from the Greater London area; the five others (Corby
in Northamptonshire; Aycliffe and Peterlee in Durham; Cwmbran in Monmouthshire;
and Skelmersdale in Lancashire) are to serve the special needs of their areas. The
Scottish new towns (East Kilbride in Lanarkshire; Glenrothes in Fife; Cumbernauld
in Dunbartonshire; and Livingston in West Lothian) will help in housing the surplus
population from Glasgow. Livingston is also to be a focus for industrial activity in the
central belt of Scotland.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use. They are
generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experiments, both socially
and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment. Many thousands of people
have moved into the new towns during the past decade and to meet their needs an
extensive building and civil engineering programme has provided houses, flats,
factories, schools, shops, roads, water supplies and sewerage on a very large scale.
Additional gas and electricity supplies, more police, fire and bus stations, extra postal,
telegraph and telephone services and new health centres have also been provided and
most of the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various kinds.
Sites for all the more important public buildings (the town hall, the central post
office, the public library, the health centre, the college of further education and the
magistrates’ court) are to be found in the town centres, where some of the most recent
planning ideas (notably the separation of the pedestrian from the motorist) are being
put into practice. In a few of the towns the public buildings have already been built
and are in use; elsewhere they are under construction or planned. It is expected that
the new towns will, in time, become important regional centres, and though they still
provide fewer facilities for commercial entertainment than are to be found in older
established towns of similar size, plans exist for cinemas, hotels, restaurants and dance
halls which will be built as soon as the populations are large enough to give the
necessary support.
Under the New Towns Act, 1946, Parliament approved a consolidated fund of
£50 million to provide for advances to the development corporations for work on
the new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts and, under the 1959 Act,
stands at £400 million. A total of over £310 million has been advanced to the corpora¬
tions during the past fifteen years.

Town Development Schemes and War-damaged Cities
The Town Development Act, 1952, makes provision for the relief of congestion in
large industrial towns in England and Wales by encouraging the transfer of population
and industry from these areas to appropriate country districts. Schemes have been
approved for moving more than a quarter of a million people and, so far, twenty
thousand families have moved under arrangements of this kind.
The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957, makes similar provision
for Scotland; agreements between Glasgow Corporation and other local authorities
provide for the housing of over 8,000 Glasgow families outside the city.
Proposals by the local authorities of 44 cities and towns for the reconstruction of
areas of extensive war damage, covering some 1,650 acres, have been approved. The
estimated cost of £92 million for acquiring and clearing this land in preparation for
redevelopment attracts grant under the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act; in
addition the central areas of several provincial cities (for instance Bristol, Coventry,
Exeter, Kingston upon Hull, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Southampton) have been
almost entirely rebuilt. In the county of London, some six and a quarter square miles
of redevelopment of all kinds should be finished within the next ten years; while in
the City of London, projects valued at about ^86 million have been completed.
Redevelopment of outworn and obsolete areas is also taking place in many towns:
Glasgow, for example, has started a programme of rebuilding 29 areas, housing nearly
a third of its population and accommodating much of the industry and commerce of
the city. Detailed proposals for three of these areas have been approved and the work
of clearance and rebuilding is well advanced in one of them—the Gorbals area.
National Parks and Access to the Countryside
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, provided that certain
areas of beautiful country in England and Wales should become national parks, where
the characteristic landscape would be safeguarded and facilities for open-air recreation
provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission was set up by the Act and its work has resulted in
the establishment of ten national parks: the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia
in North Wales, Dartmoor in Devon, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York Moors,
the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor in Devon and Somerset, Northumberland (comprising
most of the upland country from the Cheviots in the north to the Roman Wall in the
south), and the Brecon Beacons in South Wales. These parks cover a total area of
5,254 square miles, almost one-eleventh of the area of England and Wales, and have
various forms of administration: two of the parks are administered by joint planning
boards, four by special park planning committees of the four county councils in whose
areas they are situated, and four (which fall within the area of more than one county
council) by park planning committees of each of the constituent county councils,
advised by a park joint advisory committee concerned with the park as a whole. All these
authorities control development in the parks (which are still in private ownership)
and take such steps as they think fit to preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the
landscape and to promote enjoyment of the area by the public. For instance, trees are
planted to screen blemishes on the landscape, unsightly structures are removed, new
building is made to harmonise with the natural surroundings, advertisement displays
are reduced, and car parks and camping sites are provided in suitable localities.
Government grants at the rate of 75 per cent are available for certain measures designed
to enhance natural beauty and improve recreational facilities.
PLANNING AND HOUSING
l87
There are no National Parks in Scotland but the National Parks Working Party,
set up to consider the five areas recommended as national parks by the National Parks
Committee, has submitted a report on each of them. These are: Loch Lomond
Trossachs; Glen Affric—Glen Cannich-—Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis—Glen Coe—Black
Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon—Loch Maree—Little Loch Broom.
Close supervision is being maintained over development in these areas by means of
Scottish National Parks Directions, which require the local planning authorities
concerned to refer proposed developments to the Secretary of State for Scotland for
consideration.
The National Parks Commission also has power to designate areas outside the
national parks in England and Wales as ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’. Twelve
of these areas have been designated and a further ten are under consideration.
Government grants are also available for certain measures designed to enhance the
natural beauty of these areas.
Designation of a park or area of outstanding natural beauty does not, of itself, mean
that the general public has right of access. Local planning authorities must survey the
extent to which land is already open to the public, and may increase it, where desirable,
by means of agreements with owners or by access orders. Government grants are
available towards the cost of making such agreements or orders and in the Peak
District and the Yorkshire Dales tracts of moorland have been opened to the public
in this way.
A survey of all footpaths and bridleways in England and Wales is being made by
local authorities as a comprehensive national record of public rights of way; and in
some areas existing footpaths and bridleways are being linked to form long-distance
routes, which will become continuous rights of way. Responsibility for making
proposals for long-distance routes rests with the National Parks Commission; once
the proposals are approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, it
falls to the local authorities to give effect to them. Seven routes, covering approxi¬
mately 1,000 miles, have been approved. Large stretches of these paths are already
public rights of way and progress is being made in negotiating the footpath agreements
required to complete them. The establishment of further routes is also under
discussion.
National Forest Parks
The Forestry Commission has formed, and opened to the public, seven National
Forest Parks in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen Trool, Glen More, and the Queen Elizabeth
Forest Park in Scotland; the Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders
of England and Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Foiest Park (adjoining
the Northumberland National Park to the westward), which includes forests on the
borders of Northumberland and Cumberland in England and of Roxburgh in Scotland.
The total area of the seven parks approaches half a million acres, including planted
areas and unplantable moorland and mountains. Camping facilities are provided in
most of the parks.
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a National Forest Park, is
also open to the public.
Nature Conservation
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy,
which derives its powers from the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act,
1949. The object of conservation is to influence soils, water, vegetation and animal
i88
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
life by means of research, experiment and control, and it entails the acquisition and
management of a representative series of reserves, as well as the establishment of
laboratories for use in long-term research schemes (see p. 214) and the making of
grants-in-aid for specified research.
The Nature Conservancy is responsible for some 95 nature reserves in Great
Britain, with a combined area of about 179,700 acres, of which nearly 40,000 acres
comprise the Cairngorms, the largest reserve in Britain and one of the largest in
Europe. Seven other areas (mostly in the north) are managed by local authorities,
using their powers under the National Parks Act, in consultation with the Conservancy.
Eleven forest nature reserves have also been set up; of these, seven have been created
by agreement between the Forestry Commission and the Nature Conservancy and
consist of forest land managed under joint supervision; one is the result of a similar
arrangement made with the Crown Estate Commissioners; two derive from Forest
Nature Reserve Agreements made with the Duchy of Cornwall; and one from an
agreement made with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
Preservation of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural beauties
of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and Local Government,
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the local planning authorities. The ministers
have the duty of compiling lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest
and have so far listed more than 82,000 buildings. Local authorities have special
powers to prevent the demolition of such buildings and to control other works that
would damage their character. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is also
concerned, being responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces, for the
protection of ancient monuments (under the Ancient Monuments Acts), and for making
grants (on the recommendation of the appropriate Historic Buildings Council) for the
repair and maintenance of buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest or
their contents and for the upkeep of adjoining land. About 600 of the more important
protected monuments in Britain are in the care of the Ministry; and grants totalling
over -£3-! million have been offered and accepted towards the cost of urgently needed
repairs to over 800 historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, local planning authorities have
power (a) to protect trees and woodlands by means of tree preservation orders (about
3,500 of which are in force throughout Great Britain); (b) to prevent mineral workings
becoming permanent eyesores by attaching suitable conditions to planning permissions;
and (c) to restrict or regulate the display of advertisements in the interests of amenity
or public safety. Local authorities are also empowered, under the Clean Air Act, 1956,
to declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from chimneys
constitutes an offence, and to make grants towards costs incurred by owners and
occupiers of premises in these areas in making the necessary changes in their appliances.
Unofficial amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their members,
include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, founded in 1926 to
organise concerted action to secure the protection of rural scenery and of town and
country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the Association for the Preservation
of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the protection of rural scenery and of the
amenities of country districts and towns and villages in Scotland; the Council for the
Preservation of Rural Wales, founded in 1928 to organise and advise upon concerted
action for the protection of the beauty of Wales; the Commons, Open Spaces and
Footpaths Preservation Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the
PLANNING AND HOUSING
189
Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust; the National Trust for Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and the
National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust for England, Wales and Northern
Ireland (which was founded in 1895 and now has some 109,000 members) is (apart
from the Crown) the largest land-owner in the United Kingdom. It has acquired,
mainly through gifts, over a thousand properties, which it holds for the enjoyment of
the public; it administers more than 250,000 acres of land of great natural beauty;
and it owns many fine gardens. The National Trust for Scotland, an independent
body, founded in 1931 to promote the preservation of places of historic or architectural
interest or of natural beauty in Scotland for the benefit of the public, now has about
23,000 members and has under its care over 60 properties, covering in all over 70,000
acres.
The Council for Nature (founded in 1958) is a foundation of about 300 natural
history societies and voluntary bodies concerned with nature conservation and repre¬
sents the interests of some 80,000 naturalists at public inquiries on developments
likely to threaten British flora and fauna. The Council, which undertakes practical
tasks of nature reserve management as well as information work on all aspects of
natural history in the British Isles, receives grants from the Ministry of Education,
the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.
Planning in Northern Ireland
The Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, which is the main source
from which power to prepare a planning scheme is derived, provides for the preparation
by local authorities of planning schemes for development or redevelopment of their
areas, with the general object of securing proper sanitary conditions and amenities
in connection with the laying out and use of land. The Interim Development Act of
1944 enables persons wishing to carry out development to do so without delay, while
ensuring that such development shall conform to the provisions likely to be included
in the planning scheme for the area.
The provisions of the Acts brought all land in Northern Ireland under planning
control and required every local authority to prepare a planning scheme for its area.
Interim control is exercised in accordance with the section of the 1944 which
requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission to develop,
the authority may grant the application conditionally or unconditionally or may
refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or conditional approval, the applicant
has a right to appeal to the Ministry of Health and Local Government for Northern
Ireland (which is the department primarily responsible for the administration of the
planning Acts) to have the matter determined by the Ministry or, if the appellant
wishes, by an independent person appointed by the Ministry.
Local planning authorities in Northern Ireland have made appreciable progress
in the preparation of outline plans which indicate broadly the proposals for their
areas, thus providing a foundation for the preparation of more detailed plans at a later
stage’and facilitating materially the work of interim development control. In addition,
an interim report on Housing Sites in the Belfast Area (in which it was estimated that
the areas surveyed would provide sites for about 5)000 houses) has been published as
part of a Government-sponsored plan for the Belfast region.
Industrial Development
The Ministry of Health and Local Government co-operates with the Ministry of
Commerce in the selection of industrial sites in order to secure the best possible use of
190
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the land and to facilitate the efficient provision of housing and other services in
connection with industrial expansion.
Nature Conservation
The committee on nature conservation in Northern Ireland was appointed in i960
to consider the protection of the natural flora and fauna and the physical features
of scientific interest in Northern Ireland, and to make recommendations on measures
for their conservation and control, including the protection of wild life.
Northern Ireland Forest Park
Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle, County Down,
was opened to the public in 1955. Situated at the foot of the Mountains of Mourne,
it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum comprising a wide variety
of native and exotic trees, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland scenery. Caravan
facilities and a camping site for youth organisations are available.
HOUSING
Between 1945 and the end of 1961 over 4 million new houses and flats were built.
Despite this achievement much still remains to be done before all the housing
problems facing the country are solved. The nationwide shortage of housing accom¬
modation which existed in 1945 as the result of enemy action, the gradual deterioration
of old houses and the increase in the number of households, has been alleviated, but
there are still serious shortages to be overcome in some areas. Other housing targets
are the completion of the slum clearance programme, the provision of more accommo¬
dation suitable for elderly people, the elimination of overcrowded living conditions
and the modernisation and conversion of older houses.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing pro¬
gramme is borne by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in England and
Wales, by the Secretary of State in Scotland and the Minister of Health and Local
Government in Northern Ireland. The actual provision of housing accommodation in
any area is the concern of the local authority, which is obliged to plan for new housing
and slum clearance where necessary, to see that adequate standards are maintained
in newly built and existing houses and to ensure, as far as possible, that housing
conditions are satisfactory in that area. In selecting tenants for council dwellings
local authorities give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory
conditions. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the local housing authorities
are the councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including metropolitan boroughs),
urban districts and rural districts, the London County Council and the Common
Council of the City of London. In Scotland all town and county councils are housing
authorities.
There are nearly 17 million houses in Britain, over 14! million in England and Wales,
1,600,000 in Scotland and about 390,000 in Northern Ireland. About 3I million of the
houses in England and Wales and over half a million in Scotland are owned by public
authorities, that is about one house in four. Over 6| million houses, more than one in
three, are in owner occupation; most of the remainder (mainly older houses) are rented
from private landlords. Today one family in four lives in a post-war dwelling. Of
houses and flats built since 1945, over 63 per cent were built by local authorities (that
is, generally, by private builders under contract to local authorities). Since the
restrictions on private building which were necessary during the shortages of the
PLANNING AND HOUSING
I9I
post-war period were abolished, in 1954, the proportion of building undertaken by
private enterprise has risen steadily.1 In 1961 the total number of houses built was
303,161, of which 180,727 were privately sponsored.
New Building
Private enterprise is therefore responsible for over half the housing being built
today in Britain; the rest is built by local authorities, new towns development corpora¬
tions and certain Government departments (for housing families of the armed forces or
other services). Housing associations, which are non-profit-making bodies providing
houses for letting rather than for sale, are increasing in number, as are self-help groups
whose members build houses for their own occupation in their spare time. Local
authority housing is normally built for letting; privately sponsored dwellings for owner
occupation.
Most of the new dwellings in Britain are houses (usually of two storeys); the remain¬
der are flats or maisonettes in blocks of from 2 to 13 or even 24 storeys. High blocks
are generally built in central urban areas where they replace old, overcrowded
dwellings. In the new towns and on new housing estates they provide focal points
and help planners to achieve high density while still providing open spaces.
Accommodation in a house designed for a family of four or five persons includes
one or two living rooms, a kitchen, a store, a bathroom and a w.c. and two or three
bedrooms. A typical 3-bedroom house built by a local authority in England and
Wales in 1961 had a superficial area of about 898 square feet and cost ^1,786 to build.
Provision for the growing number of old people in the population is a housing
priority. Encouraged by Exchequer subsidies local authorities have been building a
greater proportion of smaller units suitable for the elderly. The percentage of one-
bedroom dwellings built by local authorities has risen from 7-7 per cent in 1951 to
26-1 per cent in 1961 in England and Wales and from 2*4 per cent to 18-8 per cent in
Scotland. •
Control of building standards is the responsibility of the central departments, who
issue manuals of guidance on design and layout for different types of houses and
flats provided by local authorities. Research into building techniques and into new
methods of house construction, as well as into the needs of families, is carried out by
the Development Group of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the
Building Research Centre, the architects’ departments of major local authorities and
the research groups in big constructional firms.
Slum Clearance
Returns made by local housing authorities in 1955 indicated that there were about
one million slum dwellings in Great Britain which ought to be cleared. In England
and Wales about 850,000, or 6*5 per cent of all houses, and in Scotland over 150,000,
about 10 per cent, were estimated to be unfit for human habitation and due for demoli¬
tion. In Northern Ireland the number of such houses was estimated in 1959 at about
50,000.
In the five years 1957 to 1961, local authorities in England and Wales demolished
or closed 285,984 unfit houses, involving about 807,233 occupants; while in Scotland
1The proportion relates to Britain as a whole. In Scotland the proportion of private building
to local authority building is lower than in England and Wales. Out of a total of 27,230 dwellings
built in Scotland in 1961, 7,200 (about 26 per cent) were for private owners. In Northern Ireland,
in the three years 1959-61, out of a total of 18,430 new houses, 8,448 were built for private
owners.
192
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
51,461 houses were demolished or closed during the same period. In Northern Ireland
2,500 dwellings were demolished or closed by local authorities in the three-year
period 1959-61.
Well over half the 1,469 housing authorities in England and Wales should have
completed their 1955 programmes by the end of 1965. Many of them, since the
process of replacing unfit houses is a continuous one, have submitted further proposals
for increased programmes. Within the next 10 years the great majority of them should
have succeeded in getting rid of all their present slums. In certain areas, however,
particularly the older industrial towns, and including Birmingham, Liverpool and
Manchester, three of the biggest cities in the country, the proportion of unfit houses
is so high that clearance will take much longer.
To help in those areas of Great Britain where the number of slum houses is so
large that it would not be practicable to replace all of them within the next few years,
local authorities can acquire houses unfit for human habitation and ‘patch’ them in
order that they may be occupied for a strictly limited period pending their demolition.
The intention is that these houses should be demolished as soon as possible: the
temporary repairs are not intended as an alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer
contributions are available to meet part of the costs of acquisition and essential repairs.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or can be
provided by them, for persons to be displaced from slum clearance areas. Where an
unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the owner retains his
land, he normally receives no compensation. But if the local authorities acquire an
unfit property in order to demolish it themselves and to rebuild on the land, the
normal basis of compensation is the market value of the house as it stands or the
value of the site after clearance, whichever is the less. In England and Wales there
are, however, special provisions for owner-occupiers who bought between 1939 and
1955, and they receive full compensation regardless of whether the house is being
acquired by the authority or not; similar terms apply to business occupiers. In England,
Wales and Scotland the slum clearance code provides for special payments for the
good maintenance of unfit houses and business occupiers may receive hardship pay¬
ments in certain cases. In Northern Ireland provision is made for payments to owner-
occupiers, business occupiers and for good maintenance of older houses.
Housing Finance
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by raising
loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on loans, is met
from rents, rates and where available Exchequer subsidies. Local authorities may
raise loans for housing either in the open market or, where borrowing from private
sources at normal rates of interest is impossible, by borrowing from the Public Works
Loan Board (see p. 77). Exchequer loans of up to a maximum of £25 million in
England and Wales and ^3 million in Scotland are available to approved housing
associations in order to finance the building of houses to let at unsubsidised rents.
Loans to enable persons to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are available from various sources, including building societies, insurance companies,
industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies, of which there are about 730, are the most important of these
agencies. They do not themselves build houses but provide long-term loans on the
security of houses bought for owner-occupation, whether newly built or older houses,
or houses under construction. Loans are usually repayable over periods of 20 or even
30 years, by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The societies
PLANNING AND HOUSING IQ3
funds are derived mainly from investment of relatively modest sums by the general
public.
Many local authorities operate a scheme whereby, for a house costing up to £2,500,
they guarantee part of the loan made by a building society so that an advance greater
than normal (up to 95 per cent of the value of the house in some cases) may be made
to the purchaser. The Exchequer undertakes to share any liability local authorities
may incur under this scheme. Local authorities also have power to make loans under
the Housing Acts for the acquisition, conversion, improvement, repair and alteration
of houses. Under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, they may make loans
of up to 100 per cent of the house’s value.
Building Subsidies and Improvement Grants
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for varying purposes, have been provided
in Britain since 1919, when they were first introduced to facilitate the building of
houses for letting at moderate rents.
After the second world war subsidies at higher rates, payable annually for 60 years
from the year of building completion, were provided for all new housing accommoda¬
tion built with ministerial approval by the local authorities, by new towns development
corporations, or by housing associations under arrangements with local authorities. In
England and Wales a standard rate of subsidy was paid for ordinary houses or flats
built to meet general needs, and higher rates of subsidy were provided for certain
types of housing (such as high blocks of flats on expensive sites), housing built for
particular purposes (for instance, for the agricultural population) and housing in special
areas (such as poor areas of low rate-paying capacity).
During the 1950s various systems of subsidy were introduced under successive
Housing Acts. The present subsidies in England and Wales, announced in the
Government White Paper of 1961 and implemented by the Housing Act, 1961,
provide for a flexible system of general subsidy on all types of housing. The level of
subsidy depends on the financial need of the housing authority. Authorities with
inadequate resources receive a basic subsidy of £24 a year for each house built, which
may be increased in stages to £40 for authorities with particularly low reserves. For
other authorities the basic rate is ^8. Additional subsidies exist for high flats and
expensive sites. These provisions enable authorities to build where need exists and to
ensure that Exchequer assistance is available chiefly for those authorities in most need
of help.
Local authorities and private owners in England and Wales can obtain Exchequer
assistance for the improvement of existing houses or conversion of other buildings for
housing. Cash grants can be made by local authorities, with Exchequer assistance, to
persons converting or improving existing buildings for housing at a cost of over £100
per dwelling. The grants may amount to half the cost, with a maximum grant of
£400 for each dwelling. There are certain technical conditions which the dwellings
as improved or converted must fulfil, to ensure that public money is only spent on
property that will provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficiently long period.
Grants for similar work in houses owned by local authorities may also be paid by the
Minister of Housing and Local Government, but on an annual basis over 20 years.
In either case, the payment of grant is at the discretion of the local authority, or the
Minister, as the case may be. Local housing authorities are, however, obliged to make
grants called ‘standard grants’, for the provision in houses of a bath in a bathroom,
hot-water supply, water closet, wash basin, and food store; these cash grants are to
cover half the cost of the work, subject to a maximum grant of £155 or smaller sums
194
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
if not all of the five items are needed. Similarly the Minister is obliged to make standard
grants to local authorities, but again on an annual basis over 20 years. The Acts under
which these improvement grants are now available are the Housing (Financial Pro¬
visions) Act, 1958, the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, and the Housing
Act, 1961. In 1961 over 128,580 improvement grants were made.
Building subsidies and improvement grants are also provided in Scotland and
Northern Ireland; the amounts of subsidy are generally higher owing to different
circumstances. In Scotland the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1962, provides for subsidies
according to a local authority’s financial needs. The basic subsidy is £32 per house
for authorities with inadequate resources and £12 per house for the other authorities.
There are higher rates of subsidy for housing for special purposes (such as overspill,
multi-storey development, agricultural workers). Grants are also available to local
authorities and private owners for the improvement or conversion of existing properties,
and to private owners for the provision of new houses for farm workers. In Northern
Ireland annual subsidies are paid to local authorities, the Northern Ireland Housing
Trust1 and housing associations; in addition, ‘lump sum’ subsidies are paid to private
persons who build houses for letting or for owner-occupation. Grants are available for
the provision of new houses and for the reconditioning of existing premises to
accommodate farmers and approved workers.
The average annual cost of housing subsidies in Britain has been over £100 million
since 1954, some three-quarters of the total being paid by the Exchequer and about
a quarter by local authorities.
Control of Rents
The first Act of Parliament to restrict rents was passed in 1915, when houses were
in short supply because of war-time movement of population. Rent control was originally
intended as a temporary measure, but was retained by successive Acts until 1957-
During this period nearly all privately owned houses let unfurnished were subject to
a system of rent control which gave the tenant a fixed rent and security of tenure.
Since 1954 control has not applied to lettings by local authorities, New Town Develop¬
ment Corporations and certain housing associations and trusts.
Since 1954 the Government has pursued a policy of progressive abolition of rent
control on the grounds that the previous system was leading to deterioration and to
wasteful use of the nation’s stock of housing. The Rent Act, i957> released from
rent control all dwellings with a rateable value over ^40 in the London Metropolitan
Police District and in Scotland and over £30 elsewhere; it also freed from control all
new lettings after 6th July, 1957, whatever the rateable value of the property. This Act
also provided for the decontrol from time to time of further categories of houses by
order, subject to approval by Parliament. For those houses remaining within control,
it laid down a maximum rent which was more in keeping with the current value of
money and the costs of maintenance. Security of tenure for controlled tenants is re¬
tained under the Act; a controlled tenant cannot be forced to give up possession except
by a Court order, which will not be granted unless the Court is satisfied that this is
reasonable and, with some exceptions, that suitable alternative accommodation is
available for the tenant.
Where houses or parts of houses within the rateable value limits for rent control are
let with furniture or services provided by the landlord, a different system of control
1 The Northern Ireland Housing Trust, a statutory body, was established in 1945 to erect
houses for letting, to supplement building by local authorities. The Trust has built about a
quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war houses.

operates. If the tenant feels he is being overcharged, he can apply to a rent tribunal to
review his rent. These tribunals are appointed and maintained by the Government
(the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scot¬
land) but are independent, quasi-judicial bodies, from whose decisions there is no
appeal, except on a point of law. The tribunal decides in each case what is a fair rent
to fix for the accommodation and services provided. The rent so fixed is registered
with the local authority for the district, or, in Scotland, with the tribunal, and any
subsequent overcharging by the landlord is a punishable offence.
Somewhat similar measures of control and de-control apply in Northern Ireland.
In 1951 legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
controlled houses, provided that they were maintained in good repair; and the Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law (Amendment) Act (Northern
Ireland), 1956, permitted an increase of one-third in the rent levels fixed by the
1951 Act where the landlord had recently incurred expenditure of a certain amount
on repairs. The 1956 Act also released from control houses with a net annual value
of over £50 (with certain safeguards) and houses with a net annual value of over
£26 of which the landlord was in actual possession when the Act came into force,
or of which he subsequently obtained possession.

THE CHURCHES
Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom as described
in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he may change his
religion at will, and may manifest his faith in teaching, worship and observance
without interference from the community or the State. Churches and religious societies
of all kinds may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech
and in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from the seven¬
teenth century onwards; in many cases, relaxation in the administration of laws
discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the repeal of the legislation
concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with the passing of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction Act, 1677, and the Toleration Act of 1688 granted freedom of worship
to Protestant dissenters. In 1828 the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed
nonconformists from political disabilities and made it possible for them to be appointed
to public offices; Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act, 1829; the Jewish Relief Act, 1858, enabled Jews to become members
of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed on prospective students
and members of the academic staff of the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and
Durham were successively abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871. Nowadays, there
is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public office, except that the
Lord Chancellor may not be a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the national
hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of England or the
Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and are paid a salary by the
State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman Catholic Church and ministers
of other denominations may also be appointed or specially called in as required.
Voluntary schools (see p. 162) provided by churches of any religious denomination
may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number of
adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries are
made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official returns, and each
church adopts different criteria in counting its members. The membership figures
given in the following sections should therefore be taken as approximate.
Church of England
The Church of England is the Established Church, and claims to be the ancient
catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth century, it repudiated
the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic episcopate, and the creeds and
sacraments upon which its doctrines are based; therefore it claims to be both catholic
and ‘reformed’. Its form of worship is embodied in the Book of Common Prayer,
which was first compiled in 1549.
196
THE CHURCHES
197
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown in that the Sovereign, who must be
a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’ (a statutory
title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or her accession to uphold it.
The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury;
prayers for the Sovereign and other members of the royal family are said in all the
statutory services of the Church; Church of England archbishops, bishops and other
senior ecclesiastical dignitaries, as well as incumbents of Crown livings, are appointed
by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister1; and all clergymen take the
oath of allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is also linked with the State through the House of Lords, in which
the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and the twenty-four senior diocesan
bishops have seats. This makes it possible for the views of the Church leaders to be
expressed freely on any moral issue raised in connection with the corporate conduct
of the State as well as on specifically ecclesiastical issues—a matter of particular
significance in view of the fact that the clergy of the Church of England (together
with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic
Church) are legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church is not free to change its form of worship, as laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament; canons (Church rules) cannot be
made or amended without the consent of the Queen; and the measures of the Church
Assembly (as distinct from its regulations) are not valid without parliamentary assent.
Church Organisation and Government
The Church of England is organised by geographical areas into two provinces and
43 dioceses. The Province of Canterbury contains 29 dioceses and that of York 14.
Each diocese is subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which there are about
14,500 in all. The Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of All England and bishop of
his own diocese of Canterbury; the Archbishop of York is styled Primate of England and
is bishop of his own diocese of York. The baptised membership of the Church is about
27 million, i.e. two-thirds of the population born and resident in the two provinces.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative bodies
in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of Canterbury and
York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting of an upper house of
bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each cathedral chapter, archdeacons
and elected clergy. The Convocations meet not oftener than three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the National
Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the Church Assembly.
It was set up in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations, and was given power
to legislate by measure by the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act of 1919.
It can discuss any matter connected with the Church of England, but may not make
any doctrinal statements, nor infringe upon the rights of the Convocations. It consists
of three houses: bishops, clergy and laity. The first two houses are composed of the
members of the Convocations; the house of laity consists of men and women elected
every five years by the lay members of diocesan conferences, and the constitution
allows for ten co-opted members.
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after passing
through various stages in the assembly, are presented to an ecclesiastical committee
of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members, of whom 15 are appointed
1 The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have appointed a commission to consider the
method of Crown appointments to ecclesiastical offices.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
198
by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker of the House of Commons. This
committee lays the measures, together with a report upon them, before both Houses.
If both Houses so resolve, the measure is sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent,
after which it has the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though
it may reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting of
boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work, such as
education, training for the ministry, and Church work at home and overseas. The
Church Assembly, through the Schools Council of its Board of Education, is responsible
for some 8,000 Church of England schools of all types, for approximately half of which
the Church bears a quarter of the cost of improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity with the
government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils are appointed
by the parochial electors, i.e. persons who are baptised, are not members of any other
church, are 17 years of age and over, and have applied for membership of the electoral
roll of the parish where they habitually reside or worship. The estimated number on
the parish electoral rolls is just under three million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction today
consists largely of faculty cases, with very occasional cases of discipline against clergy,
either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is necessary for any specific
alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church or to a churchyard.
There are 24 Church of England training colleges for teachers and 26 theological
colleges. All these establishments are run by independent bodies of trustees. The
Church Assembly has approved a programme of expansion of the Church training
colleges which should increase the number of students from under 5,000 to 9,000,
and will include the building of two new colleges. The Church Assembly has also
accepted responsibility for considerable expenditure on the theological colleges and
their expansion.
Church Finance
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an annual
apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly contributes to the
Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority is the diocesan board of
finance, which administers the money contributed by the parishes, and acts as trustee
on behalf of the parochial church councils, which have only limited powers of holding
property. The Central Board of Finance administers the Church Assembly Fund,
supported by diocesan contributions, and devoted to the maintenance of central
services, including capital expenditure on training colleges and theological colleges
and the grants for training candidates for ordination.
The State makes no payment direct to the Church as such, though it pays for the
services of chaplains in the armed forces and in prisons, and contributes substantially
to the maintenance of Church schools and training colleges.
The income from all sources of 14,305 parochial church councils in i960 was about
^19J million; of this about 7-5 per cent went to diocesan funds, and of that 7-5 per
cent about one-third went to central needs.
The endowment income of the Church is mainly administered by the Church
Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the payment of clergy stipends and
the provision of finance for pensions, new churches, parsonage houses and church
schools. The Commissioners’ income from investments has doubled during the past
fourteen years; in broad terms, this means that the stipends of the poorer clergy have
THE CHURCHES
199
roughly kept in step with the rise in the cost of living, and that the Commissioners
have been able to embark on assistance for providing better parsonage houses, for
church buildings in new areas of population, and for better pensions for clergy and
their widows.
The Anglican Communion
The Anglican Communion comprises 17 autonomous churches in the United
Kingdom and overseas, with a total membership of over 40 million.
In the United Kingdom, in addition to the established Church of England, there
are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: the Church of
Ireland (disestablished in 1869) has 14 dioceses in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic, and some 411,000 members; the Episcopal Church in Scotland, 7 dioceses,
377 churches and some 108,000 members; and the Church in Wales (disestablished
in 1920), 6 dioceses and some 200,000 Easter communicants.
Outside the United Kingdom, the Anglican Communion exists wherever its
members have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant Episcopal
Church in the United States of America (with its missionary dioceses in Latin America
and the Philippines), the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, and the
Anglican Churches of South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies,
China, Japan, West Africa and Central Africa are all autonomous members of the
Anglican Communion. In the Middle East, Jerusalem now has the status of an
archbishopric with jurisdiction over five dioceses in the region. A new province of
East Africa includes five dioceses in Kenya and Tanganyika. In Uganda, Rwanda and
Burundi a province has been formed which comprises eight dioceses. In South East
Asia the Anglican dioceses have formed a regional council which already has a measure
of autonomy. In addition, there remain a number of overseas dioceses under the
jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. There is limited intercommunion with
the Church of South India, and between that Church and the Church of India,
Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon.
Since 1867 the Lambeth Conference has met every tenth year (except for the
war years) for unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; it is presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The last meeting, held in London in 1958, was
attended by 310 bishops from all parts of the Anglican Communion. The conference
has no executive authority, but enjoys great moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine,
discipline, relations with other communions, and on the attitude of the Anglican
churches to political and social questions are widely studied.
An executive officer of the Anglican Communion is the secretary of the Anglican
Advisory Council on Missionary Strategy, and exercises general supervision on behalf
of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference over all matters affecting the
welfare of the Anglican Communion which call for attention between the meetings of
the conference.
The Church of Scotland
The established church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland, which in government
is presbyterian. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is
established and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union, 1707, was
further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act, 1921.
Whereas in episcopacy church government is a hierarchy of persons, in presby-
terianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal status, and each of
the 2,242 churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister
200
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and elected elders (of whom there are over 45,400 in all); above this is the Court of
the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, which
meets annually and consists of elected ministers and elders presided over by an
elected Moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has
fought with the utmost vigour throughout the years for complete freedom in all
spiritual matters and for the right to appoint its own officers and to decide all matters
of doctrine and discipline. This freedom is recognised by Parliament, and the decisions
of the Church of Scotland are not subject to parliamentary debate or modification.
The thorough training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has given
the church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the standard
of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of Scotland is estimated at
about 1,307,000.
The Free Churches
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as ‘nonconformist’ churches;
and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established Church of Scotland),
Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches are the Methodist, Baptist
and Congregational Churches, and the unestablished presbyterian churches through¬
out Britain. In addition, there are a number of other protestant denominations in the
United Kingdom as well as such religious associations as the Society of Friends and
the Salvation Army, which have certain links with the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies and
practices of the established church. The Methodist Church, for example, originated
in the evangelical revival led by John Wesley within the Church of England during
the eighteenth century. In general, the Free Churches base their reason for existence
on their distinctive convictions regarding organisation and worship.
The Methodist Churches
The largest of the Free Churches is the Methodist Church, formed in 1932 by
the union of the majority of separate Methodist Churches. It has some 723,500
adult full members. The supreme authority is the annual conference and the system
of government is in many ways presbyterian, the leaders’ meeting corresponding
to the kirk sessions, with circuit meetings and district synods resembling presbytery
and synod. One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay
leadership. There are some 22,100 trained lay preachers sharing the work of 4,500
ministers and preaching in many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the Independent
Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary basis and women
(many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men; and the Wesleyan Reform
Union (with some 5,900 members) which, while retaining the essential Methodist
doctrine, gives autonomy to each of its 160 individual churches.
The Congregational and Baptist Churches
The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain. In 1831
most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union. Local churches
have formed county and national unions, whose secretariat and assemblies have much
influence, but no compulsive authority over them, since great importance is attached
to the autonomy of local church meetings. Adult membership is approximately 206,800.
THE CHURCHES
201
Like the Congregationalists, the Baptists are for the most part grouped in associations
of churches and the majority of these belong to the Baptist Union formed in 1813.
Baptists differ from Congregationalists in that they practise the baptism of believers
only; they do not baptise infants. The Baptist churches have about 314,000 members.
The Unestablished Presbyterian Churches
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a communicant membership of about
138,000; certain amalgamations of presbyteries in 1962 reduced their numbers from
29 to 21 (some of them being in the Irish Republic). The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic
Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell
Harris in 1735, now includes a considerable proportion of the Welsh-speaking
population; its members number some 134,000. The Presbyterian Church of England
is organised in 14 presbyteries and has nearly 71,100 members; its highest court is
its general assembly; women are admitted to the eldership and ministry.
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of Scotland;
the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church
of Ireland (which consists of 43 congregations and preaching stations, all but five
of which are in Northern Ireland); and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of
Ireland, comprising three presbyteries (two of which are in Northern Ireland), with
34 congregations.
Other Denominations
Among other Protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the Unitarian
and Free Christian Churches, which number about 300, with a membership of some
20,000; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of America as Disciples
of Christ) which have been an organised community in Britain since early in the
nineteenth century, and now have 165 churches in the United Kingdom, and a
membership of about 7,500; the British Province of the Moravian Church, which is
an international missionary church, with 40 congregations and preaching stations
in the United Kingdom and some 3,300 communicant members; the Free Church
of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a direct
result of the Oxford Movement, and now has 50 churches; the Society of Friends;
and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, came into being in the middle of the seven¬
teenth century under the leadership of George Fox. A distinctive feature is the way of
worship: outward sacraments are not observed and there is no separate ministry.
Friends place great emphasis on work for peace, and their influence in many parts
of the world, especially in social reform and in the relief of suffering, is very wide in
relation to their numbers. There are 441 Quaker Meetings in Britain and about 21,700
members; and the Society has nine schools (the pupils and staff of which are not
exclusively Quaker).
The Salvation Army, founded in 1878 by a Methodist, William Booth, is a religious
movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual and social betterment
of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to those hitherto untouched by
religious effort. The movement, in which military rather than ecclesiastical terminology
is used, has branches all over the world, and its social work (particularly that connected
with the welfare of members of the British armed forces serving overseas) is well
supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other church,
have about 340 branch churches and societies in Britain.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Roman Catholic Church
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became temporarily
extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish hierarchy
became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in 1878, while the
Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct. The normal government of the
Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial archbishops and bishops, is once
again the rule in the whole of the United Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation is the
province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an archbishop. The
chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is the Archbishop of West¬
minster. A province normally comprises several dioceses, each under a bishop aided
by a chapter of canons and others, and by priests in charge of the parishes into which
the diocese is subdivided. In England and Wales there are four provinces and
archdioceses (Westminster, Liverpool, Birmingham and Cardiff), 14 dioceses, and
nearly 2,300 parishes; in Scotland there are two provinces and archdioceses (St.
Andrews and Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and about 400 parishes; in
Northern Ireland there are six dioceses (several of which have territory partly in the
Irish Republic and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one hierarchy for the whole
of Ireland) and about 170 parishes. In the whole of the United Kingdom there are
some five million adherents (including children) to the Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of Roman
Catholic children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between Roman Catholics and members of any other Church should be brought up
as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in the United Kingdom
are staffed by members of the Religious Orders for men and women, who also undertake
other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jewry
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were expelled
at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The present Anglo-
Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being the Sephardi (from
Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth century an Ashkenazi community
(from Germany and East Europe) was established, which increased rapidly and spread
to the principal provincial cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish
communities on the Continent during the second world war, the present Anglo-Jewish
community of some 450,000 is the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought, each of
which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox (the original
groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches less religious
importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the Jewish faith, began
in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the Liberal Jewish Move¬
ment which, in addition, lays emphasis on the reinterpretation of traditional Judaism
in the light of modern thought and custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain who belong
to any kind of synagogue, about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the
head of the largest group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head
of the Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain number approximately 450. There has been an increase in
the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now attended by about one
in seven Jewish children, while the remainder attend the ordinary State or independent
schools and receive extra-curricular instruction in the Jewish faith.
THE CHURCHES
203
Other Religious Communities
Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and foreign
countries have established centres for worship for their own communities in the
United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian communities include
the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with some Estonian and Latvian
Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There are also churches belonging to
the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and
centres where Estonian, Latvian and Polish Lutherans worship according to their
creed. In addition, the French, Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed
Churches are represented in Britain, the first three having their own places of worship.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the jews, are the
Moslems and the Buddhists. The Moslems are the more widely represented; it is
estimated that the Islamic population of Britain may now number about 200,000, of
whom some 2,000 are in the Muslim Society of Great Britain. Their principal mosque
is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking, and there are also mosques in London,
Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow.
The Buddhist temple is in South Kensington, London. There is also a meeting place
and discussion centre for the several thousand adherents of Buddism in Britain.
Co-operation between the Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation between
the Churches. The British Council of Churches, founded in 1942, includes official
representatives from almost all the churches of the British Isles, with the exception
of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council facilitates common action between the
churches and seeks to further the cause of Christian unity. The Archbishop of
Canterbury is president. In addition, most, though not all, of the Free Churches
in England and Wales are members of the Free Church Federal Council (formed in
1940 by the amalgamation of the Federal Council of Evangelical Free Churches with
the National Free Church Council), the aims of which are to promote unity and joint
action between the Free Churches, and to provide a channel through which the Free
Churches can communicate and negotiate with central and local government authorities
as a united body. Discussions on changes in organisation to allow of closer relations
between the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Presbyterian Church of England have been taking place for the
last few years. Conversations on the same subject are also being held between
representatives of the Church of England and the Methodist Church.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is advised on these matters, both at home and
abroad, by the Church of England Council on Inter-Church Relations.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also participate
in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at Amsterdam, Nether¬
lands, in 1948; its third assembly was held in the autumn of 1961 in New Delhi,
India. The council links together 171 churches in over 50 countries for co-operation
in action and the study of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes place on
some specific issues through the Churches’ Alain Committee. The Council of
Christians and Jews works for better understanding between members of the two
religions and deals with problems arising in the social field.

PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
The promotion of the sciences in the United Kingdom is largely the concern of
learned societies and institutions but only a small part of the national research pro¬
gramme is carried out directly by them. Most pure research is conducted in the
universities, which also play an essential part in maintaining a steady supply of trained
scientists. In practice, it has become impossible to distinguish clearly between pure
science and its extensive applications in everyday life, with the result that scientific
research has become the concern also of industry and of various Government depart¬
ments, a number of which maintain their own research establishments.
Today it is an acknowledged responsibility of the Government not only to under¬
take research directly but also to keep under review facilities for the training of
scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain research projects, and
to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters of national interest. As a result,
a system of collaboration which leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to
individual scientists has developed between the universities, industry and the Govern¬
ment. The learned societies, membership of which is derived from all three, play an
important part in the discussion and publication of the results of research. Important
work is also undertaken by independent organisations.
THE LEARNED SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the develop¬
ment and organisation of science in Britain; not only have they provided the back¬
ground for continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards, but they
have been a meeting ground where scientists can foregather for the exchange of ideas,
and a reliable source from which new ideas for the enrichment of knowledge can
flow. Although today most research operations are conducted under other auspices,
the learned societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread
of scientific knowledge and the application of new discoveries.
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with approxi¬
mately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical institutions
and professional associations, many of which are playing a distinguished part in
promoting their own branches of science or are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. Prominent examples of these are the
British Medical Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of
Chemical Engineers, the Institution of Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry,
the Institute of Physics and the Physical Society, the Institute of Biology, the National
204
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
205
Institute of Industrial Psychology and the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research.
The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its broadest
aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and activities) are
noted below.
The Royal Society (or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for the Improvement
of Natural Knowledge), founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs and admission to it is regarded by scientists as a high honour. The
Queen is Patron. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
comprising the Queen Mother and three Royal Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom
there are now 65; and the main body of Fellows, numbering some 625. Election to the
Fellowship, which is for life, is restricted to 25 people a year and to foreign membership
to four a year. The Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its present activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings', the
presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of research
appointments and grants. The highest medal presented is the Copley Medal, for
which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are also two Royal Medals, and
the Rumford, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester and Hughes Medals. There are five
lectureships: the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier
(nervous system); the Wilkins (history of science); and the Leeuwenhoek (micro¬
biology). Events to mark the tercentenary of the Society in i960 included the foundation
of the Wolfson Research Professorship of the Royal Society and the Leverhulme
Tercentenary Medal for the most important contribution to pure or applied chemistry
or engineering. In 1962 the Henry Dale Research Professorship was instituted by an
endowment from the Wellcome Trustees.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had a special
relationship with the Government, which provides its accommodation and makes
grants for research activities administered by it. The President of the Society is con¬
sulted on appointments to Government research councils and its Fellows serve on most
governmental advisory councils and committees concerned with research.
The Society represents the United Kingdom in the international unions comprising
the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and appoints national com¬
mittees for each of them.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific, artistic,
technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in i754> however, one of
the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and application to
useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose chiefly by
disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society regularly holds meetings for
the delivery of lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing effective
media for the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of developments
which have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching
the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the ‘promotion of
chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manufactures’,
and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’. Its character, however, was
largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday, who
206
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
established a tradition of research. Today, the Royal Institution has extensive research
laboratories, and lectures are given on recent developments in science and other
branches of knowledge. Its library of some 60,000 books includes many early scientific
works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief activities
is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well as by eminent
scientists. Its 14 sections cover the whole range of pure and applied science other
than medical science, and there is a division for studying the social and international
relations of science. In addition to the annual meeting and in order to extend its
influence, the association plans continuous activities throughout the year, in particular
special lectures, exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences),
the publication of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of
study groups and liaison with the press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The association has set up area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing respectively
with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to encourage scientists to
make their activities known to wider audiences. Collaboration with other scientific
organisations has always been an important function of the British Association, and
it has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific bodies and learned societies.
It has also played an important part in the development of science by taking or
recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and application of scientific
knowledge.
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY
According to a survey carried out by the Ministry of Labour, the number of
qualified scientists and engineers (i.e. holders of degrees or diplomas, or members of
certain professional institutions) in employment in Great Britain at the beginning
of 1959 was 173,000 (72,200 scientists and 100,800 engineers) representing an increase
of 28,000 or nearly one-fifth over the numbers recorded in a similar survey in 1956.
On the basis of the 1956 survey the Committee on Scientific Manpower of the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy estimated that the number of scientists and engineers
qualifying annually would need to be raised from 10,000 in 1956 to 20,000 between
between 1966 and 1971. The Government accepted this figure as a reasonable goal
and supported measures to ensure that the universities and technical colleges together
would be able to produce at least this number. In 1961 the Committee reported that
this target was likely to be reached by 1965 and an output of 30,000 by 1972 was possible.
The prospect of an adequate supply was welcome as it would enable those trained in
scientific disciplines to be available for management, administration and the pro¬
fessions generally.
The Universities
During recent years there has been a considerable expansion of scientific and
technological training and research facilities within the universities. For example, the
Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, the Royal College of Science
and Technology, Glasgow, and the Manchester College of Science and Technology
provide degree and postgraduate courses for the universities with which they are
associated. At the new Churchill College, Cambridge, 70 per cent of places are
allocated to students of scientific and technological subjects. More than half of all
students at universities are now studying some branch of science or technology.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
207
Eighteen universities in the United Kingdom have faculties of engineering, some
of them including chemical, aeronautical and production engineering. Universities
in industrial centres have long been renowned for studies relating to their local
industries, such as metallurgy at Birmingham, Sheffield, Swansea and other centres
of the metals and metal-using industries, and naval architecture and marine engineering
at Glasgow, Liverpool and Newcastle upon Tyne. In the textile areas, Manchester
offers courses in textile chemistry and engineering and Leeds has specialised in
courses and research in connection with the wool textile industry, including colour
chemistry and dyeing. Leeds is the only university in Britain that has a department
devoted to the study of leather manufacture, and Manchester offers courses in paper
and machine tool technology. Sheffield is unique for its department of glass technology
—the pioneer among such departments in the world. Aeronautical engineering is
a main subject for first degree courses at Bristol, Cambridge, London, Manchester,
Southampton, Glasgow and Belfast. Birmingham and London offer first degree
courses in oil technology.
All universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have laboratories
or research departments.1 The Government research councils award a substantial
number of studentships for postgraduate training in science and technology, as well
as post-doctoral research fellowships. Leading firms in such industries as chemicals,
oil, motor vehicles, textiles, electrical equipment, food, and mining provide grants for
specific research projects or endow research fellowships, such as the Imperial Chemical
Industries and Leverhulme Fellowships, or professorships. Foundations which provide
similar benefactions include the Nuffield Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
Trust, the Wellcome Trust and Courtaulds’ Scientific and Educational Trust Fund.
Among individuals whose major contributions to universities have included provision
for research facilities are Lord Nuffield, with gifts to the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford,
Lord Austin, who provided new buildings for the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge,
members of the Wills family, who financed the Physics Laboratory at Bristol, members
of the Boot family at Nottingham and of the Brotherton family at Leeds.
There are several examples of continuous co-operation between industry and
commerce and the universities. A notable one is the Manchester Joint Research
Council, set up in 1944 by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the University
of Manchester, which have equal representation on it; this body organises lectures
and discussion meetings and conducts investigations into the use made of research by
industry. Another is the Glass Delegation of the University of Sheffield, which directs
the work of the Department of Glass Technology and is composed of members
appointed by the Council of the University and representatives of firms and companies
who subscribe funds for the furtherance of training and research. An example of
co-operation between a Government department, an independent organisation and a
university is the radio telescope at the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Observatory, Jodrell
Bank, Cheshire (see p. 217), financed jointly by the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research, the Nuffield Foundation, and Manchester University, which has
been responsible for its development.
Technical Colleges
The Government’s plans for a large-scale and rapid expansion of education in
advanced technology include the increase of advanced work at Colleges of Advanced
1 The many topics under investigation in these laboratories and in those of the major technical
colleges, are listed in Scientific Research in British Universities and Colleges (see Bibliography,
P- 538).
2o8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Technology (in England and Wales), Central Institutions (in Scotland) and technical
colleges, as well as at the universities (see pp. 171-4).
Most postgraduate studentships and fellowships awarded by the Government
research councils may be held at colleges of advanced technology and technical
colleges as well as at universities.
INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
The most recent governmental survey of the pattern of the research and development
effort in Great Britain was published in the report of the Advisory Council on
Scientific Policy for 1959-60. It indicated that in the year 1958-59 Britain spent a
total of some £480 million on all kinds of research and development, of which £266
million was spent in private industrial laboratories, industry itself providing £136
million and the Government most of the remainder. Public corporations were esti¬
mated to have spent million.
In the fourth of its estimates of research in manufacturing industry, published in
December 1961, the Federation of British Industries (FBI) found that its members
(accounting for 90-95 per cent of such expenditure) spent £250 million on research
and development in 1959-60. An earlier (1958) inquiry by DSIR indicated that the
largest expenditure was by the following industries: aircraft (44 per cent), electrical
engineering (18 per cent), chemicals (13 per cent) and shipbuilding (8 per cent).
This survey also showed that, according to the most reliable estimates available, about
46,600 professionally qualified scientists and engineers were then engaged on research
and development in industry, including about 2,200 research workers in agriculture
and medicine.
The major part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the research
organisations of the larger firms. The other main agencies are independent institutes
for sponsored research, consultant laboratories, Government laboratories and uni¬
versities and technical colleges. The main nationalised industries have their own
research establishments (particulars of which are given in the appropriate sections of
Chapter 10, Industry), and also give financial support to organisations concerned
with research into matters of interest to them.
Research Associations
A scheme by which the Government helps groups of firms with similar interests
to form industrial research associations was started in 1915 with the decision to
create the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1961-62, there were
53 such research associations with a combined income of ^8-7 million (compared
with £5-1 million in 1955), of which a little less than a quarter was contributed by the
Government through the Industrial Grants Committee of the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research. The associations, which serve about 60 per cent of British
industry, vary in size from the British Iron and Steel Research Association (BISRA)
with an annual income of over £1 million, of which 120,000 is provided by DSIR
grant, to the File Research Council with an income of only £8,100. The largest are
those dealing with the metals and electrical engineering industries, coal utilisation,
cotton and man-made fibres, production engineering, marine engineering and ship¬
building. (Particulars of these and other associations are given in the relevant sections
of Chapter 10, Industry.) The amounts of the Government grants are related to the
contributions made by the industries concerned.
The research associations are autonomous bodies governed by their own councils,
the members of which are mostly representatives of industry. The councils are advised
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
209
by research committees in preparing research programmes. The research associations
make the results of their work known to member firms by a variety of methods, among
which are bulletins, publications, lectures, films, training classes, exhibitions and
mobile demonstration units.
Institutes for Sponsored Research
A number of institutes exist to carry out sponsored research for industry on a
confidential basis, the results and patents arising being retained as the property of
the sponsor. The principal institutes of this type are the Fulmer Research Institute,
Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, the Sondes Place Research Institute, Dorking, Surrey,
the Battelle Institute, London, and the Arthur D. Little Research Institute, Musselburgh,
near Edinburgh.
ORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT RESEARCH
The active participation by the Government in scientific research is for the most
part a development of the twentieth century, though its association with science dates
back to a much earlier period.
Evolution of the Research Organisations
In 1675, King Charles II established Britain’s first State-supported research
institution—the Royal Greenwich Observatory (now transferred to Herstmonceux,
Sussex)—to correct the tables of the positions of the moon and fixed stars ‘for the use
of his seamen’. The Geological Survey of Great Britain, the first national institution
of its kind in the world, was founded in 1835. In 1842 the Board of Inland Revenue
established a chemical laboratory which eventually developed into the Laboratory of
the Government Chemist; and in 1854 the Meteorological Office was established by
the Board of Trade. All these Government departments were using scientific know¬
ledge, but there was little organised effort towards the application of the discoveries
made in pure science.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into methods
of precise measurement, led to the establishment in 1900 of the National Physical
Laboratory under the control of the Royal Society, with a small grant from the
Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant towards upkeep. Government
recognition of the importance of scientific research and its applications was hastened
by the first world war, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
(DSIR) was established in 1916 as a separate Government department. In 1918
the DSIR took over financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory
from the Royal Society, but the Society appoints a general board and an executive
committee which supervise scientific policy.
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the research
funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act of 1911. In 1920 the
committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), established
under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid provided by Parliament.
Agricultural research, in its early days, was not centrally organised. The first
research institutes were founded and initially maintained by private individuals.
Rothamsted Experimental Station, for example, the oldest of them, was founded
in 1843 by Sir John Lawes, who personally financed it until, in 1889, he endowed it
and set up the Lawes Agricultural Trust to administer the endowment; as research
210
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
became more costly, Government funds were sought and obtained, though the institute
remained independent. The Development Commission, set up under the Development
and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, recommended that financial aid should
be made available from the Development Fund to ‘aid and develop agriculture and
rural industries by promoting scientific research’ and in 1911 this fund was used to
promote a scheme which led to the establishment of many of the present-day agricul¬
tural institutions. In 1931 the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established
by Royal Charter to be responsible for the general organisation and development of
agricultural research in Great Britain. In addition to advising the agricultural depart¬
ments on the programmes of the institutes and, in the early stages, acting as scientific
adviser to the Development Commission, the ARC was given funds to spend at its
own discretion and it gradually took over the Commission’s responsibilities for
agricultural research. The Nature Conservancy, which is concerned with the con¬
servation of flora and fauna, was set up in 1949.
During the second world war, a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet
was created to co-ordinate defence research and civil research. This committee was
replaced in 1947 by two bodies: an Advisory Council on Scientific Policy to advise
the Lord President of the Council, who had come to be regarded as responsible for
the formulation and execution of Government scientific policy; and a Defence Re¬
search Policy Committee ‘to advise the Minister of Defence and Chiefs of Staff on
matters connected with the formulation of scientific policy in the defence field’.
Ministerial Responsibility for Civil Scientific Research
Ministerial responsibilities for Government scientific organisations were rearranged
following the governmental changes in October I959‘ ^ Minister for Science was
appointed in conjunction with one of the ancient Offices of State traditionally within
the Cabinet (at first that of Lord Privy Seal, but from July i960 that of Lord President
of the Council) who is responsible to Parliament for the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council,
the Overseas Research Council and the Nature Conservancy. He also exercises
ministerial functions under the Atomic Energy Acts, and general supervision over
the programme of space research.
Other ministers remain responsible for the scientific establishments within their
own departments; but the Minister for Science, advised by the Advisory Council on
Scientific Policy, is broadly responsible for civil scientific policy. He is assisted by an
administrative staff, known as the Office of the Minister for Science, which is com¬
posed of a general division and an atomic energy division.
A Committee on Management and Control of Research and Development, set up
in 1958 by the Lord President of the Council, formulated in its report in 1961 standards
of good practice which have been accepted by the Government as widely applicable
to its research and development organisations.
The Advisory Council on Scientific Policy
The members of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy, who are appointed
by the Minister for Science, include eminent scientists drawn from the universities,
industry and Government service.
In order to give adequate attention to each of the subjects within its wide range of
interest, the Advisory Council has established standing committees on Scientific
Manpower; Scientific Library and Technical Information; Overseas Scientific
Relations; and Statistics.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
211
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The DSIR is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research. It is governed by a Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, known as the Research Council.
The Research Council consists of as many members as may be determined by
the Minister for Science; in 1961 it had a chairman and 14 members. It is entrusted
with the organisation, development and encouragement of scientific and industrial
research and with the dissemination of the results of such research. In particular,
it may:
(1) encourage and support scientific research in universities, technical colleges
and other institutions;
(2) establish or develop institutions or departments of institutions for investi¬
gation and research relating to the advancement of trade and industry; and
(3) take steps to further the practical application of the results of scientific and
industrial research.
These functions are discharged through 14 national research organisations under
the Research Council’s own control and direction and financed from its own Vote,
and one, the Joint Fire Research Organisation, which is maintained by the DSIR
and the Fire Offices’ Committee; and through the autonomous industrial research
associations. The Council also makes grants for these purposes and for postgraduate
instruction in science and technology to individual workers and to institutions.
Since DSIR was set up, technological changes have necessitated a measure of
reorganisation. Science-based industries, such as the chemical and electrical industries,
have matured and prospered; entirely new industries, such as electronics, plastics,
synthetic fibres and synthetic rubber industries, have emerged. Industry, for its own
purposes and on behalf of the Government, has become the largest employer of
research workers. Organised teamwork has increasingly replaced individual effort
in scientific research, leading to a demand for trained research workers who can both
specialise and co-operate with colleagues trained in other subjects, and also for men of
outstanding qualities to direct large research departments. Research projects, at the
same time, have become increasingly expensive and have to be selected with more care.
The research stations operated by DSIR are as follows: the Building Research
Station near Watford, Hertfordshire, is concerned with the technique of building
design and construction, and the organisation, productivity, and economics of building
work; the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, 36 miles west
of London, studies the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of home-grown
and imported timber; the Geological Survey and Museum, with headquarters in London
and branch offices in Edinburgh and Leeds, maps the geological structure of the
United Kingdom and publishes information on mineral resources of special importance,
including underground water supplies; the Hydraulics Research Station at Wallingford,
on the river Thames, studies problems of water flow in open channels such as rivers,
estuaries and harbours, and coastal erosion; the Joint Fire Research Organisation is
concerned with the detection, suppression, and inhibition of fires and the safety of
life in fires; the Laboratory of the Government Chemist in London has a statutory
function as official analyst and as an adjudicator in cases of disputed analyses and also
carries out analytical research and advisory work for Government departments on
request; the National Chemical Laboratory at Teddington, near London, concentrates
on basic chemical research applicable to a wide variety of industries which is not
being done elsewhere; the National Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride, south of

BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Glasgow, carries out basic and applied research in mechanical engineering to provide
industry with information required to solve its own particular problems and has unique
facilities for making precision engineering measurements and testing hydraulic machinery
and heat exchange plant; the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington conducts
research in various branches of non-nuclear physics and maintains Britisn primary
standards and physical units; the Radio Research Station at Slough, west of London,
carries out research on radio wave propagation and radio noise, taking advantage, in
particular, of the new techniques provided by rockets and artificial satellites, and its
space research programme also includes a tracking and prediction service and the
maintenance of one of the World Data Centres for space research; the Road Research
Laboratory at Harmondsworth, west of London, does research on road construction,
safety and traffic flow; the Torry Research Station at Aberdeen (with a branch labora¬
tory at Hull) investigates problems arising in the handling, processing, and transport
and storage of fish; the Tropical Products Institute in London aims at improving the
economical viability of the less-developed countries of the tropics, especially those
within the Commonwealth, by research into new uses for tropical plant and animal
products; the Warren Spring Laboratory near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, provides
facilities for research and development, including pilot-scale work on subjects of
national importance which cannot be fitted into the programme of other organisations,
undertakes sponsored research and can accommodate teams from industry; the Water
Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage is concerned with the safe disposal of
sewage and trade effluents and with the purity of water supplies.
In 1939 the annual expenditure of DSIR for all purposes amounted to ^5o0)oo<-)*
For 1962-63 the total net expenditure is estimated at j£i8*i million (compared with
£15.4 million in 1961-62). The largest increases have been in support of work in
the universities. Expansion of staff in DSIR’s own laboratories and increases in
grants to research associations are proceeding steadily and much more attention and
money are being devoted to ensuring that the results of research are known and
applied. To this end the National Lending Library for Science and Technology was
established at Boston Spa in Yorkshire in i960 (see p.224).
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is responsible to the Committee of the Privy
Council for Medical Research, of which the Minister for Science is chairman and the
Secretaries of State for the Home Department, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations
and the Colonies and the Ministers of Health and of Labour are members.
The members of the council, appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council
for Medical Research for a period of four years, are twelve in number. Nine members,
representing different branches of medical knowledge and the fundamental sciences
on which these are based, are appointed after consultation with the President of the
Royal Society and with the council itself: on retirement, these scientific members are
not eligible for immediate reappointment. Of the three lay members of the council,
one must be a member of the House of Lords and one a member of the House of
Commons.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health and
disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme, the council is assisted
by special committees appointed to advise on particular subjects. Its arrangements
for the support of research fall under four main headings.
(1) investigations by members of the council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in its own research establishments;
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 213
(2) temporary research grants to independent investigators in universities and
elsewhere;
(3) long-term research grants in support of specific research programmes in
university medical departments; and
(4) research fellowships and scholarships for tenure both at home and abroad.
The National Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead, London,
is the council’s main research establishment; in addition, there are about 80 smaller
establishments, generally known as research units, which are attached in most cases
to universities and hospitals in the United Kingdom. The council also undertakes
work overseas and, with additional support from funds made available through the
Department of Technical Co-operation, maintains laboratories in the Gambia and
units in Uganda and Jamaica.
For the financial year 1962-63 the council’s grant-in-aid is ^5-8 million, compared
with £5-6 million for 1961-62.
Agricultural Research Council
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) is responsible to the Committee of the
Privy Council for Agricultural Research, consisting of the Minister for Science, the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The council consists of 15 to 18 members, five of whom are appointed for their
general experience of and interest in agriculture. Others are appointed by the Com¬
mittee of the Privy Council, after consultation with the President of the Royal Society,
on account of their qualifications in one or other of the sciences relating to agriculture.
Included in the council’s membership are the Chief Scientific Adviser (Agriculture)
and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
also one member appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and
one by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Liaison is also maintained with the Ministry
of Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the Royal Society by the appointment of
representatives as assessors to the council.
The council has 24 research stations and units under its direct control in Great
Britain including three laboratories concerned with the preservation, storage and
protection of foodstuffs. It is also responsible for the financing of the independent
research institutes in England and Wales. The programmes of all these institutes are
co-ordinated and approved by the council and are integrated with those of the indepen¬
dent research institutes in Scotland, which are grant-aided by the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. (For particulars of some of the leading re¬
search institutes, see Chapter 11, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.)
The council makes grants to universities and other recognised research institutions
for special investigations, and awards research fellowships and postgraduate student¬
ships in agricultural and veterinary science, agricultural and dairy engineering and
agricultural statistics.
The greater part of the council’s expenditure is met from the Agricultural Research
Fund, which is financed by parliamentary grant-in-aid. For the year 1962-63 expendi¬
ture is estimated at ^6-5 million, compared with ^6-o million in 1961-62.
Overseas Research Council
The Government established the Overseas Research Council in July 1959. The
council is under the general control of a committee of the Privy Council and its
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
214
principal functions are to formulate overseas scientific research policy and to co¬
ordinate advice and assistance on research matters provided by the United Kingdom
research councils and research specialist advisory committees (see p. 220). Matters
concerning scientific development in the United Kingdom dependencies, in Common¬
wealth countries and in countries outside the Commonwealth can be referred to it.
The council thus provides a central point to which Commonwealth government and
research institutions can refer for advice and information, and advises generally on
United Kingdom co-operation in scientific research overseas.
Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy is responsible to the Privy Council Committee for Nature
Conservation. Its functions, as summarised in the charter, are ‘to provide scientific
advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and fauna of Great Britain;
to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves in Great Britain, including the
maintenance of physical features of scientific interest; and to organise and develop the
research and scientific service related thereto’.
Research stations have been set up by the Nature Conservancy at Merlewood,
Grange-over-Sands, in Lancashire, at Furzebrook, Wareham, in Dorset, and at
Speyside, Inverness, and field stations at Moor House, Westmorland, and at Anancaun,
Ross, and an experimental station at Monks’ Wood, Huntingdon, where long-term
ecological research is undertaken into such problems as the relation of vegetation to
soils and climates, peat growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal erosion
and roadside spraying. Grants are made for research, and the Nature Conservancy
awards annually a number of postgraduate studentships. The grant-in-aid for 1962-63
is estimated at ^590,000.
Nuclear Energy
Since 1959 the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the Atomic Energy
Authority Act, 1954, has been responsible to the Minister for Science for research
and development in nuclear energy.
The Minister of Aviation has assumed the responsibility of the former Ministry of
Supply for the development and production of nuclear weapons for the Services in
accordance with agreed defence policy; in practice, however, the Atomic Energy
Authority produces the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for nuclear weapons
under contract and carries out weapon research. The Minister of Power (in Scotland,
the Secretary of State) has a general responsibility for the civil nuclear power pro¬
gramme; the power stations are being built for, and will be operated by, the electricity
authorities. The Admiralty is concerned (in close collaboration with the Atomic
Energy Authority) in the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion, and a
small working group, responsible jointly to the Minister for Science and the Minister
of Transport, has been set up to advise on the programme of research to advance
nuclear propulsion for merchant ships. The Authority collaborates with a number of
other Government departments—the Ministries of Health, Labour, Housing and
Local Government, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and Transport, the Post Office,
the Scottish Office, and the Home Office—on various aspects of health and safety in
relation to atomic energy. • 1 1
Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and Agricultural
Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee. This
committee advises ministers on the administration of the Radioactive Substances
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 215
Acts which deal with the safeguards necessary in the use of radioactive substances and
apparatus producing radiation.
The Atomic Energy Authority
The Atomic Energy Authority, appointed by the Minister for Science, at present
consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and ten other members, six of whom are
part-time.
The Authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-to-day
Government control (subject to the power given to the responsible minister to issue
directions to the Authority in matters of over-riding national importance), but differs
from them in that most of its revenue is derived from money voted by Parliament,
although income from other sources, such as the sale of radioisotopes and fuel elements,
is expected to increase.
The organisation is divided into five groups controlling various establishments
and has a London office, which is responsibile for central financial, administrative
and establishment matters, and for raw material procurement.
The Research Group, with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at
Harwell as its principal establishment, conducts research into all aspects of nuclear
energy. About a fifth of its work is fundamental research. Most of the applied research
at Harwell is devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, although some assistance is
given on specific problems relating to weapons. The work is arranged in eleven
divisions and the equipment includes reactors, accelerators, an isotope separator and
a neutron project. All controlled thermonuclear research is being moved from Harwell
and Aldermaston to a new research centre at Culham, Oxfordshire (a few miles north
of Harwell).
Two other important establishments in the research group are: the Radiochemical
Centre at Amersham, and the Radiation Laboratories at Wantage. The former,
which prepares and distributes radioisotopes and other radioactive materials, has
been enlarged to meet a demand for radioactive products which has more than
trebled since 1955. Harwell also runs an isotope school, started in April 1951 and now
situated at Wantage, and a reactor school, started in September 1954, which provides
training for home and overseas students.
The Weapons Group, centred on Aldermaston, conducts research on and development
of nuclear weapons and other research work with civil, as well as defence, applications.
It has outstations at Foulness and Orfordness in eastern England, and Woolwich
Common, London.
There are three groups with headquarters at Risley, in north-western England.
The Reactor Group is responsible for the design and development of reactors. It is
responsible for the Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor at Windscale which has recently
been completed. The Group includes the Atomic Energy Establishment at Winfrith,
Dorset, which houses among other things high-temperature gas-cooled reactor
experiments such as Zenith and the Dragon project, the latter a 20 MW reactor due
to be completed by 1963, financed jointly by a number of member countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including
members of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The United
Kingdom is providing the largest share and will retain ownership of the reactor.
The Reactor Group also includes the Dounreay experimental reactor establishment
in the north of Scotland, which houses a materials-testing reactor and a fast-breeder
reactor. The Group has research laboratories at the main establishments of the
Production Group, which is responsible for the operation of factories producing
H
2l6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
fissile material at Windscale (Cumberland), Capenhurst (Cheshire) and Springfields
(Lancashire) and the AEA’s nuclear power plants at Calder Hall (Cumberland) and
Chapelcross (Dumfries). The third group with headquarters at Risley is the Engineering
Group, responsible for the construction of plant, works and buildings, and for the
design and inspection of fuel elements for production purposes.
National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science
In 1957 the Government set up a National Institute for Research in Nuclear
Science (NIRNS), which provides, for common use by universities and others,
facilities and equipment which are beyond the scope of individual universities and
institutions carrying out research in nuclear energy. It does not replace the research
already being done in individual universities with assistance from Government funds;
nor does it affect the Government’s participation in the international scheme for
common facilities set up in Geneva under the auspices of the European Organisation
for Nuclear Research (CERN). The institute is financed in the main by grants through
the Atomic Energy Authority from the Atomic Energy Vote. Early in 1961 NIRNS
took over from AERE responsibility for the development of particle accelerators.
The Rutherford High Energy Laboratory at Harwell will house the institute’s proton
synchrotron (particle accelerator). This 7,000 million electron volt apparatus, due for
completion in 1963, will be one of the largest such machines in the world.
Space Research
The Minister for Science, in consultation with other ministers, is responsible for
sponsoring and co-ordinating Britain’s space research programme. He is advised by a
Steering Group on Space Research, representing Government departments and
university scientists and they, in turn, are advised on the programme’s purely scientific
aspects by the British National Committee on Space Research, which is appointed
by the Royal Society. This committee is also the United Kingdom body adhering to
non-governmental scientific groups, such as the Committee on Space Research
(COSPAR), established by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in
October 1958. The execution of the programme, under the general supervision of the
Office of the Minister for Science, is in the hands of scientists in universities, such as
those of London, Birmingham, Manchester and Belfast, and Government research
establishments, such as the Ministry of Aviation’s Royal Aircraft Establishment, at
Farnborough, and Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern, and the Radio Research
Station of the DSIR. The General Post Office undertakes research work connected
with experiments in satellite communications. DSIR is responsible for channelling
and administering grants to universities provided from Government funds. Private
industry is also developing equipment and materials needed in space research.
Identifiable Government expenditure on the scientific space research programme
amounts at present to over f 1 million a year.
A programme involving the firing of Skylark upper atmosphere vertical sounding
rockets from the Woomera range in Australia, in co-operation with the Australian
Government, has been in progress since the end of 1957. The current programme
involves about 25 firings a year for research in upper atmosphere physics and
meteorology. In 1961-62 the cost of rockets for this programme amounted to some
£200,000.
Britain was one of the first countries to accept an offer made in 1959 by the United
States to launch into orbit experiments of mutual scientific interest designed by
foreign scientists. As a result the first international satellite experiment, the S-51
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
217
or Ariel, with British instrumentation, was successfully launched on 26th April, 1962,
from Cape Canaveral by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA). Plans have already been made for launching a second Anglo-American
satellite about the middle of 1963. Because of the enormous cost involved, only the
United States and the Soviet Union at present possess rockets capable of launching
earth satellites, space probes or manned space vehicles. Two organisations in which
Britain is playing a leading part are, however, being set up to give European
countries the opportunity to participate in space research and technology—the
European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) and the European Launcher Development
Organisation (ELDO).
The General Post Office is co-operating with NASA and the French telecommuni¬
cation authorities in a programme for transatlantic testing of satellite communication
systems. A satellite, known as Telstar, was launched by NASA on 10th July, 1962.
Television pictures, some in colour, and telephone messages were successfully ex¬
changed, by reflection from it, between the United States station at Andover, Maine,
and the United Kingdom station at Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, which uses British
equipment.
The satellite prediction centre at Slough, attached to DSIR’s Radio Research
Station, also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for Space Research,
co-ordinates optical and radio tracking activities in Britain. Optical observation of
satellites is carried out regularly by many individual observers in the British Isles and
by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s outstation (see below); radio tracking is
undertaken at the Radio Research Station itself and by the radio telescopes at
Cambridge, Jodrell Bank and the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern.
Optical and Radio Astronomy
Large optical telescopes were first constructed in Britain by Herschel and Rosse in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At present British optical observatories are
being extensively re-equipped. The Isaac Newton 98-inch telescope, to be constructed
for the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux, will provide additional facilities
for optical astronomers in Britain; and grants to the Radcliffe Observatory in South
Africa, with its existing 74-inch telescope, and the merger of the Royal Observatory,
Cape Town, and the Royal Greenwich Observatory will enable astronomers to have
improved use of large optical telescopes in both hemispheres. The Royal Edinburgh
Observatory has been re-equipped with modern instrumentation for use in stellar
spectroscopy and photometry. It is specialising in the introduction into astronomy of
new electronic methods of observation and computation. The Observatory is also
engaged in seismology and, at an outstation in Peeblesshire, on the tracking of artificial
satellites.
Radio astronomy, developed since 1931, is carried out mainly at Cambridge, Jodrell
Bank and Malvern. Two large radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio Astronomy
Observatory, Cambridge University, were completed in 1957 and have made important
contributions towards the testing of the various cosmological theories. The DSIR is
granting .£466,000 for a new triple paraboloidal radio telescope at Cambridge. At the
Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories of the University of Manchester at Jodrell
Bank, there is a fully steerable paraboloid radio telescope of 250 feet diameter which
has performed outstanding work since it started in 1957* The DSIR is granting
£236,000 for a new fully steerable radio telescope on this site. There is also a new
radio telescope interferometer at the Ministry of Aviation’s Royal Radar Establishment
near Malvern.
2l8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A Radio Astronomy Planning Committee was set up by the Minister for Science in
December 1961 to advise him on the nature and extent of Britain’s radio astronomy
research programme both nationally and internationally.
Other Government-sponsored Scientific Research
All departments rely on one or other of the Government research councils for
scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of scientific
information, a few have research organisations of their own.
Research and development is undertaken by the Service Departments primarily to
meet the requirements of the armed forces, but a substantial amount of this work has
important civil applications, for instance, in land transport, aviation, navigation and
meteorology.
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out applied research in
its own veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade, Midlothian,
and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire; while at its
infestation control laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey (with a field station at Worplesdon),
it co-ordinates work on the control of insect pests of stored food and conducts research
on the control of harmful mammals and birds. The Scientific Services of the Depart¬
ment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland in Edinburgh undertake a number
of statutory duties and international obligations in regard to crop improvement and
crop protection. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the
promotion of agricultural research and research divisions dealing with a variety of
aspects have been established.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains four laboratories for
marine, shell-fish and salmon and freshwater fisheries research, and four research
vessels; the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, maintains a marine
research laboratory, four research ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater research
laboratory at Pitlochry.
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on Fishery
Research, co-ordinate all fishery research. From the Development Fund a number
of independent institutions receive grants for marine and freshwater research.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science and
Atomic Energy Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is respon¬
sible for formulating the Ministry’s general policy on the acquisition and dissemination
of scientific and technical information about food and the food handling and processing
industry; for furnishing scientific advice to the other divisions of the Ministry; and
for sponsoring or carrying out experimental work. 'I he division has its own experi¬
mental laboratories and kitchens in London. The Food Research Advisory Committee,
appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of
State for Scotland, advises on food problems (other than fish, which is dealt with by
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research) requiring investigation or
research which should be undertaken with the aid of public funds.
Forestry
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvicultural and
allied problems (see p. 35^)- means of grants, it also aids forest research work
undertaken by various universities and other institutions, including the Imperial
Forestry Institute, Oxford.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
219
Fuel and Power
The Minister of Power is responsible for research on safety in mines. The nation¬
alised coal, electricity and gas industries are required to submit their research plans
(see p. 274) for his concurrence and there is close collaboration between the Ministry
of Power, the scientific departments of these industries and DSIR.
Transport and Aviation
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research into aspects of marine
navigation, marine propulsion, and road construction, but most of the basic work
is carried out for the Ministry by the Admiralty and the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research. Research on radio aids for marine navigation is undertaken by
the Admiralty, which is also responsible for research on nuclear propulsion and inter-
Service electronic valve research, and for the administration of the Royal Greenwich
Observatory, at Herstmonceux, and the National Institute of Oceanography.
The Ministry of Aviation, which carries out most of the research needed to meet the
technical requirements of air defence, is also responsible for some civil research, for
instance, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Establish¬
ment at Farnborough, and at the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern. Some
fundamental research is carried out for the Ministry by universities and industrial
organisations. The Ministry of Aviation is also responsible for research into airport
operations and air traffic control.
Meteorology
The Air Ministry finances the Meteorological Office, which is responsible for
research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly directed to non-military ends. The
headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are at Bracknell, Berk¬
shire. The Forecasting Research Section has been equipped with a large-capacity
electronic computer. Balloon and aircraft soundings and radar techniques are used to
investigate the movement and composition of the atmosphere, and instruments are
being designed which will be used in rockets and an earth-satellite. The Air Ministry
also makes grants for fundamental meteorological research carried out under the
auspices of the Royal Society or in university departments.
Land Use and Planning
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government deals with geographical, geological,
economic and sociological research relating to the use and development of land in
England and Wales. Similar arrangements are made in Scotland by the Scottish
Home and Health Department, and in Northern Ireland by the Ministry of Health
and Local Government.
Communications
The Post Office undertakes scientific research on a wide range of subjects related
to the mechanisation of mail handling and to line and radio systems for telecom¬
munications, as well as experimental development. When the work reaches the
development stage it is usual to co-operate fully with industry, so that the final product
has been jointly engineered. A prototype electronic telephone exchange, planned in
conjunction with industry through the Joint Electronic Research Committee, and
now in operation at Dollis Hill, London, is an example. Another important outcome
is the novel submarine telephone cable system completed to Canada in 1961 and due
to span the Pacific to Australia by 1963 and thence to South East Asia by 1966, the
design having been adopted by the Commonwealth partners concerned. In this
220
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
instance the research and development was carried out by a unit run jointly by the
Post Office and Cable and Wireless, Ltd., a Government-owned company concerned
with long distance overseas telecommunications. Experiments with communication
satellites are being conducted in conjunction with the United States and French
authorities (see p. 217).
Medicine and Health
In addition to the work carried on under the segis of the Medical Research Council,
the Ministry of Health may conduct and promote research into the cause, prevention
and treatment of illness. The Scottish Home and Health Department has similar res¬
ponsibilities, in the discharge of which it is advised by its Advisory Committee on
Medical Research; liaison with the Medical Research Council is also maintained. In
Northern Ireland the Hospitals Authority (a statutory body set up by the Minister
of Health and Local Government) has power to conduct or assist medical research.
In addition, it has a statutory duty to provide adequate bacteriological and pathological
services. The General Register Office carries out research in four main fields: (1)
analysis and interpretation of statistics of causes of death; (2) statistical inquiry into
the treatment of cancer and its results; (3) morbidity as revealed in hospital statistics;
and (4) mental health.
Human and Social Sciences
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research promotes research in the human
sciences in several ways. It awards grants for special research schemes to universities,
colleges of advanced technology and other research institutions. It also awards
Fellowships and Studentships for postgraduate training in these sciences, as it does
for other sciences. It conducts research in the general field of the human sciences at
certain of its establishments, for instance the Building Research Station, the Road
Research Laboratory and the National Physical Laboratory. Additionally, the Human
Sciences Section of its Warren Spring Laboratory has a programme of which part is
on contract to universities and other institutions. The Laboratory also publishes a
Register of Research in the Human Sciences.
A great deal of social and economic inquiry is carried out inside Government
departments. The Social Survey Division of the Central Office of Information is
responsible for sample survey inquiries which involve direct contact with members of
the public or of special groups. The Social Survey works at the request of all Govern¬
ment Departments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration with
universities and other independent research organisations.
Colonial Development
Most of the research work relating to colonial development is done in the colonial
territories and is assisted by funds made available under the Colonial Development
and Welfare Acts and administered by the Department of Technical Co-operation
advised by specialist committees. Much of this work requires close collaboration with
research institutes and laboratories in Britain. The Overseas Research Council advises
on general questions of policy and co-ordination.
Locust Control
An example of Britain’s research work on behalf of colonial territories is provided
by the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, which has been internationally
recognised as a world centre for locust research since 1931. This organisation receives
and co-ordinates information on locust movements and breeding from some 40
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
221
countries, undertakes scientific research into the life history and habits of the different
species of locust, and investigates and develops methods for their control and
destruction. In co-operation with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organi¬
sation (FAO), it provides an information service on the movements of desert locusts
and provides forecasts of swarm movements which are distributed to the countries
threatened.
Botany
There are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government depart¬
ments which undertake research work in addition to their other scientific activities.
These include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759 an(^ now administered
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its three research departments are: the Herbarium, con¬
cerned primarily with the classification and accurate determination of plants; the
Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant physiology, cytology and
genetics; and the Museum of Economic Botany, dealing with the economic exploitation
of plants. The library, attached to the herbarium, was founded in 1853; it consists of
more than 55,000 botanical books, about 80,000 reprints and separately issued items
and a collection of over 150,000 drawings and paintings of plants.
Scientific Museums
The British Museum (Natural History)—an independent section of the British
Museum—contains one of the world’s largest collections of natural history material
and is recognised as a leading research institution. 1 he Science Museum illustrates
the development of pure and applied science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain,
which has always held a leading place in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining,
aeronautics, and in the development of industrial machinery and processes, all of
which are represented in the museum’s collections. The geology of Britain is known in
more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the Geological
Survey (since 1919 an establishment of DSIR), responsible for this work, has an
outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological Museum. These three museums
are in South Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and Industry,
in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939
by members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary
Science Committee. It is one of a number of unofficial, all-party parliamentary groups
which have grown up spontaneously and have varying degrees of influence. Member¬
ship is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses, and also to
nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and technological
organisations in Britain as may be affiliated under its constitution. The committee
provides, as far as possible, for a regular exchange of information between members
of Parliament and scientists.
Scientific Liaison Overseas
The history of scientific progress is essentially a story involving many nations;
the organisation of a country’s scientific research would, therefore, be incomplete
without provision for adequate liaison with other countries.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Before the second world war, international scientific collaboration took place
through the exchange of university staffs, the awards of scholarships and fellowships,
the close relations existing between the learned societies in Britain and their equivalent
bodies abroad, and through international conferences and congresses.
The war and the post-war period saw the emergence of a number of new develop¬
ments in overseas scientific collaboration, including the exchange of scientific
information. Well-known examples are the specialised agencies of the United
Nations Organisation (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation)
and those concerned with nuclear energy (the International Atomic Energy Agency,
the European Organisation for Nuclear Research [CERN], the European Nuclear
Energy Agency) and space research (the European Space Research Organisation
[ESRO]), in all of which the United Kingdom is playing a full part. The United
Kingdom is also represented on the Governing Committee for Scientific and Technical
Personnel of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
and on the Science Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO),
and collaborates bilaterally with a number of countries in nuclear energy. Besides
agreements between the AEA and other atomic energy authorities, including that of
the Soviet Union, there are inter-governmental agreements with eight countries,
including the United States, with which collaboration is now particularly close. There
are permanent representatives of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in
London and of the United Kingdom AEA in Washington. Controlled thermonuclear
(fusion) reactions and nuclear marine propulsion are two important subjects on which
there are regular discussions and exchanges of experts.
Among the various channels through which scientific liaison is conducted are:
The British Commonwealth Scientific Offices
A feature of the war-time pattern of scientific collaboration was the establishment
of scientific missions in London by the United States and Commonwealth countries,
and in Washington by the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. The latter
subsequently joined together as the British Commonwealth Scientific Office (North
America). In 1946 a British Commonwealth Scientific Conference was held to see how
the war-time collaboration and co-operation could be continued and extended.
Among the recommendations of the Conference was the continuance of the British
Commonwealth Scientific Office (North America) and the establishment of the
British Commonwealth Scientific Offices (London), a group of offices containing the
scientific representatives of Commonwealth countries with whom the Overseas Liaison
Group of the DSIR is closely associated.
British Commonwealth Scientific Committee
The British Commonwealth Scientific Committee, consisting of the heads of the
research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in 1958 from the previous
Standing Committee set up in 1946, holds conferences about every two years.
Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux comprise three Institutes and ten
Bureaux, each concerned with a particular branch of agricultural science. Their
purpose is to act as clearing houses for the interchange of information of value to
research workers in agricultural science throughout the Commonwealth. This they
achieve by scanning and indexing journals of scientific repute in all languages, by
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
223
keeping in touch with agricultural research in progress and by the dissemination of this
information by the periodic issue of Abstract Journals. Fifteen Abstract Journals are
published periodically and have a combined annual circulation of about 22,500 copies.
A list of research workers in agriculture, animal health and forestry m the Common¬
wealth is published from time to time, and this list includes an indication of topics
under investigation by the individual workers concerned. The Bureaux also issue
monographs on particular subjects within their respective fields and deal with inquiries
received from research workers in all parts of the Commonwealth. In addition, the
Institutes provide taxonomic and identification services.
The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations
This is a committee of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy which was set up
after the second world war to consider and advise on United Kingdom Government
policy on overseas scientific relations. In view of the Government’s increasing interest
in international organisation for scientific co-operation, the committee was recon¬
stituted in 1958 as a small committee concerned primarily with questions of policy
and scientific co-operation. The chairman of the Advisory Council on Scientific
Policy acts as its chairman, and its secretariat is provided jointly by the Office of the
Minister for Science and the Overseas Liaison Group of the DSIR.
The Overseas Liaison Group of the DSIR
This group, which is part of the Information Division of the DSIR, is broadly
responsible for the overseas relations and activities of the department In addition
to its executive work for the Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations,
it is responsible for the administration of the scientific attaches, advisers and missions
at present stationed in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Stockholm, Moscow Tokyo, and New
Delhi. These representatives are accredited to a total of 12 countries (Austria, Cana a,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway the Soviet Union,
Sweden and the United States) and are also concerned with five otheis (Belgium,
Italy Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) as required. The group is
responsible for ensuring that information collected by representatives is effective y
disseminated in the United Kingdom. The attaches, advisers and missions and he
Overseas Liaison Group itself have inter-departmental responsibilities, although the
group is placed within the DSIR for convenience of organisation.
The group forms the United Kingdom element of the British Commonwealth
Scientific Offices (London) and is also associated, through the United King om
Scientific Mission in Washington, with the British Commonwealth Scientific Office
(North America). It is responsible for the DSIR interests in a number of international
organisations, such as OECD, NATO, UNESCO, ILO.
The British Council
The aims of the British Council in the pure and applied sciences are to foster closer
co-operation between British scientists and scientists of other countries, and to
promote a better understanding of Britain among overseas specialists by disseminating
a knowledge of British activities and achievements. Under the first objective the
exchange of visits between scientists in the United Kingdom and other countries is o
prime importance. Besides arranging lecture or advisory tours overseas by eminent
British scientists, the British Council, among many activities of a similar nature, brings
to the United Kingdom every year a number of senior overseas specialists, pos -
graduate students and technologists on visits of varying duration, for the purpose ot
224
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
study in British universities and other institutions, or for discussion with British
experts. The Council organises a number of short courses for overseas specialists every
year, including such subjects as meteorology and farm management. In addition to
publishing the British Medical Bulletin, a journal issued every four months and
intended primarily to keep overseas specialists informed of progress in medical
research in Britain, the Council maintains an extensive and much used specialist
information service. In countries in which the British Council is represented, libraries
are maintained and in many instances these have strong sections of scientific and
technological literature.
The British Council maintains at its headquarters specialist departments for
medicine and science (including agriculture and engineering), and scientists serve
on the staffs of a number of its overseas offices. The British Council is advised by
eminent scientists who serve on its Science Advisory Committee and on specialist
panels for the different subjects.
Communicating Results of Research
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and to ultimate
users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of information has
grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in which results are written
up into papers and published in journals, is still the main means of communication
among scientists. The leading learned societies have for long been important agencies
for communicating scientific information.
Both the DSIR and the AEA devote considerable sums to information services.
Besides its own publications and services, DSIR gives financial support to ASLIB (the
Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux), which runs a technical
information department and maintains a panel of translators and a Commonwealth
Index of Translations covering scientific subjects. A new National Lending Library
for Science and Technology (NLL), which started operations under the DSIR at
Boston Spa, Yorkshire, in 1961, came into full operation in 1962. It covers all subjects
in science and technology (other than some branches of medicine) and is also res¬
ponsible for increasing the volume of translations of foreign (especially of Russian and
Chinese) scientific literature, in which work it collaborates with the National Science
Foundation of the United States.
Besides information services provided by its various groups, the AEA hasr an
information centre and an isotope information bureau at its London headquarters.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux provide
abstracts and an information service in various branches of agricultural science. The
ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in Progress, and gives an account of
current developments in its annual reports. The advisory services of the agricultural
departments bring research results directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and periodicals;
but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles in its annual reports.
A national Reference Library for Science and Invention is to be formed out of the
Patent Office Library; it will be part of the British Museum Library. Work on a new
building for it will be begun in London on the south bank of the Thames in 1963, and
should be finished by the end of 1965.
Development Agencies
Several agencies assist in the commercial development and spread the use of new
inventions.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
225
National Research Development Corporation
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the Board
of Trade in 1949 under the Development of Inventions Act, 1948. Its primary function
is to develop and exploit, in the public interest, inventions resulting from research
carried out by Government departments and other public bodies. It may also develop
and exploit an invention from any other source where, in the Corporation s view, the
public interest requires it. Under the Development of Inventions Act, i954> NRDC
may promote 01 assist research to meet specific practical requirements, or may assist
the continuation of research which may lead to inventions of practical importance.
It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by the Board of Trade,
with powers, under the Development of Inventions Act, 1958, to borrow from Govern¬
ment funds to a total of £10 million up to 1968. Projects sponsored by the Corporation
include among many others such varied items as electronic digital computers, towed
flexible barges (known as dracones), interferon (an anti-virus agent), selective weed¬
killers, a new form of transport known as the hovercraft, a hydrogen-oxygen fuel
cell as a transportable source of electricity and a group of new antibiotics called
cephalosporins. The Corporation has a substantial annual income from the exploitation
of inventions.
Technical Development Capital Limited
A new private financial institution, Technical Development Capital Limited, was
formed in January 1962 to help to bring technical developments to the profitable stage.
It has a capital of £2 million, raised from insurance companies, merchant banks and
other institutions in Britain, Canada and Australia. Up to the end of March 1962 the
new company had already considered 100 out of 250 applications received.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
This section will not attempt to discuss current trends in the arts or the work of
individual British painters, sculptors, authors or musicians, but will try,to give a
summary of official and unofficial assistance in the preservation of Britain’s cultural
heritage and the encouragement of the arts today.
There is no equivalent to a Ministry of Fine Arts to formulate and administer
policy in the arts; but bodies such as the Standing Commission on Museums and
Galleries and the Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland
act in an advisory capacity. Government interest is expressed mainly through the
provision of grants to the Arts Council, the British Council (see footnote on p. 176),
the British Film Institute, the Council of Industrial Design, and other organisations,
and also to museums and art galleries.
Government expenditure on the arts is now over £9 million a year. Of this total, over
£31 million is the cost of upkeep of the national art collections in museums and art
galleries, over ^2 million the amount of the grant to the Arts Council, and more than
j£i million is expenditure on preserving historic houses and their contents.
Municipalities, large and small, also play their part in sustaining the arts. Under
the Local Government Act of 1948 they may use part of their revenue from rates
(see p. 77) for this purpose; they also have powers which permit capital expenditure
on new buildings for the arts, and can make grants to schools of art, music and drama.
As a rule local councils refrain from actual management of orchestras and theatre
companies (usually having a representative on the governing boards or trusts con¬
cerned), but they often provide the arenas for the performance of music or drama.
226
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Northern Ireland, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts
(CEMA) receives a grant from the Northern Ireland Government of £29,000
plus up to a maximum of £7,500 on a £ for £ basis on contributions from local
authorities.
Unofficial institutions concerned with the promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, among them the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust,
the Pilgrim Trust, the United Kingdom branch of the Calouste Gulbenkian Founda¬
tion, and a large number of societies, associations and other organisations concerned
with separate aspects of the arts; examples are mentioned later in this chapter.
Industrial patronage has increased considerably in recent years.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter in 1946.
It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Its main duties are to increase the accessibility of the fine arts to
the public, to improve the standard of execution in the fine arts, and to advise and
to co-operate with Government departments, local authorities and other organisations
on any matter connected with these aims. The corresponding body in Northern
Ireland is CEMA, the board of which consists of the president and vice-president,
four members nominated by the Minister of Education for Northern Ireland, four by
the Senate of Queen’s University, and six elected by the Association of CEMA.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913 by the late Andrew
Carnegie. It was incorporated under Royal Charter in 1917. The trust, which was
initially founded for ‘the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the people
of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 25 life trustees, six trustees nominated by
the Corporation of Dunfermline and three trustees nominated by the Fife County
Council. Its cultural policies include the support of adult amateur activities in music,
drama and the visual arts. It also assists non-national museums. Grants totalling
£26,576 were made for these purposes during the year ended 31st December, 1961.
The Pilgrim Trust was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen Harkness, an
American citizen. The trust, which has an income of about £210,000 a year, is
administered by a body of trustees who are empowered to make grants towards
any legally charitable object within the United Kingdom. In fact, the greater part
of the trust’s income is at present being used to help to preserve the nation’s heritage
of architecture and history, and for the advancement of learning and the arts. The
grants made for these objects during 1961 amounted to £197,000.
The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon was established in 1955 under the
will of the late Calouste Gulbenkian. A branch in the United Kingdom is responsible
for the Foundation’s activities in Britain and in other Commonwealth countries.
During 1961 the Foundation made grants totalling £148,000 for the arts in Britain, and
continued to implement the policy proposed in the report, Help for the Arts, prepared
for the Foundation in 1959 by a small private committee under the chairmanship
of Lord Bridges.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government, voluntary
bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine. The most outstanding
example is the Edinburgh Festival Society; other Arts Festivals which have developed
a similar basis of responsibility are those of York, Leeds, King’s Lynn and Norwich.
A notable example in regional co-operation in arts patronage has been set by the
North Eastern Arts Council: it combines representatives of local councils, chambers

of commerce, Tees and Tyneside Television Co., universities, industrial firms and
trade unions.
VISUAL ARTS
A number of modern British painters and sculptors now have a high international
reputation, established partly through the organisation of exhibitions on an unpre¬
cedented scale throughout Europe and America since the second world war. In addition,
they have received international prizes, and commissions for major works in foreign
cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home has been stimulated by an
increasingly lively attitude towards display on the part of museums and galleries, and
by exhibition programmes and the varied activities of many institutions, societies
and private galleries. While it would be untrue to say that there is a general apprecia¬
tion of contemporary art, interest and curiosity are growing, generated, partly at
least, by the high prices fetched by certain works of art at auction.
The art schools are full and young artists find it easier to exhibit and sell their
work than was formerly the case.
Painting and sculpture receive State support by grants to national institutions and,
indirectly, through grants made to the Arts Council, to municipal art galleries and
museums, and to local education authorities for art schools and other means of pro¬
moting education in art.
In the year April 1961 to the end of March 1962 the Arts Council arranged 76
separate art exhibitions in Great Britain; 294 showings of these exhibitions were
given in 160 different centres. In Northern Ireland, 43 exhibitions were arranged
by CEMA. Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council
by means of exhibitions, the dissemination of reproductions and photographs, lectures,
and the provision of information and advice to inquirers abroad and to visitors in
Britain. In the year ended March 1962, 39 fine art exhibitions organised by the Council
were shown in 46 countries. The Council was also responsible for British participation
in seven international exhibitions. Since 1948, 35 international awards have been won
by British artists.
Museums and Art Galleries
There are in all about 900 museums and art galleries open to the public in the
United Kingdom, though many are only small collections or merely a few rooms
set aside in a public building for the display of local treasures.
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain between
them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic, archaeological, scientific,
historical and general interest ever to exist within one city. The British Museum
has unparalleled collections of archaeological and ethnographical material from every
part of the world, in addition to housing the national library of printed books, manu¬
scripts, newspapers and periodicals; its Department of Prints and Drawings also
possesses collections of the widest extent and richness. The Victoria and Albert
Museum contains works of fine and applied art of all countries and periods, arranged
mainly according to material, though primary collections have been arranged to bring
together, by style, period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National
Gallery houses paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The Tate Gallery
embodies two collections: the British school from the eighteenth century onwards,
with a few earlier works, and modern foreign schools (since 1850). Both sections
include modern sculpture. Frequent loan exhibitions are held in the Tate Gallery.
Other important collections in London are at the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the Public
228
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Record Office Museum, which contains Domesday Book and other famous historical
documents, the Guildhall Museum, the London Museum in Kensington Palace,
where the collection illustrates the history of the capital, and the Wallace Collection
at Hertford House (furniture, armour, objets d'art and paintings, mainly French works
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries). In the summer of 1962 a small but
important art gallery was opened in part of Buckingham Palace for exhibitions of
pictures from the extensive Royal collections.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration of the Victoria
and Albert Museum and the Science Museum.1 The other national collections are
run by trustee bodies. All are financed from Government funds. Besides meeting
the administrative costs, this finance takes the form of annual purchase grants, which
have recently been substantially increased, and of special ad hoc purchase grants. The
collections may also receive certain pre-eminent works of art acquired by the
Treasury in lieu of estate duty. The buildings are maintained by the Ministry
of Public Building and Works.
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Royal
Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish United
Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which was opened
to the public in i960. The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a bianch at
St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed. The Ulster Folk
Museum is sited close to Belfast. The former City of Belfast Museum and Art Gallery,
now known as the Ulster Museum, has recently been transferred from civic to national
control and is administered by a statutory body receiving financial aid from the
Government of Northern Ireland. In addition, a small Belfast gallery under the
control of CEMA promotes exhibitions by contemporary painters and craftsmen.
The Government is advised on questions relating to the most effective development
of the national institutions as a whole, and on their co-operation with provincial
institutions, by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries, set up in 1931-
The Standing Commission publishes periodic reports.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some wealthy collector
in the past has bequeathed his treasures. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in
museums—the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, is the oldest in the
country and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a notable
collection of engravings, manuscripts and books bequeathed by its founder on his
death in 1861. Other universities have notable collections, primarily for teaching
purposes but also open to the public. Other cities with important museums and art
galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester,
Norwich, Southampton, and York where the Castle Museum, with its complete
reconstruction of an eighteenth-century street of shops, offers a most interesting
historical display. The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum at Coventry, the first major
art gallery to be built in the provinces since I939> was °Pened in I9^°* recent
years there has been a notable development of ‘period-house museums , for which
outstanding private residences of former times have been taken over by national and
municipal authorities, as at Temple Newsam, Leeds; Aston Hall, Birmingham; and
the Royal Pavilion, Brighton. Private art collections are to be seen in the historic

family mansions (including many in the ownership of the National Trust) which are
now open to the public at certain times.
In 1959 the first area museum council in Britain was inaugurated for the south-west,
and a similar organisation for the Midlands was started in 1961. The objects of such
councils are to promote closer co-operation between museums and art galleries in the
region, to improve technical facilities, and to provide financial assistance.
Financial assistance for improving the displays of the smaller museums is among
the functions of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has done much to
encourage the growth of the museum movement during the past thirty years, and at
present spends an average of ^10,000 a year for this purpose. The Victoria and Albert
Museum also administers an annual Government grant of £25,000 to help local
museums and art galleries to buy works of art for their collections.
The Museums Association, founded in 1889, is an independent organisation to
which museums and art galleries and their staffs throughout the country belong;
there are also many overseas members. The association serves as a central body for
the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating to museum adminis¬
tration, and as a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions Bureau,
and the Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum are a regular
feature of many museums.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy, which,
in summer, holds exhibitions of works by members and non-members and, in winter,
exhibitions usually devoted to national schools of painting or to the art of a particular
period; the Royal Scottish Academy; the Society of Scottish Artists; the Royal Society
of British Artists; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; the Royal
Society of Portrait Painters; the Artists’ International Association; the Women’s
International Art Club; and the London Group (all the foregoing are associations of
professional painters); and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Some of these societies,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in London.
In Northern Ireland there are the Royal Ulster Academy of Arts, the Ulster Society of
Women Artists and the Ulster Arts Club. Among regional societies are the Newlyn
Society of Artists, the Midland Group of Artists (Nottingham), the Birmingham Society
of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts, while an increasing number of amateur
art societies throughout the United Kingdom hold local exhibitions and encourage
local interest in the fine arts in a variety of ways. The Contemporary Art Society
uses its members’ subscriptions to buy modern works which it presents to the
public galleries.
Exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the
year in the galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in the Bond Street area).
The Whitechapel Art Gallery shows a series of important exhibitions in the East
End of London; and the London County Council has shown an exhibition of modern
sculpture in one of its parks every third year since the second world war. John Moore’s
exhibition, which takes place in Liverpool every two years, is open to all British
painters and sculptors and sets a high professional standard; important prizes are
awarded. There are also exhibitions of children’s art, including the National Exhibition
of Children’s Art sponsored annually by the Sunday Pictorial.
Art Education
There are 15 regional colleges of art in the United Kingdom, all of which offer
courses in most branches of art and a varying range of crafts; and there are schools
230
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of art in nearly all the larger towns. In London, the most notable of these schools and
colleges are the Royal College of Art (a national college) and the Central School of
Arts and Crafts of the London County Council, in both of which the emphasis is on
industrial design, and the Slade School of Fine Arts in the University of London. At
the Royal Academy Schools, founded in 1768, all instruction is provided free by
Royal Academicians.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history of art
are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of Classical
Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg Institute
(also a part of London University) which provides facilities for research on the
character and history of the classical tradition.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society for
Education through Art, among its other activities, encourages the purchase by schools
of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition.
The Arts Council operates a loan scheme for reproductions of works of art which is
used extensively by schools.
Industrial Design
The Council of Industrial Design was set up in 1944 by the President of the Board
of Trade as a grant-aided body with the purpose of promoting the improvement
of design in the products of British industry. The council has 28 members, a majority
being prominent industrialists, and there is a separate Scottish committee.
The council runs a permanent exhibition, The Design Centre, in the Haymarket,
London. This is a selective, changing display of well-designed British consumer
goods in current production. To supplement this display, an illustrated record of
good design, known as Design Index, is maintained at the Centre. A maximum of
20 Design Centre awards are presented annually to the makers of outstanding products
shown in the Centre during the previous year. In 1959 an additional award was
instituted, the Duke of Edinburgh’s Prize for Elegant Design which is now presented
annually to the designer of a single product chosen from the Index. Permanent design
exhibitions opened in Bristol in 1958 and in Nottingham in i960: both these function
independently. The Scottish Design Centre opened in Glasgow in 1957. The council
also organises conferences, courses and exhibitions in Britain and overseas, and
maintains a record of designers and a photographic and reference library on industrial
design. It has an education section and a retail section and publishes a monthly
magazine, Design.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of Arts
(see p. 205), the Society of Industrial Artists, which is the representative professional
body in Great Britain of designers engaged in industry and commerce, and the Design
and Industries Association (DIA), founded in 1915. The DIA is a voluntary association
of industrial companies, designers, and other bodies and individuals interested in the
promotion of good design in industry.
Architecture
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with encouraging
the best in new building and preserving the best that has been inherited from the past.
The Government departments chiefly concerned with domestic architecture are
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Scottish Development Depart¬
ment, and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Government, which
are responsible in their respective countries for approving the layout and design of
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
231
local authority housing schemes, and which issue reports and circulars setting standards
for local authority housing. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is concerned
with the design, construction and maintenance of Government civil buildings and also
with the preservation of historic buildings and ancient monuments in Great Britain.
In Northern Ireland responsibility for the preservation of ancient buildings is vested
in the Ministry of Finance. All these departments have architects on their staffs, as
have also the local authorities concerned with housing and planning.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions exist to
further the interests of architecture and the preservation of buildings of aesthetic
value or historic interest.
Several State-sponsored organisations are concerned with special aspects of archi¬
tecture. The Royal Fine Art Commission (appointed in 1924) and the Royal Fine
Art Commission for Scotland (appointed in 1927) advise Government departments,
planning authorities, and other public bodies on questions of public amenity or artistic
importance; many large-scale modern buildings have had the approval of the com¬
missions. The National Buildings Record maintains a library (open to the public for
consultation) of over half a million photographs of English and Welsh architecture
and an index of architectural records in public and private possession. The Scottish
National Buildings Record carries out similar functions. The Royal Commissions on
Ancient and Historical Monuments for England, for Wales and Monmouthshire, and
for Scotland, record in detail all ancient and historical remains in their countries and
publish a series of surveys, designed ultimately to cover the whole of Great Britain.
The Ancient Monuments Boards for England, Scotland, and Wales, set up under the
Ancient Monuments Acts, consider which monuments should be listed in accordance
with those Acts and advise the Minister of Public Building and Works on any questions
concerning ancient monuments. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Finance
administers the Ancient Monuments Acts (Northern Ireland) and is advised by the
Ancient Monuments Advisory Council. The Historic Buildings Councils for England,
Scotland, and Wales, constituted under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments
Act, 1953, advise the Minister of Public Building and Works on the provision of grants
towards the repair and maintenance of such buildings (see p. 188). The Historic
Buildings Council for Scotland also advises the Secretary of State for Scotland on the
exercise of his functions relating to buildings of architectural or historic interest under
the planning Acts. An Historic Buildings Bureau finds new uses for unoccupied historic
buildings of outstanding interest.
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom is the
Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) to which are allied 48 autonomous
architectural societies covering the whole of the United Kingdom and most of the
overseas Commonwealth. The Royal Institute has a membership of over 20,000, and
some 5,000 students. It has one of the largest and most important architectural
libraries in the world, housing over 65,000 books and periodicals and many thousands
of drawings. The RIBA holds an annual conference and is concerned with a wide
range of activities covering professional practice, science, technology, statistics,
architectural competitions, professional and public relations. It arranges lectures,
symposia and discussions on a variety of subjects, presents exhibitions and through its
Board of Architectural Education controls the training and examination of architects.
The Royal Gold Medal for Architecture is awarded annually by the Queen on the
recommendation of the RIBA.
Education in architecture in the United Kingdom is given at 28 Schools of Archi¬
tecture recognised for exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and Final examinations
232
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and one recognised for the Intermediate examination only. In addition, there are
42 schools of art and technical institutes (nine full-time) which prepare students for
the external examinations of the RIBA.
It is against the law for any person to practise or carry out work under any name,
style or title containing the word ‘architect’ unless he or she is registered. The statutory
body which regulates registration is the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. The principal professional associations of architects are the Incorporated
Association of Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects, the
Faculty of Architects and Surveyors, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland,
and the Royal Society of Ulster Architects. Other societies include the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of societies interested in particular
aspects of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The Civic Trust, established in 1957, seeks to promote high standards in archi¬
tecture and civic planning and to encourage a wider interest in the appearance of
towns, villages and the countryside. In 1959 the Trust introduced a system of awards
for good architectural design, to be given in two classes; the first for planning develop¬
ments, such as housing estates, the second for smaller projects, for example, shop fronts.
Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group, a society designed to
awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save Georgian buildings from des¬
truction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; and the National Trust
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scotland, which
together own more than a hundred houses of historic or architectural interest, many
of which contain pictures and other works of art. Most of these houses, and other
ancestral homes, are open to the public at a small charge and attract large numbers
of visitors. The Treasury also makes use of its powers to accept historic houses and
their more important contents in lieu of death duties. Such properties are normally
administered by the National Trust. The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was
formed in 1952 under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Canterbury, in order
to raise funds to supplement the efforts of parishes to put their churches into good
repair. By the end of 1961, it had made available sums totalling £545,889 to 1,287
churches and chapels of various religious denominations.
LITERATURE
A knowledge of literature is fostered in the United Kingdom by the schools,
colleges and universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taught
either as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject is
thereafter maintained by the libraries, by the very large number of private literary
societies (both national and local), by book reviews in the press and on the radio, and
by the numerous periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature. State
support for literature is given through the Arts Council and the British Council.
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary prizes, a
number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the two James Tait Black Mem¬
orial prizes for biography and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize
for young writers of promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the
Library Association Carnegie Medal for an outstanding book for children, the Kate
Greenaway Medal for the best children’s book illustration and the Somerset Maugham
award for young writers. The Arts Council makes triennial awards for the best books
of poetry published; it also encourages poetry readings and subsidises the Poetry
Book Society.

Libraries
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (about
6^ million volumes). The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million volumes) is in
Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million volumes). Together
with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (2^ million volumes) and the Cambridge Univer¬
sity Library (about 2^ million volumes) these comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the
country and are entitled to receive a copy of each new book published in Britain:
the British Museum Library must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Other great libraries include1: the University of London Library,2 the libraries of
the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews, and Queen’s University
Library, Belfast; the London Library (the largest public subscription library) and
the John Rylands Library, Manchester; the Science Museum Library, the Victoria
and Albert Museum Art Library and the British Museum (Natural History) Library;
the Patent Office Library, the India Office Library, the National Lending Library for
Science and Technology and the Public Record Office (which contains the non-current
records of the superior courts of law and of most of the Government departments);
the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the British
Drama League, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Royal College of Music
and the Royal Academy of Music; the Central Music Library; and the National
Library for the Blind. The Arts Council has founded a reference and lending library of
modern English poetry, which is housed with the National Book League. The National
Register of Archives, maintained by the Historical Manuscripts Commission in the
Public Record Office building, contains particulars of numerous local and private
records.
The public libraries of Britain maintain a service throughout the country,
administered by 548 public library authorities (county councils, county borough
councils, municipal borough councils, urban district councils and a few parish councils).
Together these authorities provide more than 40,000 service points; they hold about
75 million books and make more than 441| million loans a year. (These figures do not
include the use made of libraries in the publicly maintained schools.) A feature of the
service in rural areas is the travelling van, which is an itinerant library. Over a quarter
of the total population are registered members of public libraries.
In addition to lending books, music scores and gramophone records, and providing
special facilities for, among others, children, patients in hospitals and prisoners,
public libraries engage in many other activities, such as play readings, lectures, film
shows, music circles and co-operation in university extension education.
A committee set up by the Minister of Education to examine the structure of the
public library service in England and Wales issued its report (known as the Roberts
report) in 1959. Its principal recommendations were that every public library authority
should have a statutory duty to provide an efficient library service; that the Minister
of Education should have general supervisory responsibilities and be assisted by an
advisory body in England and Wales; that non-county borough and urban district
councils which cannot satisfy the Minister that they are providing an efficient library
service should have their public library powers withdrawn; that greater co-operation
1 This list provides only an arbitrary selection of some of the largest libraries. Unless
otherwise stated these libraries are in London, where there are more than 500 libraries; and
see also pp. 206, 221, 224 and 231.
2 The total holding of all the libraries (college and special) of London University is about
3^ million volumes.

between libraries should be encouraged; and that libraries should be provided with
an increased staff of qualified and specialist librarians and, in many cases, with new
or improved premises. In 1961 two Working Parties were appointed by the Minister to
study the implications of these recommendations.
A feature of library services in Britain is the co-operation within the network of
libraries which greatly increases the value of the service. Library co-operation is
organised, in the first instance, through regional library bureaux, and is finally
centralised in the National Central Library with its widespread system of outlier
libraries (public, university and special), giving access to a total stock of some 100
million books and many thousand sets of periodicals. The Scottish Central Library
carries out, in Scotland, functions similar to those of the National Central Library.
Both Central Libraries are financed in part by Exchequer grants. In Northern Ireland,
as yet, there is no regional library bureau but access to the stocks of the National
Central Library, the Scottish Central Library and the Irish Central Library is available
on application to the Belfast public libraries, Queen’s University Library and the
county libraries.
The two principal organisations to which librarians belong are the Library Asso¬
ciation, with the affiliated Scottish Library Association, and the Association of Special
Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) (see p. 224). The Library Association
endeavours to unite librarians and governors of libraries throughout the world and
through its many meetings, conferences, personal service and publications, including
its official journal The Library Association Record, to provide for their general and
specialised professional interests.
In addition to the services provided by public libraries, many bookshops maintain
lending libraries for their customers.
Books
New books constitute the large majority of all books published annually in Britain.
In 1961 nearly 1,100 British publishers issued 24,893 separate titles, of which 18,487
were new books and the rest reprints or new editions. A feature of recent years has
been a great increase in the number of books of all kinds, both original works and new
or reprinted editions, published with paper covers (‘paper backs’).1
The above figures do not include Government publications by Her Majesty’s
Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisation in Britain; the great
majority of books, however, are produced by some 300 of the principal commercial
publishers, including the university presses, notably the Oxford University Press
(including the Clarendon Press) and the Cambridge University Press.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association, the Booksellers
Association, and the Society of Authors.
Literary and Philological Societies and Institutions
Societies and institutions concerned with the promotion of literature in its various
forms include: the National Book League, which encourages the reading of and an
interest in books, and which holds exhibitions, including annual exhibitions of book
design, and arranges exhibitions of books in some overseas countries; the English
Association, which aims at upholding the standard of English writing and speech;
and the Royal Society of Literature, which is concerned with the advancement of
1 For total sales and exports of books in 1961, see p. 323.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
235
literature. The British Academy, for the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and
Philological Studies is the leading society in Britain dealing with humanistic studies.
It receives a grant from the Treasury.
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society, the Apollo Society, the
Company of Nine, and other societies which sponsor poetry readings and recitals.
Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals, including the National
Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-Avon Festival of
Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Art and Literature, and ‘Poetry at the Mermaid’
week in London (launched by the Poetry Book Society in 1961).
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the Biblio¬
graphical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens Fellowship. There
are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book Society and the Poetry
Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new books to their members.
DRAMA
State patronage of the drama is expressed through the Arts Council (in Great
Britain) and CEMA (in Northern Ireland), which grant subsidies to certain theatrical
managements operating on a non-profit-distributing basis (i.e. using profits to finance
future productions), provided that such managements have given evidence of serious
aims and of consistently high standards of practical competence; and through the
British Council, which is responsible for making the British theatre better known
abroad by organising and sponsoring international tours by important companies,
including the Old Vic Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Com¬
pany, and by sending overseas lecturers on drama and exhibitions of theatrical design or
of books dealing with the British theatre. The Arts Council also operates a scheme
for the promotion of new drama whereby guarantees may be offered to managements
giving the first professional production of selected new plays; and promising authors
may be awarded bursaries. A similar scheme has been started to encourage stage
designers. Subsidies are also given for theatres to pass on to parties travelling to the
theatre from outlying districts.
Professional Theatre
There are about 250 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of theatrical activity
is in London, where there are some 40 principal theatres in the ‘West End’ and several
more in the suburbs. With the exception of five theatres—Covent Garden, Sadler s
Wells, the Old Vic, the Royal Court and the Mermaid—these are let to some 25 pro¬
ducing managements on a commercial basis for each production. The provincial
theatres are served by productions touring either before or after London presentation,
by companies specially formed for touring, and by local repertory companies. Since
the second world war several theatres in London and about a hundred in the provinces
have been closed. On the other hand, several new theatres have been opened in recent
years, both in London and the provinces. The Mermaid Theatre, the first to be built in
London for 25 years, was opened in i959> as was completely reconstructed Queen s
Theatre; the Royalty Theatre opened in i960 (but was used as a cinema in 1961);
and another new London theatre, the Prince Charles, is being built. The first full-
scale theatre to be built by a civic authority since 1939, the Belgrade Theatre, was
opened in Coventry in 1958, and smaller theatres have been opened in Middles¬
brough and Whitehaven (Cumberland). New civic theatres have been, or are being,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
236
built in Nottingham, Croydon, Eastbourne and Torquay, and others are planned for
Guildford, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Manchester, Birmingham and Leicester; and a
festival theatre, with an open stage, opened in 1962 at Chichester (Sussex). Plans are
in hand for the construction on the south bank of the Thames, in London, of a National
Theatre, with which will be associated an opera house which will provide a new home
for Sadler’s Wells. Under the terms of the National Theatre Act, 1949, the Treasury
will provide ^1 million towards the capital cost of the National Theatre. Any addi¬
tional expenditure on the two buildings, up to a limit of ^1-3 million, will be met by
the London County Council (LCC). Both the Treasury and the LCC will provide
annual subventions towards the running costs of the two theatres.
In addition to managements which rent theatres, there are a number of companies
which produce plays in theatres of their own. Among the best known of these organisa¬
tions are the Old Vic Theatre Company in London and the Royal Shakespeare Com¬
pany at Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1956 the English Stage Company was established
at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where it presents contemporary plays. Theatre
Workshop, formed in 1945, has since 1953 performed classical and contemporary
plays at the Theatre Royal, Stratford, London (except for a period of a year from the
end of 1961 when the theatre was leased to another company). Local repertory com¬
panies (many of which are assisted financially and otherwise by the Arts Council or,
in Northern Ireland, by CEMA) may have the use of their own theatres (as in Bristol,
Lincoln, Liverpool, Nottingham, Salisbury, Perth, Belfast and Birmingham) or may
rent them from a local authority. A number of companies also exist especially to tour
the smaller towns and villages, playing from one to several nights in each place and
using any building which can be made suitable for the purpose. A large number of
organisations present children’s plays in London and the provinces. The National
Youth Theatre, consisting of schoolboy actors, has its own centre in London but also
presents Shakespearean productions in the provinces and abroad. The Open Air
Theatre in Regent’s Park, London, has presented many summer seasons of repertory,
mainly plays of Shakespeare and other poetic drama. The Ulster Group Theatre
in Belfast specialises in Ulster comedy; the Belfast Arts Theatre, specialising in
international drama, has now become the Belfast Arts Theatre Trust and has moved
to a new building where Irish plays will also be presented. Both these theatres are
subsidised by CEMA. The Lyric Players Theatre, a non-profit-making organisation,
under a board of trustees, presents Irish and international drama, and plans to build
a small theatre in or near Belfast. Inevitably, the work of repertory companies varies
in quality but, generally speaking, the standard of both production and acting is high:
London managements watch their activities and may bring repertory company pro¬
ductions to the West End. Many of the leading dramatists, producers, designers,
actors and actresses in the United Kingdom started their careers in repertory.
Theatre clubs for regular patrons are run in connection with some of the company-
owned theatres. Where seats are sold only to theatre club members (for instance, the
Arts Theatre, London), the plays are not subject to the provisions of the Theatres
Act, 1843. This Act deals with the licensing of theatres and plays and requires all new
plays to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain,1 who may forbid the presentation of
any play ‘for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or of the public peace’.
The number of plays for which a licence is refused amounts to under one per cent of
the total submitted.
1 The Lord Chamberlain, whose office dates from the fourteenth century, is the senior officer
of the Royal Household.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
237
Both in London and in the provinces, most managers and artists are members of
one or another of the professional organisations which exist to maintain the standards
of the professional theatre, to regulate the industry and to promote and safeguard the
welfare of those who work in it. Organisations of this kind include the London 1 heatre
Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West End Managers, the
Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory Theatres, British Actors
Equity (the actors’ trade union), and the League of Dramatists. The trade union of
theatre staffs is the National Association of Theatrical and Kine Employees.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the history
and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre Institute has a British
centre in London. Its headquarters are in Paris and there are 40 member countries.
The main purpose of the institute is to foster international goodwill and understanding
by interchange of students, theatrical companies, theatre personnel and all theatrical
information. The British centre’s committee is composed of representatives of the
Arts Council, British Council, League of British Dramatists, British Drama League,
Conference of Repertory Theatres and representatives of the theatre.
The Arts Council is co-ordinating plans for the celebration in 1964 of the quater-
centenary of Shakespeare’s birth.
Amateur Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout the United Kingdom;
there are thousands of amateur dramatic societies, with an active membership of
some half a million. The movement is sponsored and fostered by local education
authorities, by other public bodies, and by five special organisations—the British
Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations, the Scottish Com¬
munity Drama Association, the Ulster Drama League and the Association of Ulster
Drama Festivals. Amateur companies which stage productions in their own theatres
(for instance, the Maddermarket Theatre in Norwich) belong to the Little Theatre
Guild of Great Britain.
The British Drama League, founded in 1919, operates on a basis of affiliation and
individual membership. Its services include the arrangement of courses, lectures and
competitions in dramatic work; the provision of a library, which has the largest
collection in Britain of plays and books on the theatre, and an information bureau;
and advice on such matters as play-writing, production, stage management and the
organisation of drama festivals. The work of the Standing Conference is mainly that
of co-ordination between the various bodies concerned in the amateur dramatic move¬
ment. Functions similar to those of the league and the conference in England and
Wales are fulfilled in Scotland by the Scottish Community Drama Association, which
receives some financial assistance from the Scottish Education Department.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have famous dramatic societies, and
there are drama clubs and societies in many other universities and colleges.
Dramatic Training
Dramatic training is provided mainly in the dramatic schools and institutions
established throughout the United Kingdom. Among the most important are the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (which is grant-aided by the Treasury, and which
provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Guildhall School of
Music and Drama, the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, the Rose
Bruford School and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, all of which
are in or near London; and the Old Vic School in Bristol.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
238
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many schools and youth
clubs in Britain, and a varying degree of recognition is given to the subject in the
universities. The University of London offers a Diploma in Dramatic Art; and Bristol
University has created a department of drama offering a course which an arts student
may take as part of a general degree course. From October 1962 Manchester University
is offering courses in drama for Honours or General Arts degree students, and also a
diploma course in Theatrecraft (embracing sound and television broadcasting). In 1959
Bristol inaugurated the International Festival of University Theatre now held annually
in Britain.
The popularity of plays on radio and television has provided increased opportunities
not only for established artists but also, particularly in regional studios, for young
actors and actresses.
FILMS
Although cinema attendance has been declining in recent years (attendances at
cinemas in the United Kingdom dropped from 1,101 million in 1956 to 460 million in
1961) and the number of cinemas in Great Britain decreased by about i,55° between
1956 and 1961, there were, at the beginning of 1962, about 2,720 cinemas in Great
Britain (with a total of about 2*85 million seats).
About 10 per cent of British first feature films are made, and between 25 and 35 per
cent are distributed, by the two large amalgams, the Rank Organisation and the Asso¬
ciated British Picture Corporation, which have companies for production, distribution
and exhibition. Most producers who are independent of either group make films in
association with other film distributors. There are numerous companies (many of
them small) which produce short films.
Cinematograph films were first shown to the public in Britain in 1896, and within
ten years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early ascendancy did
not survive the impact of the first world war and, since i9I4> British films have had
to contend at home as well as abroad with keen American competition.
During the second world war the British cinema re-emerged with new vitality and
began again to exert an important influence by the production of many notable feature
films depicting Britain’s ordeals and achievements. These films were based on the
documentary technique which had been developed in Britain from the early 1930s.
British feature films in the post-war years were influenced by this trend, and realistic
treatment became a characteristic of British feature production, both in dramatic films
and in the light-hearted satirical comedies that won international acclaim.
In recent years this talent for realism has been successfully employed in feature
films reflecting current social problems or based on war experiences. London is one of
the most important centres for the making of films for international markets and export
earnings are an important part of total earnings. British films, actors and creative
and technical talent are appreciated abroad as well as at home and frequently achieve
success at international film events. The British Film Producers Association and the
Federation of British Film Makers are the two trade associations to which many
feature film producers belong.
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to 1929)
when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive and imaginative
kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial organisations. The war
years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then, British documentary technicians
have continued to produce high quality factual films which have won numerous
international awards. The Association of Specialised Film Producers, the trade
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
239
association of documentary and specialised film makers, has over 70 members, and
there are many other, non-member, companies. An interesting recent development
has been the attempt to re-interpret the documentary tradition in contemporary terms
by a group of young technicians—the Free Cinema movement and by the television
film units of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent Television
Authority contractors.
The Government has continued to sponsor a wide range of information films and
film material. These are produced through the film, television and newsreel services
of the Central Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by
private companies and by the television and newsreel organisations. Documentary
films, television programmes and newsreels are produced to inform audiences overseas
about British life and achievement. These, together with other films acquired from
private industry and public bodies, are distributed throughout the world, in English
and many foreign languages, by British Information Services.
The films produced by the COI for Government departments have included
many specialised films on science, agriculture, health and industry. Films for industry,
produced by the Government, the British Productivity Council and private firms,
have helped to increase productivity; to the same end, many hundreds of industrial
films from other countries have been evaluated, and the best of them made available
to industrial audiences through the COFs Central Film Library1 and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee, set up in 1936 and revived in 1954 by the
Scottish Council (Development and Industry) in consultation with the Secretary of
State for Scotland, promotes the production of Scottish films covering the industries
and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Films from abroad made in languages other than English often draw large audiences
in London and a few other large cities, but are rarely shown throughout the country.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute,
founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant. The Institute
encourages the making and showing of good films and helps the public to appreciate
them Similar work is undertaken in Scotland by the Scottish Film Council, which is
also financed in part by an Exchequer grant. The British Film Institute administers
the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film Archive, runs an annual
summer school, and maintains a film library from which films may be hired, a library
of books on the film and an information service. The Institute also makes grants to
the Scientific Film Association, the University Film Council and the Society for
Education in Film and Television, and administers a fund for the production of
experimental films. _ ,
The National Film Archive contains over 7,000 films, excluding newsreels and other
miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and 464,000 photographic
stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the film and as significant social
and historical records. .
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames, in London, shows
films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it holds a unique position
as a cinema offering regular programmes unrestricted by commercial considerations
or by the age or nationality of the films shown.
The Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in 1958 by the amalgamation of
the British Film Academy and the Guild of Television Producers and Directors, has

tions films on many specialised subjects.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
as its aim to improve the standard of film and television production and to stimulate
public appreciation of the arts.
Assistance to British Film Producers
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and needs adequate financial backing com¬
bined with freedom for the film-maker to experiment and to express his own ideas.
There is no State-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National Film
Finance Corporation, a statutory body set up in 1949, is empowered to lend money
for film production. Its members—a chairman, a managing director and three to five
others—are appointed by the Board of Trade. Its funds (limited by statute to £8 million)
are provided up to £6 million by advances from the Board of Trade; the remaining
£2 million may be borrowed from non-Governmental sources. The Corporation is
financially concerned with about half the first feature films being made in British
studios.
There is a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund. The money
so raised is paid out as a percentage of a film’s takings, so that the more successful a
film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the fund. Started by the industry
in 1950 on a voluntary basis, the scheme became statutory under the Cinematograph
Films Act, 1957, which gave the President of the Board of Trade powers to make
regulations governing the collection, by the Board of Customs and Excise, of a levy
from exhibitors, and the distribution of the proceeds for the benefit of British film
production. The British Film Fund Agency undertakes the distribution.
To help British films meet the keen American competition, legislation passed in
1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent legislation), under
which a certain proportion of British films must be shown in British cinemas each
year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade annually after consultation with
the Cinematograph Films Council, any change being effected by statutory instrument
approved by both Houses of Parliament. For first feature films it has stood at 30 per
cent since 1950.
Cinema Licensing and Film Censorship
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but, by virtue of
their power to grant licences, the local licensing authorities act as the final arbiters
of films proposed for showing in their areas. There are over 700 licensing authorities;
they are local authorities or, in some areas, magistrates. The Cinematograph Act
of 1909 required, for reasons of safety, that inflammable films should be shown only
on premises licensed for the purpose; it was subsequently established that licensing
authorities had the right to supervise the character of the films exhibited. In judging
the suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an independent
body, the British Board of Film Censors, to which are submitted all films (other than
newsreels) intended for public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of the
cinema industry, which wished to ensure that a proper standard was maintained
in the films offered to the public. It consists of a president, a secretary, and five
examiners (including two women) appointed by the president who is elected by a
trade committee and is usually a man prominent in public life.
The Board, which does not use any written code of censorship, may require cuts
to be made before it will grant a certificate to a film ; very rarely, it will refuse a
certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed in one of three categories: ‘U’
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
24I
(suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more suitable for adults than children) and
‘X’ (suitable only for adults). A child or young person under 16 years of age may be
admitted to a cinema showing an ‘A’ film only if accompanied by a responsible adult,
and may not be admitted on any condition if an ‘X’ film is being shown.
Children and the Cinema
The Cinematograph Act, 1952, which came into force in January i95^> extended
the scope of the 1909 Act and provided for the making of regulations by the Home
Secretary to protect the health and welfare of children attending film shows. Cinemas
which give children’s shows require a special licence from the licensing authority,
which may impose special conditions. The British Board of Film Censors publishes at
intervals a list of films particularly suitable for children and for exhibition at children s
matinees. One of the women examiners is appointed for her special knowledge of
children’s needs.
Children’s cinema clubs, providing special programmes on Saturday mornings, are
widely organised by the cinema groups and have become very popular. An important
contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film Foundation,
which produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children.
The foundation is a non-profit-making body set up by the British film industry in
1951 and under the Cinematograph Films Act, 1957, it receives grants from the
British Film Fund Agency.
MUSIC, OPERA AND BALLET
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and music
festivals, orchestral concerts, choral singing, brass bands, opera and ballet are
important features of British cultural life.
Tours abroad by British orchestras, soloists, and opera and ballet companies are
sometimes assisted financially by the British Council, which sponsors some record¬
ings of works by British composers, and maintains libraries of British music (scores
and records) in about 70 countries overseas. At the Council’s London headquarters
a reference library of records, scores, and books on music is maintained, and musicians
from abroad are sometimes invited to Britain as the Council’s guests, to gain first¬
hand experience of British music-making.
The National Music Council, representative of every aspect of British musical
activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council and UNESCO.
Music
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large towns
and cities of Britain, some of which have well-known concert halls. In London, the
principal concert halls are the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames,
opened in 1951 and used for both orchestral concerts and recitals; the Royal Albert
Hall, Kensington, where mainly orchestral concerts, including the annual summer
season of Promenade Concerts are given; and the Wigmore Hall,which is the principal
recital centre. In 1961 the London County Council announced plans for two small
concert halls to be built on the south bank of the Thames by 1964.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Symphony, the BBC
Symphony, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic, the Philharmonia,
the Halle (Manchester), the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the City of Birmingham
Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle-upon-
Tyne), the BBC Northern, the Scottish National and the BBC Scottish. There are
242
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
also the specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the Philomusica of London
and the London Mozart Players; and a number of new orchestras which have been
formed during the past few years. Many of these receive financial aid from the Arts
Council and local authorities to help with the cost of maintaining ensembles, of
presenting new or unfamiliar works, and of improving standards generally. The City
of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by the Belfast Corporation and the Council for
the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA).
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC Choral,
the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the
London Philharmonic Choir, the Philharmonia Chorus, the Bach Choir, the Royal
Edinburgh Choral Union and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. These and many other
choral societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works; most of
them, together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies and music
clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies, through which they
are supported with funds provided by the Arts Council. Membership of the National
Federation has risen to over 800 societies. Among societies which specialise in en¬
couraging the performance of the work of living musicians are the Society for the
Promotion of New Music, the Music Section of the Institute of Contemporary Arts
and Macnaghten Concerts.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held annually
in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in existence for over
200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably in recent years, and festivals
of music and other arts are now held annually in many cities and towns throughout
the United Kingdom. The famous Edinburgh International Festival of Music and
Drama lasts three weeks and attracts many thousands of visitors; other festivals such
as at King’s Lynn, last a week or less. Among the better known are the Royal National
Eisteddfod of Wales; the Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the National Gaelic
Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year; the Cheltenham Festival, largely
devoted to contemporary British music; the Aldeburgh Festival; the Bath Festival;
and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals of choral music, which are held on a triennial
basis. An annual international festival of folk song and dancing is held by the English
Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is increasing. It is encouraged by the work of
County Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The Rural Music
Schools Association is concerned with music-making by amateurs in country districts;
it brings together professional musicians, teachers, administrators and amateurs.
Professional organisations which look after the interests of music and musicians,
include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Composers’
Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Specialised education in music is given at colleges of music, of which the most
prominent are the Royal Academy of Music, and the Royal College of Music in
London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish Academy in Glasgow,
all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are also the Trinity College of Music and the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, both in London, and the School of Music in
Birmingham. Youth orchestras are strongly encouraged, and children s concerts,
given by symphony orchestras directed by prominent conductors, are a regular feature
1 Some of these are voluntary committees and some are local education authority
sub-committees.

of the country’s musical activities and have helped to develop among the youth of the
community an appreciation of the world’s greatest music. The National Youth
Orchestra of Great Britain and the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, made up of the
most promising members of school orchestras, are noted for their high standard of
performance, and so is the London Schools’ Symphony Orchestra. A ‘Youth and
Music’ organisation, affiliated to the continental ‘Jeunesses Musicales’, was established
in 1954 to encourage musical education and performances for young people. The
Students’ Orchestra of Great Britain, specially formed in 1958, 1959 and 1961 from
music students for performances abroad, has achieved great successes.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and about
125,200 candidates a year (children and other students) take the examinations of
the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest proportion (about
80,700) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The increase in musical appreciation among the general public during recent
years is shown not only by the size of the audiences for concerts and for broadcast
music, but also by the fact that of some 80 million gramophone record units sold
during 1961, the proportion of classical music was about one-quarter. The National
Federation of Gramophone Societies has some 370 affiliated societies.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library in its Buckingham
Palace Road library building, and many other public libraries have collections of
music that can be borrowed; some of them also lend out gramophone records.
Opera and Ballet
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London, leased by the Government1 to the Covent Garden Opera Trust,
which was formed in 1944 to make the famous opera house the home of a national
opera and ballet, and which receives a Government grant through the Arts Council.
The Royal Opera House has its own resident opera company and ballet company
which give performances both in London and elsewhere. The opera company, which
numbers about 200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes an annual tour of provincial
centres. The ballet company, incorporated in 1957 with the Sadler’s Wells Theatre
Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School to form the Royal Ballet, has a high international
reputation gained in many overseas tours.
Seasons of opera and ballet are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre m London;
with two permanent opera companies, Sadler’s Wells provides a full London season
and opera and operetta for 42 weeks in other centres. .
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international cast is
specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include the English
Opera Group, formed in 1947, and noted for its performances of operas by Benjamin
Britten; the New Opera Company, formed in 1957 by members of the Cambridge
Opera Group to produce new operas in London and give opportunities to promising
amateurs and young professionals; the Handel Opera Society; the Intimate Opera
Company, which performs works for very small casts in any hall available; and the
Welsh National Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Grand Opera Society of Northern Ireland and the Studio Opera Group, both receiving
a subsidy from CEMA. The Arts Council manages two small operatic groups (Opera
for All) which specialise in introducing opera to audiences in small towns who hitherto

have been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of amateur opera clubs in
London and the provinces, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, in Northern Ireland and in
universities.
Among the ballet companies are the Ballet Rambert, Britain’s oldest ballet company,
which has discovered many distinguished dancers and choreographers, London’s
Festival Ballet and an important new group, Western Theatre Ballet, that includes a
large proportion of contemporary works in its repertoire. The work of the Irish Ballet
Company in Northern Ireland, which is sponsored by CEMA, combines traditional
music, dancing and mime. The Royal Ballet, the Arts Educational, and the Rambert
Ballet Training Schools and the Royal Academy of Dancing are among the teaching
institutions which have played an important part in raising British ballet to its present
high standard.

THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
The United Kingdom ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world,
with about 0-18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, with slightly under
2 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks tenth. In density of population it is
fourth: of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands are more
crowded; and there are nine times as many people to the square mile in the United
Kingdom as in the United States. In world trade, it ranks second, accounting for about
one-tenth of the total. It takes about a fifth of the world’s exports of primary products,
and provides about one-sixth of the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
The United Kingdom, from its own soil, provides only half of the food it needs,
and—apart from coal and low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources; thus it
is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat, meat, butter, fodder grains,
citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber. In return, it is one of the world s
largest exporters of aircraft, locomotives, motor vehicles, electrical equipment,
chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. No other country has such a small
proportion of the working population engaged in agriculture (only slightly more than
4 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an area with
a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the sterling area use
sterling in their international transactions, and it is the currency in which about one-
third of the world’s trade is conducted.
The Economy before 1939
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world manu¬
facturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to support a rapidly
increasing population at a rising standard of living. It was Britain s commerce in
cotton goods, above all, which gave it the leading position in world trade; cotton
cloth provided 40 per cent of its exports in 1851. It was in this period also that the
country became so largely dependent on imports of foodstuffs and raw materials.
During the period from 1870 to 1890 British industrial expansion had the clearest
lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing industrial com¬
petition from Europe and North America began to make itself felt, but its effects on
Britain’s staple export industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by
the general rise in world trade, by the continued demand for British textiles from
India and other eastern countries, and by the continued high level of overseas
investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth century
became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and Japan, where
245
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
246
labour was cheaper, established themselves firmly in the large eastern markets, to a
great extent replacing the more expensive and often higher quality British products.
The extension of the world demand for coal was slowed down by the increasing use
of oil, while coal from the newer European mines competed keenly with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of industries
(for instance, locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world demand fell away after
a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of the
expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products (for example, cars
and electrical goods). Most countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some
sought deliberately to protect nascent and even established industries by tariffs and
(later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned the effect of a fall
in the volume of exports, and imports remained high. The loss of export markets led,
however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple industries—coal, cotton, iron and steel,
and the older branches of engineering. The result was heavy unemployment, the general
rate of which averaged 14 per cent of the working population in the years 1921-39,
reaching a peak of 22 per cent in i932> w^en the slump in world trade was at its worst.
In districts relying mainly on one or other of the staple industries, the rate was much
higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment took place,
stimulated by an increase in home investment which was aided by the policy of cheap
money, by some revival in world trade and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
The decade saw a strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemicals and aircraft
industries, while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth
in the building and ancillary industries. By 1937 average real income per head was
about 14 per cent higher than in 1929.
Effects of the Second World War
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic capital by
about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial
maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in considerable alterations in Britain’s
financial and trading position. These included the sale of £1,000 million worth of
overseas investments, nearly half in North America, and the accumulation of new
external debts of £3,000 million. Exports had fallen by 1944 as a resu^ the war
effort to less than one-third of their 1938 volume while there had been a sharp adverse
movement in the terms of trade as a result of the shortage of imported raw materials.
On the credit side, there was the large volume of fixed investment in the munitions
industries, a greatly increased skilled labour force in the engineering trades, and a
prosperous and well-equipped agricultural industry.
Post-war Developments
Since the war, the United Kingdom has experienced, with few interruptions, a
steady growth in output of goods and services and a high level of employment.
Invention and technological advance and shifts in world demand have helped to
produce some radical changes in the British industrial scene. Industries in which new
techniques have predominated, notably the electrical engineering, aircraft, motor and
chemicals industries, and new branches of machinery construction, are contributing
a significantly larger share of the total output and of total exports and providing
wider employment opportunities for an increasingly skilled labour force. Expenditure
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 247
on industrial and scientific research has increased steadily and facilities for technological
education have been greatly enlarged.
At the same time, the United Kingdom has had to deal with some persistent
economic problems; in particular, to fulfil its overseas obligations and to maintain its
traditional role in world commerce and finance it has needed to achieve and maintain
a substantial balance of payments surplus. In the initial post-war years Marshall Aid
and loans from the United States and Canada helped to overcome the serious deficit
in the balance of payments pending the full recovery of exports. Exports of both goods
and services have maintained the upward trend, but in some years the rate of increase
has been insufficient to pay for a rising volume of imports (almost all restrictions on
imports having been removed) and to provide for overseas investment and economic
assistance to developing countries. Nevertheless on external capital account as a
whole the United Kingdom is again a net creditor country.
The persistent rise in prices, a problem shared with most other countries, has not
yet been fully checked. It stems partly from an excessive pressure of demand
exports, investment at home and abroad, personal consumption, defence and other
public expenditure both at home and overseas—on the nation’s resources, and partly
from the fact that money incomes have risen faster than production, thus raising costs.
The Government has not only taken strong short-term measures to curb inflationary
tendencies, but is also increasingly concerned with the working out of policies to
relate increases in incomes to the rate of economic growth and to evolve machinery
for longer-term planning of the economy.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of the national income and
expenditure of the United Kingdom in recent years. The sources of Tables 8 to 12
are National Income and Expenditure, 1961, and Economic Survey, 1962, Cmnd. i6y8.
Output and Employment
Between 1950 and 1961 Britain’s gross national product (the measure of total
goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is estimated to
have doubled from j£i 1,752 million to ^23,703 million. In real terms, that is after
allowing for price changes, the increase has amounted to about 32 per cent over the
same period; this is equivalent to an average annual advance of about 2^ per cent. In
terms of national income per head the United Kingdom ranks appreciably below the
United States and Canada and slightly below Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and
Switzerland.
The working population has risen relatively slowly; in the twelve years to tne
middle of 1962 it increased by slightly over if million (or some 8 per cent) to about
25 f million, of which slightly more than two-thirds are males, while the total popula¬
tion rose by only 5 per cent. The expansion of the national income over the same period
has, therefore, been mainly the result of higher productivity. During this period
unemployment remained very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the working
population being out of work, compared with 14 per cent between the two world
wars, and only once since 1947—en<^ I95^ ^as in Great Britain
exceeded 500,000. When resources were stretched to the utmost as, for example,
in 1951 and again in 1955* the number of unfilled vacancies was about double that
of registered unemployed. There are, however, districts in which unemployment is
1
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
248
persistently higher than average, notably in Northern Ireland and Scotland. As far
as possible, new industrial development is being steered towards these areas.

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
249
During the 1950s there was an average annual increase of about 2 per cent in the
output of goods and services per head of the labour force, the chief factor in the growth
of the gross national product. There is some evidence that the rate was a little higher
towards the end of the decade. Industrial investment has been at a high level for several
years, stimulated by measures such as special investment allowances, and capacity for
a further increase in productivity is readily available. While considerable fluctuations
in demand may be encountered from time to time, and the Government may therefore
be obliged during such periods to influence the level of demand either upwards or
downwards, it is committed to a policy of maintaining full employment.
Table 8 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services since 1950,
at current prices, divided between consumers, public authorities, investment and
exports, while the diagrams on page 248 show the changes in national expenditure
in 1961 compared with 1956, at average 1958 prices, and production and national

Manufacturing industry contributes about 36^ per cent to the total output of goods
and services, and together with mining and quarrying, construction and public utilities
(gas, electricity and water) makes up just under half the total; agriculture, forestry and
fisheries account for slightly over 4 per cent; transport and communications, together
with the distributive trades, for more than 20 per cent. The remainder, just over one-
quarter of total output, includes public administration, education, health and financial
services. Over the past decade the only marked change has been the decline in the
proportion contributed by agriculture (though agricultural output is actually rising).
Industrial production as a whole has risen over the eleven years by about two-fifths,
and in the seven years from 1954 1961 by about one-quarter in manufacturing
industry. Rising output has made possible an appreciable advance in living standards,
the raising of investment progressively to the present record levels, and a notable but
not fully adequate expansion in exports.
Defence expenditure has made heavy calls upon resources at certain periods; in
peak years in the early 1950s it absorbed over 10 per cent of the gross national product.
In real terms, between 195® and 1961 gross fixed capital formation rose by 80 per cent,
consumption by 27 per cent, and public authorities current expenditure by about
25 per cent. Public authorities’ current expenditure, after remaining almost unchanged
since 1952, went up by about 5^ Per cent in 1961. Compared with i954> gross fixed
capital formation in 1961 was up by nearly half as much again.
250
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Investment
Since the end of the war, and particularly since 1953, gross fixed investment has
risen markedly. In 1938 fixed investment in the United Kingdom was about 12* per
cent of the gross national product; in 1948, 14 per cent. From 1957 to 1959 it averaged
over 17 per cent, rising to i8| per cent in i960 and 19 per cent m 1961. In some years
such as 1951 and i960, the level of economic activity has been influenced by a high
and rising investment in stocks and in work in progress. Up to 1953 investment in oil
refineries, chemicals and iron and steel, coal mining, and in the housing programmes
of local authorities increased particularly rapidly. Since 1954 industrial development
as a whole, and especially in manufacturing, transport and communications, and
distribution, has expanded greatly, while investment in housing tended to decline unti
1958, but has since risen by about one-third. In 1961 the volume of fixed capital
formation by manufacturing industry was about one-third higher than in 1957. It has
been at higher than average levels in the food, drink and tobacco, chemicals, motor
vehicles and electronics industries. _
More than 40 per cent of total fixed investment is carried out by the central Govern¬
ment, the local authorities and the public corporations, the last accounting for half of
public investment, and the central Government for about one-tenth. Each year the
Government considers proposals for capital expenditure in the following financial
year put forward by the authorities concerned, and in the light of the overall position
of the economy approves the total level. Public investment in 1961 amounted to about
/1,800 million, an increase of £134 million over i960, reflecting increased expenditures
on education, hospitals, roads, electricity generation and other services. It is expected
to be about 5 per cent higher in real terms in 1962. The diagram below shows the

Savings and the Financing of Investment
The marked growth of investment since 1954 has been greatly facilitated by a
substantial increase in personal savings (see Table 10). . . , 1 f
Personal savings in 1961 reached a record total, provisionally estimated at about
r2 070 million net nearly £500 million more than m i960 and more than three times

1948—51, on average only about 2 per cent of disposable personal income was saved;
by 1957 the proportion had risen to nearly 6^ per cent and in 1961 it slightly exceeded
10 per cent.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. Over one-third has consisted
of life assurance premiums and other forms of contractual savings, such as super¬
annuation funds. The National Savings movement (which in 1959 reached the record
peace-time level of £390 million) and building societies have also absorbed considerable
sums of personal savings. Since 1959, however, the most significant change has been
a faster growth in personal deposits in clearing banks.
The most important contribution to savings up to 1961 came from companies,
which provided about half the total, but the fall in company profits and other factors
in that year led to a marked drop in savings. The proportion of gross trading profits
of companies allocated to savings has tended to fall since 1959 to under half the total,
with an increasing share being taken by dividends and interest payments.
Public Authorities
Expenditure by the central Government, local authorities and the National Insurance
funds has expanded appreciably in comparison with pre-war years, although from the
end of the war until about 1957 less rapidly than the gross national product. The

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
253
main factors in this change have been the growth of the social services and of defence
expenditure. The proportion absorbed by defence fell from about 27 per cent of the
expenditure of the public authorities in 1953 to about 20 per cent in 1959 and has
remained at about that ratio. Government current expenditure (excluding transactions
of the National Insurance funds) dropped from 30 per cent of the gross nationa
product in 1948 to 25 per cent in i960. It rose to 26 per cent in 1961 when the rise in
Government expenditure was particularly large.
The expansion of the national income has enabled central Government tax revenue
to increase by over one-quarter since 1956, despite several reductions in taxation rates.
Revenue from taxes on expenditure, and especially from purchase tax on cars and
durable goods, rose slightly faster from 1958 to i960 than that from taxes on income,
partly because of income tax reductions. Increases in the rates of contributions for
the national insurance and health schemes have increased revenues from £642 million
in 1956 to ^1,071 million in 1961. Revenues from rates imposed by local authorities
rose by one-third in the four years from 1957 to 1961.
Table 11 shows how the public authorities collected and spent their revenue,
including national insurance and health contributions, in 1956 and 1961.
Persona! Incomes and Consumer Expenditure
Incomes from employment in 1961 totalled £16,258 million, having increased by
about one-third in five years, and accounted for slightly oyer 71^ per cent of tota
personal incomes (against 59I per cent in 1938); for rent dividends and interest the
corresponding percentages were 11^ and 22^. The diagram be ow s ows t e
composition of personal incomes and expenditure m 1961.
After payment of income tax and surtax, income is fairly evenly distributed. In
i960 of a total of 26! million incomes there were only about 3,000 incomes after tax
of more than £6,000 a year. More than one-quarter of incomes after tax were in the
£250-500 range and slightly more (7-7 million) in the next range of £501-750- About
57 per cent of the yield from the above taxes came from persons with annual incomes
of £1,000 a year and above, although the total incomes before tax of this group
accounted for only 23 per cent of all personal income.

On the other hand, the ownership of property and personal assets is less evenly
distributed and tends to be concentrated in a relatively small number of individuals.
Estimates for i960 by the Board of Inland Revenue give net personal wealth (including
landed property) in Great Britain as totalling £51,615 million; approaching one
quarter of this total represented shareholdings in companies.
While consumer expenditure nearly doubled between 195° an<^ I9^I> reac^1 a
total of £17,302 million, in real terms (i.e. after discounting the effect of price changes),
the increase has been slightly less than one-third. In the four years between 1957
and 1961 it rose by n| per cent (as shown in Table 12), although the increase in
1961 was less than per cent. The proportion of this larger expenditure devoted to
food has been falling slightly each year and now accounts for just under 30 per cent;
outlays on manufactured foods and on beverages, however, have risen appreciably.
Housing absorbs about 8| per cent of total expenditure. Spending on motor cars and
other personal transport has shown a steep rise since 195 &nd there has also been a
substantial growth in spending on household electrical equipment. Outlay on cinema¬
going has dropped by half since 1956, while that on running costs of vehicles has risen
by about 68 per cent.

Incomes and Prices
Between 1945 and the middle of 1958, the cost of living in the United Kingdom
rose almost without interruption, though at varying rates of increase. The most rapid
rise in retail prices, roughly 10 per cent, was between 195° an<^ I95I *> lowesh about
2 per cent, between 1953 and 1954. After two years of stability, retail prices advanced
by a further 5^ per cent between mid-1960 and mid-1962. From 1950 to 1961, retail
prices increased by 54 per cent; hourly wage rates by 79 per cent; personal incomes as
a whole by 106 per cent. The annual rate of increases of incomes has been nearly
7 per cent (but about 5! per cent since 1957), while the corresponding rise in the national
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
255
product per head of the labour force has been only about 2 per cent. It is clear that
the main immediate cause of the rise in prices has been the tendency of money incomes
to rise faster than production.
Steps have been taken by the Government throughout the period to check gradua
inflation. The main weapons used since 1955 have been the prevention of excessive
demand by monetary and fiscal measures and appeals for voluntary restraint in increases
in wages and profits. . . , ,
Following severe but generally successful measures in the autumn of 1957 to nalt
the upward drift in costs and prices, a policy of expansion again became feasible, n
19eg and the early months of i960 there was a rapid growth in demand and output,
and it became necessary to restrain the pressure of demand by a series of moderate
disinflationary measures. Balance of payments difficulties made more stringent measures
necessary in the summer of 1961. They included a sharp rise in bank rate, increases
in indirect taxes and an appeal for a ‘pause’ in wage and salary increases and for restraint
in profit and dividends. Government policy on incomes for the period following the
‘pause’ was outlined in a White Paper published in February 1962. This proposed that
increases in wages and salaries and in other incomes should be kept within the figure ot
2—2A per cent, which represented the annual average rate of growth of national pro¬
duction per head in recent years, and asked for continued restraint in profits and
dividends.
Longer Term Policies
As part of the Government’s plans to secure economic stability and sustained
growth, the National Economic Development Council (NEDC) was set up m February
1962. The task of the NEDC, of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is chairman,
is to examine the economic performance of the nation with particular concern for
plans for the future in both the private and the public sector, to consider use of
resources and to seek agreement upon ways of increasing the rate of sound growth.
Long-term planning of public expenditure, with regular surveys for periods ot
years ahead, is already being developed by the Government.
In July 1962 the Government announced its intention to set up a National Incomes
Commission to consider, in the light of the public interest, important claims for income
increases both in industry and in public and other services, and to publish its findings.
Balance of Payments
A strong balance of payments is vital to Britain because of its exceptionally high
degree of dependence on international trade, its many overseas commitments, and
its position as banker to the sterling area: therefore, one of the foremost objectives of
the Government’s economic policy must always be to preserve this strength.
Britain’s overseas short-term liabilities in the form of sterling balances held by other
countries and non-territorial organisations are substantial, amounting to .£4,515
million at the end of 1961. Gold and foreign currency reserves at the end of July 1962
stood at /i,o4i million. As a second line of reserves, the United Kingdom has drawing
rights on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which it can exercise with the
permission of the Fund. In August and September 1961, to strengthen the reserves,
the United Kingdom drew $1,500 million (,£536 million) in nine different currencies
from the Fund and obtained a standby credit for the equivalent of a further $500 million
(/178 million). The final instalment in repayment of these drawings was made in July
1962 (see p. 435). Taking into account external assets and liabilities as a whole, long¬
term as well as short-term, the United Kingdom is probably a net creditor country.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
256
In normal times it is necessary for the United Kingdom to earn a substantial surplus
on current account in order to finance a capital outflow in the form of private invest¬
ment and Government grants and loans.
There are also, however, important commitments which the United Kingdom has
to meet within the current account. The most important of these are the cost of
overseas military expenditure, which rose from ^182 million in 1958 to ^227 million
in 1961, and grant assistance to less developed territories, mainly the United Kingdom
dependent territories. Total bilateral grant aid of this kind exceeded £70 million in
1961; in addition, there is United Kingdom multilateral assistance, in the form of
contributions to international agencies such as the International Bank.
On capital account, the largest component is generally private investment abroad
(net of disinvestment) and over the last few years the outflow has been about ^300-350
million a year. A considerable proportion of this outflow has been to the less developed
countries and has thus maintained the traditional role of Britain as a source of finance
for overseas development.
Latterly there has been a steady increase in the flow of private capital to Britain
from overseas. In 1961 the inflow was exceptionally large, partly because of the
investment by the Ford Motor Company of America in its United Kingdom sub¬
sidiary (^131 million), and for the first time the private inflow was greater than
private outflow.
The United Kingdom also has to make repayments of capital and interest on post¬
war loans from the United States and Canada: the total service of these loans requires
about £67 million a year. In addition, there has been a substantial increase in recent
years in Government loans to help finance development in developing countries.
(Total United Kingdom aid to overseas countries, including grants as well as loans,
rose to about £160 million in 1961 from £82 million in 1957-58.)
If the special factor of subscriptions to international organisations is ignored, in
recent years the net capital movement has been outward, averaging about £210 million
a year from 1958-1960. In 1961, because of the Ford Motor Company transaction
and the advance repayment of loans to the United Kingdom, there was, exceptionally,
a small net capital inflow.
For a fuller account of the balance of payments, see Chapter 14.

INDUSTRY
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised. Thirteen people work in mining, manufacturing and building for every
one in agriculture. The United Kingdom is one of the world s largest exporters of
manufactured goods per head of population and the range of its industrial manufactures
reflects its position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
Location
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many and
various. During the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century one of the most
important influences was the proximity of coal, the major source of power, particularly
when it was associated with ease of access to other raw materials such as iron ore in the
West Midlands and salt (for chemicals) in Cheshire, and to the coast, which in turn
offered easy access to imported raw materials and a quick outlet for exports. In the course
of the past hundred years, the pull exercised by coal has been progressively weakened
as improved means of communication and an alternative source of power in electricity
have been developed and have enabled advantage to be taken of other sites for example,
those near to big consumer markets and plentiful supplies of labour. The main areas of
industrial concentration are still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the
beginning of Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Belfast), are on or near coalfields; but many smaller and more widely dispersed centres
of industry have grown up, notably in southern England.
During the inter-war period there was a tendency for the new industries, such as
those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods and rubber products, to develop
rapidly in the south (especially in and around Greater London) and in the Midlands.
On the other hand, this period was one of acute depression and mass unemployment
for the older industrial areas which specialised in the great staple industries—coal¬
mining, steel, shipbuilding, marine engineering and cotton manufacture. These
conditions prompted official action (which has been intensified since the second world
war) aimed at encouraging the development and diversification of industry in the areas
where labour and other unused resources are to be found and discouraging further
industrialisation in congested areas, and these policies, allied to the war-time dispersal
of industry and the widespread demand for new factory premises over the past decade,
have had a considerable effect.
A brief description follows of the location of British industry, grouped according to
broad geographical areas.
Greater London and the South-eastern Region
London, situated at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary, is Britain s
capital and main communication centre, probably still the world s most important
257
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
258
financial centre, one of the world’s three largest cities (with Tokyo and New York)
and one of the world’s three largest ports (with New York and Rotterdam). Greater
London (see p. 18), including the urbanised fringe areas within 40 to 45 miles of
Charing Cross, has a working population of over five million, of whom nearly a half are
in manufacturing industry. London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing and
food and drink industries, of printing, of cinema film production, and of the manu¬
facture of furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and many other
specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these industries and the
average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the County of London) is well
below the national average. London, especially its outer ring, is also an important area
for light engineering, chemicals and consumer goods and has some heavy engineering
plants. Towards the periphery of the London conurbation and in the new urban
development outside it, industry, particularly the electronics and a variety of con¬
sumer goods industries, has been expanding rapidly; some of the largest aircraft
plants are in this area, as well as the factories, at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable,
of two of the five main motor vehicle manufacturers. Along the lower Thames and
Medway estuaries there are large oil refineries as well as shipyards and a variety of
other engineering works.
West and South-west England
The largest city, Bristol, is both a leading port and an industrial centre with aircraft,
tobacco, food processing, paper, paint and other industries. Gloucester has aircraft
and engineering plants; Swindon, in Wiltshire, has railway and engineering works. The
port of Southampton is served by the largest passenger liners and has ship-repair
yards, oil refineries, synthetic rubber and other industries. Plymouth has an important
naval dockyard and several light industries. The noted West of England woollen and
worsted cloths come from factories in the Cotswold valleys.
East Anglia and Lincolnshire
Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern counties
possess some sizeable towns. Ipswich and Grantham are renowned for agricultural
machinery and implements, and Norwich for footwear and food manufacture. Food
canning and freezing, based mainly on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly.
Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire, is an important steel-making centre, and the ports of
Grimsby and Yarmouth have extensive fish processing plants.
Midlands
The main industrial area of the Midlands consists of the great conurbation centred
on Birmingham and Wolverhampton (which includes portions of Staffordshire,
Worcestershire and Warwickshire) where there is a wide variety of industry, including
notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all kinds,
and also jewellery, rubber products and domestic metalware. The smaller conurbation
of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent, is devoted chiefly to the manu¬
facture of pottery and china and to coalmining. The largest concentration of motor
vehicle manufacture in the United Kingdom is situated in the Midlands, at Coventry
and Birmingham and, further to the south, near Oxford.
Industrial cities and towns lying outside the main industrial area include Leicester
(hosiery, clothing, footwear and footwear machinery), Derby (general engineering,
locomotives, aero-engines), Nottingham (light engineering, lace, drugs, tobacco),
Rugby (electrical engineering), Northampton (footwear, engineering) and Kidder¬
minster (carpets). Corby, in Northamptonshire, has a steel industry originally based on
INDUSTRY
259
local deposits of iron ore, and at Peterborough there are several large engineering
works. The richest coalfield in Britain, with the highest output per man, lies in the
north-west of the area and continues into Yorkshire.
Lancashire
Besides being the commercial hub of the cotton textile industry, Manchester is
one of the chief centres of electrical and heavy engineering, machine tools and dye¬
stuffs in Britain. Most of the cotton yarn is spun in Bolton, Oldham, and Rochdale,
and at Stockport (in Cheshire); further to the north lie the weaving towns of Burnley,
Nelson, Blackburn, Colne, Accrington and Darwen; Preston and Bury have both
spinning and weaving plants. Engineering industries, notably the manufacture of
printing, textile and electrical machinery and commercial vehicles, are, however,
more important to the area than cotton, which has been declining for some years.
The Lancashire coalfield also lies in the Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas trade,
links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through the important industrial towns
of Warrington with its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes with its chemi¬
cals, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey
estuary. St. Helens, to the north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture. Liverpool
is the second port of Britain, a great commercial and insurance centre and, after London,
the greatest centre for processing imported foodstuffs and raw materials, being noted
especially for flour milling, soap manufacture, sugar refining and rubber products.
Among its older industries is ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across
the river at Birkenhead. Many new industries, including electrical engineering and
the manufacture of other heavy industrial equipment, have been established in the
Liverpool area, particularly on industrial estates. Barrow, in the north-west of the
county, is a well-known shipbuilding and marine engineering area.
Yorkshire
Most of the county’s industry is located in the West Riding, where about 90 per
cent of the United Kingdom’s worsted industry and the greater proportion of its
woollen industry are found. Bradford is the main city for worsteds and also the com¬
mercial centre of the whole wool trade; Morley and Leeds specialise in cheaper cloths,
and Batley, Dewsbury and Cleckheaton in heavy cloth. Huddersfield has a reputation
for fine woollens and Halifax for carpets. Leeds, the commercial capital of the area,
has a large ready-made clothing industry and manufactures a range of engineering
products. Further south is the heavy engineering centre of Sheffield, famous for its
high quality steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s extensive coalfields provide about
one-fifth of Britain’s coal. York, noted for chocolates and confectionery manufacture
and with important railway workshops, and Hull, one of the world’s largest fishing
ports and with many manufacturing industries, including engineering, vegetable oil
processing, paints and sawmilling, are other important industrial towns in Yorkshire.
North-east England
The coal industry is of great importance in Northumberland and Durham. Tyneside
and Wearside together are second only to Clydeside for shipbuilding and ship repairing,
and ships are also built at the Hartlepools and on Tees-side. Iron and steel plants are
situated at Consett, in County Durham, and in the Middlesbrough area, which is also
the most important centre for chemicals in Britain. Tyneside is particularly noted for
the manufacture of heavy electrical equipment. Other industries of the area, whose
manufactures have been greatly diversified since 1937 as a result of the establishment
260
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of large industrial estates, are mining and other machinery, rolling mill plant, machine
tools, ropes, glass, clothing and scientific instruments.
Wales
Although coalmining, including the extraction of special coals such as steam coal
and anthracite, remains the largest single source of employment in South Wales, the
area today produces many categories of capital and consumer goods and more than
twice as many people work in general manufacturing as in coalmining. Its steel
industry, with some of the most modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s
output of tinplate and a large proportion of sheet steel. In the past 25 years a number
of new industries have been established, including plastics, synthetic fibres, clothing,
electronics and light engineering; many of the new factories are on industrial estates.
The largest cities are Cardiff and Swansea. In North Wales a number of light industries
are located in the seaside resorts and other towns, particularly Wrexham.
Scotland
The thickly populated, industrial area of Clydeside, which includes the city of
Glasgow, is Britain’s largest shipbuilding and marine engineering centre. The steel
industry, specialising in plate and heavier products, is mainly in the North Lanarkshire
area. A variety of engineering products, such as earth-moving equipment, air-
conditioning plant, industrial valves, food-processing machinery and commercial
vehicles, are manufactured on Clydeside. The Scottish coalfields of the Lothians, Ayr,
Fife and Lanark produce about one-tenth of Britain’s coal, but many of the seams
in the last-named fields are gradually becoming exhausted.
Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland and its second largest city, has printing, brewing,
rubber, and engineering industries. The United Kingdom jute industry is concentrated
in Dundee, which also provides many other products, such as office machinery, clocks
and watches, refrigerators, and food manufactures. Aberdeen, the third city of Scotland
and a famous fishing port, has several light industries. Kirkcaldy, in Fife, is the centre
for the manufacture of linoleum. The border towns in the south are especially renowned
for high quality tweeds and knitwear. The north of Scotland possesses Britain’s only
significant resources of hydro-electric power. In north-east Scotland is the largest
concentration of whisky distilleries.
Northern Ireland
Although the area is relatively small and lacking in minerals, there is substantial
and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around the capital city of Belfast.
The largest single shipyard in the United Kingdom is sited in Belfast and, in addition
to other long-established engineering activities, including the manufacture of marine
engines and textile machinery, Northern Ireland has long been an important centre
for textiles (particularly linen), clothing, and tobacco manufacture. Long-established
industries outside Belfast are mainly connected with textiles or clothing but rapid
diversification (see p. 262) has brought new industries to many areas. Aircraft con¬
struction has become an important industry, and more recently there have been exten¬
sive developments in such fields as man-made fibres, carpets, synthetic rubber,
oil-well equipment, and a wide range of electrical and mechanical engineering, both
light and heavy.
Distribution of Industry Policy
While the Government has no power to direct an individual firm to set up a new
factory or plant in any particular area or site, it has sought, on both economic and
INDUSTRY
26l
social grounds, to control the expansion of industry in some areas and to encourage
it in others.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, the consent of the local planning
authority is, in general, necessary for any new building, any extension of a building or
any change in the use of an existing building. Where industrial floor space of more
than 5,000 square feet is to be created, such consent cannot be sought without a
certificate from the Board of Trade that the development is consistent with the proper
distribution of industry. One object has been to try to limit the expansion of industry
in congested areas, such as Greater London or Birmingham.
The main aim of the Government’s positive measures has been the alleviation of
local unemployment. The first Act dealing with this problem, the Special Areas
(Development and Improvement) Act, was passed in 1934, a time of acute economic
depression; its aim was to help certain large industrial regions, in which over a third
of the working population were unemployed. Under this Act and an amending Act of
1937, these regions—West Cumberland, the north-east coast of England, South Wales
and the Clyde Valley—were designated ‘special areas’ and special commissioners were
made responsible for their development and improvement. Industry was attracted to
the areas by various inducements, mainly the lease of factories built by Government-
financed non-profit-making estate companies and also certain loan facilities and
Government grants.
Under the Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, the original special areas
were renamed ‘development areas’ and enlarged, and the Government’s powers of
assistance were strengthened. The Board of Trade took over the special commissioners’
powers to build and let factories in these areas and, in addition, could and did designate
additional areas, while the Treasury had powers to make loans or grants to undertakings
unable to secure finance through normal channels.
Partly as a result of this Government action the special problems of some parts of
the development areas have now largely disappeared; and the general employment
position remains much better than it was before the war. On the other hand, employ¬
ment problems emerged in a number of new, and often quite small and isolated,
districts. To enable them to deal more flexibly with changes in the pattern of
unemployment, the Government acquired new powers under the Distribution
of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, which permitted the Treasury to
give financial assistance to undertakings which would provide employment in places
with high and persistent unemployment, whether or not they were within develop¬
ment areas.
The legislative basis of the Government’s powers to alleviate local unemployment
was simplified and strengthened by the passing of the Local Employment Act, i960.
Under this Act, the Government’s powers of assistance are centred in one depart¬
ment, the Board of Trade, which can name as ‘development districts’ places where
high and persistent unemployment exists or is expected, and can offer a number of
inducements to industrialists to settle or expand there. Specifically, the Board can
build factories for leasing at favourable rents or sale on deferred terms; make a capital
grant towards the cost of an industrialist’s own factory or for unusual initial expenses
arising solely from the choice of a development district; and make loans towards
working capital or for acquiring premises or equipment. The appropriate Government
departments can also make grants to local authorities for clearing derelict or neglected
sites and for improving basic services.
Under the Act, the Government-controlled industrial estate companies, which
under the Distribution of Industry Acts had run the industrial estates in the
262
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
development areas, have been replaced by three Industrial Estate Management
Corporations, one for England, one for Wales and one for Scotland. These corporations
are controlled and financed by the Board of Trade.
The Local Employment Act does not apply to Northern Ireland. The matters with
which the Act deals are the concern of the Northern Ireland Parliament. Under the
Industries Development Acts (Northern Ireland), 1945 to 1953, a comprehensive and
flexible scheme of assistance (which can include the tenancy or purchase on favourable
terms of a Government-built factory, together with a grant towards the cost of plant
and machinery and the cost of transferring equipment from a factory outside Northern
Ireland) can be offered to projects which appear likely to make a desirable contribution
to the economy of Northern Ireland. Grants and loans can also be offered to the
appropriate authorities for the improvement of basic services if these should be
considered inadequate for a given development. Firms which are assisted under the
Industries Development legislation are expected to undertake a specific development
which will employ an agreed number of persons within a given period. Under the
Capital Grants to Industry Acts (Northern Ireland), 1954 to 1962, manufacturing
enterprises in Northern Ireland are entitled to claim outright grants of 33^ per cent
of their annual expenditure on plant and machinery and industrial building, subject,
in the case of firms new to Northern Ireland, to a maximum grant of £200,000 in any
one year. This assistance, which is largely unconditional, is intended primarily to
encourage modernisation and capital investment.
Since 1945, 170 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland and 113
schemes of expansion carried out with Government assistance, developments which
at present are employing some 43,000 persons. The Ministry of Commerce is the
Northern Ireland Government department concerned with the administration of the
Industries Development and Capital Grants legislation.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. In England and
Wales there is the Rural Industries Bureau, which, on the recommendation of Rural
Community Councils, provides technical advice and instruction to craftsmen and
small rural businesses; it also provides loans from the Rural Industries Loan Fund,
started in 1940, for the acquisition of equipment and the purchase or improvement of
workshops. In Scotland the corresponding body is the Scottish Country Industries
Development Trust, founded in 1935, which exercises local and national responsibilities
for the development of rural industries.
Development Organisations
In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales there are national organisations devoted
to encouraging the expansion and diversification of industry. The Northern Ireland
Development Council, established in 1955, makes more widely known in Great
Britain and elsewhere the facilities offered by Northern Ireland to new undertakings;
and advises the Northern Ireland Government on matters connected with industrial
development. The chairman of the council is appointed by the Prime Minister
of Northern Ireland and the other members are appointed by the Prime Minister in
consultation with the chairman. The Scottish Council (Development and Industry),
with a wide membership including local authorities, trade associations, trade unions,
chambers of commerce, co-operative societies and banks, is concerned writh the
economic development of Scotland. It assists the expansion of existing industry,
fosters the growth of new industries, especially in areas requiring development,
encourages exports, organises exhibitions and publicises Scottish trade and industry.
There are several voluntary associations concerned with the needs of Welsh industry

as a whole, but the most similar in aims and constitution to the Scottish Council is
the Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959-
In England certain regions and cities have established industrial development
associations which are concerned with studying local industrial needs and with trying
to attract suitable industry. These associations are sponsored mainly by local authorities
and trade associations, but may also include firms, financial and commercial interests,
and individuals in their membership.
The Structure of Industry
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal, corporate,
co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different forms, and all
are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from the many small work¬
shops to vast organisations such as the National Coal Board, a public corporation with
over 600,000 employees; Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., a limited liability com¬
pany which, with its subsidiaries, employs about 114,000 persons in the United
Kingdom; and the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., a co-operative society with
about 50,000 employees.
Role of Public Enterprise
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the growth of the social services,
especially health, education and housing, led to the progressively greater influence
of the public sector of the economy. There was also an increase in the State’s direct
participation in productive economic activities, particularly in the decade 1940-50.
State participation is effected mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal
with a particular activity. Such bodies, though not part of a Government department,
are under a considerable but varying degree of public control (see p. 269). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate major
industries and services in the public interest.
The public corporation in its twentieth-century form is, generally speaking, a
public body having a clearly defined and specific task. Its board of directors and its
staff are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are
not civil servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring departments
who are responsible for the management of the corporations. Certain of the corporations
are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help them in carrying out the
duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were established1
in those industries and services where it was considered that the national interest
required co-ordination or control by a public authority. Their constitutions had no

Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, to rationalise electricity
generation and build and operate a main transmission system, (2) the British Broadcasting
Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a national broadcasting service;
(3) the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, established by the Electricity (Supply) Act
(Northern Ireland), 1931, to develop electricity supplies in Northern Ireland outside the two
county boroughs, Belfast and Londonderry; (4) the London Passenger Transport Board,
established by Act of Parliament in 1933, to operate the public transport system of the London
metropolitan area; (5) the Northern Ireland Road Iransport Board, established by the Road and
Rail Transport Act (Northern Ireland), I935> to acquire public road transport services in Northern
Ireland outside the county boroughs; (6) the British Overseas Airways Corporation, established
by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, to take over the operation of the two main existing
air transport companies—Imperial Airways and British Airways.

standard pattern and their governing bodies differed in the method of appointment
and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the nationalisation Acts set up public
corporations to run certain major industries and services, including coalmining,
inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply, and civil air transport.
These post-war corporations are less varied in the structure of their governing bodies,
which are appointed by the responsible minister.
The following corporations, the organisation and functions of which are described
in later chapters, are now operating or controlling large-scale industries or services:
The Bank of England.
The British Broadcasting Corporation.
The British Transport Commission.1
The Ulster Transport Authority.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation.
British European Airways.
The National Coal Board.
The Gas Council and Area Gas Boards.
The Electricity Council, the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Area
Electricity Boards.
The Electricity Board for Northern Ireland.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.
The South of Scotland Electricity Board.
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
The Independent Television Authority.
Mining and Quarrying
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining. The
coalmining industry of Great Britain (see p. 275), is operated as a single co-ordinated
enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board.
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk, limestone, salt,
tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprises, usually owned
and operated by limited liability companies. About 70,000 workers are employed in
mining and quarrying, excluding coalmining.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include fissile
materials and radioactive isotopes made by the Atomic Energy Authority, locomotives
and rolling-stock for use on British Railways, built in workshops owned and operated
by the British Transport Commission, a considerable quantity of arms and military
equipment made in Royal Ordnance factories and other factories operated by the
War Office and the Ministry of Aviation, and some fighting ships built in naval
dockyards operated by the Admiralty. The staff of the Stationery Office do some
printing and bookbinding, while the repair, and to a limited extent the construction, of
post office equipment is carried on in factories run by the Post Office. Certain factories,
giving employment to the severely disabled, are operated by Remploy Ltd., a non-

profit-making public company financed on the Vote of the Ministry of Labour, which
appoints the directors (see p. 456). The equity of certain iron and steel companies is
still held by a government agency, the Iron and Steel Holdings Realisation Agency
(see p. 299).
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more than
10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour; the results of the most
recent of these surveys, based on returns rendered by employers in June 1961, show
that nearly a third of all employees in such establishments are in those employing
from 100 to 499 persons, while slightly over a third are in establishments employing
1,000 or more persons. A high proportion of the biggest establishments are in the heavy
industries, while the average size of establishments in industries making consumer
goods is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results
obtained in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that there is a slow but significant
trend towards an increase in the average size of manufacturing establishments: in
1961, establishments with 1,000 or more employees were found to employ 2,821,000
persons, over 25 per cent more than in 1953 and more than 2^ times as many as in 1935.
In addition, there are estimated to be some 140,000 manufacturing establishments
with fewer than 11 employees and in these a total of about 750,000 workers are
employed.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manufacturing
enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establishments, not all of them
necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities. An analysis of manufacturing
enterprises by size (employment) is shown in the Report of the Census of Production
for 1958. An enterprise, as defined in the Census, normally consists of either a single
firm or a holding company together with its subsidiaries. Just over half of all employ¬
ment in British manufacturing industries in 1958 was accounted for by about 950
large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest 70 or so accounting
roughly for a quarter. In some industries a small number of big companies and their
subsidiaries are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil refining,
steel making, the manufacture of motor vehicles and components, aircraft and aero¬
engines, heavy electrical equipment, bicycles, cement, and basic chemicals. Shares in
these companies are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is
rare for a few large holders to have a controlling interest. For example, five of the
largest public companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders. The trend is
towards merging into larger units of control; and especially in brewing, pharmaceuticals,
aircraft, electrical products and newspaper and magazine publishing there have been
several movements in this direction in recent years.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between different
firms varies from industry to industry. In the cotton industry, for example, it is
usual for different firms to undertake the various main processes of production
(spinning, weaving, finishing), while in the woollen section of the wool textile industry
all these processes are commonly undertakemwithin the same firm. Some of the leading
establishments in the vehicles group of industries are primarily engaged on the assembly
of parts, many of which have been manufactured for them under contract by specialist
firms.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on pp. 297-324.
Building and Civil Engineering
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by private
contractors. From the end of the second world war to 1958 most new houses were
266
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
built by firms under contract to local authorities, but the majority are now built on
private orders, or for sale (see p. 191).
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and civil
engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work, many of which
operate outside as well as inside the building industry. Building is an industry of
small firms; more than three-quarters of the firms employ fewer than 20 employees.
For a fuller account of the building and civil engineering industries see p. 294.
Industrial Association
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings have
increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different purposes.
Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with the Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation of
prices (see p. 273).
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying com¬
pleteness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of industry where there
are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices. Associations which deal with
labour matters usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of operation or manu¬
facturing process. Organisations mainly concerned with representations to the Govern¬
ment, provision of common services or the regulation of trading practices are built up
round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector concerned wholly
with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all the required
functions.
There are about 80 national federations and probably altogether about 1,500
employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the
national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of work.
Most of the national federations are in turn affiliated to the British Employers'’ Con¬
federation, the national body representing employers on labour questions affecting
industry generally (see p. 470).
The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned with providing common
services is not known precisely, but according to a survey carried out by Political and
Economic Planning (an independent research organisation) between 1953 and 1956,
some 1,300 were in existence, varying greatly in importance, structure and activities.
Membership of the Federation of British Industries (FBI), the national body recognised
as the spokesman for British industry on economic, commercial and production (as
distinct from labour) matters, consists of some 8,300 individual firms and nearly
300 national trade organisations, with a total affiliated membership of some 40,000 to
45,000 firms. The FBI has offices in the main industrial centres in the United Kingdom
and is widely represented abroad. It has a wholly owned subsidiary company, British
Overseas Fairs Limited, which is responsible for organising British trade fairs
overseas.
A number of the organisations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour matters
and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two organisations work
closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National Association of
British Manufacturers (NABM) and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.
INDUSTRY
267
The members of NABM are over 5,000 manufacturing firms, mainly small or medium
sized, and some 66 trade associations are affiliated to it. Like the FBI it has regional
branches. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is the central organi¬
sation to which 98 local chambers of commerce (together with 15 British Chambers
of Commerce operating in foreign countries) are affiliated. The Association celebrated
its centenary in i960. In Scotland there is also a central organisation, the Council of
Scottish Chambers of Commerce. These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and
traders and exist to promote the interests of local industry and commerce. The FBI, the
NABM and the Chambers of Commerce often act jointly in matters of common concern.
Relations with Government
The Government is able to influence industry in a number of ways—through fiscal
and monetary policy, by means of physical controls and inducements, as well as b^
providing information and advice.
A system has grown up whereby a particular Government department acts as the
main point of contact, or ‘production department’, for each major industry.
The department through which the Government s relations with trade and industiy
are chiefly conducted is the Board of 1 rade (which has regional offices in the principal
industrial centres) and its responsibilities cover a wide range of industries and
materials. Certain industries and services, however, are the responsibility of other
departments, as production departments:
Ministry of Aviation   Aircraft, aero-engines, electronics
industries and civil aviation.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Farming, horticulture, agricultural
machinery and fisheries in England
and Wales; food processing in Great
Britain.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Treasury is responsible for economic policy, and specifically for fiscal and
monetary policy, through which it is able to influence the level of economic activity
and the utilisation of the nation’s resources. The Ministry of Labour is the channel
through which manpower policy is conducted. The Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research (DSIR) undertakes research in the national interest and encourages
and assists industrial research and the application of scientific knowledge to industry.
There are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for matters
within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Ministry of Commerce
deals with industry, including the encouragement of industrial development.
During and after the second world war, many operations of industry and commerce
were subject to Government control. Very few controls now remain; of those in force
probably the most important is the power of the Board of Trade to influence the
location of industry. The housing departments, acting through local planning authorities,
have powers to control the use of land. The export and import of a small range of
products still require Board of Trade approval.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office, was estab¬
lished in 1940 to provide a comprehensive statistical service to assist the authorities
in framing economic and financial policy.
Although departments themselves compile statistics relating to their particular
responsibilities, and may publish them in their own standard publications, the com¬
prehensive statistical publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office, which
collects the main departmental statistics and compiles its own series from departmental
and other information. Statistics relating to industry may be found in its regular
publications: the Monthly Digest of Statistics, Economic Trends, Financial Statistics
(monthly), The United Kingdom Balance of Payments (published half-yearly), the
Annual Abstract of Statistics, the Preliminary Estimates of National Income and Expendi¬
ture (published annually before the Budget) and the fuller National Income and
Expenditure Blue Book issued later in the year. Statistics on Incomes, Prices, Employment
and Production is published quarterly (the first issue appeared in April 1962); it is
compiled by the Ministry of Labour to provide factual information for those engaged
in wage negotiations. The Digest of Scottish Statistics is published half-yearly by the
Scottish Statistical Office, a Digest of Northern Ireland Statistics at half-yearly or
yearly intervals by the Ministry of Finance of the Northern Ireland Government,
and an annual Digest of Welsh Statistics by the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government.
To ensure that industry is aware of Government policy and that policy is framed
with a knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of consultative bodies
have been set up representing Government, employers’ associations and trade unions.
Among these are the National Production Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and
the National Joint Advisory Council (NJAC). The NPACI, which covers the wider
problems of industrial production, is under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and includes representatives of the Regional Boards for Industry (see
below) and of certain Government departments as well as of employers and workers.
Northern Ireland sends two representatives to meetings of the NPACI as observers.
The NJAC consists of representatives of private employers, the nationalised industries
and trade unions, under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour, and is concerned
with matters affecting the relations between employers and workers.
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad national
point of view. There are, in addition, bodies concerned with the special problems of
Scotland and Wales and of the English regions. The most important of these are the
INDUSTRY
269
nine Regional Boards for Industry and the corresponding Scottish and Welsh Boards
for Industry, whose main functions are to keep the Government informed on industrial
conditions in the English regions and in Wales and Scotland either by direct reference
to Government departments or through representation on the NPACI, and to provide
a link between central Government and local industry. The regional boards have set
up district advisory committees wherever they considered that the geographical
grouping of industry justified such a step.
A body of somewhat different character and function is the National Economic
Development Council (NEDC), established in February 1962 to examine plans for
the future both in the private and in the public sector of industry, to consider obstacles
to quicker economic growth and to seek agreement upon ways to increase the rate of
sound growth. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is chairman of the Council and
appoints its members, which in 1962 consisted of industrial and trade union leaders,
the Minister of Labour, the President of the Board of Trade and two well-known
economists. The Council has its own permanent staff (not members of the Civil Service)
under a Director General.
Government and the Nationalised Industries
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of the
boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies from industry
to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them. First, the minister
appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of each board, and secondly,
he has power to give general directions as to how the industry should be run, but does
not interfere in day-to-day management. It is usually also laid down that the board
shall give to the minister any information, statistics and financial accounts which he
may require. In practice, as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major
policy decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion
for him to issue a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual statutory
requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so that receipts
at least balance outgoings taking one year with another. The responsible minister is
usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say what shall be done with any
surplus revenues which may accrue. As regards finance of capital expenditure, the
present system is that such finance as cannot be met from internal sources is mainly
provided, in the form of interest-earning loans, by the minister from the Exchequer,
bank advances being used only for normal requirements of short-term capital.
The minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to see
that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually done
by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints
and suggestions made to them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes
they think desirable. It is recognised that these arrangements are still to a great extent
experimental.
Government policy towards these industries is subject to the approval of Parliament.
Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by debates, including debates
on their annual reports and accounts, and by answers to parliamentary questions,
which, in principle, are admissible only if concerned with policy rather than details of
administration.
In a White Paper {Cmnd. 1337) issued in April 1961 the Government outlined
certain general principles which it believed had to be applied for the administration
of the nationalised industries to be efficient. Among them were a balancing of revenue
270
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
accounts over a five-year period, a closer definition of the financial and economic
obligations of the industries, and greater freedom in price policies.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalised industries is
informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised
Industries was established in 1957 to examine the reports and accounts of the
nationalised industries and to report to Parliament. Reports issued by the committee
have so far dealt specifically with the two Scottish electricity boards, the National
Coal Board, the airways corporations, British Railways and the gas industry. These
reports have discussed problems of ministerial control, organisation and finance. A
report published in February 1962 reviewed the action taken by the corporations and
the Government in the light of the committee’s recommendations.
Production and Productivity
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and con¬
tracting, and gas, electricity and water) increased rapidly in the immediate post-war
years as industry was turned over from war production and manpower was released
from the armed forces. It had regained the pre-war level by 1946, was 14 per cent
greater by 1948, and by 1954 had exceeded the 1948 level by a further 27 per cent.
The course of production and employment from 1958 to 1961 is shown in Table 13.

Partly because of measures taken to check inflationary trends, production from 1955
to 1958 showed only small changes. The volume and efficiency of industrial equipment
and plant, however, increased steadily during this period in consequence of the high
level of investment, and output rose rapidly in 1959 and by the second quarter of 1961
was about 15 per cent above the 1958 level on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Between 1958 and 1961 output in the chemicals industry rose by 24 per cent; in
vehicles, by 9 per cent; and in engineering and electrical goods, by 21 per cent. Other
industries which expanded considerably were clothing and footwear (22 per cent);
bricks and cement (22 per cent); and paper, printing and publishing (20 per cent).
Consumption of electric power over the period rose by about 30 per cent.
The increases in production since 1958 have been due partly to an increase in the
labour force (about 3 per cent between mid-1959 and mid-1961 in civil employment
as a whole and about 3^ per cent in productive industry) and partly to a variety of
factors influencing sales and production, including increases in both domestic and
world demand; technical advances in products, machinery and processes; the high
INDUSTRY
27I
and increasing rate of fixed capital formation; and improvements in the management
and morale of particular undertakings.
Gross fixed capital formation at home has continued to increase steadily; in 1961 it
amounted to some 19 per cent of the gross domestic product and was estimated to be
over 25 per cent greater than in 1958. Part of this rising investment is linked with the
introduction of new techniques and equipment and in particular of machines and
instruments, which lessen the need for human skill and supervision; it is, in fact,
part of the process known as automation, which is beginning to affect the organisation
of business enterprises and the structure of the labour force in advanced industrial
countries and, in the long run, is likely to be responsible for very large increases in
production and efficiency. Much investment, however, still consists of replacements,
additions and improvements of a more traditional kind. In the short run, very large
increases in output per man are sometimes achieved by such investment or simply
by changes of policy, organisation or methods.
Both the long term and the short term growth of productivity thus depend most
directly on the decisions of individual undertakings, and the promotion of productivity
is regarded as primarily a matter for industry though Government departments and
educational and research establishments also have their contribution to make.
Employers’ associations and trade unions are engaged in activities to raise industrial
productivity. The former often provide technical assistance, conduct market surveys,
and support schemes of vocational education and training. The National Association
of British Manufacturers has established an advisory service to enable small firms to
obtain advice on production problems. The trade unions in many industries organise
special schemes for training young people, and also a variety of courses designed to
give trade unionists an understanding of modern management techniques. Private
consultants specialising in management and work study are available to give advice
to firms on measures to increase their productive efficiency; there are also many
specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned with various aspects of
productivity.
The British Productivity Council (BPC) has been established by both sides of
industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity. Ihe BPC was
set up in 1952 to continue and develop the wTork of the Anglo-American Productivity
Council which, between 1948 and 1952, sent productivity teams from many British
industries to study progress and techniques in the United States. It is an independent
body on which are represented the British Employers’ Confederation, the Federation
of British Industries, the Trades Union Congress, the Association of British Chambers
of Commerce, the National Association of British Manufacturers and the nationalised
industries; its work is financed by contributions from these bodies and by a Government
grant-in-aid. Advisory committees have been set up to promote productivity in the
building trades, in agriculture and in retailing. Much of the BPC’s work is done through
over 100 local productivity committees and associations throughout the country. These
local organisations arrange meetings, inter-factory visits, courses, conferences, film
shows and exhibitions. To assist them, and the many other national and industrial
bodies with which it co-operates, the BPC produces booklets, pamphlets, case studies,
films and a monthly bulletin, and arranges work study demonstrations.
A National Productivity Year, initiated by the British Productivity Council (BPC),
was due to open in November 1962. Its aim is to focus attention on every possible means
that lie within the capacity of management and v/orkers to raise efficiency and lower
costs. It is backed by employers, professional organisations, trade unions, research
bodies, universities and technical colleges.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Standards Institution (BSI), is a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards in respect
of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods and codes of practice.
Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufacturers, buyers and sellers reduces
unnecessary variety and simplifies the specification of requirements, thus promoting
industrial efficiency. The BSI is governed by a council consisting of representatives
of the main organisations of employers and workers, professional institutions and the
larger Government departments.
The Board of Trade is the department responsible for general aspects of the
promotion of productivity and it administers the Government grants to the BPC,
the BSI, and the Council of Industrial Design.
A number of other departments have responsibilities which bear on productivity.
The Ministry of Labour has an Industrial Relations Service, wdiich advises firms on
personnel management and industrial relations. The Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research is also concerned directly with research into such factors as
productivity measurement techniques, production engineering and operator fatigue;
and it provides technical advisory sendees. The Ministry of Education and the Scottish
Education Department are responsible for the technical colleges, at which courses are
available in such subjects as work study and industrial engineering. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works provides a Technical Information Service for the building
industry; and the Ministry of Power and the British Productivity Council sponsor
the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food provides a number of advisory services which aim at encouraging the
efficiency of the farming industry in England and Wales; similar services are
provided by the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
Management
During the present century and particularly during and since the second world war,
the increasing pace of technical, organisational and social change has made the success¬
ful conduct of enterprises dependent on knowledge of, and practice in, a complex of
managerial techniques for dealing with technical and human problems. There has,
therefore, emerged in Britain, as elsewhere, a growing awareness of the importance
of management as a subject requiring special skills and knowledge. This has been
reflected both in a change in the general educational qualifications of recruits to
management and in the spread of systematic education and training for management.
Before the war the manager with a university degree was the exception, apart from
senior managers in large firms, while a high proportion of junior managers had left
school at fourteen and had worked their way up to responsible positions without
formal education or training in management. Today most large and many other
businesses recruit graduates and arrange for their systematic training in the various
techniques of management. Moreover, progressive firms have comprehensive pro¬
grammes of management development to fit the senior staff for wider responsibilities.
Many organisations are contributing to the growing knowledge and appreciation
of the wider functions of management. They include institutes, societies and firms
concerned with specialist subjects of interest to managers, such as industrial psychology,
industrial welfare or aspects of industrial efficiency; associations of those who work in
particular fields of management, such as sales managers; industrial associations of all
kinds, including such central bodies as the FBI, the NABM, the BEC and the TUC;
and professional bodies whose members may be managers or directors or those who
work closely with them, such as accountants or engineers. The professional engineering
INDUSTRY
273
institutions, for example, include industrial administration in the syllabus of their
qualifying examinations.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) was founded in 1947, with Government
support, to study and promote improved standards of management throughout industry,
commerce, and public administration. It is now entirely financed from industrial
and professional subscriptions. The main objects of the BIM, which combined in
1957 with the Institute of Industrial Administration, are to provide information on,
and undertake research into, management practices and techniques, and to encourage
the development of education and training for management on a national scale.
Education for management is developing mainly in four ways:
(1) national schemes for England and Wales and for Scotland are administered
by the BIM in co-operation with the Ministry of Education and the Scottish
Education Department respectively; in addition to intermediate awards in
business administration, there are, at a higher level, diplomas in management
studies awarded on the basis of examinations;
(2) independent courses organised by universities, other educational establish¬
ments, professional organisations, industrial consultants, and certain centres
specialising in management training (such as the Administrative Staff College,
at Henley-on-Thames, and Ashridge College, in Hertfordshire);
(3) training courses organised by employers’ associations and various voluntary
bodies; and
(4) formal courses and informal training within individual firms, some of which
have their own residential centres.
The growing number of firms and individuals working as management consultants—
more than 1,550 in 1962—and the use of the services of independent management
selection firms in the appointment of senior staff are indications of the interest in
the science of management in Britain.
Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Competition in trade and industry is sometimes restricted either by agreements
(formal or informal) between suppliers, or by monopolies which dominate the market;
legislation in force in the United Kingdom for dealing with these problems is described
below.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, provides for the registration and judicial
examination of restrictive agreements. It requires the entry in a public register of the
particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements (including those relating to
common prices, approved lists of dealers and the limitation of production) which
affect the supply or processing of goods for the United Kingdom market. The Registrar
of Restrictive Trading Agreements is responsible for keeping the register and for
bringing the agreements before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under the Act.
The court, which includes laymen but is presided over by one of Her Majesty’s
judges, is, in effect, responsible for deciding whether or not an agreement is in the
public interest. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the court that any restriction
in their agreement produces one or more of seven beneficial effects set out in the
Act, and that the restriction is not unreasonable, having regard to the balance between
the benefit it confers and any public detriment likely to result from its operation, that
restriction must be found contrary to the public interest. Agreements are void in
respect of restrictions so found. The court can make orders preventing the parties
from operating their agreement, or from making new arrangements having the same
274
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
effect. Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this procedure
but have to be notified to the Board of Trade.
The first full hearing before the court took place in October 1958. By the end of
June 1961 the register contained particulars of 2,350 agreements. Of these, over 1,065
had been abandoned or had had all restrictions removed from them, while 78 agree¬
ments had been the subject of decisions of the court. In 62 cases the agreements had
not been defended and the restrictions were, therefore, found contrary to the public
interest. Of the 16 agreements defended, 13 had been found wholly or largely contrary
to the public interest.
One form of restrictive practice, the collective enforcement of resale price main¬
tenance by the use of stoplists or boycotts, was prohibited outright by the 1956 Act.
On the other hand, the Act strengthened the powers of individual suppliers to enforce
their resale prices through the civil courts.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements which are not within the scope of the
Restrictive Practices Court in the circumstances indicated in the Monopolies and
Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, may be referred by the Board
of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investigation and report. Production
departments take appropriate action on the basis of these reports but no order can be
made without the approval of Parliament. Prior to the passing of the 1956 Act the
commission had investigated a number of industries, several of which modified their
practices in accordance with its recommendations. The 1956 Act excluded from the
scope of the commission’s work agreements which had to be registered under the new
legislation. It is now mainly concerned with the investigation of monopolies. Since
1948 the commission has presented some 24 reports.
In January 1962 it was announced that the Board of Trade was reviewing the
legislation on monopolies and restrictive practices.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal, petroleum
and, to a small extent, water power, nuclear energy and colliery methane; secondary
sources produced from these are electricity, gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies nearly three-quarters of primary energy and
it will remain the principal source for many years to come. For supplies of crude
petroleum Britain is virtually dependent on imports. Water power resources are small.
A large-scale programme is in hand for the construction of nuclear power stations.
The pattern of primary energy consumption has shown marked changes in recent
years, as shown in Table 14. While consumption of coal has tended to fall, that of oil
has risen considerably—from 15 per cent of total inland energy consumption in 1957 to
over 26 per cent in 1961. Of the primary fuels consumed, more than half the coal and
one-sixth of the oil are converted into secondary fuels.
The fuel and power industries, wdth the exception of petroleum, are under public
ownership. General responsibility for ensuring the effective and co-ordinated develop¬
ment of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister of Power. Fuel research is
undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using industries. The Minister of Power has an
Advisory Council on Research and Development.
In general, fuel and power industries require heavy capital investment in long-term
projects and both internal resources and borrowing are used to raise the large sums
needed. Until 1956 long-term borrowing by the corporations was mainly through the
issue of stock, except in the case of the coal industry, which borrowed direct from the
INDUSTRY
275
Exchequer. There were also special loans from non-government sources as well as
temporary advances from the commercial banks. Under the Finance Act,
the corporations were given power to raise money by means of Exchequer advances
from the responsible minister with the approval of the Treasury. These powers were
extended and amended by the Finance Act, 1958, and by other Acts. Since 1956 all
the corporations have obtained their long-term capital by loans from the Exchequer
and issues of stock have been suspended.
Investment by the nationalised fuel and power industries in 1962-63 amounted to
£534 million1. In 1961 it accounted for about one-quarter of public investment and
about one-ninth of all fixed investment.

The Minister of Power is required by statute to ensure the protection of consumers
of fuel. Consultative councils were established for coal in 1947, for electricity in 1948
and for gas in 1949. The councils each consist of a chairman and from 20 to 30 unpaid
members. These are appointed by the Minister from nominations put forward by
interested bodies selected by the Minister for representing consumers. In the electricity
and gas supply industries councils and committees have been formed on an area and
district basis; for coal there are councils at national level only. Energy consumption
by domestic users, in common with other users, has been steadily increasing, the
share of oil rising and that of coal slightly decreasing.
COAL
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coalmining
industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years longer than in
any other European country. British coal exports dominated the world market until
about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry was producing 287
million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and employing over a million workers.
The very fact that the British industry was developed so early has meant that many
of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has to be mined from
deeper and thinner seams and productivity can be maintained only by a high level
of investment.
1 Government Expenditure Below the Line. Cmnd. 1680.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
276
The industry declined during the first world war owing to shortage of manpower
and of the plant and materials necessary for undertaking any mechanical improvement.
Moreover, alternative sources of energy and lower prices in other countries led to a
later decline in exports, which had fallen to 67 million tons by 1925.
Attempts to secure economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey Com¬
mission of 1919. In 1930 a Coal Mines Act established commissioners to bring about
the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of 1938 transferred
ownership of royalties from mineral coal to the State. During the second world war the
industry was under Government control.
The National Coal Board
The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946, brought the industry under public
ownership; by this Act, all its assets—coal mines, mineral rights and ancillary under¬
takings—were vested on 1st January, 1947, in the National Coal Board (NCB), which
became responsible for the industry’s management, compensation being paid to the
former owners. Under the Coal Industry Act, 1949, the board, which is appointed
by the Minister of Power and is responsible through him to Parliament, consists of a
chairman and not fewer than eight or more than 11 other members.
The National Coal Board has the exclusive monopoly to mine coal in Great Britain,
though it may license privately owned undertakings to work small mines not employing
more than 30 underground workers, and also to work opencast sites where the total
output is not expected to exceed 25,000 tons. Its policies must be directed to ensure
that on an average of good and bad years its outgoings do not exceed its revenues.
The NCB is responsible for its own regional organisation. The main collieries,
numbering about 669, are grouped into 47 areas which are the basic units for com¬
mercial management; their size varies according to geological, geographical and other
technical considerations. The areas are grouped into nine divisions which roughly
correspond to the main coal-bearing regions. A divisional board for each division
supervises and co-ordinates the work of the areas (except in the small south-eastern
division, which is administered by a general manager), formulates divisional policy,
and is answerable to the NCB, which is responsible for questions of national policy,
finance and the co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The day-to-day
work of running the collieries is under the direction of colliery managers. The NCB,
however, has no monopoly of sales or distribution. It makes some direct sales to large
consumers and also retail sales in a few areas. Most retail distribution is in the hands of
private firms.
In its first year, 1947, the NCB had a deficit of £23-3 million, and since then has
made surpluses in some years and deficits in others. In certain areas, such as Scotland,
Lancashire and South Wales, deficits have been persistent, and profits from areas of
high productivity, for instance the East Midlands, have not been sufficient to cover
the losses. The cumulative deficit at the end of 1961 amounted to £93 million.
Production and Manpower
It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for about
400 to 500 years at current rates of consumption. But certain types such as high-quality
coking coal will be exhausted long before then unless they are eked out by blending
with other types of coal.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottingham¬
shire field, which produces about 45 per cent of the total ouput, (2) the Durham
and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and (4) the Scottish field.

Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lancashire and the West Midlands
(Staffordshire and Warwickshire). Coal is not found to any great extent in Northern
Ireland but two coal mines are at present working, with an annual output of 12,000
tons. Prospecting for coal continues both inland and off the north-east coast of England.
The main trends in coal production and manpower since 1947 are shown in Table 15.

Previous years’ rates are for all deep mines.
(6) Figures for i960 onwards relate to NCB mines only; those for previous years included all
deep mines.
Future plans are directed towards bringing efficient new mines into production,
developing machines for power-loading the coal at the face on to face-conveyor belts,
and reorganising the haulage systems. The NCB is engaged on a programme of major
reconstruction and new sinkings.
The great progress made in mechanisation has been mainly responsible for the
increase in productivity of 16-1 per cent between 1957 and 1961. All but a small
proportion of coal output is now mechanically cut and conveyed. In 1961, 62-2 per
cent was mechanically cleaned; for the year as a whole 48-4 per cent, and in the
month of December over 54 per cent, was power-loaded. The eventual target is
80 per cent. During 1961, on average, three men on mechanised faces could win
more coal on each shift than five men where coal was hand-filled.
Consumption and Overseas Trade
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly 4 million
tons between 1947 and 1956 and, to cover requirements in certain years, supplies
INDUSTRY
279
had to be imported from the United States. Inland sales fell sharply between 1956
and 1959, and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit heads; in i960 and again in 1961,
however, demand exceeded production and stocks were drawn upon. Growing com¬
petition from oil and increasing efficiency in the use of coal have largely contributed
to the fall in demand for coal.
About one-quarter of total output is consumed by the electricity authorities and the
same proportion by domestic and miscellaneous users. Coke ovens and the gas in¬
dustry are other large users. Since 1958 consumption by electricity authorities has
increased; consumption by railway, gas, engineering, and domestic users has tended
to fall, although there has been some improvement in the last outlet owing to marketing
of improved smokeless fuels.
Coal exports have fallen heavily in relation to pre-war levels, due, at first, partly
to increased internal consumption and, more recently, to keener competition in a
diminishing market. In 1961 exports of coal, coke and briquettes amounted to 5-5
million tons, valued at ^29-3 million, the principal markets being Denmark, the Irish
Republic, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.
Capital Investment and Development
The National Coal Board raises capital by borrowing direct from the Exchequer.
There is a statutory limit of £750 million at present on such borrowing and borrowing
above £700 million must be authorised by Order in Council. In addition, the board
may, with the permission of the Minister of Power, borrow temporarily, by way of
overdraft or otherwise, up to £20 million. The greater proportion of investment,
however, is financed from internal resources. Capital expenditure by the industry
totalled £462 million from 1947 to 1955, and about £500 million in the five years
1956 to i960. A review of its plans by the board in 1959 led to a reduction in the rate
of investment. In 1961 fixed investment amounted to ^93 million and it is expected
to be about the same in 1962. Present long-term plans provide for about three-quarters
of coal output to come from new and reconstructed collieries by 1965.
Many of the new and reconstructed pits will have a daily output of 4,000 to 6,000
tons. A few mines will be combined to give an output of up to 8,000 tons a day, the
highest compatible with British conditions. Horizon mining, already the basis of
schemes in North Staffordshire, Scotland, South Wales and Lancashire, will be
introduced elsewhere, allowing for locomotive haulage along level roads. Revised
layouts for pit-bottoms, new designs for loading stations and mechanical handling
methods are among other improvements envisaged. Exploration of coal reserves is
being intensified and the first boring for coal under the sea is in progress in the Firth
of Forth and off the Durham coast.
Research
In 1948 the NCB established a central research organisation, the Coal Research
Establishment, at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to provide
facilities for fundamental research. A second central research organisation, the Mining
Research Establishment, for the investigation of underground problems, was formed
in 1952 at Isleworth, Middlesex. A Central Engineering Establishment for developing
new machines and testing equipment is operating near Bretby, Derbyshire. Research
at Stoke Orchard had led to a promising new process for the making of smokeless
briquettes from small coal, and in 1959 the board set up a new department concerned
primarily with the development of new processes.
K
28o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The NCB also subscribes to a number of autonomous research associations in
receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR),
including the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, the British Coke Research
Association and the Coal Tar Research Association. In addition, much of the work of
other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment of the Ministry
of Power, is closely related to the board’s problems. In 1947 the NCB took over,
with other assets, the Coal Survey, a national organisation for surveying coal resources
within Britain, and 70 laboratories (in the various coalfields), which it has since extended
and modernised.
PETROLEUM
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young, a
Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from natural mineral
oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish shale deposits, yielding
similar products, were first worked in 1858.
Indigenous Production
Sources of crude oil within Britain (including oil extracted from shale) supply
altogether less than three per cent of total United Kingdom requirements, the remainder
being imported from overseas.
Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment of several
small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Eakring, Egmanton and Bothamsell), in
Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough), in Lancashire (Formby) and
in Dorset (Kimmeridge). Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields
totals over 100,000 tons. Prospecting by seismic methods in the North Sea started
in 1962.
Crude oil is extracted from shale at five shale mines and one opencast quarry
and retorted in two crude-oil works. Output of shale reached a peak of 3-4 million
tons in 1913 but has been steadily falling since i960; production amounted to some
468,000 tons in 1961, yielding about 43,000 tons of crude shale oil. From the latter,
some 41,000 tons of refined products were obtained. Some 300,000 tons of refined
benzole are derived from coke ovens and gas-works.
Indigenous crude oil both from shale and from oil wells is refined at Pumpherston,
near Edinburgh.
International Trade
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the Middle
East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce about one-third of all oil entering into international
trade, with a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on charter) amounting to
nearly one-third of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United Kingdom registered tanker
tonnage is nearly one-sixth of the world’s total.)
In 1961 the United Kingdom imported 49 million tons of crude oil valued at
£351 million; nearly half came from Kuwait, the other largest suppliers being Iraq,
Venezuela, and Iran, in that order.
Consumption
Inland consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom, apart from a
slight drop in 1957, has been expanding rapidly and in 1961 reached over 46 million
INDUSTRY
28l
tons. An outstanding feature has been the continued rapid advance in use of black oils.
Fuel oil consumption rose from 6-9 million tons in 1957 to 18-8 million tons in 1961.
The introduction of a duty on heavy oils in the 1961 Budget retarded the rate of
growth slightly. Nevertheless the demand for gas and diesel oils (excluding that used
in road vehicles) rose 11-5 per cent to about 3-9 million tons. Sales of motor spirit in
recent years have been rising by about half a million tons a year and reached 8 -1 million
tons in 1961.
A more detailed analysis of deliveries of gas and diesel oils for 1961 shows that
their most important uses were for non-industrial central heating, agricultural tractors
and the railways. Electricity generation accounted for about 30 per cent of total fuel
oil consumption, excluding that used in oil refineries; steel used 14 per cent and
non-industrial central heating a further 10 per cent. Among the remainder the largest
users were the cement, paper-making, general chemical and fishing industries. Use of
most other products increased in 1961 except for burning and vaporising oils.
Refineries
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum products
was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical to refine at the source of
production. Since the second world war, however, the industry has come to favour the
siting of refineries in the consuming areas.
By the end of 1961 refinery capacity in the United Kingdom exceeded 50 million
tons a year. Of the 16 refineries in operation, six have a capacity of under 0-2 million
tons. The largest, all of which have been considerably extended, are situated at Fawley,
near Southampton (12 million tons), Shellhaven (8 million tons), Isle of Grain (9^
million tons), both on the Thames Estuary, Stanlow (5 million tons), in Cheshire,
and Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire (4! million tons). A second refinery, of 5 million
tons a year capacity, is to be built at Milford Haven and others, at Belfast and on
Tees-side, are under construction.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) rose from
4 million tons in 1948 to the record total of 45 million tons in 1961. There is a
substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading and seasonal
requirements and the commercial arrangements of the oil companies. United Kingdom
exports, mainly in the form of heavier products to European countries, were valued
at £90 million in 1961; imports of refined products amounted to ^139 million.
Oil Pipelines
Three major oil pipelines are at present in operation in Britain. Two of these—one
in Scotland (from Finnart on Loch Long to Grangemouth) and one in South Wales
(from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy)—carry crude oil from harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries; and one, from Walton-on-Thames
to London Airport, carries aviation fuel. In addition a pipeline from the Shellhaven
refinery to Romford gasworks carries refinery gas and gas-making products. The major
oil companies are planning pipelines to take refined products from refineries to major
marketing areas, where the volume transported is sufficient to justify the capital cost.
A pipeline has been constructed to carry refined products between Stanlow, Cheshire,
and Urmston, near Manchester; another, 78 miles long, is being built to take petroleum
feedstock from Fawley refinery to the £100 million petroleum chemicals project at
Severnside, near Bristol; and another is to transport aviation fuels from Fawley to
London Airport. Meanwhile, parts of the system of pipelines laid during the second
world war are being used by the petroleum distributing companies. In 1962 the
282
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Oil Pipelines Act was passed to secure the orderly development of privately owned
industrial pipelines.
Research
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities on a
substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames (the British
Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock, in Kent (Shell),
and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). Research covers the evolution of new and improved
lubricants and the development of new uses for oil and of new products based on oil,
especially chemicals.

A public supply of electricity was first provided in 1881, at Godaiming, Surrey,
though there were earlier demonstrations of its use to consumers, such as the lighting
of the Thames Embankment by the former Metropolitan Board of Works. From
its earliest days a measure of public control has been a feature of the industry, and
the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, authorised the Board of Trade to grant licences
for the establishment of electricity undertakings by local authorities or by companies
(which the local authorities might compulsorily purchase after a given period of time)
to supply consumers in given areas. By the turn of the century, technical developments,
including the introduction of the electric motor as a source of motive power, had led
to a large increase in the scale of distribution of electricity, and a variety of independent
supply systems had grown up all over the country.
After the first world war steps were taken to reorganise the industry on a national
scale. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were set up as a supervisory body and
to promote reorganisation through voluntary agreement. Then, in 1926, the Central
Electricity Board was established to co-ordinate more efficiently the generation of
electricity. Its main duties were to concentrate the output of electricity in certain
stations, selected for their efficiency and low operating costs, and to connect these
selected stations with one another and with local distribution undertakings by means
of a national system of main transmission lines, known as the ‘grid’. Steady progress
was made in putting this plan into effect and, by March i94^> I43 selected stations,
out of some 300, were supplying 95 per cent of the electricity generated for public
supply.
Organisation under Public Ownership
Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the British
Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards took over in April 1948 the
assets of former municipal and private electricity supply undertakings throughout
Great Britain, except in the area already served by the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board (see p. 283). Under the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act of
1954, the authority’s functions in Scotland were taken over in April i955> by the
South of Scotland Electricity Board (see p. 283). The name of the authority was
changed from British Electricity Authority to Central Electricity Authority and the
number of area boards was reduced to 12.
On 1st January, 1958, under the Electricity Act, 1957, the Central Electricity
Authority was dissolved and replaced by two new bodies, the Electricity Council
and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
INDUSTRY 283
The present organisation of the electricity supply industry, in which more than
220,000 people are employed, is described below.
England and Wales
The Electricity Council, the central body of the industry, is composed of a chair¬
man, two deputy chairmen, not more than three other persons, and the chairman
and two other members of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and, ex officio,
the 12 chairmen of the Area Electricity Boards. The main functions of the council
are to advise the Minister of Power on matters relating to the electricity supply
industry. The council is responsible for a number of common services, including
capital financing and research.
The Central Electricity Generating Board consists of a chairman and not fewer
than seven, nor more than nine, other members. The board has taken over certain
of the executive functions of the former Central Electricity Authority in England
and Wales: i.e. to generate or acquire supplies of electricity and to provide bulk
supplies to the area boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for the distribution
and sale of electricity. Each consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman
and five to seven members (mostly part-time).
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act, 1947, in the area
of each board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen are ex officio
members of their respective Area Boards.
The most important functions of the Minister of Power in England and Wales
under the new arrangements are: to appoint the chairmen, deputy chairmen and
members of the Electricity Council, the Central Electricity Generating Board and the
Area Boards; to approve each area board’s capital development programmes and the
industry’s research programme; and to approve, in consultation with the Treasury,
the boards’ borrowing requirements.
The Central Electricity Authority (and its successors the Electricity Council and
the Central Electricity Generating Board) together with the Area Boards, have made
a consolidated net surplus on their operations in each of the years since they were
established. Up to and including the financial year 1960-61, these surpluses amounted
in the aggregate to over £165 million. Under the 1957 Act, each electricity board, not
merely the industry as a whole, must pay its own way, taking one year with another.
Scotland
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was set up in 1943 as a public corpora¬
tion to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands and Islands and to distribute
electricity in the more sparsely populated parts of Scotland not covered by existing
undertakings. The board consists of a chairman, and not less than four nor more than
eight other members, of whom one or more may be appointed deputy chairman,
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Act of 1947 made the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board solely responsible
to the Secretary of State for Scotland for all generation and distribution in its area.
This area was extended under the Act to include that part of Scotland north and west
of a line running roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on
the Firth of Tay.
On 1st April, 1955, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the then British Electricity Authority’s
functions in Scotland, and also the functions of the two area boards in the south
284
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of Scotland, which were dissolved. The board consists of a chairman, and not less
than four nor more than eight other members, of whom one or more may be deputy
chairmen, appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
A consultative council to represent the interests of consumers has been appointed
for the district of each board by the Secretary of State.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
Londonderry and at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast and London¬
derry are owned and operated by the city corporations and the remainder by the
Electricity Board for Northern Ireland. Generation at these stations is co-ordinated
by the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee, set up by statute in 1948, which
purchases their output and resells it to distributors—the Belfast Corporation, for
Belfast and district, the Londonderry Corporation for the City of Londonderry, and
the Electricity Board for the rest of Northern Ireland.
Generation
Most of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam generating stations.
The country has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water transport
for moving it, while water-power resources are relatively small and in remote areas.
The development of hydro-electricity on any scale is comparatively recent.
The installed generating capacity of the electricity authorities (including the North
of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board) in Great Britain at the end of 1961 totalled 33,915
megawatts (MW), an increase of about 38 per cent since 1956. In recent years about
2,000 MW of new plant has been commissioned each year but in the period up to
1966 this will be increased to over 3,000 MW a year.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where of the total installed generating
capacity of 689 MW, 120 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in coal-fired thermal
stations) amounted to 1,536 million kilowatt-hours in 1961.
In 1961 over 124,000 million kilowatt-hours, or slightly under 98 per cent of the
public supply in Great Britain, was generated at conventional thermal stations,
and almost all the remainder from water-power. The high rate of expansion of output,
which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has been maintained
since the war. Total production in 1961 was nearly 12 times that of 1930, and had
increased by about 50 per cent since 1956.
An analysis of electricity generation in Great Britain is given in Table 16.
In the mid-1950s, when a coal shortage seemed likely, programmes for oil-firing
at conventional thermal stations and for generating from nuclear energy were intro¬
duced. There are thirteen oil-burning power stations, or parts of stations, operating in
Great Britain. They are mainly situated on river estuaries and thus able to be fed
conveniently from nearby oil refineries.
Conventional Thermal
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in Britain,
and although most of their electricity generation is based on coal, oil consumption
rose from a negligible quantity in 1955 to over 5! million tons in 1961. Average thermal
efficiency of conventional steam stations in England and Wales (i.e. the ratio of power
output to the fuel consumed) rose from 20-75 per cent in 1947 to 27-24 per cent in
1961 as new plant was brought into use. Twenty stations containing much of the
newest plant had an average efficiency of 32-31 per cent in that year.
INDUSTRY
285
The largest generating sets in operation are the 200 MW set at High Marnham,
in the east Midlands, and a set of 275 MW capacity at Blyth ‘B’ station in Northumber¬
land. In 1963 a 550 MW set is due to come into use at Thorpe Marsh, near Doncaster.
These large machines will show substantial economies in capital cost, in fuel con¬
sumption and in operational costs. Station capacities are also increasing; the largest
stations under construction are the West Burton station, near Gainsborough, Lincoln¬
shire, due for completion in 1967, which will have an ultimate capacity of 2,000 MW
and will use generating sets of 500 MW, and twTo further stations of similar size to be
built in Yorkshire. A station at Cockenzie, in Scotland, will have four 300 MW
generating sets.

Hydro-Electric
The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943 marked the
beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the Highlands of Scotland.
A development scheme drawn up by the board in 1944, showing the water-power
resources which it proposed to examine, listed 102 hydro-electric projects with an
estimated annual output of 6,274 million units of electricity. In 1961, 2,733 million
units were generated by the North of Scotland Board from water-power, compaied
with 322 million in 1949. At the end of 1961 there were 44 main hydro-electric stations
in operation in the north of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 885 MW and
the largest—the Loch Sloy station—had a capacity of 130 MW; further hydro-electric
schemes with a total installed capacity of 563 MW were under construction, including
400 MW of pumped storage in the Loch Awe scheme, and a further 579 MW were
under consideration. The board also had 171 MW of coal and diesel-fired capacity.
In addition, there are stations generating electricity by water-power in the south of
Scotland (123 MW) and in Wales (175 MW).
Nuclear Power Stations
As an extension of its experimental work and to produce plutonium, the Atomic
Energy Authority (AEA) has two stations which also produce electricity—at Calder
Hall, Cumberland, and Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire, both of about 180 MW output
286
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
capacity. The first started operating in May 1956 and was officially connected to the
grid by the Queen in October of that year; the second, Chapelcross, started supplying
electricity in February 1959. These two nuclear power stations are supplying 2,000
million units of electricity annually for the national grid.
The main commercial stations under the Government’s nuclear power programme
are being built for the electricity authorities by groups of engineering firms specially
organised for the construction of nuclear power plants.
Special factors have to be taken into account in the siting of the nuclear power
stations, notably the need for firm rock foundations to bear the weight of the reactors
and their supporting structure, a location distant from heavily built-up areas, and
plentiful supplies of water for cooling. Great care is taken to preserve amenity and
landscape beauty.
Eight stations are under construction; all, with a total output capacity of some
3,500 MW, should be completed before the end of 1967. In i960 the Government
announced modifications in the earlier programme, to take account of the fact that
coal had become plentiful and oil supplies had also improved. The intention now is
to place orders for about one station a year. As it is expected that it will be possible to
increase the capacity of stations over the years, there will be a steady rise in the rate of
commissioning nuclear generating capacity, which should total about 5,000 MW in
1968.
The stations at Bradwell (300 MW output capacity), in Essex, and at Berkeley
(275 MW), in Gloucestershire, begun in January 1957, came into full operation in the
summer of 1962. Hinkley Point (500 MW), in Somerset, should be in operation in
1963. Hunterston (300 MW), in Ayrshire, and Trawsfynydd (500 MW), in North Wales,
and Dungeness (550 MW), in Kent, should all be in operation in 1964, and Size-
well (580 MW), in Suffolk, in 1966. A station at Oldbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire
(550 MW), is due for completion in 1966. Consent has been given for a ninth station,
of about 800 MW, at Wylfa, Anglesey, and for an additional station at Hinkley Point
of 1,000 MW, and sites for additional stations are being considered.
Pumped Storage
In order that generating stations, especially nuclear stations with their higher
capital costs and lower operating costs, should be run as continuously as possible,
pumped storage schemes are being developed. In these schemes, electricity generated
in off-peak periods is used to pump water to higher levels from which it descends at
peak periods to operate turbo-generators. The 300 MW pumped storage station at
Blaenau Ffestiniog, near Trawsfynydd, in North Wales, is the largest in the world.
It started operating in 1961 and will be completed in 1963; suitable sites for other
schemes are being investigated. The first large-scale pumped storage works in Scotland,
comprising a 400 MW combined pumping and generating plant costing some ^24-5
million, forms part of the Loch Awe project, and is expected to come into operation
in 1965.
Sites in Northern Ireland suitable for this type of project have been surveyed.
Transmission and Distribution
Main electricity transmission lines—the National Grid—cover most of the country.
In 1961 those of the Central Electricity Generating Board totalled some 7,600 route
miles (12,600 circuit miles), of which 1,500 miles were operated at 275,000 volts, 5,733
miles were operated at 132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts and below.
In Scotland there were 3,100 circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of
INDUSTRY
287
1961, of which 289 circuit miles operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000
volts. Energy movements on the grid in England and Wales are controlled through the
seven operational areas, set up for that purpose and distinct from the divisions in
which the generating side of the industry is organised; each area has a separate control,
and the operations are co-ordinated by a National Control in London. The grid in
Scotland is operated from the control centres at Tummel Bridge (North of Scotland)
and at Kirkintilloch (South of Scotland).
The new ‘supergrid’ of main transmission lines operating at 275,000 volts is to
be up-rated to 400,000 volts, starting in 1965. This is being done to reduce the number
of transmission lines needed to meet the country’s increasing power demands. The
development of the grid system has made the British system the most closely integrated
power network in the world. A link interchange of energy by direct current by means of
twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, costing £4-2- million,
and capable of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current) came into
operation in 1961. Its object is to take advantage of the differences between France and
Britain in the timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers electricity
acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board, but in part from
other sources, such as collieries and the nuclear power stations of the AEA. There
are 16 million consumers, an increase of about million on those supplied in
December 1939. Industrial concerns are the biggest users of electricity and their
demands are increasing rapidly as are those of domestic consumers; the principal
domestic uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking, and for space and water heating,
but the demand for numerous other domestic purposes is rising steadily.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with the
distribution of electricity to consumers in the north of Scotland. At the end of 1961
it had 400,000 consumers of electricity, many of them in remote areas, and 82 per cent
of the farms and crofts had a supply of electricity. At the same date the South of
Scotland Electricity Board supplied 1-4 million consumers, including about 95 per
cent of the farmers in the area.
Capital Investment
Nearly 8 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United Kingdom
in 1961 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. Future needs of capital are
likely to be heavy. In England and Wales the Electricity Council estimates that the
consumption of electricity will rise by an annual average of 8 per cent.
Total capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry in Great Britain from
the time of its nationalisation (in 1948) to 31st March, 1961 (in the case of the Electri¬
city Council), and the 31st December, i960 (in the case of the Scottish Boards),
amounted to about £2,950 million, of which about two-fifths had been financed from
internal resources. The aggregate outstanding borrowing of the electricity supply
industry in Great Britain is limited to £2,675 million (£2,300 million for the Electricity
Council, £135 million for the South of Scotland Electricity Board and £240 million
for the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board). The Government’s policy on the
financial objectives of the nationalised industries has been set out in the White Paper
Cmnd. 1337.1 For the electricity supply industry in England and Wales the objective
is a gross return on net assets of 12-4 per cent over the 5 years 1962-63 to 1966-67,
involving an aggregate net surplus of £336 million over the period.

Research
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Minister of Power, is responsible
for drawing up a general programme of research, comprising: direct research carried
out by the Electricity Boards themselves; sponsored research undertaken for the
supply industry by universities and colleges; and co-operative research with other
organisations, in particular the industrial research associations, such as the British
Electrical and Allied Industries Research Association, to which the supply industries
subscribe. The council itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the
Electricity Supply Research Council.
The main research establishment of the industry is the Central Electricity Research
Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey. Research laboratories of the CEGB concerned
with nuclear power were opened in 1961, adjacent to the Berkeley nuclear power
station in Gloucestershire.
The Atomic Energy Authority’s research into improved types of nuclear power
reactors includes work on fast breeder reactors at Dounreay, Caithness; on advanced
gas-cooled reactors at Windscale, Cumberland; and on high-temperature gas-cooled
reactors at Winfrith, Dorset.
Both Scottish electricity boards are empowered to carry out research and experi¬
mental work either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board undertakes a wide range of research and
development work, both independently and in conjunction with the British Electrical
and Allied Industries Research Association, colleges of science and technology, univer¬
sities and manufacturers. The South of Scotland Electricity Board has recently
extended its own research activities and is associated fully with those of the Electricity
Council and Central Electricity Generating Board in England.
GAS SUPPLY
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke
Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In the early years
of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting and was provided by
a growing number of company and municipal undertakings. After the invention of
the Bunsen burner in 1855 gas was used increasingly as a source of heat for many
purposes, such as domestic cooking and space and water heating, in addition to a
number of industrial uses. In the last 20 years of the nineteenth century, however,
gas for lighting purposes was subjected to competition from the new electricity supply
industry; but the invention of the Welsbach incandescent mantle in 1887, which raised
the efficiency of gas lighting very considerably, enabled the industry to hold its own,
while the use of gas for purposes other than lighting increased.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the period
between the two world wars when increasing competition from electricity had to be
met and when changes in social habits and outlook were taking place. The industry
undertook a large-scale programme of modernisation of production and distribution
and launched widespread sales promotion campaigns, especially for the numerous uses
of gas in the home. By 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating
instead of lighting.
Organisation under Public Ownership
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about 125,000
persons are at present employed, under public ownership and control on 1st May, 1949-
INDUSTRY
289
The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to local authorities, were vested
in 12 Area Gas Boards. The central body is the Gas Council, appointed by the Minister
of Power. It is a co-ordinating council, not a trading body, consisting of a full-time
chairman and deputy chairman and the 12 chairmen of the area boards. Its general
duties are to advise the Minister on questions affecting the industry and promote the
efficient performance of their duties by the area boards. It has also specific duties
relating to finance, labour relations and research.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies of the other
publicly owned corporations, are responsible for manufacturing gas and distributing
it to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards, appointed by the Minister of Power,
consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman, in some cases one or more full¬
time members, and usually five or six part-time members, including the chairman of
the Area Consultative Council. There is no common pattern of organisation; each
board is fully independent and has devised its own subordinate structure. Each is
required to pay its way, taking one year with another. The operations of the area
boards have resulted, in the 12 years up to 31st March, 1961, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of approximately ^25 million, before taxation.
When the industry came under public ownership, a link between it and the con¬
suming public was established by the creation of a Consultative Council in each board
area. These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and not more than 30 members, of
whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen from panels of persons nominated by the
local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a number
of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
Production
In 1961, in Great Britain, 22 million tons of coal were carbonised by gas under¬
takings and 26-8 million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas industry. Nearly
one-third of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas undertakings for general
distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or at collieries or steel¬
works. Between 1921 and 1940 the number of consumers increased from 7-6 million
to over 11 million. It had risen to over 12-9 million by 1957 and has since fallen slightly.
Gas manufactured and acquired from coke ovens and other sources for distribution
exceeds 600,000 million cubic feet.
In 1961 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was almost 7,000 million
cubic feet, most of it for household use.
Consumption
Half of all gas is sold by gas boards for household use and the remainder for industrial
and commercial purposes. Total consumption has been relatively static in recent years,
but the level in 1961 showed an increase over that for 1959, though it was no higher
than in 1955.
Domestic Use. About 70 per cent of the domestic load is used for cooking, the
remaining 30 per cent being spread over space heating, water heating and other
installations. Most homes in Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some rural
areas where, owing to difficulties in storage and transmission, gas is not economic.
Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural areas.
Industrial and Commercial Use. Gas is used extensively in industries which require
the control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery
290
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industry and in certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In
1961 sales of gas to industry totalled 180,000 million cubic feet.
Coke and By-products
Production of coke at gas works in 1961 was 9-8 million tons, and at coke ovens
17-8 million tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce about 3 million
tons of crude coal tar and over 100 million gallons of crude benzole a year. These latter
by-products yield materials widely employed in the newer branches of the chemical
industry and also in other industries.
Capital Investment
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas Boards
was limited to £250 million. In 1954 the industry’s borrowing powers were increased
to £450 million, and in i960 to £500 million (or up to £525 million if authorised by
Order in Council) in the period up to 31st March, 1966.
The industry in recent years has been spending about .£50 million a year on capital
investment. Between vesting day (1st May, 1949) and March 1962, about £580 million
had been invested in fixed assets. Expenditure of ^52-5 million is approved for
1962-63.
Lines of Future Development
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable integration
by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas (through gas grids and
long-distance mains), enabling production to be concentrated in the most efficient
units.
In order to compete fully with other fuels, the gas industry is seeking ways of reducing
costs of production. Processes for gasifying coal of inferior quality are being investigated.
At Westfield, in Fife, Scotland, a gas plant, costing £6-6 million, and using low grade
coal, began production in December i960, and was completed in 1962. It produces
30 million cubic feet of gas a day, about one-fifth of the total gas requirements of
Scotland. The plant marks a change from conventional carbonisation of coal to the use
of chemical processes. Because the gas will be made at high pressure, it will be possible
to pipe it through a 133-mile grid-main covering industrial Scotland. Further
advantages of this method are low costs and the production of by-products such as
tar, ammonia and benzole. A similar plant is being erected at Coleshill, near
Birmingham.
Alternative sources of gas are being developed by the Gas Council. Gases from oil
refineries (butane or propane) are used in several installations in smaller towns remote
from large gas works or the grid systems. Progress has also been made with the use
of methane, drained from coal mines, and of surplus gases from oil refineries. A
number of oil gasification plants have been built. These include a plant constructed
by the South Eastern Gas Board adjacent to the British Petroleum Company’s refinery
at Isle of Grain, Kent, which converts some 70,000 tons of petroleum products a year
and has a daily output of 45 million cubic feet of gas. Trial shipments of liquid natural
gas were made in 1958 and 1959 from the United States Gulf Coast. The gas, after
being stored at Canvey Island, Essex, was modified at the Romford gas works for
public use. The Gas Council has since signed a 15-year contract for the purchase of
natural gas from the Sahara in specially constructed refrigerated tankers. Deliveries
are to start in 1964 and will rise to about 35,000 million cu. ft. of gas annually, equiva¬
lent to some 10 per cent of total consumption.
INDUSTRY
29I
Research
The Gas Council’s research organisation consists of a research committee which
advises on the initiation and implementation of research policy, two research stations,
one in London and one at Solihull, and the Watson House Centre at Fulham, London,
for the design, testing and development of appliances. Research is also carried out on
behalf of the Gas Council at Leeds University and at other universities and colleges.
FUEL EFFICIENCY
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has been
assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and by the technical
advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National Coal Board,
coal distributors and coal appliance manufacturers and distributors. Originally formed
in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users on the best use of solid fuel, including
the choice of installation and the operation of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service, was
formed in 1954 by the fuel and power industries to promote fuel saving in industry.
It provides advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of forms, from
‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and power surveys and regular visits on a contract
basis.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, in general, sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. The sources of water are often distant from the areas where supplies
are needed, however, and water undertakings are therefore mainly concerned with
abstraction, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from
surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering
grounds and river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells,
adits and boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity
and gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings of
different kinds. Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests with the
Minister of Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with the Secretary
of State for Scotland in Scotland and with the Minister of Health and Local Government
in Northern Ireland.
Organisation of Water Supply in England and Wales
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies became
a general public service and then only after long and bitter controversy. It was largely
due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues, who demonstrated the dangers
arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation, that the Public Health Act, 1848,
became law in England and Wales and laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing
with public health.
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of water under¬
takings were set up to provide water to the expanding urban population, and the
water supply system developed rapidly, although in piecemeal fashion and with some
overlapping and waste.
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water supplies
are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this either by operating
water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other bodies are providing adequate
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
292
supplies. The householder receives his domestic water supply at a comparatively small
charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of a water rate levied,
like other rates, on the value of his house. Industrial users are charged according to
consumption as recorded by meter.
Under the Water Act, 1945, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has
a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in England and
Wales. A statutory Central Advisory Water Committee advises the Minister on
general questions relating to water and organisation of supplies. Since the passing of
the Act, some 580 smaller water authorities in England and Wales have been absorbed
by larger authorities or by the creation of joint boards in order to improve the efficiency
of the water supply industry. In March 1962 there were in England and Wales 487
local authority water undertakings, 95 joint water boards (including bulk supply
boards) and 8 joint water committees, 53 statutory water companies, 11 non-statutory
water companies, and 3 private proprietors with statutory powers. A considerable
number of private proprietors without statutory powers also provide small supplies.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which is probably the largest single water under¬
taking in the world, supplies about 360 million gallons daily to about million
people in the London area. It consists of 88 part-time members who are the elected
representatives of the various local authorities within the board’s area of operations,
together with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Conservancies.
Under the plans for the reorganisation of local government in London (see p. 78),
the functions of the board may be transferred to the Greater London Council.
Present Supplies in England and Wales
Today, piped water reaches over 95 per cent of the total population of England
and Wales and about 90 per cent of the rural population.
Capital expenditure by water undertakers amounts to between £40 million and £50
million a year. Interest, together with running costs, is largely met from annual income.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934, and under the Rural Water Supplies
and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955. By March 1962 schemes costing £90 million had
been completed or were in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, the needs of industry having grown so much that in many areas they now
exceed domestic demand. The use of water in irrigation of farm land is also growing;
it is estimated that the area of land under irrigation is increasing by 15 Per cent a
year. In order that the country’s water resources should be developed to meet these
growing requirements the Government has proposed a new structure of administration
for the control of water in rivers and underground, consisting of 27 river authorities
and a central advisory body (Water Conservation, England and Wales, Cmnd. 1693).
The river authorities would manage the water resources of river basins, superseding
the existing river boards (see p. 343) an<^ taking over their functions of land drainage,
flood control, administration of fisheries and prevention of pollution. They would be
responsible for assessing water resources and requirements, controlling and developing
resources, and allocating water between users by a system of licensing. Special arrange¬
ments, based on existing authorities, would be made for the Greater London area,
which is not considered suitable for administration by a self-contained river authority.
The work of the river authorities would be co-ordinated by a new expert central
advisory authority accountable to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
Its duties would include the review of national water resources and requirements,
INDUSTRY
293
the encouragement of the transfer of water between areas according to need, the
co-ordination of proposals of river authorities for capital investment and the initiation
of research. Water conservation is expected to be financially self-supporting, the cost
being met from charges made to abstractors and users of water. Legislation based on
these proposals is to be put before Parliament.
Water Supply in Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local authorities,
either separately or in combination with each other; they supply over 95 per cent of
the total population. The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in
England and Wales except that there is not the same need to allocate water between
competing interests and less reliance needs to be placed on underground sources.
The Water (Scotland) Acts, 1946 and 1949, among other provisions, impose a general
duty on the Secretary of State to promote the conservation of water resources in
Scotland; require local authorities to provide supplies of wdiolesome water everywhere
in their districts, where this can be done at reasonable cost; and provide for a uniform
system of rating for water throughout the country. The Scottish Water Advisory
Committee advises the Secretary of State on general questions relating to resources
and supplies. The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955, make
available to Scottish local authorities grant assistance up to a maximum of £30 million
towards the cost of water supplies and sewerage schemes in rural areas. By December
1961 the total value of work done on new and improved water supplies since 1945
amounted to £59 million, of which £27-9 million represents works aided by grants
under these Acts.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and industrial
consumption. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, made
it obligatory for water supply authorities to provide a supply of wholesome water to
houses and schools in their areas where this could be done at reasonable cost, and also
empowered the Ministry of Health and Local Government to make grants towards
the costs of schemes undertaken by these authorities. Before 1945 only the more
densely populated areas had a piped supply, but progress has been such that even in
the thinly populated rural districts most households have now been, or soon will be,
connected to a piped supply. By 3Ist March, 1962, ^3° milli°n had been expended,
including grants totalling ^12-9 million.
In October 1961 the Minister of Health and Local Government appointed a Water
Resources Committee which is making a detailed study of water in the province.
Measurement of Water Resources
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation s surface water
resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain, published
annually by H.M. Stationery Office. This publication contains particulars of the run¬
off and related rainfall from a large number of rivers, streams and reservoired areas.
The Surface Water Survey Centre of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government
is responsible for the promotion of gauging, the collection of hydrological information,
and the publication of the year book. The field work of surface water measurement is
carried out by river boards, water undertakings and other bodies. General information
on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the responsibility of the
Meteorological Office, while the subject of ground water is dealt with by the Geological
Survey and Museum. In special cases the Hydraulics Research Station of the Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research carries out research into problems of the
294
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of surface
water.
Water Pollution
The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Acts, 1951-61, give river boards (see p. 343;
the term includes the Thames and Lee Conservancies) extensive powers to control
the discharge of polluting matter into rivers and certain tidal waters. Control of
pollution in the tidal Thames is exercised by the Port of London Authority (see
p. 365). There is a similar Act for Scotland, under which nine river purification boards
have been set up to promote the cleanliness of the rivers in their areas.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research is engaged in investigating problems connected with the treat¬
ment of water for domestic and industrial supply, the treatment and disposal of
sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention of pollution of
surface water and underground water. Research is carried out with general supervision
and advice from the Water Pollution Research Board of the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industries comprise firms engaged wholly or mainly on con¬
struction, alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, sewers,
waterworks, harbours and canals, electric wiring, heating and other installation work,
open-cast coal prospecting and mining, non-electrical work at power stations and
structural work connected with telecommunications. The industries employ some
11 million persons and provide about 6 per cent of the gross national product. They
also make an important contribution to overseas development.
Structure
Over four-fifths of all constructional work is done by private concerns. The majority
of firms are small or medium sized. Nearly 28 per cent of the firms in the industry are
one-man businesses engaged in such trades as house painting or plumbing, and over
80 per cent employ fewer than 10 persons. At the other end of the scale there are only
about 80 firms of building and civil engineering contractors employing more than
1,000 persons each. Some of these are integrated concerns owning quarries as well
as workshops, extensive stocks of mechanical plant, and the standard stores and tackle
of builders’ yards; they also undertake large-scale constructional contracts overseas.
Some firms are prepared to offer a ‘package’ service comprising complete responsibility
for projects from design to finished building.
There are also over 250 United Kingdom firms of consulting engineers which
undertake detailed investigations of constructional projects, report on the type of
work recommended and materials required, provide estimates of the time and cost of
construction, obtain competitive tenders from contracting firms and supervise the
carrying out of the work by the contractor. In addition, there are hundreds of firms of
architects which are concerned with the design, planning and supervision of building
and civil engineering projects in association with quantity surveyors for costing.
A growing proportion of construction work, in Britain and overseas, is being under¬
taken by ‘consortia’, i.e. organisations in which several firms group together to secure
large contracts—such as the building of nuclear power stations—which are beyond
the technical or financial resources of a single firm.
INDUSTRY
295
Value of Output
The value of the annual output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily since
1945 and especially since 1958; the total for Great Britain in 1961 is estimated to amount
to £2,845 million. Of this total, £442 million represents work carried out by the staffs
employed directly by the public authorities (including Government departments, local
authorities and certain public utilities), while the balance of £2,403 million represents
the output of private firms (new work, £1,881 million, and other work, £522 million).
According to the index of industrial production its volume of output rose by 18 per cent
between 1958 and 1961.
Housing Construction
In the post-war period most new houses in Britain have been built by private
firms working under contract to local authorities, but the proportion built by private
firms for private owners has increased appreciably since 1951 (see Chapter 6, Planning
and Housing). About 9 per cent of local authorities in England and Wales employ
direct labour in housing construction. In 1961 the value of new housing built in
Great Britain by private firms was £742 million, of which £469 million was for private
developers and £273 million for public authorities.
Between 1945 and the end of 1961 about 4 million new permanent houses and other
dwellings were built in the United Kingdom (including over 95,000 in Northern
Ireland), besides some 160,000 temporary houses constructed in the immediate
post-war years with extensive use of prefabrication techniques.
Civil Engineering and Industrial Building
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale modern
industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment to carry out
major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent figures in the
early development of civil engineering included: James Brindley (1716-1772), builder
of canals; John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), pioneer in road construction; Thomas
Telford (1757-1834), builder of roads, docks and bridges; and George Stephenson
(1781-1848), Robert Stephenson (1803-1859), Joseph Locke (1805-1860), Isambard
Kingdom Brunei (1806-1859) and Thomas Brassey (1805-1870), builders of
railways.
The principal professional body in the civil engineering industry is the Institution
of Civil Engineers, incorporated by Royal Charter in 1828.
Within the United Kingdom the industry has been occupied since the war with
large-scale reconstruction and development schemes. These have included work
on the repair, modernisation and electrification of railways, road and dock develop¬
ment schemes, airports, sea defence works, thermo-electric and hydro-electric power
stations, improved water supplies, and drainage and sewerage systems.
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom in 1962
were a 26-storey office block with a 400 foot tower being built in Manchester at a
cost of £5 million; the new 10-storey West London Air Terminal with an underground
garage for 140 cars, which is being built for BEA at a cost of £3-5 million; and a
nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk with a net output of 580 MW, costing
£55 million and due for completion in 1966. Large-scale bridge-building projects in
hand include a road suspension bridge across the river Severn which will be the
largest in the world outside the United States; and the Medway bridge with the
world’s largest pre-stressed clear span (500 ft.).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
296
In Great Britain since the war, more than 34,000 industrial buildings of over 5,000
sq. ft. (with a total area of over 873 million sq. ft.) and many smaller factories have
been erected.
Output in Northern Ireland
Developments in the building and civil engineering industries in Northern Ireland
have followed much the same pattern as in Great Britain.
The output of these industries has been relatively higher in Northern Ireland
since 1946 than before the war, as considerable leeway had to be made up. Progress
has been particularly marked in housing, hospitals and educational buildings, water
supply and sewerage, road reconstruction schemes, arterial drainage and harbour
schemes. An extensive programme of factory construction has been under way since
1947 with the object of attracting new industries to Northern Ireland.
Overseas Constructional Work
Constructional work carried out overseas by British firms has included railways
in most parts of the world; large-scale irrigation works in India, Pakistan, Egypt,
and Greece; and canals, roads, docks, harbours, power stations, airfields, hydro¬
electric schemes and industrial and housing estates in several countries. British
conditions of contract for international civil engineering work have been widely
adopted as standard throughout the world.
British consulting engineers have built up a tradition of knowledge and integrity,
which has caused their services to be in demand throughout the world. During i960
they were involved in building and civil engineering projects in all five continents
costing over £550 million. British construction firms were exclusively responsible for
projects costing £168 million and shared a further £157 million worth of contracts
with firms from other countries.1 Important overseas projects in which the consulting
engineers and holders of the main construction contract are all British are the new deep
water harbour at Barbados, which cost £3-7 million and was completed in 1961, and
Tema Harbour in Ghana which was opened in 1962 and, when completed, will have
cost over £21 million, including preliminary work which was also done by a British firm.
Similar examples are the drainage and irrigation schemes at Black Bush Polder and
Tapakuma in British Guiana, costing together over ^4 million. In the Sudan a
British consulting engineer and British construction, textile machinery and electrical
firms are co-operating in the construction and equipment of two cotton ginning factories
which will cost £1-4 million. A British firm is the sole contractor for the design,
procurement and construction of a polyethylene plant, started in i960 at Altona in
Australia and expected to cost ^4 million. The consulting engineer in this case is
not a United Kingdom firm.
It has been estimated that the value of work done during the year ended March
1962 by 60 principal British building and civil engineering firms, operating in some
62 countries, was ^113 million, compared with £135 million in the previous year;
the value of contracts obtained rose from £g8 million in 1960-61 to £122 million in
1961-62. Just over half of this was done in the sterling area.
Research and Development
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) set up the Building
Research Station in 1921, and thus made Britain the pioneer of organised building
1 The foregoing figures refer to contracts completed during i960 and in hand at the end of
that year.
INDUSTRY
297
research. Work affecting the construction industries is also carried on in several of the
other research laboratories connected with the DSIR, such as the Hydraulics Research
Station and the Road Research Laboratory, the Heating and Ventilating Research
Association and the Welding Research Association. Large manufacturing firms have
laboratories, some of the work of which is concerned with construction, and the major
construction firms have research departments working on plant, materials and methods.
Other bodies concerned with such research include the Admiralty, universities and
colleges of technology.
In construction plant, a notable British contribution is Ransomes and Rapier s
walking dragline, an earth-moving machine which is moved over the ground by
walking beams. The largest model has a capacity of 40 cubic yards of earth.
Concrete is probably the construction material now used in greatest volume through¬
out the world, and several contributions to concrete technique have been made in
Britain since 1945, including methods of pre-stressing invented by small firms and the
development of various additives which can be used to impart special qualities to the
concrete or to overcome the limitations of natural materials. A cost-reducing process
for making sheet glass, known as ‘float glass’, which can be used for windows and
mirrors, has recently been invented in Britain.
Prefabrication is a method of construction which has been successfully developed
in Britain during the past twenty years. The assembly of standardised parts saves
labour on the site, which may be a great advantage in less-developed areas and has
been applied to bridges, houses and large buildings. An interesting example is the
solution of the problem of building new schools in Britain reached by a group of local
and other public authorities known as CLASP. The techniques developed by CLASP
are being exported to Germany and Italy.
Experimental tests with models to assist in the planning of hydraulic projects
involving large expenditure were first used in Britain, and then the initiative passed
overseas. In 1947, however, the British Government founded the Hydraulics Research
Station, one of whose functions is to make model studies of specific problems. This
research station has investigated problems connected with the port at Chittagong in
Pakistan, the new harbour works at Tema in Ghana, Hong Kong, and Escravos,
Nigeria, and with dams in Malaya, Greece, Venezuela and Pakistan.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries provide a wide range of products, many of
which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by 15 per cent
since 1958, though there was only a marginal increase between i960 and 1961. In 1961
this sector spent £1,276 million on fixed capital equipment, including £354 million
on building work and £850 million on plant and machinery. The number of employees
in manufacturing industry (including the unemployed and those absent from work
through sickness and other causes, but excluding employers and the self-employed)
was 9-1 million at the end of May 1961, 39 per cent of the total number of
employees.
Manufacturers’ prices, which had risen by more than 3 Per cent a year from 1954
to early 1957, increased very little from then until the end of 1959; by i960 the
average price of manufactured products had begun to rise again, and in 1961 prices
were 2-5 per cent higher than in i960, though in the latter part of 1961 the rate of
increase was much lower.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
298
The employment and net output figures listed in Table 17 give an indication of
the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry. (Net output is
the value added by productive activity of firms in the industry.) Expansion has been
particularly rapid in electronics, most sections of electrical engineering, most branches
of the chemical industry and man-made fibres.
In the subsequent sections, statistics relating to firms are those of enterprises given
in the Census of Production for 1958, statistics of employees refer to numbers at end
May 1961, and export statistics are taken from the Accounts Relating to Trade and
Navigation in the United Kingdom.

METAL MANUFACTURE
The metal manufacturing industries employed 638,000 persons in May 1961. Of
these, 364,000 were in the iron and steel industry, 128,500 in the manufacture of iron
castings, 58,000 in the manufacture of light metals, and 88,000 in the copper, brass
and other base metal industries. Exports had an aggregate value of X3I4-6 million.
Iron and Steel
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards, and British inventors were responsible for the discovery
INDUSTRY
299
of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in the second half
of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s fifth largest steel producing
nation. Output of ingots and castings in 1961 totalled 22-1 million tons, somewhat
below the record level of 24-3 million tons in i960, but well above the 1946 level of
12-7 million tons; 12-7 million tons of pig iron and 11-5 million tons of scrap were
consumed. Pig iron production amounted to 14-7 million tons.
Deliveries of finished steel amounted to 16-8 million tons in 1961, and the 3-4
million tons of iron and steel products which were exported had a value of £211-7
million; India (£12-5 million), New Zealand (£12 million), Sweden and the United
States were the main overseas buyers.
The main producing districts are: South Wales (22 per cent of total crude steel
output); the north-east of England (20 per cent); Sheffield and district (13 per cent);
Lincolnshire (11 per cent) and Scotland (11 per cent). Other important areas are
Lancashire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Northamptonshire, and the north-west coast of
England. South Wales concentrates mainly on the manufacture of flat products,
especially sheet steel and tinplate; the output of the north-east coast and Scotland is
predominantly of heavy steel products (plates, sections and rails); Sheffield is res¬
ponsible for 70 per cent of the United Kingdom alloy steel production.
During the period 1946-61 over £1,100 million was spent on capital development,
including £200 million in 1961. As a result, Britain has some of the most modern
plant in Europe. Major schemes still to be completed include those involving the
use of oxygen both in modified large open-hearth furnaces and in the new converter
processes. Five companies are installing enlarged electric arc furnaces of over 100 tons
capacity. By 1965 it is estimated that open-hearth steel will have declined from 85 per
cent to 67 per cent of total output; converter steel will have increased from 8 per cent
to 21 per cent, and electric steel from 7 per cent to 12 per cent. Total capacity in 1965
may exceed 34 million tons.
Larger and more efficient blast furnaces (in some cases exceeding 30 ft. hearth
diameter) have been installed and coke consumption has been reduced by improvements
in the preparation of raw materials. Extensive experiments are taking place on the use
of fuel injection and oxygen-enriched blast. The industry controls a fleet of 73 special
ore carriers.
Many companies have developments to improve the quality and range of finished
products, including continuous mills to roll rods, strip bars and other items. Out¬
standing projects nearing completion in 1962 include the erection of new works for
the production of sheet on strip mills at Newport (Monmouthshire) and at Ravenscraxg
(Scotland).
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public supervision
since 1932, when a Government-appointed body, the Import Duties Advisory Com¬
mittee, gave special attention to the reorganisation of the industry. In February 195*
the greater part of the industry came under public ownership by virtue of the Iron and
Steel Act, 1949. The 1949 Act was repealed by the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, which
established an Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency with the duty of return¬
ing the companies to private ownership. The number of companies in which the
Agency has a controlling shareholding has been reduced from 81 in July 1953 7 ^
the end of 1961 (including one major company and one company in voluntary
liquidation).
The 1953 Act also provided for the establishment of the Iron and Steel Board to
exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry. Alembers of the Board
are appointed by the Government and it is financed by levies which it has power to
3 00
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
make on firms in the industry. The major trade association in the iron and steel
industry, excluding iron founding, is the British Iron and Steel Federation.
Iron Castings
Output of iron castings was 3-8 million tons in 1961, compared with 3-5 million tons
in 1959 and 2-54 million tons in 1946. Over 1 million tons are used annually in the
general engineering industry, over 700,000 tons in the motor vehicle industry, about
500,000 tons each in the manufacture of pressure pipes and fittings and some 600,000
tons in the steel industry. An important part of total output consists of grey and
malleable iron castings for use in motor vehicles, tractors, machine tools, engines and
all kinds of power unit.
There are about 1,400 firms in the industry, which includes blast furnaces other
than those forming part of integrated steelworks; the output of pig iron is consequently
only a small proportion of the total. Exports are included in the total of steel exports
in the previous section.
Non-Ferrous Metals
The United Kingdom non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a
consumer of aluminium, copper, lead and zinc Britain is second only to the United
States among western countries. Output in 1961 included: aluminium, 32,000 tons
of virgin metal and 220,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 129,000 tons of
virgin copper and 105,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 86,000 tons of refined metal;
zinc 93,000 tons of slab metal; and tin, 26,000 tons. Mining in Britain is confined to
the working of lead, tin and tungsten ores on a small scale.
In 1961 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at ,£102-8 million. The
main products exported were copper and copper alloys (£48 million), aluminium and
its alloys (£17-6 million), nickel and its alloys (,£20-1 million), and tin and its alloys
(,£io-1 million). These totals include the value of semi-finished products. Western
Germany (,£11-2 million) and the United States (^£8-5 million) were the largest
purchasing countries. There weie also substantial exports of finished products in¬
corporating non-ferrous semi-finished products and non-ferrous metals in many
finished forms.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres include South
Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth. It consists of 915 firms engaged in smelting,
casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing. The techniques of powder
metallurgy and pressure diecasting are also employed. Some non-ferrous metals such
as nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium are largely used in the making of high
speed and tool steels. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties have
emerged with the growth of new industries having particular requirements, as, for
example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium, beryllium), jet aircraft
(niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic apparatus (selenium, silicon, germanium,
tantalum), and the United Kingdom industry has some of the most advanced plant
in the world for the preparation of zirconium.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Mechanical engineering comprises a wide range of industries, including all types of
machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools, small arms, mechanical handling
equipment, construction equipment, industrial plant, watches and clocks, and scientific
instruments. Tractors and vehicle engines are included in the section on vehicles
(p. 308). The volume of deliveries from these industries rose by 26 per cent between

1954 and 1961, in which latter year £1,658 million was the aggregate value of the
main products of all sections other than small arms, scientific instruments and watches
and clocks; exports of these products had a value of £586-8 million (including some
parts and used items). The total number of employees was over 1-34 million.
Agricultural Machinery
In 1961 output of agricultural machinery other than tractors was valued at £49
million, and included: 18,500 mould-board ploughs, 8,600 disc harrows, 3,600 corn
drills, 8,000 farmyard manure spreaders, 15,300 mowers, 14,200 pick-up balers,
2,800 combine harvesters, 1,600 grain and grass driers, and 9,300 milking machines.
Exports in 1961 had a value of £20-1 million; the Irish Republic, Australia, France
and Western Germany were the main markets. Though there are over 300 firms in
the industry, three enterprises employing over a thousand workers account for over
half the net output of larger firms.1 About 36,000 persons are employed.
Metal-working Machine Tools
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry, and by the early
1830s had developed to an advanced stage the boring machine and screw-cutting lathe,
as well as other machine tools. The industry’s output today ranges from watchmakers
lathes weighing a few pounds to machines weighing hundreds of tons, including
transfer lines for motor vehicle manufacture and electronically controlled machine
tools giving accuracies of one ten-thousandth part of an inch.
A substantial expansion in output and exports took place in 1961. The value of
deliveries of metal-working machine tools rose to £115-7 million, the highest ever
recorded. Exports in 1961 had a value of £35-1 million; of the orders on hand at the
end of December 1961, valued at £116-9 million, 27 per cent was for export. India
(£4-6 million), Australia (£3-6 million), Italy, Western Germany and Japan were the
main markets. f
There are about 330 separate firms making machine tools, but over 40 per cent ot net
output is produced by 13 enterprises employing over 1,000 persons. Ihe high degree
of specialisation makes it possible for the small firm to flourish. The industry is centred
mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to a lesser extent near London
and Glasgow. . . . , . , ,
The Machine Tool Trades Association of Great Britain is the representative body
of most manufacturers and importers, and is responsible for the International Machine
Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years; the most recent exhibition took place
in i960. The industry is also served by its own research body, the Machine Tool
Industry Research Association. .
Substantial expenditures on plant and buildings have been made in recent years.
About 94,000 persons are employed in the industry.
Industrial Engines
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines other than those for the
vehicle construction industries (see p. 307). Deliveries of complete engines had a
value of £88-4 million in 1961 and exports were worth £15-5 million; in addition,
parts exported (including some for marine and rail traction engines) were valued at
£16-8 million. The total brake horse power of the 342,000 internal combustion engines
delivered was 7 million.
1 Firms with over 25 employees.
302
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are 71 firms for whom industrial engines are the chief product. Production is
concentrated among the large firms, and 10 large firms, each employing over 1,500
persons, account for over 86 per cent of the net output of larger firms. About 44,000
employees work in the industry.
Textile Machinery
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry, which developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. It enjoys a world¬
wide reputation and offers a complete range of modern equipment for all stages in
the manufacturing process. Deliveries in 1961 were valued at the record total of
£91-4 million and exports also reached their highest ever value of £62-1 million.
Principal markets were the Soviet Union (j£8-i million), India (£4-9 million), Western
Germany (^3-8 million), Australia (^3-1 million), the United States, Italy, France and
Pakistan.
The industry, which has about 62,000 employees, comprises about 617 firms,
situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee, Leicester and
Nottingham, making a wide range of machines and accessories for the manufacture
and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres,
including bast and leaf fibre machinery of which the United Kingdom is still by far
the world’s largest supplier. Five enterprises with over 2,000 employees produce
almost 53 per cent of the net output of the 158 larger firms.
Mechanical Handling Equipment
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment; the products
of the industry range from individual units and accessories to complete operating
systems but are usually taken to exclude colliery gear and conveyors for underground
mines. The value of deliveries in 1961 was some £97-5 million, the main constituents
being: cranes and bridge transporters (about 40 per cent by value), lifts, escalators,
conveyors, elevators, hoists and other mechanical handling equipment. Exports in
1961 were valued at XI9'3 million.
There are 267 firms in the industry but only 150 of these employ over 25 persons,
and 8 large enterprises with over 1,000 employees account for 43 per cent of the net
output of larger firms.
Construction Equipment and Quarrying Machinery
Production of construction equipment in the United Kingdom before the second
world war was mainly concerned with small excavators, concrete-mixing machinery
and road surfacing plant, including road rollers. Today almost the whole range of plant
is manufactured, including crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers, trenchers, dozer
equipment, dumpers, rippers, rooters, and crushing, pulverising and screening plant.
The value of deliveries from the industry was over £107-2 million in 1961; by far
the most important single item was earth-moving machinery with a value of ^67-4
million. Exports in 1961 totalled £52-1 million; Australia, Western Germany, Malaya,
Switzerland, France, Sweden and Spain were important markets.
Contractors plant and quarrying machinery is manufactured by 129 firms, and of
the larger enterprises, 8 with over 1,000 employees account for 47 per cent of net
output. The labour force numbers about 27,000.

Office Machinery
The United Kingdom office machinery industry has expanded rapidly and is now
second in size only to that of the United States. In 1961 the value of deliveries of
office machinery (such as accounting machinery, punched-card machinery, typewriters,
dictating machines, and duplicating machinery) was ^76 million. Deliveries in 1961
included 189,000 standard typewriters and 241,000 portable typewriters. The value of
deliveries of accounting machinery was ^41'^ million and of other office machinery
£20-4 million. Exports were valued at £29 6 million and the most important overseas
purchasers were Australia, the United States, France, South Africa and Western
Germany. British subsidiaries or associates of United States firms are prominent in
the office machinery industry, in which there are 78 firms. Nine firms, each with over
1,000 employees, produce 85 per cent of the net output of larger firms.
Engineers’ Small Tools and Gauges
The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding industry and
is the main branch of production for over 1,100 firms, of which 4 have over 1,000
employees. Deliveries increased in value from £s2'1 million in 1959 to LlS'2 million
in 1961; exports amounted to about ^14 million. The industry has a labour force of
about 55,000 persons.
Industrial Plant and Steelwork
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and steelwork,
and about 160,000 are employed in this branch. Of particular importance are steam¬
raising boilers, lime and cement kilns, gas and coke oven plant, sintering plant,
metallurgical furnaces and plant, chemical and mineral oil refining plant, nuclear
reactors, water and sewage treatment plant, and steelwork for bridges, buildings, etc.
The 859 enterprises include several large firms. Almost 60 per cent of the net output
of larger firms comes from 29 firms with over 1,000 employees, and nearly one-third
is accounted for by 7 firms with a labour force of over 3,000. In 1961 the aggregate
value of deliveries was ^33^’7 million; exports had a value of almost £$£> million.
Boilers and Boilerhouse Plant. British companies delivered water tube boilers to the
value of £56-4 million in 1961; shell boilers and other boilerhouse plant accounted
for a further £32-6 million. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of large steam¬
raising capacity are produced for power stations, whereas shell boilers are used for
steam-raising and heating in factories and buildings. Exports in 1961 amounted to
£19-2 million.
Iron, Steel and Non-ferrous Metal Works Plant. The post-war modernisation and
expansion of the British steel industry has led to the rapid development of the steel¬
works plant industry, which today provides, in association with firms producing
rolling mills, almost all Britain’s requirements, and also supplies plant for export.
The value of deliveries in 1961 was £31-9 million; rolling mills and ancillary equipment
(classified under miscellaneous machinery) (see p. 304) accounted for an additional
£23-9 million. Exports had a value of ^8-6 million, which includes blast furnace
plant and other metallurgical equipment.
This industry consists of a small number of firms, most of which are business
associates or members of a consortium. They are capable of supplying the plant and
equipment for steel and non-ferrous metal works, and are in the position to undertake
the planning, erection and supply of complete plants in any part of the world; the
Durgapur Steel Works in India is an outstanding example.
304 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Chemical Plant and Mineral Ore Refining Equipment. The manufacture of specialised
equipment for the chemical and ore refining industries has developed rapidly since
the second world war. Deliveries of complete plant had a value of £68-6 million in
1061 compared with £37-3 million in 1959. Exports of chemical plant (including
some gas machinery) amounted to £8-5 million in 1961, and exports of mineral ore
refining machinery came to a further £2-9 million. If the whole range of equipment
manufactured by British firms for the petroleum industry is aggregated, Britain ranks
second to the United States as a supplier. The range of chemical plant produced
includes distillation columns, heat exchangers, high vacuum drying equipment, and
plant for the manufacture of chemicals from all feedstocks including petroleum.
Nuclear Power Station Plant. The design and construction of nuclear power stations
is one of the outstanding present-day enterprises of British industry. Three major
groups of firms, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical engineering, cm
engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries, build nuclear power stations
for the United Kingdom electricity authorities, and are also building stations in Italy
and Japan. The Atomic Energy Authority grants them non-exclusive manufacturing
licences and is working in close collaboration with them in research and development.
Several companies have designed, or have designs under study for, small nuclear
power stations to be used for electricity generation, and for marine propulsion reactors.
Companies have also been established for the manufacture of graphite for use in reactors.
The Nuclear Energy Trade Associations’ Conference (NETAC) was formed towards
the end of 1956 to establish a permanent means of liaison and to pool experience
among the firms and trade associations concerned in nuclear development.
Miscellaneous Non-electrical Machinery
In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in preceding sections,
there are 1,750 enterprises whose principal product is a type of machinery not so tar
mentioned; 891 of these firms have over 25 employees and 59 have more than 1,000.
Four firms have a labour force of over 4,000. The mam products include: mining
machinery, printing and book-binding machinery, refrigeration appliances space
heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, pumps and pumping machinery,
industrial valves and cocks, compressors, scales and weighing machinery, porta e
power tools, food preparing machinery, rolling mills for steel and non-ferrous metals
and many other types of equipment. The total value of deliveries in 1961 was some
/603 million. Exports of the industry’s main products including some parts were
valued at £238 million. About 348,000 workers are employed in these industries.
Refrigeration, Space Heating and Ventilation Equipment. The United Kingdom
industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances, extending from refrigerators
of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial use to industrial refrigeration
equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals and other products, ice-ma mg
plant and refrigeration plant for ships. Important advances have recently been made
in the development of accelerated freeze-drying equipment for the food industry an
of refrigerated transport vehicles. Production of commercial and industrial refrigera¬
tion machinery was well established before the second world war, but th® Present
large production of domestic refrigerators has been built up since 1946. Deliveries
in 1961 had a value of fisi'1 million. c ,
Space heating and ventilation equipment includes sectional boilers tor centr
heating; hot air, water and steam radiators; and fan and air filters. The value o
deliveries have been rising in recent years and in 1961 reached fis2'S million.
INDUSTRY
3°5
Exports of air conditioning equipment, refrigerators and fans in 1961 had a value of
£9-8 million; Western Germany (^i-i million) was the largest overseas buyer.
Pumps and Industrial Valves. Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids
and gases are a vital component in many industrial processes, particularly in the
chemicals, oil and electric power industries. The value of deliveries of pumps and
valves in 1961 was estimated at £98-3 million. Exports of pumps were valued at
£18 million and exports of industrial valves at ^I4,6 million.
Other Machinery. The value of deliveries of other major products in 1961 was:
mining machinery, ^53-6 million; air and gas compressors and exhausters, 3^29-2
million; food and drink machinery ^41-3 million; packaging machinery £19-3 million,
rolling mills (see p. 303), ^25-9 million; and other machinery £228-1 million. Exports
of mining machinery had a value of £7-2 million, air and gas compressors had a value
of £10-4 million, and food and drink machinery had a value of £14 million.
Scientific and Industrial Instruments
The industry comprises 1,330 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of photo¬
graphic, scientific, surgical and industrial instruments. A rapidly expanding sector is
that making industrial and process measuring and control instruments—an essential
element of automation in industry—deliveries of which amounted to £52‘4 million in
1961. The value of deliveries of other broad categories was: optical instruments
£7-6 million; electrical measuring instruments £8-4 million; nautical and gunnery
control instruments £12-5 million, and other instruments £24-4 million.
The industry has a labour force of 136,000 persons. About 54 per cent of the net
output of larger firms is accounted for by 21 large enterprises, each employing over
1,000 persons.
Exports have risen sharply to £53‘5 million in 50 per cent higher than the
1958 total. Australia, the United States, Western Germany, France, India and Canada
were the most important markets.
Clocks and Watches
Britain was at one time the world’s leading producer of clocks and watches, but by
the end of the nineteenth century production had virtually died out. The present
industry is largely a post-war development. It employs about 16,200 people, the great
majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories are located in the development
districts and particularly in Scotland. Deliveries in 1961 included clocks to a value of
£6-2 million and watches worth £4'4 million; exports were valued at about £2-5
million.
General Mechanical Engineering
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section are
nearly 4,000 enterprises employing about 210,000 whose main functions are to supply
parts and components, to conduct research and development work, and to undertake
general sub-contract and repair work. (Some enterprises are included because the
mixed character of their work makes it impossible to classify them under any other
industries.) They include several very large undertakings: 23 have over 1,000 employees
each and 7 have over 5,000 employees. Ball and roller bearings, and precision chains
are particularly important products; exports of the former were valued at £8 million
in 1961, and exports of chains at £4-7 million.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The United Kingdom electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manu¬
facture and installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, including all types of
generating, transmission and distribution equipment; motors; telecommunications
apparatus; domestic appliances; and specialised laboratory and electronic equipment.
The volume of output rose by 48 per cent in the period 1954-61, and exports (other
than record players, etc.) in 1961 reached their highest ever value of £259 million.
Products are exported to all parts of the world; in 1961, Australia (£19-9 million).
South Africa (£17-5 million), India (£i3'5 million), New Zealand (£12-6 million),
Canada (£u-6 million) and the United States (£11-2 million) were the main markets.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of almost 812,000. The leading
organisation of the industry is the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers’
Association.
Electrical Machinery
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic advances
in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experiments of Michael
Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity as a source of cheap and
abundant power; Sir Charles Parsons produced and patented the first turbo-dynamo,
the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating sets of today. The industry has provided
the plant required for the large-scale post-war expansion programme of the United
Kingdom electricity authorities, and has built all types of equipment for overseas
countries. . .
In 1961 the output of electrical machinery was valued at £342-8 million, including
£140.6 million worth of rotating electrical machinery (motors, generators and rotary
converters), £48-5 million worth of transformers for lighting, heating and power,
£131-1 million worth of switchgear and control gear and £22-6 million worth of other
electrical machinery. u at •
Exports of electrical machinery in 1961 had a value of £65-3 million; South Africa,
Australia and India were the main markets. Generators, generating sets and motors
accounted for £35-9 million and converting machinery, rectifiers, transformers and
other machinery for the remainder.
About 670 firms manufacture electrical machinery, including 27 with over 1,000
employees and five with over 7,500. The total labour force numbers 226,000. Manu¬
facture takes place in many areas; among the most important are Manchestei, Rug y,
Tyneside, Stafford and Larne (Northern Ireland).
Radio and Other Electronic Apparatus
Production of electronic equipment is a rapidly expanding British industry. United
Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many basic contributions to electronics
—the thermionic valve, the development of radar (a British firm has fitted oyer halt
the world’s radar-equipped ocean-going ships), the first public transmission television
service, and the ‘printed circuit’, which has led to far-reaching changes in methods
of production in the radio industry. Its wide range of products includes radio and
television receivers and electronic capital goods.
Production in 1961 included 3-1 million radios and radiograms with a value ot
£27-8 million, and 1-3 million television sets worth £50-4 million; among capital goods,
electronic control equipment (£11-9 million), computers (£10-9 million), electronic
measuring and testing equipment (£9 million); transmitters (£5-5 million), radar an
INDUSTRY
3°7
navigational aids (£14-1 million), radio communication equipment (^13-4 million),
other electronic apparatus (£9-9 million). Exports in 1961 had an aggregate value of
£6g-6 million. _
Among the most important overseas markets are the United States, Canada, the
Netherlands, Sweden and Australia. Indirect exports of equipment in other products,
such as ships, aircraft and machinery are considerable.
There are 490 enterprises in the industry including 3 with over 10,000 employees.
Firms employing over 1,000 persons account for 79 per cent of net output of larger
firms. The industry has a labour force of over 240,000.
Insulated Wires and Cables
There are 71 firms whose main products are cables and wires for the distribution
of electric power, for telegraph and telephone networks and for many other purposes;
they include submarine cables and those insulated by a great variety of materials.
The value of deliveries in 1961 was million and exports had a value of £2t)'2
million.
The industry has a labour force of about 64,000 persons. Three firms with over
5,000 employees account for 58 per cent of net output of larger firms.
Telegraph and Telephone Apparatus
Britain is the largest exporter of telegraph and telephone equipment. Shipment
overseas (including signalling apparatus and parts) had a value of ^24‘4 million in
1961. Research and development work is done by firms in co-operation with the
Post Office (see p. 391). The industry, employing 66,000 persons, is organised for
large-scale operations. Three enterprises have over 10,000 employees and ten firms
with over 1,000 employees produce over 75 per cent of the output of the larger firms.
Electrical Goods and Domestic Electrical Appliances
Deliveries of electrical goods in 1961 included: domestic electrical appliances,
^138 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles and aircraft, ^62 million,
batteries and accumulators, ^41 million; electric lamps, £25 million; and other
electrical goods, £91 million. By number, deliveries included: 1-2 million electric
blankets, 1-4 million vacuum cleaners, 995,000 domestic washing machines and 2-3
million electric irons. Exports in 1961 had a total value of ^64 million. The industry
has a labour force of 215,000.
VEHICLES, AIRCRAFT AND SHIPS
The industries which manufacture vehicles, aircraft and ships are among the largest
exporters; overseas deliveries in 1961 (including used vehicles and parts) had a value
of over ^700 million, equivalent to 21 per cent of exports of manufactured goods.
The labour force numbers over i-2 million and includes: 415,000 in motor vehicle
manufacture, 305,000 in aircraft construction and repairing, 275,000 in shipbuilding
and marine engineering, 141,000 in the manufacture of railway vehicles and carriages,
34,000 in cycle and motor cycle manufacturing, and y,ooo in the building of perambu¬
lators and hand trucks.
Motor Vehicles
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises the
manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles. In the last fifteen years expansion has
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3°8
been rapid, and the larger firms alone are currently involved in developing schemes
costing over £200 million; new plants are being established on Merseyside, in Wales
and in Scotland, and total annual capacity of the five largest manufacturers is expected
to be more than 2-3 million cars and 600,000 commercial vehicles and tractors by
1962-63.
The industry is at present located mainly in the Midlands and the London area.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the five largest firms (British
Motor Corporation, Ford, Rootes, Leyland-Standard-Triumph and Vauxhall) who
account for about 90 per cent of complete vehicle production other than tractors;
the balance is in the hands of specialist producers of heavy commercial vehicles,
omnibuses, coaches, trolley-buses, limousines and sports cars. Agricultural tractor
production is also dominated by five large organisations, with two of these producing
about 80 per cent of output. The principal trade association is the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) which holds a motor show annually in London,
and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years. Agricultural tractors are
exhibited at the annual Smithfield Show in London.
Cars: Car output expanded almost without interruption to a record of 1-35 million
units in i960, falling back to 1 million in 1961. Exports, which in 1961 were also
below the record levels of i960, amounted to 371,000 cars and chassis with a value of
£147-9 million. Canada (£20-9 million) became the largest single overseas purchaser.
The United States (£18-8 million compared with £61-6 million in i960 and £86-7
million in 1959), New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Republic were the other
largest markets.
Commercial Vehicles: Production of commercial vehicles has increased from 146,000
in 1946 to the record total of 460,000 vehicles in 1961. Britain sent overseas the
highest ever number of vehicles in 1961—167,000 vehicles and chassis valued at
£120-3 million—to become the world’s largest exporter of commercial vehicles.
South Africa (£9 million), Australia (£8-5 million), Argentina and New Zealand
were the main markets.
Tractors: The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural
tractors. Some 176,000 agricultural and industrial (wheeled and half track) tractors
were produced in 1961, about 134,000 (76 per cent) for export. Output also included
5,000 track laying tractors (3,000 for export) and 55,000 small market garden tractors
of less than 10 belt horse power. In addition, British firms produced 11,000 powered
industrial trucks, including 7,000 of the fork-lift variety. Exports of tractors had a
value of £90-8 million in 1961; industrial and works trucks accounted for a further
£3-8 million.
Accessories and Parts: It has been estimated that in some cases up to 7° Per cent of
the final cost of a car is represented by bought-out components. Exports of parts in
1961 had a value of £108-5 million; engines and parts were valued at a further £37-2
million. Caravan and trailer exports were valued at £3-4 million, and exports of used
vehicles (not included above) had a value of £3-9 million.
Cycles and Motor Cycles
Cycles: The pedal-driven bicycle was invented in Britain by Kirkpatric Macmillan in
1839. Deliveries have declined from the post-war peak of over 4 million in 1951
just under 2 million in 1961. Over 80 per cent of British cycle capacity is concentrated
in the hands of a single group of companies, and output is becoming increasingly
concentrated in the Nottingham area. Some 1-3 million cycles worth £n-6 million
INDUSTRY
309
were sent overseas in 1961; the United States (£3-5 million) was much the largest
single market. Parts and accessories exported amounted to a further £3-2 million.
Motor Cycles: Deliveries of all types of motor cycle which rose to the post-war
peak of 249,000 in 1959 have since declined to 150,000 in 1961 (27 per cent below the
level of i960). Output has been increasingly diversified during the 1950s, and the
1961 total of deliveries included 24,400 mopeds, 30,000 scooters and 7,300 three¬
wheeled vehicles. Manufacture of motor cycles is dominated by two large groups.
Some 32,700 units with a value of £4-4 million were exported in 1961; parts and
accessories came to an additional £i-(> million.
Railway Vehicles
Britain was the first country to build railways and British engineers pioneered
railway development in most parts of the world. The industry is organised to meet the
conditions resulting from the replacement of steam locomotives by other forms of
traction on most of the world s railways.
Production in 1961 included 23 electric locomotives, 631 diesel and diesel-electric
locomotives, 2,048 coaching vehicles and 8,408 wagons which were added to operating
stock by British Railways. In addition, 69 electric locomotives, 158 diesel and diesel-
electric locomotives, 160 coaching vehicles and 2,996 wagons were exported. The
total value of exports in 1961 was £14-1 million; South Africa (£2-8 million) was the
largest purchaser. . .
There are 57 establishments making locomotives and railway track equipment in
Britain. British Railways have their own workshops; private firms build locomotives,
carriages and wagons for British Railways, for industrial users and for export.
Aircraft and Aero-Engines
Since the second world war the British aircraft industry has concentrated on the
development of civil and military applications of the gas turbine aero-engine first
developed by Sir Frank Whittle. This propulsion was first used in scheduled airline
services by the turbo-jet Comet and the turbo-prop Viscount, the latter probably the
most successful post-war civil aircraft. The Comet 4 jet airliner went into service in
1958, and other gas-turbine aircraft in production include the Argosy, the Herald,
and the Amo J48. A second generation of jet airliners made their maiden flight in
1962—the medium-haul Trident and the longer-haul Vickers VC 10-, both have rear-
mounted engines. They will come into airline service in 1963 and 1964 respectively.
The industry also produces a wide range of military aircraft and air missiles; its
size being strongly influenced by defence requirements. At the peak of wartime
activity the number of those actually working in the industry rose to nearly 2 million,
compared with 35,000 in 1935. In May 1961 the industry had a labour force of about
3 Exports of aircraft and parts in 1961 had a value of £58-8 million. Leading buyers
(who vary considerably from year to year) included Canada (£19 million), the United
States (/y million), the Lebanon (£4-2 million) and Egypt (£4-1 million). In addition,
exports of electrical appliances for use in aircraft had a value of £3-7 million, aero¬
nautical instruments had a value of £2-8 million, and tyres a value of almost £1 million.
It has been estimated that early in 1962 there were 813 British jet or turbo-prop air¬
liners in service or on order, and of these over half (437) had been ordered by overseas
0PThe°construction of aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufacturers and
one helicopter concern resulting from a series of mergers in 1959 and i960, though
3io
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
there are a few important smaller companies outside these groups. Main centres of
the industry are the home counties (i.e. counties around London), Coventry, Bristol
and the west of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Besides extensive research work by the industry, research on a substantial scale on
problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by the Ministry of Aviation,
chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Establish¬
ment, both at Farnborough, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Bedford. This
work is done in collaboration with the industry and results are made known to manu¬
facturers. In addition, the National Physical Laboratory undertakes research on
aerodynamics.
Aero-Engines: Aero-engines provided over £440 million in export earnings from
1946 to 1961; in 1961 exports reached the record total of £82 million, including parts
worth £23-9 million. Licence arrangements have been made for about twenty types of
British engines to be made abroad, and early in 1962 almost 50 per cent of the world
total of jet and turbo-prop airliners on order or in service were to have British power
plants. Famous engines at present in production include the economical Dart turbo-
prop, the Avon, Conway and Spey turbo-jets and the revolutionary Pegasus lift-thrust
engine for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Two companies produce
almost all British aero-engines.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
The United Kingdom shipbuilding industry is concentrated in four main areas:
the river Clyde in Scotland, the north-east coast of England, the north-west coast of
England, and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Ships are also built in the Southampton
area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the rivers Forth and Tay in
Scotland; while numerous yards along the coast build fishing vessels, yachts, harbour
craft and barges. Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the large ports.
During the sixteen years from 1946 to 1961 over 21 million gross tons of shipping
were launched from British yards, including 670 tankers, 1,288 dry cargo ships,
86 ore carriers, and 3,139 miscellaneous craft of over 20 different types. The total
value of this output was over £2,142 million, excluding £325 million worth of naval
vessels, and over £1,000 million worth of naval and merchant ship repair work.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is undertaken by
the British Ship Research Association. A separate organisation, Parsons and Marine
Engineering Turbine Research and Development Association (Pametrada), carries out
design, development and production liaison work in marine turbines.
Merchant Shipbuilding and Ship Repairing: Tonnage launched has gradually de¬
creased from the post-war peak of 1-5 million gross tons in 1948 to 1-2 million tons in
1961, in which year Britain launched (after Japan) the largest quantity of shipping.
The 1961 total included oil tankers amounting to 393,000 gross tons and bulk carriers
totalling 224,000 tons. Among the notable ships leaving British yards during the year
were three steam turbine tankers of over 67,000 deadweight tons, and two passenger
liners of over 20,000 gross tons. The ten large liners completed since 1959 have a
total value of at least £85 million. Almost 24 per cent of the tonnage launched in 1961
was for registration overseas.
Modernisation in British shipyards involved the replanning of yards, the erection
of large prefabrication shops for welding massive sections under cover, the installation
of heavy-lift travelling cranes, and much other reconstruction. Facilities are available
for building tankers of up to 100,000 deadweight tons.
INDUSTRY
3H
Although there are many specialist ship repairing establishments, most of the largest
firms also carry on shipbuilding work; about one-quarter of ship repairing activity is
concentrated in the north-east coast of England area. Some 2-2 million gross tons of
merchant shipping was undergoing repair and conversion in British yards at the end
of 1961 but the amount varies from day to day.
Marine Engineering: Most of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain their own engine
building works; often they manufacture several types of diesel engine under licence.
Steam turbines of the highest powers are available, many designed by Pametrada.
Several vessels have been fitted with free-piston gasifier machinery and a large amount
of work is being undertaken on the problems of nuclear propulsion units for com¬
mercial operation.
MISCELLANEOUS METAL PRODUCTS
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not described above consists
of a large number of companies with a total labour force of 564,700 in 1961; the main
groups were tools and implements (24,7°°)) cutlery (12,000), bolts, nuts and screws
(47,700), wire and wire manufactures (45,000), cans and metal boxes (37,000), jewellery,
plate, and refining of precious metals (29,900), also other metal industries (368,400).
The total value of exports in 1961 was about j£i5° million.
Cutlery and Flatware
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred in the city of Sheffield. The
industry has been built up on the skill of its craftsmen; while mass production methods
are used today by some firms, the highest quality wares are still produced by skilled
craftsmen. Firms remain mainly small and, of some 290 enterprises manufacturing
cutlery, over 225 still employ fewer than 25 persons.
Exports of spoons, forks and cutlery had a value of £9-6 million in 1961.
Domestic Hollow-ware
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, South Wales
and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets
and dustbins, mainly from wrought steel and aluminium. Increasing quantities of
plastic hollow-ware are being produced, though aluminium manufacturers comprise
the largest single group, both in the value of total production and in exports. Exports
in 1961 had a value of £3-2 million.
Tools and Implements
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries. Some 680
firms manufacture tools such as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades; Sheffield,
Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important centres.
The value of exports of implements and tools, other than machine tools and portable
power tools, was some £20 million in 1961.
Jewellery, Gold and Silver Ware
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious metals
is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a great tradition. Some 625 of
the 885 firms in the industry have fewer than 25 employees. The law requires that
L

gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked at one of the
Assay Offices situated in London, Birmingham, Sheffield, Edinburgh, and Glasgow.
The Birmingham office, located in the main centre of the jewellery industry, probably
hall-marks as much gold and silver as the rest together.
CHEMICALS
The chemical industry, which has a labour force of 468,200, comprises the manu¬
facture of: chemicals and dyes (220,000 employees), pharmaceutical and toilet
preparations (73,700 employees), explosives and fireworks (32,700 employees), paint
and printing ink (49,200 employees), oils, fats, soap and detergents (45,200 employees),
synthetic resins and plastics (32,800 employees), polishes and gelatines (14,700
employees). Between 1954 and 1961 output increased by 49 per cent, and in 1961 its
net output was valued at almost j£8oo million. T. he industry is capital intensive: during
the decade 1951-61 some £1,000 million was spent on fixed assets and in recent years
the annual rate of fixed capital investment has been around £130 million. The value of
exports in 1961 was £325 million; Australia, the Netherlands and India were the most
important markets.
Chemical Elements and Compounds
The inorganic chemicals industry dates back to the middle of the nineteenth
century, when sulphuric acid and alkali were in increasing demand for the growing
heavy industries. Almost 2-7 million tons of sulphuric acid were produced in Britain in
1961, about the same tonnage of ammonia and ammonia salts is produced and large
quantities of chlorine and alkali are manufactured. About 70 per cent of the ammonia
is made into nitrogenous fertilisers. The most rapidly growing outlets for chlorine
are in the manufacture of solvents and the plastics material polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
Production of inorganic chemicals increased by nearly one-third between 1954 an<^
1961.
The earliest organic chemicals were dyestuffs and explosives. Almost 30,000 tons
of dyestuffs were produced in 1961. Newer chemicals with organic structures which
are manufactured in bulk by modern synthesis from organic chemicals include plastics,
synthetic rubber and synthetic fibres. These are among the most rapidly expanding
sections of the industry. Production of organic chemicals nearly doubled between
1954 and 1961.
Exports of organic and inorganic chemicals and compounds amounted to over
£77 million in 1961; organic chemicals, other than radioactive products, accounted
for £40-3 million. Exports go to a large number of countries including, in 1961, the
Netherlands (£5-4 million), Australia (£4-6 million) and India (£4-4 million).
Petroleum Chemicals
Since 1949 output of petroleum chemicals in Britain has increased by an average of
37 per cent each year; their share of total organic chemical output has risen from about
one-fifth in 1953 to over 50 per cent at the present day, and is expected to reach 70 per
cent by 1965. It is estimated that by the end of 1962 total investment in petroleum
chemicals will have reached £200 million. Most of the important plants are adjacent
to the oil refineries. Production of feedstock for the petroleum chemicals plants
totalled about 582,000 tons in 1961 compared with 302,000 tons in 1958. In addition,
consumption of coke and tar distillation products (such as phenol, used in the
manufacture of organic chemicals) has also increased in recent years. Large quantities
INDUSTRY
3I3
of industrial ethyl alcohol, which was formerly produced from molasses, are now
manufactured from petroleum.
Plastics
The first plastic, celluloid, was produced in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes;
other British discoveries include polyethylene. Britain was the first country to
manufacture plastic coated steel, in 1957.
Manufacture of plastics is one of the most rapidly growing sections of the economy.
Output in 1961 was more than double that of 1954* Expansion in recent years has
mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are polyethylene
(used in coverings, packaging—notably for foodstuffs and domestic mouldings),
polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for industrial conveyor belting and a
wide range of consumer goods) and polystyrene (a cheap non-inflammable mateiial
used for toys, light mouldings and many consumer goods). Capacity for the production
of polypropylene (a versatile material for use mainly in electrical components, mouldings,
and domestic appliances) is being expanded substantially.
Sales of plastics in 1961 amounted to 609,000 tons, of which thermoplastics
accounted for over 396,000 tons. Exports were valued at £42-4 million. The industry
is currently undertaking large extensions to productive capacity.
Synthetic Rubber
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a commercial
scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 1958. Since then capacity for production
of this and other rubbers has increased rapidly. Types of specialised synthetic rubber
already in production include high styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and
nitrile rubbers for use where oil resistance is required. Production in 1961 amounted
to 106,000 tons, by far the greater part of which came from the styrene-butadiene plant
at Hythe, near Southampton. Exports of synthetic rubber were valued at £4-9 million
in 1961.
Fertilisers
The production of fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of the British scientists,
Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert, and the research now carried on at Rothamsted,
Hertfordshire, and at the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen, is of world-wide importance.
Two firms predominate in the production of fertilisers, and both have established new
large-scale manufacturing facilities in recent years. In addition, there are about
one hundred firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents
nitrogen, phosphates and potash. To encourage use, sales on the home market are
assisted by Government subsidies paid to the farmer (see p. 340). Output of nitrogenous
fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen content) in 1961-62 totalled 442,000 tons, nearly
twice the 1948 volume, and 399,000 tons of phosphatic fertilisers were produced (in
terms of phosphate content); sales of compound fertilisers in granulated form are
increasing. The use of ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen) and, to a limited
extent, urea (45 per cent nitrogen) is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers.
The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, almost all in the form of ammonium
sulphate, totalled £2-6 million in 1961.
Paints
Sales of paint and varnish during 1961 amounted to some 90 million gallons, worth
about ^133 million; exports accounted for one-tenth of sales, the remainder being
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3I4
almost equally divided between the domestic and industrial markets. Production has
risen from about 72 million gallons in 1954. Exports of pigments, paints, varnishes and
related materials in 1961 amounted in value to ^3®'5 million; about one-third are in
the form of ready-mixed paints, which command a growing market overseas. The
industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form of surface coatings for finished
goods is also considerable.
In recent years the application of improved techniques has resulted in rapid
development, in particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic resins and
various types of titanium oxide pigment.
Pharmaceuticals
The pharmaceutical industry has expanded greatly since the second world war.
Output increased by 85 per cent between 1954 and 1961. The whole range of drugs is
produced in the United Kingdom, including sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti¬
histamine products, anaesthetics, vaccines, sera, and naturally occurring drugs. Over
£6 million per annum is currently being spent on research; most of the major firms
have large projects in hand to expand production.
Notable British contributors to the development of new products include: the
discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming, its evaluation by Sir Howard
Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693) by Sir Lionel
Whitby; the introduction of the anti-malarial proguanil; the discovery of griseofulvin;
and most recently, the isolation of the penicillin nucleus. A promising development is
the Medical Research Council’s discovery of ‘interferon’ for the treatment of virus
diseases. Several of the larger pharmaceutical companies in Britain are subsidiaries
of overseas firms.
In 1961 exports were valued at 5^4^'^ million. Commonwealth countries were the
largest purchasers.
Toilet Preparations, Soap and Cleaning Preparations
The market for detergents has grown rapidly since the war. Petroleum is the
principal raw material in the manufacture of organic surface-active agents in detergents,
the other main constituent, polyphosphates, is derived from inorganic sources. Sales
of detergents amounted to 315,000 tons in 1961. Production of soap was some 433,000
tons. Exports of perfumery and toilet preparations, soap and cleansing and polishing
preparations were valued at £28-2 million in 1961.
TEXTILES
The textile industries in 1961 had a labour force of about 903,200 persons, including
employees engaged in the production of man-made fibres. Some 139,5®® were in the
spinning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made fibres, 130,600 in the weaving
of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 203,600 in the woollen and worsted trades,
about 129,300 in hosiery and knitted goods and 82,700 in textile finishing. Over half
the employees are women. The total value of textile exports in 1961 was almost £250
million.
Cotton
The invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second half of the
eighteenth century led to cotton becoming Britain s chief consumer goods industry
and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth century. In the
INDUSTRY
3*5
twentieth century, increasing foreign competition and the tendency of many countries
to set up their own textile industry have cut progressively into British markets.
Agreements have been negotiated with industries in certain Commonwealth countries
to fix temporary ceilings on their exports to the United Kingdom.
Though it remains one of the largest consumer goods industries, the cotton industry
has continued to decline in employment and output in recent years. Output in 1961
consisted of: 455 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 126 million lb. of spun man-made
fibre and mixture single yarn, 147 million lb. of doubled yarn, 1,235 pillion linear
yards of woven cotton cloth, and 608 million linear yards of man-made fibres and
mixture cloth. In 1961 exports of cotton yarn and woven fabrics (excluding man-made
fibres, see p. 316) amounted in value to ^56-6 million, including woven fabrics with
£40-9 million. Australia (£7 million), South Africa, New Zealand and Nigeria were
the most important markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county being
mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning. Manchester is the
commercial centre. Liverpool is the chief port of entry for raw cotton and the
Liverpool Cotton Exchange is the main market for raw cotton dealings.
Legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry was introduced in 1959.
Exchequer funds have paid for two-thirds of the cost of removing surplus capacity,
and also provide grants of about one-quarter towards the cost of approved re-equipment
and modernisation. The reorganisation schemes are administered by the Cotton
Board, a development council, i.e. a statutory body with constitution and powers
laid down under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
Scientific and technical research for the industry is carried out by the Cotton bilk
and Man-made Fibres Research Association, formed in April 1961 by a merger of the
British Cotton Industry Research Association (Shirley Institute) with the British
Rayon Research Association.
Wool
The United Kingdom wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the most
ancient of Britain’s staple industries and has been important since medieval times.
There are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While about 85 per cent of
woollens and 95 per cent of worsteds are made in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
Scotland and the West of England have retained their importance as specialised
producers of high quality woollen cloth. In recent years an increased amount of
man-made fibres has been blended with wool.
In 1961 output included 320 million lb. of tops and 281 million lb. of woollen yarn.
Deliveries of worsted yarn amounted to 246 million lb. and total deliveries of woven
fabrics were almost 352 million square yards. In addition, large quantities of raw wool
are scoured and cleaned in the United Kingdom. Exports of wool yarns and woven
fabrics in 1961 were valued at £81-8 million. Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain)
and tops exported had a value of £70-9 million and re-exports of wool and hair were
worth a further £9-7 million. The United States, Canada, and Western Germany
were the chief buyers. There are considerable indirect wool exports in the form of
blankets, carpets and clothing (see p. 317)- Research is carried on mainly by the Wool
Industries Research Association, and the National Wool Textile Export Corporation
is responsible for assistance to exporters and the development of new markets.
Over 42 per cent of the net output of larger firms is accounted for by 681 enterprises
with fewer than 300 employees. Altogether there are 1,440 firms in the industry.
In recent years on the worsted side there has been a tendency towards the formation ol
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3l6
holding companies controlling a number of subsidiaries which combine all the worsted
processes within one organisation. Firms on the woollen side are normally organised
to include the full process of manufacture from raw material to finished article.
Man-made Fibres
Man-made fibres produced from cellulose were first made commercially available
in the United Kingdom in 1905, and much of the early development of viscose rayon
and acetate took place in Britain. Large quantities of chemicals are consumed in their
production, which is spread throughout the Midlands and Lancashire, with outposts
in other areas. In 1961, 308 million lb. of staple fibre and 265 million lb. of filament
yarn were delivered by the 9 enterprises which manufacture man-made fibres in
Britain. Three of these, each with over 3,000 employees, account for over 90 per cent
of net output. By weight cellulose fibres are today responsible for 70 per cent of total
output of man-made fibres, and annual production is about 200,000 tons; one company
accounts for over four-fifths of total output.
Since the second world war, output of a variety of fully synthetic fibres, derived
predominantly from mineral rather than vegetable sources, has been expanding at a
rate previously unattained in a major chemical product. Production of nylon, the
first fully synthetic fibre, started in Britain in 1941; large-scale production began
at Pontypool, in Wales, in 1948, and new factories were opened in 1955 and i960.
Capacity is expected to reach 82 million lb. in 1962. Another type of nylon (nylon 6)
is to be produced at Antrim, Northern Ireland. Nylon is used extensively in the
manufacture of clothing, fabrics and stockings, and has many industrial uses.
‘Terylene’, a polyester fibre, was discovered in the United Kingdom during the
second world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to blending with
wool. Annual capacity is about 50 million lb. Firms in many overseas countries
undertake its manufacture under licence.
A group of fibres of growing importance are known as acrylic or polyacrylonitrile
fibres. Two examples are ‘Acrilan’ and iCourtelle\ and it is expected that polypropylene
fibre will shortly be marketed. These fibres are soft and warm and have particular
applications in the wool textile industry. Polyethylene has been developed as a mono¬
filament yarn for industrial uses.
Since the advent of rayon and the newer man-made fibres, British textile manu¬
facturers have been developing a number of ways of blending these with natural
fibres and with each other in order to produce fabrics with new combinations of
texture, colour and finish, and with moisture-absorbent, hard-wearing, drip-dry and
crease-resisting properties.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns and woven fabrics had a value of £31-6 million
in 1961. South Africa (^3-1 million), Australia (£3-1 million), Sweden and New Zealand
were the most important purchasers.
Hosiery and Knitwear
The hosiery and knitwear industry is organised predominantly on a small scale.
Over 60 per cent of the 1,100 firms in the industry employ fewer than 50 workers,
and only 4 enterprises have more than 2,000 employees. The industry is widely
distributed, with Scotland and the east Midlands as the two most important centres.
Consumption of yarns totalled about 76,000 tons in 1961, nearly 40 per cent of which
were woollen yarns; the proportion of fully synthetic fibres is growing. Exports of
stockings and socks in 1961 were worth £2-7 million, and those of knitted underwear
INDUSTRY
31?
and outerwear totalled £7-8 million; the largest buyers were the United States and
Canada. Exports of knitted fabrics amounted to £3-9 million, mainly to Common¬
wealth countries. Exports by parcel post, which are not included in these figures,
are known to be substantial.
The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, with laboratories at
Nottingham, undertakes collective research, and is particularly concerned vfith the
improvement of quality.
Other Textiles
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is believed
that the art of linen weaving was being practised during the seventh century. Today
it is an industry mainly of comparatively small firms, chiefly in Northern Ireland (the
greatest linen manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in
Scotland. The principal raw material of the industry is flax, which is almost wholly
imported (the chief supplier is Belgium), but considerable quantities of man-made
fibres and cotton are also used, and a certain amount of soft hemp and jute, particularly
in Scotland. Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on the
lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely, but not exclusively, of
coarse linens and canvas. In the ten years to i960, the industry’s investments in new
plant and machinery amounted to £12 million. The Northern Ireland Government
has given financial aid for re-equipment. Exports in 1961 included £7-4 million worth
of linen fabrics, £2-9 million of flax yarns and linen thread. Technical problems are
investigated by the Research Institute of the Linen Industry Research Association,
formed in 1919.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in Dundee—the centre of the world s oldest
jute industry. About 40 per cent of jute yarn production is utilised in the manufacture
of carpets, cordage, ropes and other products. The balance is woven into fabrics for a
wide range of uses in the carpet, upholstery, building and motor car industries, as
well as its traditional use as a packaging material. Production of jute cloth in 1961
came to about 69,000 tons. The value of exports in 1961 was about £4-9 million
(including second-hand sacks and bags).
Research facilities are concentrated at the laboratories of the British Jute Trade
Research Association. About ^14 million has been spent on a post-war modernisation
programme.
Miscellaneous Textile Manufactures
In addition to the products mentioned specifically in this section, British textile
firms manufacture a wide range of goods including many special yarns and fabrics,
net and lace, household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and curtains, and floor
coverings other than carpets. Exports of these miscellaneous items were worth almost
£59 million in 1961.
Carpets
In 1961 manufacturers’ sales of carpets (including tufted carpets) in Britain
amounted to 74 million square yards. Exports had a value of ^io-6 million, incluaing
processed imported oriental carpets worth ^i‘4 million.
There are 135 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of carpets, though only
71 have over 25 employees and 9 firms each employing over 1,000 persons account for
58 per cent of net output of larger firms. In addition to the manufacture of woven
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
318
carpets such as Axminster and Wilton, there is an expanding branch of the industry
engaged in making tufted carpets, a form of carpeting in which the pile, usually
containing a high proportion of artificial fibres, is inserted into a pre-woven backing.
There are some 37,000 employees, and the principal manufacturing centres include
Kidderminster (in Worcestershire), Halifax and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of
Yorkshire), Durham (in north-east England), Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland).
Wool accounts for about 90 per cent of the raw materials used in the surface yarns in
carpet manufacture and more than two-thirds of the traditional carpets produced are
of a pure woollen or worsted pile.
CLOTHING, LEATHER AND FOOTWEAR
There are over 664,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear industries.
Some 465,100 are in the clothing industry, 119,700 in the leather footwear trade,
63,900 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture, and 15,300 in the hats, caps and
millinery trades. The aggregate value of their exports in 1961 was £70-5 million.
Clothing
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total production has
increased by 25 per cent since 1958. Exports in 1961 were valued at £15-3 million and,
in addition, substantial quantities are sent by parcel post.
Although there are some large firms employing mass production methods on an
increasing scale, the typical firm is small. Unofficial estimates suggest that five-sixths
of the concerns in the industry employ fewer than 100 workers. The principal manu¬
facturing centres are London, Leeds and Manchester, but several firms are also
situated on industrial trading estates.
Fashion is important in the production of haute couture models and throughout the
ready-to-wear industry. Fashion shows are arranged by the Apparel and Fashion
Industry’s Association and the Fashion House Group of London.
Leather
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1961, 27,000 tons of heavy
leather and 458 million square feet of upper, lining and other finished leathers were
produced. The United Kingdom is the world’s leading exporter, with exports in 1961
valued at £18-2 million. The United States, Western Germany and Canada imported
the largest amounts.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important concen¬
trations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and the London
area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging from the heavy types for
industrial uses such as machinery belting and car upholstery, to high quality leather for
footwear and for leather goods, and to gloving and clothing leather.
Research into tanning processes and the improvement of the quality of finished
leather is undertaken by the British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association, the
foremost association of this type in the world.
Footwear
The British footwear industry is the third largest in the world. In 1961 manufacturers
sales of leather footwear totalled 161 million pairs. Exports of all types had a value
of j£i3-i million; the United States and Canada were the largest markets.
Factories are located throughout the United Kingdom. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region of Lancashire
INDUSTRY
3J9
on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on women’s and girls’ shoes. There are
about 800 firms in the industry, producing footwear of all types. The British Boot,
Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide reputation in all
matters connected with shoemaking.
FOOD, DRINK AND TOBACCO
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ over 841,700 persons in the production
of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports in 1961 was £207
million, of which exports of alcoholic and other beverages accounted for £85-5 million,
sugar and sugar preparations for £21-3 million, coffee, cocoa and tea for £11 million
and dairy produce for JTii million. Capital expenditure in fixed assets amounted to
£130-6 million in 1961.
Bread and Flour Confectionery and Biscuits
The average weekly household consumption of bread per head of population in
Great Britain in 1961 was about zf lb., about | lb. less than in 1954. In England
and Wales particularly, the small ‘family’ type of baker, producing bread by hand or
by semi-mechanical methods, is still numerous, but there has been a trend towards
concentrating production in large mechanical bakeries; about two-thirds of the breac
is made in these bakeries, which specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves; 4 firms
have a dominant position. In the smaller bakeries production of cake and other flour
confectionery is usually allied to bread production. There are some 2,000 firms and
148,500 employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry; a further 540 firms
and 44,800 employees are employed in grain-milling.
Production of biscuits, of which there are about 108 manufacturers with some
57 500 employees, is estimated to be about 80 per cent higher than in the immediate
pre-war period. Annual output has been about 546,000 tons in recent years Weekly
consumption of biscuits per head in Britain was about 5! oz. in 1961. British biscuits
have gained a world-wide reputation, and despite the problem of import restrictions
in several overseas markets, exports in 1961 were valued at £6-2 million.
Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has some 104,400 employees,
is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and many hundreds of
medium-sized and small manufacturers. Though there are some 660 firms in the
industry 49 per cent of net output is produced by 8 firms with over 2,000 employees.
The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk,
nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery was 670,000 tons in
1961. Consumption of chocolate and sugar confectionery in the United Kingdom is
far higher than in any other country, being equivalent to about 8 oz. per head per
week in 1961, compared with 7 oz. per head before the war.
The value of exports of sugar confectionery and chocolate reached the highest ever
value of £14-1 million in 1961 and exports of other chocolate products were valued at
£2-6 million. The total value of the industry’s exports was just over £17 million;
Canada and the United States were the main markets.
Fruit and Vegetable Products
Fruit and vegetable products are manufactured in Britain by 378 enterprises,
including 11 with over 1,000 employees who account for 65 per cent of net output.
320
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Among the products manufactured are jam, marmalade, sauces and vinegar. The
labour force numbers 77,500.
The three largest manufacturers account for two-thirds of total output of jams and
marmalade, which has fallen from 329,000 tons in 1949 to 209,000 tons in 1961.
Strawberry, raspberry and blackcurrant jams are the most popular.
In 1961, 562,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British Navy was
using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry did not take place
until after 1935. Processed peas (182,000 tons) and beans in tomato sauce (203,000
tons) are the vegetables most preserved in cans. In addition, output in 1961 included
90,000 tons of canned and bottled fruit, and 193,000 tons of canned soup. Plums are
the most important single fruit used for canning, but the largest tonnage canned is
fruit salad, mainly from imported fruit.
The quick freezing of foods has been expanding rapidly in Britain since 1954.
Some 68,000 tons of vegetables and 1,200 tons of fruit were preserved by this method
in 1961; peas account for 75 per cent of all quick-frozen vegetables.
Aggregate exports of fruit and vegetables in 1961 were valued at ^9-3 million.
Bacon Curing, Meat and Fish Products
There are some 980 enterprises, whose principal activities are: the curing of bacon
and ham, the canning and preserving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages
and pies or the preparation of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers over
75,000. Output in 1961 included 62,000 tons of canned meat and meat products and
203,000 tons of bacon. There has been a rapid expansion of frozen fish output, and
some 56,000 tons were produced in 1961; small quantities (3,000 tons in 1961) are
also canned. Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of £6-4 million in 1961,
and meat products were worth an additional j£5'9 million.
Beverages
The industries which manufacture beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks had a
labour force of 102,000 in 1961, and exported products with a value of £85-5 million.
Whisky: Exports of Scotch and Irish whisky reached 27 million proof gallons with
a value of £74-4 million in 1961; over half went to the United States. Scotch whisky,
which makes up most of this total, was first distilled in the fifteenth century. It is
blended from 20 or more different types, some from malted barley and some from
other grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 72-7 million proof gallons
(a record) produced in 1961 will not be on sale for some years. Stocks of whisky
amount to about 327 million proof gallons, of which one-third has been in stock
for more than three years. Nearly three-quarters of annual sales are to overseas buyers.
Gin: Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the 1950s. The main
distillers are situated in London and one company accounts for about half the total
output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad, exports had
a value of ^5-4 million in 1961.
Brewing and Malting: There are 300 enterprises in the brewing and malting industry.
In recent years there has been a strong tendency towards the creation of larger brewery
units, partly to secure wide distributive outlets for the products of the large brewing
groups, many of which market beer throughout the country. Bottled beer consumption
is increasing, and today probably accounts for two-fifths of total consumption;
draught beer accounts for the remainder. The industry undertakes investment in
INDUSTRY
321
fixed assets (including bottling equipment) of about £16 million a year. Firms are
experimenting with new methods, including continuous brewing processes.
The main raw materials used in brewing are sugar, hops and malt. Malt is made
almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all or part of their own
malt others purchase it from independent maltsters who also supply distillers, vinegar
brewers, and malt extract manufacturers. British malt is used by brewers throughout
the world, and exports in 1961 were worth £1-9 million.
Soft Drinks: The soft drinks industry has expanded rapidly since the second world
war, especially since 1954. Output in 1961 included 43.9 million gallons of
concentrated liquid and 234-6 million gallons of unconcentrated drinks. The post-war
trend has been towards increasing consumption of carbonated squashes, sales ot whic
are seven times greater than in 1939.
Though there has been some amalgamation in recent years, there are still several
hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are three very large firms among
the twenty producing widely advertised brands which are marketed on a national
scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by firms in the production of various
tvpes such as carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials tonic
waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted drinks (in which the whole fruit is used).
Tobacco
The United Kingdom tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and
other tobacco goods sold in the country. In 1961 personal expenditure on these goods
amounted to £i,2iS million (of which over two-thirds was tax revenue) and, in
addition, exports worth £18-7 million (over 90 per cent of which were cigarettes)
were shipped to a large number of overseas markets. The main centres of production
are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham,
Glasgow and Belfast. The two largest manufacturing groups now account tor about
qo per cent of output. The industry has 47,600 employees. . ,
The tobacco industry used almost 320 million lb. of unmanufactured tobacco in 1961,
all of which was imported. The main sources are the United States, Rhodesia and
Nyasaland, India and Canada. Most of this tobacco goes to make cigarettes (nearly
seven-eighths) and pipe and cigarette tobaccos. Production of cigarettes for the home
market is estimated at 110,000 million per annum, about 20 per cent of sales being in
the form of filter-tipped brands, consumption of which is expanding. Cigars account
for some £ per cent of tobacco consumption, but sales doubled between 1954 and
1961 to about 315 million.
BRICKS, POTTERY, GLASS AND CEMENT
This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods pottery,
glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The total value of its
exports in 1961 was £69-6 million. The industries have a combined labour force of
351,000, which includes 79,000 in the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades.
Brickmaking and Refractory Goods
About 700 firms manufacture items such as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney pots,
fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln linings. Brick¬
making, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by the Romans, and
manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabrication to highly mechanised
systems. In 1961 about 7,400 million building bricks were produced; over one-third
322
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
were of the Fletton type, made mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas.
Refractory goods (firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite
bricks) are manufactured mainly for home use. Exports in 1961 had a value of ^4'9
million.
Domestic Pottery
The domestic pottery industry is one of the oldest craft industries in Britain;
the making of domestic pottery dates back to before the Roman occupation. The
chief raw materials, china clay, ball clay and china stone, come from Devon, Cornwall
and Dorset, where known deposits of high quality are expected to last for about 100
years.
About 95 per cent of production capacity is concentrated in the Potteries area
in Staffordshire, comprising the six towns of Stoke, Burslem, Tunstall, Hanley,
Fenton and Longton. The 356 enterprises in the industry have about 68,000 employees,
of whom many are engaged in the production of table and ornamental ware. Exports
in 1961 had a value of £14-5 million, comprising £8-7 million worth of stoneware and
earthenware, and ^5’^ million worth of china; the United States, Canada and
Australia were the chief markets.
Among the famous makes of British pottery are: Wedgwood, Spode, Royal
Worcester, Royal Doulton and Royal Crown Derby. Early in i960 the pottery industry
started production of felspathic-type pottery under the name of English Translucent
China.
Glass
Britain’s glass industry, the third largest in the world, has some 68,000 employees.
The section of the industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in
their various forms is organised for quantity production. Glass can now be supplied
in sheets of great size and can be made almost unbreakable. Its use for internal
decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent
years. Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor industry. Other
products include glass bricks, tubular glass (produced on a large scale), mirrors, lamp
and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types of glass
container (often made by fully automatic machinery). A traditional product is hand¬
made lead crystal glassware, of very high quality, much of which is exported.
The advance of the industry is shown by the increase in direct exports of glassware
from a negligible level in 193^ ^ ^ v<du<; of ^18-9 million in 1961, this total included
^8-9 million worth of plate and sheet glass which was exported mainly to Australia,
Canada and the United States.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research Asso¬
ciation, and much research work is also carried on by the Department of Glass
Technology at Sheffield University, the first of its kind in the world. A British firm
has developed a revolutionary glass-making process for producing float glass .
Cement
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the manu¬
facture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824, this
material and the methods of its production have been the subject of continuous
technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity of the industry, which
has some 18,000 employees, has increased substantially since the war to meet the
growing demands of the building industry. About one-third of production comes
INDUSTRY
323
from plants situated in the Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent. Annual output,
which reached 7-7 million tons in 1938 had risen to 14-2 million tons in 1961. One
group of companies is responsible for about two-thirds of total output. In 1961 direct
exports of cement, which have been falling in value, were worth £5'3 million.
PAPER, PRINTING AND PUBLISHING
The paper, printing and publishing industries have a labour force of over 621,800,
including 98,800 in the manufacture of paper and board, 68,900 in the production of
cardboard boxes and packing cases, 137,700 in the publishing of newspapers and
periodicals and 240,600 in other types of printing and publishing. Fixed capital
expenditure came to an aggregate £83 million in 1961.
Paper and Board
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until 1678,
but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year 1492. Total
production in 1961 of all types of paper and board amounted to 4 million tons, double
the pre-war figure of 2 million tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 712,000 tons,
against 800,000 tons pre-war; since 1953 output of wrapping and packaging paper
and board has risen by nearly two-thirds, mainly as a result of its growing use as
packaging material. Exports of paper, board and manufactured paper items were
valued at £41-2 million in 1961. The bulk of the export trade is to sterling area
countries, mainly Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.
Nearly three-quarters of the many different materials used by the industry (totalling
some 4 million tons in 1961) comes from abroad. The balance consists mainly of waste
paper recovered from domestic sources.
The industry comprises 210 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of paper and
board, 495 enterprises which make cardboard boxes, cartons and packing cases and
610 firms who manufacture miscellaneous items such as wallpaper and paper bags.
Considerable interests are held abroad, including pulp and paper producing mills in
the United States, Canada and other parts of the Commonwealth and in Europe.
Printing and Publishing
The printing industry produces an immense range of goods from national news¬
papers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The industry includes
many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have led to the formation of
large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sections. Of the 629
enterprises in the printing and publishing of newspapers and periodicals, 322 have
over 25 employees and 22 of these over 1,000 employees; 4 large firms employ more
than 7,500 persons. General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains
essentially an industry of small firms with over 75 Per cent of the 6,500 firms having
fewer than 25 employees.
Total sales of books in 1961 amounted to £79 million, of which some £32 million
worth were exported. Popularity of paper-backed books has increased rapidly and
the value of sales has increased by 300 per cent since 1953- According to official figures,
expoits of printed matter, manuscripts and typescripts were valued at ^35 million in
1961, including books (^16-5 million), and newspapers and periodicals (^b-i million),
but since these figures do not include parcel post shipments, exports are considerably
higher. The United States, Australia and South Africa are the most important overseas
markets. A shortage of skilled workers has led many firms to introduce the latest
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
324
developments in high-speed printing equipment, including electronic engraving
machines and advanced processes of photographic reproduction.
OTHER MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with some
294,600 employees, rubber manufacture, with 125,400 employees, and a group of
miscellaneous manufactures which together embrace some 176,200 employees.
Rubber
The United Kingdom rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world,
dating from 1819 when Hancock, the inventor of the nrst method of processing
raw rubber on a commercial scale, set up a factory in London. He afterwards collaborated
with Macintosh, the inventor of waterproof garments, and it was another Scotsman,
Dunlop, who in 1888 devised the pneumatic tyre. At the present day, tyres and tubes
represent more than half the total output of the industry. More recently, British
firms have pioneered cellular rubber and latex foam products, and they also make
a great variety of other rubber manufactures, the most important being rubber
footwear, conveyor belting, cables, hose and thread.
The British industry is the third largest in the world, coming after those of the United
States and Russia. There are 470 firms located throughout the country, and in 1961
their consumption of rubber totalled 321,900 tons, including 166,000 tons of natural
rubber, 121,000 tons of synthetic rubber and 35,000 tons of reclaimed rubber. There
are 14 tyre manufacturers, including several subsidiaries of United States companies.
In 1961 they consumed 167,000 tons of rubber, and exported tyres and tubes worth
£29-4 million; this figure excludes large indirect exports on vehicles. Exports of other
manufactured goods in the same year were valued at ^18-4 million.
Furniture
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe, in
Buckinghamshire, is an important centre for domestic furniture manufacture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture had a value of £126 million in 1961; exports were
worth £2-4 million. A Furniture Development Council was established in 1949; it
undertakes research, training and study in technical and artistic subjects and design,
provides a technical information service and publishes statistics.
There are some 2,400 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of wooden furniture
in Britain (including domestic, upholstered, office, school and other furniture) with a
total labour force of 103,000. Many firms are small and of the 590 larger enterprises,
8 with over 1,000 employees account for 25 per cent of net output. In recent years
there has been a tendency towards increased concentration.
Toys, Games and Sports Equipment
There are over 520 enterprises manufacturing toys and sports equipment in Britain,
though three large firms with over 1,500 employees account for 31 per cent of net
output. The British toy industry is today the largest in Europe; deliveries in 1961
were worth £40 million, and exports had a value of £S-j million. Australia, the United
States and Canada were the main overseas markets. Exports of sports equipment and
games were valued at an additional £6 million. The industry estimates that current
annual expenditure in Britain on toys amounts to £j per child; current trends are
towards increased production of small-scale precision models of vehicles and equipment
and greater use of plastics materials; interest in construction kits is also increasing.

AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES
AND FORESTRY
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on imports
for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and most important
industries. It occupies nearly one million people, or just under 4 per cent of those in
civil employment, provides about 4 Per cent of the gross national product, and uses
49 million of the 60 million acres of land.
THE LAND AND ITS USES
Land used for farming is conventionally divided into improved land suitable for
cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing, nearly all of which is hill or mountain
land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken, heather or scrub trees.
Rough grazing has a low potential output—usually assessed at about one-sixth of that
of agricultural land—but is valuable for sheep. In England and Wales only about one-
sixth of the 29-4 million acres of farming land is classified as rough grazing. In Northern
Ireland the proportion is about one-quarter of a total of nearly 3 million acres but in
Scotland it is about three-quarters (12-4 million out of 16-8 million acres). In the
United Kingdom as a whole there are 30-6 million acres under crops and grass.
Improved land and rough grazing together represent 82 per cent of the land area.
The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available
for farming is being gradually reduced to meet the needs of housing and industry;
however, the loss is outweighed by the increase in output from what remains.
The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west and north,
overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river valleys are usually
fertile, varying in texture from clay to sandy loam, silt and peat. Clay soils everywhere
necessitate under-drainage, and as all are constantly leached by rainwater, lime has to
be applied at regular intervals. In hill country the aroa of improved land is often small,
but is usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
Size and Ownership of Farms
For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size from a
few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to tenants. At all
times the tenanted holdings were interspersed with some owned by the farmers who
occupied them, and with some peasant or cottage holdings. Social changes of the past
half-century have completely changed the pattern of rural life in England and Scotland.
Estate duties have been a principal factor in the breaking up of estates. Most surviving
estates are still owned by private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, the
325
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
326
Church Commissioners, local authorities, the National Coal Board, and other corporate
bodies hold considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many have been bought by the
tenants already in occupation. About half the farms in Great Britain today are owner-
occupied.
Although the average size of all agricultural holdings in Britain is about 7° acres of
crops and grass, many of them are small holdings which do not provide a full livelihood
for their occupiers. In England and Wales, for instance, nearly half the 345,000
holdings are of this type, the occupiers generally having another source of livelihood
in addition to farming. Taking full-time holdings only, the average size of holding in
England and Wales is about 115 acres of crops and grass. In Scotland the crops and
grass area of the 24,000 farms worked part-time average only 11 acres, but for the
31,000 full-time farms the average is 132 acres.
Scotland has two distinct farming zones: most of the good land lies in the east and
south of the country, while in the Highlands and Western Islands agriculture is quite
distinct from that of the rest of Britain, there being an exceptionally high proportion
of rough grazing to improved land. Numerous small occupiers are grouped in scattered
villages, each with a tiny area of enclosed land and rights of grazing on an adjoining
hill. The Highlands are thus divided between a few large holdings and a great many
very small crofts.
In Northern Ireland there are only a few large estates. Almost all the land is divided
into about 70,000 holdings varying from a few acres to 300-400 acres. Most of these
holdings are occupied by the owner. Some 20,000 are either re-let in conacre (small
portions prepared for crops) or owned by people who do practically no farming.
Of the remaining 50,000 effective farms, about half can be said to provide a full-time
occupation for the owner.
Types of Farming
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from farm to
farm. In many districts the mosaic of farms is dominated by one type and the bias
towards one product or group of products is so marked that the whole area takes on a
distinctive character. In England the farms devoted primarily to arable crops for sale
are in the eastern part of the country, in East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire, and the
East Riding of Yorkshire. Potato and vegetable growing on a substantial scale marks
the farming of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas
around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire.
Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops. In
Scotland, the rich lowlands of the east coast, the Lothians and a fringe of land around
the Moray Firth are also primarily arable.
Interspersed between these arable areas, and also in the Midlands and the south¬
east of England, there are large tracts where, although much of the land is kept under
the plough, the rearing and fattening of cattle is an important enterprise. In the south¬
west of Scotland dairying is extensively practised, but most of the north-west is
devoted to rearing sheep on rough hill land. The parts of England bordering the
Pennine hills and most of Wales are also sheep rearing areas, though a good deal of
dairying, based on purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. Dairy farming is
widely practised throughout much of the rest of Britain. In Northern Ireland mixed
farming is practised, the most important products being pigs, fat and store cattle,
milk and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill areas. Oats and barley are widely
grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the only important cash crop is potatoes,
both ware and seed.

327
Tillage and Grassland
Traditionally, in England and Wales old grass is regarded as the property of the
landlord; many leases still specify the fields which may not be ploughed, except under
penalty. But the tenant is free to sow other fields to grass if he wishes and to plough
them out whenever he wishes; so two types of grass came into existence old 01
permanent grass, the property of the owner, and temporary grass or ley, a rotational
crop of the tenant, its lease of life depending on the system of farming. The ley farming
system had its origin in the use of grass in the cereal rotation to restore soil fertility
and structure.
In Scotland, which has never had the same tradition, the tenant is free to plough as
he chooses, although in practice very high-lying fields are ploughed with the mam
object of renewal of the grass. The area under temporary grass has always been high.
The situation during the 1939-45 war called for a widespread ploughing out of
grass. Since the end of the war, in all parts of the United Kingdom there has been a
slow return to permanent grass; but not all of the gain in tillage has been lost and there
has been an increase of 2-9 million acres in the area of temporary grass, so that the
total arable area remains about 5 million acres more than it was pre-war. On the
arable land of England and Wales the old-style rotations have been abandoned, and
a cropping system has been adopted which allows a high proportion of cereals, sugar
beet and potatoes, with short or medium term leys. The western counties of England
and Wales show a heavy bias towards cereal crops with longer leys, and over the
country as a whole there has been a tendency for leys to lengthen with improved
management of grass. In Northern Ireland, while the greater proportion of the grass¬
land is under permanent grass, medium length leys are a common feature. Scotland,
with its choice of crops restricted by soil and climate, has returned to its pre-war
pattern of rotational cropping, in which leys occupy more than half the arable ground.
Thus, in England and Wales nearly one-half of the 24 million acres of arable and
grassland is under permanent grass, about one-quarter under cereals and one-sixth
under temporary grass; of the 4-3 million acres in Scotland, only just over one-fifth is
in grass seven years old or over, against about two-fifths in grass under seven years old,
while in Northern Ireland over a half is permanent grass and about one-quarter
temporary grass.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION: CROPS AND LIVESTOCK
Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and diseases,
and of the market; but during the present generation much has been done in Britain
to mitigate the risks. In part this has been effected through the advance of science, in
part through self-help by farmers’ organisations, but in greatest measure by Govern¬
ment action. The role of the Government, successively as financial supporter, as
war-time controller, and as guarantor and provider of technical and advisory services,
is described on pp. 336-47. .
Between the two world wars British agriculture suffered a long depression which
reached its lowest point about 1930. Yet already the industry was becoming organised:
separate National Farmers’ Unions had been set up in England and Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland to give formers a collective voice; breed societies had been
established to watch over the interests of stock breeders; young farmers’ clubs were
becoming numerous; a chain of research stations had been constituted, and a com¬
prehensive system of university, college and farm institute education \\ as in being.
The extent to which agricultural activity had declined became more apparent with
the outbreak of war in 1939. Much land once in arable cultivation had been allowed to.

revert to permanent grass. During the war 7 million acres of the permanent grass
were ploughed, the area under potatoes was doubled, and that under wheat and barley
nearly doubled. The total number of cattle increased slightly, chiefly owing to larger
dairy herds; sheep and poultry stocks declined; and the number of pigs fell by more
than half. . r , , , r
Since the end of the war, and particularly since the easing of the balance of payments
position permitted freer importation of feedingstuffs, the general trend has been
towards the building up of cattle and sheep stocks; the number of pigs and poultry
has also greatly increased (see Table 18).
Agricultural Production
The effect of these changes may be judged by reference to the total production of
the major agricultural commodities, shown in Table 19. .
The general pattern since the end of the war shows a very large increase in all the
main crop products (except oats and potatoes), and in mutton and lamb, beef and milk.
Compared with pre-war, the 1961-62 output of pigmeat and of eggs had increased by
about 70 and 100 per cent respectively, this increase, and also the increase of 65 per cent
in sales of milk off farms, being partially attributable to heavier imports of feeding¬
stuffs in recent years. It was estimated that about 6-7 million tons of concentrates
were imported in 1961-62, nearly 2% times the volume in 1952-53, and a further
1.9 million tons would be available as by-products of imported grain and oil-seeds.
In terms of a new index of agricultural net output (average of 1954-55 t0 I956~57
= 100) introduced at the i960 annual review, the forecast for 1961-62 was 122,
representing an increase of about 9 per cent in two years. On the old index (pre-war
average = 100) the forecast figure for 1961-62 was 183.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Food Supplies
Since 1939 the population of the United Kingdom has increased by about 5 million,
or slightly more than 10 per cent; yet the total proportion of the nation’s food supplied
from home sources has increased. Before the war Britain produced (in terms of value)
about one-third of its food. It now produces about half; or two-thirds of all that can be
grown in temperate climates. The percentages by weight of total supplies of the
principal foods provided by home production in relation to the pre-war average are
shown in Table 20.
Table 21 shows how, for selected items, total food supplies have changed since
before the second world war and since food rationing ended (in 1954). It reflects
certain well-known trends. In general, consumption of bulky foods (carbohydrates),
such as flour and potatoes, has been declining, while that of high-protein foods, such
as meat and eggs, has increased with greater availability and rising living standards.

Crops
Wheat. The possibilities of wheat growing, which is mainly confined to England,
have been changed out of all recognition by the advent of new strong strawed and
heavy yielding varieties, mainly from the continent of Europe but some home-bred.
These permit the liberal use of fertilisers, and spring dressings of nitrogen have become
accepted practice. Crop yields of 2 tons per acre are no longer unusual.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 331
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation of drying
and storage facilities on many farms. In addition, such equipment is used on a
co-operative basis or by contractors.
Barley. There are two distinct markets for barley—for malting and for feeding to
stock. Malting barley has in the past commanded a much higher price than feeding
grain, but the disparity has now decreased. New varieties have greatly enlarged
yields. Since 1955 both the acreage and production of barley have risen by nearly
70 per cent.
Oats. There has been a decline of almost a half in the total area under oats in the
past decade, and even in Scotland, where it is by far the most important cereal, the
area has decreased by one-third. No longer needed for horses, oats cannot compete in
yield of grain with modern barleys. The crop thrives on acid and high-lying soils and
endures damp harvests; and no other can equal it in the fodder value of the straw.
Fodder Roots. In England the turnip crop is giving way to kale and cabbage. The
total acreage of fodder crops (except kale) has, however, been declining steadily since
1953 because in many cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically by
increased grass production and improved methods of conservation. In Scotland the
decline in turnips has been less rapid and the acreage under this crop is now greater
than in England. The area under mangolds—grown almost entirely in England—has
fallen by 49 per cent since 1953, while fodder beet, after a promising start, is now
grown on only a small scale. Rape retains a modest place as sheep fodder.
Sugar Beet. Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire where most of the
beet sugar factories are situated. The crop is grown under contract to the British Sugar
Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices and also provides
technical advice and assistance. Yields per acre are increasing and in i960 a record
crop of 7-2 million tons was harvested, with a yield of 17-4 tons per acre. Precision
drilling is the usual method and more than half the crop is mechanically harvested.
Potatoes. Early potatoes are grown in England and Wales in numerous, widely
scattered districts with favourable soils and climate. The crop is marketed during the
summer months and reaches the consumer within a few days of lifting. Main crop
varieties, which are normally stored before sale, are grown chiefly in the Fen counties,
Essex, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In Scotland early potatoes are grown in coastal
areas of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, but a substantial part of the industry is concerned
with supplying seed potatoes to English and foreign growers. In Northern Ireland
both main crop and seed potatoes are produced, and a large part of the crop is shipped
to Great Britain and abroad.
Cultivation and raising of the crop is almost entirely mechanical, picking (and some
setting) being done by hand.
Dairy Farming
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when con¬
verted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk is produced
primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk
is used for manufactured products. Production and liquid sales are now much greater
than before the war. Sales promotion by the industry is helping to maintain these
higher liquid sales. The average consumption per head is now about 5 pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow are still rising steadily; in England and Wales they have
increased during the last decade by nearly 20 per cent and now average about 75°

gallons a year. Freedom from tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and through the
artificial insemination (AI) centres, operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other
organisations, the influence of a small number of high-potential bulls is widely dis¬
seminated. The Friesian breed now dominates both AI centres and farms on which
bulls are maintained in England and Wales; the Ayrshire breed is still most in demand
in Scotland; and in Northern Ireland the Dairy Shorthorn still predominates although
Friesians are on the increase. Milk production has also been stimulated by advances in
grassland management, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of making high
quality hay; new methods of conversion into silage are being exploited. Most dairy
farmers practise some degree of intensive grass management, but hay of traditional
type remains the basic winter feedingstuff; it is supplemented with purchased
concentrates. _
Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards for equipment and buildings
used in milk production are enforced by regulations. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food’s Milk Service has a general responsibility for enforcing the
regulations and for advising farmers in England and Wales on clean milk production.
In Scotland these functions are performed by local authorities but central supervision
is exercised by the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Livestock
Beef Cattle. Although home production of beef is considerably greater than it was
pre-war, imports are lower and consumption per head has not yet overtaken the pre-war
level. Taste is changing and the public no longer wants joints from fully fattened
beasts. Normally, it does not pay to feed large amounts of concentrates to fatten cattle,
so they are maintained on grazing and the by-products of arable cash crops. In upland
regions herds of pure-bred, nearly pure-bred, or cross-bred beef stock are kept on
‘natural’ lines, the cows calving in early spring and grazing with their calves through
the summer. Usually the calves are sold at weaning to farmers with arable fodder and -
good grazing for fattening. Nowadays much beef derives from the dairy herds, some
females (usually the first calf heifers) being mated to beef sires, and suitable breeds of
bull being maintained at AI centres. The cross-bred calves make useful beef animals;
so too do the pure-bred male calves from Friesian, Shorthorn and some other types of
herds. There is a large and complex trade in store cattle, increased by young animals
imported from the Irish Republic, whose general movement is from the upland west
to grazing areas in the Midlands and arable areas of the east.
Sheep. Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary
researches have provided vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the epidemic
diseases to which sheep are subject. More than thirty breeds and innumerable crosses
are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated within a circumscribed area.
The basic stocks are everywhere maintained by local selection, but lowland flocks are
continually reinforced by fresh blood from the hills.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, wdnter conditions are usually severe.
Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn to swell the lowland
flocks, usually in two stages: firstly, to farms at intermediate altitudes, where they are
mated with rams of a larger and more rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred
progeny pass on in due course to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to
the Midlands and the south and east of England, where they become crossed again
with a variety of sires. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the first-cross sires
fecundity and early maturity.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
333
Wool, at one time of relatively little value, is now of importance to the sheep farmer;
research into breeding for wool is being undertaken, notable among Welsh flocks. But
the prime purpose of British sheep farming today is the production of fat lambs, in
response to the change in the preference of consumers away from mature sheep. Leys
are largely relied on for fodder, although in Scotland the turnip crop is still of con¬
siderable importance.
Pigs. Pig production is a complex enterprise, owing to the varying uses to which the
carcase is put. In Britain the carcase has always been used in three different ways: for
curing as bacon, for sale in fresh condition as pork, and for sausages or other processed
forms, in that order of importance. For the several trades, pigs of three different
weight ranges seem to be called for but leanness is desirable in all three.
Breeders, in the main, aim at the long type required by bacon curers, for which there
is a grading system based on weight, carcase measurements of length and back-fat. The
native Large White breed yields carcases conforming closely to these requirements.
Some breeders in search of extra length have infused Landrace blood, imported from
Scandinavia. Others have turned to pure Landrace herds. For the trade in pork and
meat for processing, the Large White boar is generally used.
Apart from type, breeders’ attention is now focused on utility qualities, such as
size and weight of litters, and on food consumed per pound of liveweight gain. Litter
recording and the progeny testing scheme operated by the Pig Industry Development
Authority are providing basic data. This authority, set up under the Agriculture Act,
1:957, promotes improvements in the production of pigs and in the processing and
distribution of pigmeat.
Poultry. Most farmers keep some poultry but a considerable number of the birds
in the country are kept on non-agricultural holdings, whether in backyards or on a
commercial scale. In the past 20 or 30 years specialist techniques have been used
increasingly and the industry has become more intensive. In consequence, by 1961 over
30 per cent of laying birds on farms were in flocks of 1,000 or more and the number of
farms on which these large flocks were kept had increased also. With the rise in the
poultry population and in the yield of eggs per bird, the estimated production of eggs
has reached double the pre-war level and for several years nearly all eggs consumed
in Britain have been home-produced.
Within the industry the trend is towards specialisation in the breeding and supply
of stock and in the production of eggs and table poultry. The mass production of
special table chickens, or ‘broilers’, has now become a major industry; it is estimated
that about 140 million birds were produced in 1961.
Horticultural Crops
Horticultural crops occupy only a tiny fraction of the cultivated land of the country
—less than per cent of the area under crops and grass—but their value in terms of
output per acre is very high. The total value of horticultural crops sold in 1961-62 is
estimated at about £165 million, compared with some £275 million for farm crops.
About 400,000 acres are under vegetables and about 280,000 acres under fruit.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population, and in the
Thames valley, for example, some very large capital investments have been made. It
has also flourished in more rural areas with favourable soil or climatic conditions—in
Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire and Kent, and in the Avon valley in a
concentration of smallholdings around Evesham. Districts with mild climates, such
as the Penzance region of Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of selected
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
334
early crops. More recently, selected vegetable crops have been grown in increasing
quantities by farmers as an alternative to potatoes: this applies particularly to brassicas
and to peas for canning, drying and quick-freezing.
Specialised horticultural holdings range from a few acres up to about 300 acres,
and many have glasshouses, frames or forcing houses. Use of fertilisers, particularly
of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the field work is mechanised. The
larger holdings normally have specialised packing sheds, with washing and grading
machinery, and irrigation plants. More and more growers, however, are coming
together in co-operatives for marketing their produce and many of these co-operatives
provide grading and packing facilities for members.
Britain has some 4,000 acres of glasshouses, more than half of the area being used
primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which are the Lea Valley
in Essex and Hertfordshire, and the Worthing district in Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on
a narrow belt of gravel and brick earth, about 800 acres are covered with glass. Total
production of tomatoes in the country is estimated at about 85,000 tons, and the value
of all glasshouse crops at about £27 million per year.
Hard fruits grow well in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk associated
with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the south, south-west and
east of England, and Kent in particular. Production of apples has been about equally
divided between cooking and dessert varieties, with Cox s orange pippin heading ihe
latter group, but production of cooking apples is now declining. iVbout 40,000 acres of
varieties of cider apple are grown mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and Somerset for
the cider-making industry. In Northern Ireland there are 8,000 acres of cooking
apples—Bramley Seedlings—mostly concentrated in County Armagh. Plums and soft
fruits are grown in many counties j concentrations of plums are found in Kent and
Worcestershire, of blackcurrants in Norfolk, of cherries in Kent and of strawberries in
Norfolk, Kent and Hampshire. Raspberries are exceptional in that of some 9,000 acres
grown in Britain nearly three-quarters are in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowiie
district of Perthshire and in Angus.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two main areas, in Kent an
Sussex and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Capital outlay and cultivation costs
are very high, but crops average about 12 cwt., worth some ^3^°> Per acre< The total
annual value of the crop is about million.
FARM EXPENDITURE AND EARNINGS
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agricultural
producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The estimates show that Britain’s farming is based on livestock; fully tw^o-thirds of
farmers’ income in Britain is derived from the sale of animals or their products. The
aggregate net income of farmers, after fluctuating around £350 million for some years,
exceeded £400 million for the first time in 1961-62. The annual cost of Government
support to the industry has ranged between approximately £240 million and -£35°
million.
Until 1953-54 labour costs were the largest item in farm expenses, but since then,
feedingstuffs have accounted for the highest proportion. Although the number of
farm workers has dropped by over a quarter since 1949, the responsibilities of those
remaining have correspondingly increased and rising wages have caused labour costs
to increase by one-third in the same period.
Since 1945 rents have lagged behind other costs. This has been due partly to the
reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and partly to the
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
335
terms of reference given to arbitrators by legislation repealed in 1958. Since 1959-60,
however, average rents in England and Wales have gone up by more than one quarter
and many farms are being let by tender at highly competitive rates often £5 ^6
per acre.
Capital Requirements
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer, if he
is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant. Each year
‘fixed capital’ totalling some £30-35 million is added to the value of land and buildings.
The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is provided by the occupiers.
Bank advances are an increasingly important source of outside capital, both fixed and
working; about half the total bank advances to agriculture are believed to be for short¬
term purposes. Agricultural merchants are also an important source of short-term
credit.
Accounts of some 2,300 farms in England and Wales, analysed by university
agricultural economists, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging from £20
to £50 per acre. In Scotland a similar sample of 900 accounts shows a wide range in
tenants’ capital per acre, from about £2 on hill sheep farms with extensive rough
grazings to between £4<-) Rud £50 P^r acre on lower ground farms. In Northern Ireland,
on the small intensive farms, occupiers’ capital ranges from £50 to £70 an acre.
Dairy farms are usually more heavily capitalised than other types of stock farms. On
all types of farms machinery is a heavy item; on dairy farms it is often £15 per acre
and on arable farms up to £20 per acre; even on stock rearing farms it may amount to
£5 per acre.
Mechanisation
The best single measure of mechanisation is perhaps the rate at which horses
have been replaced by tractors. In Great Britain the number of farm horses fell from
about 649,000 in 1939 to 54,000 in i960; tractor numbers rose from 117,000 in 1942 to
481,000 in 1961. Britain now has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world:
one to every 36 acres of arable land. Power-take-off implements now characterise
arable farming; and some 54>®®® combine harvesters were in use in the 1961 harvest.
A wide variety of machines for harvesting and preservation of grass are employed.
Milking machines are installed on all except the smallest farms, many with mechanical
means of handling milk. Four-fifths of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity
supply and accompanying equipment. There are over 200 farmers machinery syndicates
through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment without tying up their
own capital (see p. 341).
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out at the National
Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Bedfordshire. This Institute developed the
first farm tractor in the world employing hydrostatic transmission and also one of the
most effective complete potato-harvesters now in production.
Net Income
The range of profits between individual farms is very wide, varying with the size of
farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier. Farms do not lend
themselves readily to exact classification by type, so even averages must be treated with
caution. Nearly all group averages of recent years, however, show profits of £5 to
£10 per acre: there is a marked tendency for small farms to show higher profits per
33^
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
acre than large ones, owing principally to the higher proportion of profit represented
by personal work on the small farm.
Profits on arable farms have, with occasional seasonal exceptions, been maintained
at a higher level than on other types; dairy farming has shown consistent but moderate
profits, while those on stock-raising farms have usually been low, except where arable
sale crops are also grown or pedigree stock is bred. The profitability of pedigree stock
breeding can be assumed from the rise in prices for breeding animals throughout the
period. Exports of livestock other than horses were valued at over ^12-5 million in
1961 and exports of horses at £7-8 million.
THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
During the last hundred years the Government has played an ever-increasing
part in British agriculture. Since the opening up of the great primary-producing
countries of the New World and the Antipodes in the latter part of the nineteenth
century, producers of food had been at a disadvantage because supplies tended to
exceed effective demand. One answer to the problems posed for British farmers by this
situation would have been to discourage imports of primary products, but Britain,
being a great trading nation, was always reluctant to impose import duties in defence
of its agriculture—by then a relatively small part of the nation s economy, such a
course would have cut back trade, handicapped exports of manufactured goods and
raised the price of food. By the beginning of the 1930s, however, the need for some
form of State assistance to agriculture had become pressing; during the following
decade and subsequently, the main object of the Government’s agricultural policy
was to find methods of supporting domestic agriculture without prejudice to Britain’s
position as a world trading nation.
During the 1930s the Government initiated various forms of protection and financial
assistance for agriculture. Commodity commissions were set up for wheat and live¬
stock, with responsibility for administering Government subsidies or other forms of
direct financial assistance for the production of those commodities. the British Sugar
Corporation took over the sugar beet factories, and producer-controlled marketing
boards were established with powers to regulate the marketing of milk, pigs and bacon,
hops and potatoes. In 1934 subsidy payments were introduced to encourage the
production of beef cattle, and in 1937 the Government assumed powers to pay acreage
subsidies to assist producers of barley and oats.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agricultural
production was closely controlled by the State, with County War Agricultural Executive
Committees, composed of landowners, farmers and farm workers, acting as the
Government’s local agents. As a result of Government control, purchase and rationing,
the functions of marketing boards and commodity commissions were largely suspended.
To ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers and farm workers, while at the
same time keeping the cost of living steady, most of the basic farm products were
purchased at fixed prices on Government account and sold at controlled prices, often
below the cost of procurement; the difference in price was borne by public funds.
This practice continued as long as rationing lasted.
Post-war Policy
Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act of 1947* main
objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be a stable and efficient
agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation s food and other
agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the United
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
337
Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum prices consistent with proper remuneration
and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return
on capital invested in the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered
to provide, for the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the
light of annual reviews (see p. 338).
Post-war policy falls broadly into two periods, with the dividing line about 1954.
During the first, the chief aim was to encourage expansion and a return to something
like the traditional pattern of British farming. ‘Production objectives’ were set for each
of the main commodities, as they had been during the war, though the Government
gradually ceased to direct farmers what to grow. By means of additions to the prices
fixed at annual reviews, ^40 million per annum were injected into farm incomes to
provide additional working capital for expansion. The Hill Farming Act of 1946
offered grants for the rehabilitation of hill farms and, by encouraging investment in
fixed equipment, set the pattern for later legislation.
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own agricultural production and trading
position improved, the Government gradually restored to private business both the
importing of food and domestic trading in food. The last remnants of consumer
rationing of food were abolished on 3rd July, 1954. Since the ending of the period of
scarcity, policy objectives have changed: stress has been laid on more economic
production of food of the kinds and qualities demanded by the market, rather than on
indiscriminate expansion of production. By 1957 the immediate objective of a 60 per
cent increase in production had been achieved, and attention was turned to long-term
measures. The Agriculture Act of that year assured farmers that the prices guaranteed
under the Act of 1947 would not be steeply reduced, and at the same time provided
grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up to date. In 1959 the problem
of the small farm business was tackled. In the following year, grants were made
available for buildings and equipment for horticulture, primarily with the object of
improving the presentation and marketing of horticultural produce.
Machinery of Government
The functions of Government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised by the
agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, for Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern
Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister responsible for United Kingdom
aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture, local aspects being the responsibility of the
Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture. The agricultural ministers are assisted by a
number of advisory committees composed of general agriculturists and specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is divided
functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject or service. Its
relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through its local offices,
grouped in England in regions, each administered by a regional controller working in
close collaboration with the regional heads of the technical services. Local offices in
Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary, with similar functions and with special
responsibility for Welsh affairs. County Agricultural Executive Committees—suc¬
cessors of the War Agricultural Executive Committees—have a number of duties,
including those of promoting technical development and advising the minister on
local aspects of policy.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are discharged
through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, which has its headquarters
in Edinburgh, with the help and advice of 11 Agricultural Executive Committees.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
338
The Secretary of State also appoints the members of two commissions: the Crofters
Commission, which has powers to deal with the unique and difficult circumstances of
crofting in the Highlands and Islands, and the Red Deer Commission, which has the
general functions of furthering the conservation and control of red deer and of keeping
under review all matters relating to them.
Two Agricultural Improvement Councils, one for England and Wales and one for
Scotland, advise the respective agricultural ministers on the problems of the industry
that require research and on the dissemination of research results to working
farmers.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for implementing
agricultural policy inaugurated by the Northern Ireland Government. It is organised on
similar lines to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as
agent in the administration in Northern Ireland of United Kingdom agricultural
schemes. Its administrative headquarters are in Belfast and each of the six counties
has an Agricultural Executive Officer.
CURRENT SUPPORT POLICY
Annual Review
In February each year, in accordance with the Act of i947> tF® agricultural ministers
review the economic condition and prospects of the industry. Between annual reviews,
a special review may be held if the ministers consider it warranted, but this has seldom
been necessary. In holding reviews, the ministers are required to consult with repre¬
sentatives of agricultural producers—in practice, the three farmers unions in the
United Kingdom. The ministers consider such factors as production trends and market
requirements, world market prospects, the cost of subsidies, the trend of profits in the
industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in production
costs, trading relations (especially with the Commonwealth) and the national economic
situation. In the light of their conclusions, they determine guaranteed prices for fat
cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool, milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These
guarantees apply to livestock and livestock products for the ensuing twelve months,
and to crops to be harvested in the current year. Various grants in aid of particular
kinds of production or farming practice (known as ‘production grants) are also
considered. Any changes in ‘relevant’ production grants (broadly, those payable to
occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into account. The Government’s con¬
clusions and its decisions on changes in guaranteed prices and relevant production
grants are published as a White Paper.
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 Act require the total value of the
guaranteed prices and relevant production grants in any year to be maintained at not
less than 97^ per cent of their value in the preceding year, after allowing for changes
in costs. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted for any change in the basis of the
guarantee) for each commodity must be not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous
year. For livestock and livestock products—where farmers decisions need time to
take effect—there is a further provision that reductions in the guaranteed price for
any product must not total more than 9 per cent in any period of three years. The cost
of Government support to the industry in 1961—62 was ^351 million, some ^88 million
higher than in the previous year. The major factor in the rise was the greatly increased
expenditure on price guarantees for fatstock. The estimated cost of support for 1962-63
is ^339 million, but changes made at the 1962 annual review and the increase in the
retail price of milk reduce this by ^15 million to ^324 million.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
339
Price Guarantees
The general policy of the Government is to use methods of agricultural support that
allow the ordinary channels of trade to flow freely. The form of guarantee most
generally used is the deficiency payment, which means that the Government makes
payments to producers, related to the differences between the average market price
realised and the guaranteed price, for output eligible for the guarantee.
The deficiency payments schemes for cereals and fatstock are administered directly
by the agricultural departments. Payments for wheat and rye are based on the quantity
of millable grain sold and delivered by the grower. For barley and oats, much of which
is consumed on farms, payments are based on the acreage grown. New arrangements
first introduced for the 1961-62 season provided growers with an incentive to hold
barley until later in the season. Deficiency payments for fatstock are made weekly to
individual producers on certified sales on a liveweight or deadweight basis. The weekly
standard prices for fat cattle and fat sheep vary on a seasonal scale; for pigs there is no
seasonal scale but the weekly prices are adjusted for changes in feed costs and, under a
new flexible guarantee arrangement introduced after the 1961 annual review, adjust¬
ments may also be made quarterly by reference to a forecast of the number of pigs
likely to receive the guarantee payment during a period of 12 months.
For most of the remaining commodities the Government operates the guarantee
through the appropriate marketing board, which takes account of any payments from
or to the Government in deciding what to pay producers for their produce. In the case
of milk there are five such boards, and the full guaranteed price applies only to a ‘stan¬
dard quantity’ which includes all milk sold for liquid consumption, together with part
of that going for manufacture. For milk in excess of its standard quantity a board receives
only a lower guaranteed price, but there is a profit and loss sharing arrangement between
the Government and each board, to encourage the boards to get the best prices they
can for milk for manufacturing. The retail price of liquid milk is determined by the
Government so as to cover the full cost of the guarantee, and taking one year with
another there is no subsidy. For eggs, a flat rate subsidy (also subject to a profit and
loss sharing arrangement) is paid to the British Egg Marketing Board on all eggs sold
to the board through packing stations. So far as potatoes are concerned, a deficiency
payment is made in years in which the average British growers price for potatoes for
human consumption (excluding new potatoes) is less than the guaranteed price.
Payment is made to the Potato Marketing Board (see p. 345) for the benefit of growers
in Great Britain and to the Ministry of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, for the benefit
of growers there.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board for every
pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to fix in advance a schedule
of producers’ prices, based on types and quality, after making allowance for its
marketing costs.
Under the Sugar Act, 1956, and the Agriculture Act, 1957, the British Sugar
Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop produced from a
specified acreage (at present 414,600 acres) at a scale of fixed prices, determined as a
result of the annual review and related to sugar content. Refined sugar produced by
the corporation is sold, under market-sharing agreements with the refiners, at a price
based on the world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which result from the
transactions of both the corporation and the board are ultimately reflected in the
board’s accounts. When these accounts show a deficit, a levy is charged on all sugar
34°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
imported or home-produced, entering the United Kingdom market, including the
sugar content of composite sugar imports, and when there is a surplus, a distribution
payment is made correspondingly, so that taking one year with another the board
balances its account.
Production Grants
The following are the main grants and subsidies which are ‘relevant production
grants’ for the purposes of the Agriculture Act, 1957, and the annual review.
Fertilisers and Lime. Schemes under the Agriculture (Fertilisers) Act, 1952, provide
grants to assist farmers in the purchase of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers.
Farmers can also obtain a refund of more than half their costs of liming the land to
improve soil fertility.
Ploughing up Grass. Ploughing grants are available for land that has been continu¬
ously under grass for not less than three years, to encourage the regular ploughing up
and extended use of leys.
Silo Grants. Grants amounting to about half the cost of approved projects, up to a
maximum of £250 a farm, are available under the Agriculture (Silo Subsidies) Act,
1956, for constructing and improving silos for conserving grass and fodder.
Calf Subsidy. To stimulate the breeding and rearing of calves suitable for beef
production, a subsidy is paid to the rearer of suitable calves at the rate of £9 5s. a
head for steers and £7 10s. a head for heifers.
Hill Cow Subsidy. To encourage the production of breeding cattle on hill farms, a
subsidy of £12 per head is paid on breeding herds maintained on hill and upland farms.
Small Farmers. To establish on a firm economic basis small farm businesses whose
main handicap is lack of working capital, grants are offered to small farmers who carry
out three-, four- or five-year improvement plans approved by the agricultural depart¬
ments. The limit is £1,000 for any one business.
Destruction of Rabbits, Wood Pigeons and other Land Pests. The principal mammals
and birds in Great Britain harmful to farming are rabbits, wood pigeons, rats, mice,
moles and, in the north, carrion crows. Occupiers are responsible for dealing with
pests on their land and for seeing that they do not spread to neighbouring properties.
To encourage co-ordinated action, the Government pays a grant of half the expenditure
incurred by rabbit clearance societies in the systematic destruction of rabbits and
wood pigeons; over 800 rabbit clearance societies have been registered in Great
Britain. A similar grant is paid for the control of coypu, which have been spreading in
East Anglia. Contributions are paid to fox destruction societies to encourage organised
control of foxes in open country where there is no hunting.
Grants for Long-term Improvements
In addition there are several types of grants for long-term improvements which
are not ‘relevant production grants’. Among them are the following:
Farm Improvement Scheme. Under the Agriculture Act, i957> §ran^-s are available to
the owners and occupiers of agricultural land towards the cost of improving certain
kinds of fixed equipment, including farm buildings, roads and fences, and the supply
of electricity. The rate of grant is one-third of the cost. Grants are also available
towards the incidental costs of amalgamating uneconomic holdings.
Hill Farming. Under the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts, 1946-59, grants
are available to the owners and occupiers of upland farms suitable only for rearing
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
341
livestock as their main enterprise. (The Acts also apply to some lowland areas in the
north of Scotland where conditions are similar.) Grants amount to 50 per cent of the
cost of comprehensive schemes for putting the farms in sound working order.
Horticulture Improvement Scheme. Under the Horticulture Act, i960, grants are
available to horticulturists, to the landlords of land used for horticulture and, in some
cases, to horticultural marketing co-operatives. The range of improvements towards
the cost of which grants of one-third may be made includes plant and equipment
designed to improve the storage or preparation of produce for the market.
Farm Drainage and Water Supply Schemes. The State contributes towards the cost
of land drainage and water supply. In England and Wales, for example, grants for
farm drainage may be up to 50 per cent of the approved cost. Farm water supply
grants are at the rate of 25 per cent of the approved cost where the connection is to a
public main, and 40 per cent where a private source is utilised. Grants of up to 50 per
cent are available in Scotland and Northern Ireland for farm drainage and towards
the cost of installing and improving farm water supplies. Separate legislation provides
grants for these services in Northern Ireland.
Farmers’ Machinery Syndicates
The Government makes one-third capital grants towards expenditure incurred by
landowners or farmers in providing buildings to house machinery and grain drying
and storage equipment for use by farmers’ machinery syndicates (see p. 335).
Horticulture
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and is liable to great variations in
quantity and quality from season to season, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed
prices. Instead, horticulture enjoys through import duties a measure of protection
comparable to that afforded to agriculture by the guarantee system. Where appropriate
different tariffs on horticultural produce apply at different times of the year so as to
allow imports to enter more freely at times when they do not compete with the home
crop. Certain of the production grants are available to growers on the same terms as to
farmers. Marketing arrangements are described on p. 345.
OTHER GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND ACTION
Land Use
It is an integral part of the Government’s planning policy (which is administered
in England and Wales by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, and in
Scotland by the Scottish Development Department that the better agricultural land
should not be taken if there is less valuable land that would serve the purpose. The
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food assists in carrying out this policy in
England and Wales by providing expert advice to planning authorities and other
departments on the implications, from the standpoint of the public agricultural interest,
of all substantial proposals to take agricultural land for other purposes. Appropriate
arrangements exist for the Ministry to be consulted about such proposals. In Scotland
similar arrangements exist for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to give
advice.
Agricultural Credit
The Government has never pursued a general policy of making credit available to
agriculture on easy terms. Nevertheless, a number of facilities for specific purposes
enjoy government encouragement and support.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
342
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. and takes the
form of a loan on the security of a first mortgage on freehold agricultural land and
buildings or of an improvement loan against the security of a terminable rent charge
created on the land improved. The corporation s funds are derived mainly from public
issues of stock, but it receives a measure of government support. In Scotland, loans
for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural land in Scotland are granted by the
Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.; this corporation also receives
support from the Government.
Improvement loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and
buildings are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement Company,
whose funds are provided privately. The amount of such loans is charged on the
land and buildings in the form of a terminable rent charge. Improvement loans
require the sanction of the agricultural ministers.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers for a wide range of purposes from
the Agricultural Loans Fund administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed
out of public funds. The bulk of the loans issued are short-term and are for such
items as agricultural machinery, but in the case of buildings the period may be
extended to thirty years. No loans are advanced for purchase of land.
Smallholdings
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and Wales
have had powers to provide smallholdings. Legislation imposes on county councils
an obligation to provide smallholdings and enables the Minister of Agriculture to
contribute towards their losses. The aim was at first to foster a peasant economy, but
later to provide holdings for ex-Servicemen of the 1914-18 war, and then for the
unemployed. Now, under the Agriculture Act, 1947, the object is to give opportunities
for persons with agricultural experience, particularly agricultural workers, to become
farmers on their own account. In England and Wales, about 16,000 smallholdings
are provided by local authorities and about 1,300 by the Ministry. Of the small¬
holdings provided by the Ministry, approximately 1,000, situated on 18 different
estates, are managed by the Land Settlement Association Limited, which was originally
formed in 1934 for the purpose of developing smallholdings for unemployed men
from industrial areas. The association provides centrally on each estate various
services for the tenants’ use, including the supply of agricultural stores and requisites,
the operation of a machinery pool, and the packing and marketing of produce.
The Minister has power under the 1947 Act to make loans for working capital to
tenants of statutory smallholdings. In this way they can be helped to obtain livestock,
machinery, implements and other necessary items; tenants must, however, have
available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central Government,
which now owns and maintains some 436,000 acres of land settlement estates, with
over 4,000 holdings.
Crofting
In the seven Scottish counties known as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness,
Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much of the land
is farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are generally either rented at a
cost of not more than £§0 a. year or have an area not exceeding 75 acres‘
In these counties there are about 20,000 crofts, which produce about one-quarter
of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems of the crofting counties,
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
343
which had for some time been suffering from a declining population and falling agricul¬
tural production, led to the setting up, in 1955, of a Crofters Commission whose
functions are to reorganise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to
promote the interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting.
The commission’s powers, embodied in the Crofters (Scotland) Acts of 1955 an^
1961, include that of carrying out reorganisation schemes in ‘townships’ (crofting
communities) if a majority of the crofters agree, by reallocating the land in a way
which, in the commission’s opinion, would lead to the proper and efficient use of the
land and the general benefit of the township. The commission has also powers over
the letting and sub-letting of crofts and it is responsible for approving regulations
governing the use of common grazings. It acts as agent for the Secretary of State
for Scotland in the administration of schemes of loans and grants for the develop¬
ment of agricultural production on crofts, and collaborates with other bodies in
carrying out measures for economic development and social improvement in crofting
areas.
Arterial Drainage and Sea Defence
Land drainage in England and Wales is administered by 34 river boards1 and 400
internal drainage boards. Each river board area comprises a major river system. They
cover the whole of England and Wales, apart from the London area. There are no
comparable boards in Scotland, where drainage is the responsibility of owners and
occupiers of land. River boards have powers to maintain and improve watercourses
scheduled as main rivers. Their work is concerned with the improvement of land
drainage by increasing the capacity of rivers and erecting pumping stations, the
prevention of inland flooding—both urban and agricultural—and the erection of
defences to protect low-lying areas from coastal flooding. River boards also have powers
relating to freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and their
work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural areas. Their main function is to keep the land
drained in their area by improving the main drains and, where necessary, by pumping
from low-lying land.
The boards derive their income directly or indirectly from rate-payers. The Govern¬
ment pays grants towards the cost of the improvement schemes carried out by both
types of board. Grants to river boards vary from 20 per cent to 80 per cent according
to the financial position of the board. Internal drainage boards receive grants at a
flat rate of 50 per cent.
The gross capital expenditure of drainage authorities on new and improved works
is now nearly ^8 million a year. Government grants, including grants towards the
repayment of loans raised in previous years, amount to over ^4 million. Drainage
authorities’ expenditure on maintenance is estimated at about million a year and
is rising steadily.
The Land Drainage Act, 1961, extended the powers of river boards to deal with
arterial watercourses. The Act also improved the administrative provisions of the Land
Drainage Act, 1930, and extended the land drainage powers of local authorities.
1 River boards are composite bodies representing local government, agricultural and fisheries
interests. The Thames Conservancy Board and Lee Conservancy Catchment Board are similar
in constitution and powers to the river boards; because London draws most of its water supplies
from these two rivers, however, they have long been regulated under the powers granted by Acts
of Parliament of purely local application. Legislation is proposed whereby 27 river authorities
would supersede the river boards and assume their functions; they would also be charged with
the positive duty of water conservation (see p. 292).
M
344
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is the drainage authority in respect
of determined main watercourses, with the exception of the Erne and Lower Bann
which are the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. The cost is met by the
Exchequer in the first place, offset by contributions from the county and county
borough councils. Joint land improvement schemes on smaller watercourses may be
promoted by the riparian owners and receive Government assistance. Urban drainage
schemes, towards which an Exchequer grant is available, can be promoted by local
sanitary authorities.
Land Tenure
In Great Britain about half, and in Northern Ireland all farms are owner-occupied.
The traditional form of tenancy in England and Wales runs from year to year; in
Scotland leases for terms of 10 to 14 years are more common. The tenancy agreement
may be either written or verbal and may (but need not) include provisions about such
matters as rights of cropping, liability for repair and maintenance, and compensation
for tenant’s improvements.
In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to eliminate
uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of landlord and tenant relationships
has been written into legislation. The Agriculture Acts or 1947 and, for Scotland,
1948, lay down the basic rules of good estate management and good husbandry for
owners and occupiers respectively. The Agricultural Holdings Acts of 1948 and 1949
contain more detailed provisions, some of which apply to all tenancy agreements
(i.e. the parties may not contract out of them) and some of which apply only in the
absence of specific provision in the tenancy agreement.
Among the compulsory provisions are those relating to security of tenure. The
Acts provide for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception of certain short¬
term lettings to which exemption can be given by the Minister or Secretary of State, to
continue in force from year to year until determined by a valid notice to quit. With
certain exceptions, such as where the notice to quit is given on account of a breach of
contract by the tenant (for instance, failure to pay rent or carry out repairs), the tenant
can contest it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative
unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and Wales the
Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court) that his claim
for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or good husbandry or
that the land is required for certain purposes specified in the Acts.
The Acts lay down a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on
termination of the tenancy. Compensation is normally payable both for disturbance
(between one and two years’ rent) and for improvements which the tenant has carried
out during the tenancy. The landlord is normally entitled to counter-claim for
dilapidations, and machinery is provided for the settlement of claims by arbitration
in default of agreement between the parties. Rent is a matter for negotiation between
landlord and tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing agreement,
by arbitration at intervals of not less than three years in England and Wales and five
years in Scotland. A landlord is entitled to claim additional rent for improvements
carried out at his expense. The Acts also forbid provisions in tenancy agreements
which would unduly restrict the tenant’s farming operations.
MARKETING
Agricultural products are now marketed mainly through private trade channels
such as corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories; or
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY

through producers’ co-operative organisations. For certain commodities, however,
marketing arrangements are effected by boards operating under the Agricultural
Marketing Act, 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation). These marketing boards
are producers’ organisations with statutory powers to regulate the marketing of particu¬
lar products. The schemes under which they are constituted and operate must be
approved by Parliament and confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members
of the board are elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister
or ministers concerned. Other safeguards are provided for the protection of consumers
and the public interest.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which have powers to
trade as the first selling agency for all producers not specially exempted or, alternatively,
to exercise a comparable influence by controlling all contracts between producers and
first buyers; and secondly, boards which maintain only a broad control over marketing
conditions leaving producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The
boards for eggs, hops, milk and wool fall into the first category and those for potatoes
and tomatoes and cucumbers into the second.
A Horticultural Marketing Council representing all those concerned in the marketing
of horticultural produce-producers, wholesalers and importers, retailers and organised
labour—was set up in May i960 under the Horticulture Act, i960. The task of the
council is to improve the marketing and distribution of, and develop the trade in,
horticultural produce. Its functions include giving information about supply, demand
and prices; encouraging better grading and standardisation; and carrying out research
into marketing and distribution methods. It is intended that the council’s activities
should eventually be financed by the horticultural industry; the Horticulture Act,
however, authorises the financing of the council from public funds during its first
three years of operation. A Covent Garden Market Act, authorising the setting up of
a Covent Garden Market Authority, was passed in 1961. The authority has powers
to reorganise and modernise the largest of London’s five horticultural wholesale
markets.
Under a new scheme announced at the 1962 annual review, the Government is to
provide grants up to a total of £i| million over an experimental period of three years
for research and development in the marketing of agricultural and horticultural
produce in the United Kingdom; the industry will have to make available a similar
sum from its own resources.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Animals
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the veterinary
profession. The State veterinary service, which was inaugurated in 1865, deals with
situations beyond the control of the individual practitioner. The service for the whole
of Great Britain is now controlled from London, where the Ministry’s Animal Health
Division is manned day and night to deal promptly with outbreaks of infectious disease.
Britain has now been free for many years from eight serious animal diseases includ¬
ing rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies.1 Northern Ireland, in addition, is free
from fowl pest and swine fever. On 1st October, i960, the whole of Great Britain
became an attested area, virtually free from bovine tuberculosis and Northern Ireland
became so in November i960. Thus in a space of ten years bovine tuberculosis in the
United Kingdom had been reduced to a point where it was no longer a national

problem. Any cattle reacting to the tuberculin test are slaughtered and compensation
is paid to the owner. Strict movement and isolation controls are applied to all imported
cattle not of fully attested status.
To supplement the work of private veterinary surgeons and practitioners in England
and Wales, a Government-operated Veterinary Investigation Service carries out
investigations requiring specialised knowledge or facilities beyond the range of the
general practitioner. In Scotland this is not a Government service but is linked with
agricultural teaching institutions.
The work of the State veterinary service is backed by applied research carried on
at the State veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and Lasswade, Midlothian,
and at Stormont, in Northern Ireland.
Plants
Advice to growers on the general control of plant pests and diseases is given by the
advisory services. In addition, the State plant health service is responsible for statutory
controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests and diseases present in Britain and
prevent the introduction of new ones from abroad. It also issues the health certificates
required by other countries to accompany plant material imported from Britain.
Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the development of
healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of crops subject to
degenerative diseases.
AGRICULTURAL ADVISORY SERVICES
The National Agricultural Advisory Service
In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural
matters is available to every farmer and grower through the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food’s National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS). Every county
has a county advisory officer in charge of advisory work and is divided into districts,
in each of which there is a district advisory officer who can call on an extensive system
of specialist advisers. Northern Ireland has its own separate advisory service, organised
on similar lines through the County Agricultural Executive officers. In Scotland the
advisory services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on the three agricultural
colleges.
Facilities are provided at the NAAS experimental farms and horticultural stations in
England and Wales and at agricultural college centres in Scotland for field-scale
extensions of research work and investigations of local problems.
The Agricultural Land Service
The main functions of the Agricultural Land Service, which operates in England
and Wales, are:
(1) to advise owners of agricultural land on estate management matters, including
farm buildings;
(2) to provide professional advice and services to the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and his agents on all matters relating to farm land and
buildings;
(3) to provide expert professional advice to the Minister and department on the
agricultural land use implications of planning proposals, including the
possibilities of reclaiming to agriculture, land worked for minerals by opencast
methods; and
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
347
(4) liaison with other departments and planning authorities about such proposals.
In Scotland similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries but advisory work regarding farm buildings is undertaken
by the agricultural colleges.
The work of the advisory and veterinary services is supplemented by numerous
technical publications.
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Research
Agricultural research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agricultural
Research Council (see p. 213) and is largely financed by the State. The council has
24 research stations and units under its direct control and is responsible for the
administration of Government grants to 14 independent research institutes in England
and Wales; in Scotland, eight independent research organisations receive grants
through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland also have their own investigation laboratories (see p. 218). Grants are also
made by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to universities and to other
recognised research institutions.
The Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, founded in
1843, was the first such institute in the world and is still a leading authority for research
on soils, fertilisers and crop husbandry. Others of outstanding importance include the
Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, Aberdeen; the Rowett Research Institute,
Aberdeen, which specialises in the study of animal nutrition; the Research Institute
at Pirbright, Surrey, for animal virus diseases; the East Mailing Research Station, in
Kent, and the Long Ashton Research Station, Bristol University, for fruit research;
the John Innes Horticultural Institution, Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire; the National
Institute for Research in Dairying, Reading, Berkshire; the Grassland Research
Institute, Hurley, Berkshire; and the Welsh Plant Breeding Station at Aberystwyth.
Research on stored products pests is done at the Pest Infestation Laboratory, Slough,
and the subsequent development and control work at the Ministry’s laboratory at
Tolworth, where research on the control of harmful mammals and birds is also
centred.
Information on research is exchanged with other Commonwealth countries through
the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux and Institutes (ten Bureaux
and two Institutes in the United Kingdom and one Institute in Trinidad).
In England and Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined in the
Provincial Agricultural Economics Service, which comprises ten university Departments
of Agricultural Economics and which is co-ordinated not by the ARC but by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In Scotland, agricultural economists are
on the staff of the three agricultural colleges. The agricultural departments in both
England and Wales and Scotland have economics and statistics units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture also has a Farm Economics and
Statistics Division and has, in addition, its own research divisions investigating
problems of animal and crop production. The staff of these divisions are also responsible
for lectures in the Faculty of Agriculture of Queen’s University, Belfast.
Industrial concerns manufacturing weed-killers, insecticides, fertilisers, feeding-
stuffs and agricultural tractors and implements undertake research on a considerable
scale and in most cases maintain experimental farms and estates. They have been
responsible for developing a wide range of new, improved and safer products.

Agricultural Education
There are four types of institutions which provide full-time training in agricultural
subjects: universities, agricultural colleges, county farm institutes (in England and
Wales), and farm schools (in Scotland). Eight universities in England and Wales
(Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, London, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, and the
University of Wales at Aberystwyth and Bangor), and three in Scotland (Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Aberdeen) provide degree and postgraduate courses in agriculture.
The University of Bristol offers postgraduate diploma courses. In Northern Ireland, a
degree course is provided at Queen’s University, Belfast. A National College of
Agricultural Engineering was established in i960 and, pending completion of new
buildings at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, started courses in the autumn of 1962 at Boreham,
Essex. This will be the eighth of the national colleges (see p. 174) established to
train people for highly specialised industries whose needs cannot be met at local
technical colleges.
Two-year diploma courses are given at five agricultural colleges and at two of the
county farm institutes in England and Wales; three agricultural colleges in Scotland
give two-year to three-year diploma courses. In Scotland the three colleges also offer
two- or three-term certificate courses. In Northern Ireland there are two agricultural
colleges, which provide three-year diploma courses in poultry husbandry and dairying
and one-year certificate courses in these subjects and in general agriculture and
horticulture; a third college is to be built.
There are 31 county farm institutes in England and five in Wales run by local
education authorities. They provide residential courses in general agriculture, dairying,
horticulture, poultry husbandry and rural domestic economy. Local education authori¬
ties also provide a wide range of short courses and classes for farmers, farm workers,
horticulturists and domestic producers.
There are seven farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities,
providing courses—mainly residential—of from one to three years’ duration for boys
and girls of from 12 to 16 years. There is one residential agricultural school in Northern
Ireland, which provides short courses for boys and girls over 15 years of age.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge and
London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
FISHERIES
Although the sea fishing industry contributes only about J per cent of the United
Kingdom’s gross national product, it is of greater importance to the economy of
Scotland. It is also by far the most important source of employment in some of the
major fishing ports. The industry falls into two main divisions, concerned respectively
with white fish and herring. White fish, such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and sole,
are demersal fish which live on or near the sea bed. Herring and similar species,
such as pilchard, mackerel and sprats, are pelagic fish which live mainly in inter¬
mediate waters or near the surface.
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups: the distant
water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The distant waters are
those off Iceland, Greenland, Bear Island and the north coast of Norway, and the
Barents Sea; the middle water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near
water grounds are those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas
around Britain. The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The
inshore waters also yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
349
Fishing Ports
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleetwood,
Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft
for herring. In Scotland the chief centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Granton,
Fraserburgh, the Moray Firth, Shetland, and the west coast; herring landings are made
principally at Aberdeen, Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Shetland, and at a number of west
coast ports, including Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban and Ayr. In Northern Ireland the
herring fishing ports are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
Methods of Sea Fishing
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring and
drift netting.
Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant and near waters for all
species of demersal fish.
Seining is also used for catching demersal fish all the year round; a number of
fishermen in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland depend on seining for a living,
the main areas of operation being in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of Clyde,
and the Irish Sea. There are about 780 Scottish and Northern Ireland seiners, and
about 215 operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring based on
the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east coast ports of
England, and autumn fishing off East Anglia based on Lowestoft and Yarmouth.
Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of Scotland and off Southern
Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and methods
of capture; trawling, seining, lining, and drift and ring net fishing are employed;
in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, shrimps, mussels, cockles
and oysters, and, off Scotland, north-east England and in the Irish Sea, there are
substantial catches of ‘Norway lobsters’ (nephrops).
The Fishing Fleet
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood,
numbered 288 at the end of 1961- They are over 140 feet and up to 220 feet in length
and make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in the Arctic Circle, although
in the past few years there has been an increasing tendency to fish the waters bordering
Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. The increase in fishing in these areas is
due in part to the introduction of factory trawlers of up to about 260 feet in length
which spend up to three months at sea and fillet and freeze much of their catch
immediately it is taken. At the same date, near and middle water vessels numbered
461; they are under 140 feet long and most of them work nearer home, making voyages
of from a few days up to more than two weeks, although some of the larger vessels
fish regularly off the Faroes and seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the
near water group are vessels engaged in drift net fishing for herring; these vessels
usually make daily voyages. The inshore group consists mainly of vessels of under
80 feet which are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days and more usually
make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land.
In the United Kingdom fishing industry in 1961 there were about 22,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 6,000 were occasionally employed; 9,000 of the
former and 2,200 of the latter were from Scottish ports. In Northern Ireland there
were about 500 regular fishermen.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Supplies
In the year which ended on 31st December, 1961, landings of fish, both demersal
and pelagic, in the United Kingdom by British fishing vessels totalled 746,000 tons
(644,000 tons of demersal fish and 102,000 tons of pelagic), valued at about £49
million. Landings at British ports by foreign vessels totalled about 149,000 tons of
fresh and frozen fish (including 65,000 tons brought direct from the fishing grounds),
valued at about ^14 million. British landings of shellfish yielded ^2-4 million. Cod
accounted for 40 per cent of the total value of wet fish (i.e. fish other than shellfish)
landed by British vessels; haddock (20 per cent) and plaice (9-6 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) into the United
Kingdom in 1961 amounted to about 201,000 tons valued at £43 million, including
23,000 tons of canned salmon to the value of ^15 million and other canned fish worth
million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and im¬
ported canned fish) in the United Kingdom averaged 15,500 tons landed weight in
1961. On an edible (fillet) weight basis, United Kingdom consumption has been
estimated provisionally at 17-6 pounds per head in 1961, compared with a peak total
of 28-7 pounds in 1948 and an annual average of 21-8 pounds from 1934-38.
Two-thirds of the catch landed in Northern Ireland is used for human consumption
or for animal feeding; the balance is exported to Great Britain.
Sea Fish Processing
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-freezing
for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and development. The
production of quick-frozen fish has been increasing steadily since 1952' With the
increase in quick-freezing, new export outlets have opened up for white fish, which in
1961 accounted for nearly half the total British exports of fish and fish products,
valued at £6-4 million. Markets abroad for quick-frozen fish, mainly in Europe and
the Commonwealth, have been expanding steadily; exports of herrings have continued
to decline.
By-products
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for animal
food and to a much lesser extent for fertilisers. Home production of white fish meal
and herring meal has over the past three years remained constant at around 75,000
tons per annum. A large percentage of the fish meal is obtained from offal and most of
the remainder from unsold catches. Imports of fish meal of all kinds in 1961 totalled
230,000 tons. The preparation of vitamin oils from fish livers is also a source of addi¬
tional earnings. The oil is extracted at sea as soon as the fish are caught, and is later
refined ashore.
Freshwater Fisheries
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In Scotland
and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or draught nets in rivers
and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used for catching salmon in the
sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries. In England and Wales the value of
the salmon catch is approximately .£300,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to over
£1 million, and in Northern Ireland to some £150,000. In Northern Ireland, eels,
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
351
worth about £160,000 a year, are captured by long lines and by eel nets placed in river
weirs.
Fishing for sport by rod and line in rivers, lakes, streams and canals is wide¬
spread. Salmon grilse and sea-trout are the most important catches, and the fishing
rights command high rentals. There are also extensive fishings for brown trout and
other freshwater fish, e.g., roach, rudd, perch and dace; figures of catches are not
available.
Distribution System
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate Market
in London, which handles about 300 tons a day, but other large cities also have
central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers,
located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers; the port
wholesalers prepare the fish for onward shipment. Many special express fish trains
transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, but increasing use is being
made of road transport. Retail sales are handled by some 25,000 to 30,000 fishmongers
and fish friers; the latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Recent developments include the entry of trawler-owning companies into the
system of distribution. This process is being speeded by two factors: one is the
growing popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail
outlets as well as by fishmongers (between 15 and 20 per cent of fish sold in 1961 was
estimated to be quick-frozen); the other is the decline in the number of fried fish shops.
Promotion and Regulation of the Industry
The Government departments mainly responsible for the administration of legisla¬
tion concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland and the Ministry
of Commerce for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Home
and Health Department are concerned with questions of nutrition and hygiene
affecting fish and fish products. The safety and welfare of crews of fishing vessels are
provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by the
Ministry of Transport.
The Herring Industry Board. The Herring Industry Board was set up under the
Herring Industry Act of 1935 to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry;
subsequent amending Acts have also been passed. The board consists of a chairman
and two other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are
appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary
of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The board, whose activities are financed
partly by Government grants and loans and partly by levies and licence fees, is advised
by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the
catching and shore sections of the industry.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both at
home and abroad, and the provision of financial assistance for the purchase of new
boats, nets and gear, and the reconditioning of existing boats. The board is particularly
active in developing new and wider markets for herring, and applying the benefits
of technical progress to the industry, including the adoption of new fishing methods,
and the construction of new processing plants for quick-freezing and kippering. The
board buys all herring not sold for other purposes for reduction to oil and meal, and,
with the aid of Government grants, has built processing factories for this purpose.
352
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The White Fish Authority. The White Fish Authority and the Committee for Scotland
and Northern Ireland of the Authority were set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act,
1951. The function of the authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate the white
fish industry, and that of the Committee to advise the authority about the exercise
and performance of its functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The authority
is composed of five independent members, and the Scottish Committee of four under
the chairmanship of a member of the authority. They are appointed jointly by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland and
the Home Secretary. The White Fish Industry Advisory Council was also set up
under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, to advise the authority about the exercise and
performance of its functions. It consists of 51 members representing the various
interests of the fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers Government grant and loan schemes for
the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and loans for the purchase of nets
and gear and processing plants. Up to 31st March, 1962, £30-5 million in loans and
£12 million in grants were approved for these purposes by the authority. Its other
activities are financed by a levy on first-hand sales of fish.
Subsidies and Grants
Since 1950 a Government subsidy has been paid towards inshore, near and middle
water vessels fishing for white fish. This subsidy, now paid under the White Fish and
Herring Industries Act, 1953, varies according to the class of vessel concerned and
is paid at the rate of so much per day at sea for the larger vessels and at so much per
stone of fish landed from the smaller boats. In 1961-62 the amount paid in this way
was £3-i million. The White Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1957, extended the
subsidy to vessels fishing for herring, the conditions being broadly the same as for
white fish vessels. In 1961-62 herring subsidy totalled £364,273. Grants and loans
are also available under these Acts for vessels and engines for the fishing fleets.
The Sea Fish Industry Act, 1959, which came into operation in December 1959,
provided for further funds for subsidies and grants, and the White Fish and Herring
Industries Act, 1961, extended the white fish subsidy to vessels over 140 feet in length
and to other vessels fishing distant waters.
The Sea Fish Industry Act, 1962, passed in consequence of the report of a Com¬
mittee of Inquiry into the Fishing Industry, extended the scope of these forms of
aid and made provision for their continuance until the end of 1972. The Act, however,
contained special provisions for annual reductions in the rates of white fish subsidy
payable to vessels of 80 feet or over in length.
Whaling
Whaling is mainly conducted by expeditions, each consisting of a large floating
factory ship accompanied by its attendant whale catchers and tankers, which operate
mainly in the Antarctic Ocean. It is regulated by the International Whaling Com¬
mission, set up under the International Whaling Convention of 1946, which controls
the dates of the season and has powers to set a limit on the Antarctic catch of whales.
The offices of the commission are in London.
In recent years the United Kingdom industry has been declining in size, and now
sends only one expedition to the Antarctic each year. Whaling is also undertaken
from land stations on South Georgia, a British island in the South Atlantic. The
volume of whale oil obtained by the British pelagic expeditions in the 1961-62 season
amounted to about 164,000 barrels.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
353
FORESTRY
The total woodland area of Great Britain is more than 4 million acres, or over
7 per cent of the total land area. Except for the period of the two world wars, when
much over-felling took place, home woodlands have not made more than a small
contribution to the nation’s timber requirements. At present, Great Britain imports
about 85 per cent of its needs of timber and wood products. The Government is,
however, devoting continuous effort through the Forestry Commission to the long¬
term task of increasing the country’s timber resources.
Forest Areas
On 30th September, 1961, the area of woodland in blocks of one acre and over in
extent was estimated to be qj164*000 acres, of which about half were in England,
about two-fifths in Scotland and the rest in Wales. The greatest density of woodland
in Great Britain occurs in north, east and central Scotland and in the southern counties
of England, although afforestation is now increasing the importance of forestry in
many counties which were not previously heavily wooded. The classification of forest
area showing type and ownership in 1961 is given in Table 22.

(a) Forest owned by private individuals and bodies; in this classification a small area of com-
munal forest is included, i.e. forest owned by public bodies such as local authorities and water
supply undertakings.
The high proportion (over one-quarter) of unproductive woodland (scrub and areas
where trees have been felled and partially felled) is largely a legacy of two wars, when
many woods were felled to meet the need for timber. Since 1945 area of this
unproductive category has been reduced by about 250,000 acres, but the large area
which remains gives some indication of the problem of rehabilitation which still lies
ahead.
The most common of the coniferous tree species in Great Britain is probably the
Scots pine, but such trees as the Sitka and Norway spruce are also plentiful. Of the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
354
broadleaved species, the most common tree is the oak, and there are considerable
numbers of beech, ash, birch, sycamore and elm. The climate and soil of Great Britain
are such that the growth of timber which can be obtained under systematic manage¬
ment compares most favourably with that achieved in other European countries.
Increased Use of Timber
From the early Middle Ages there was a continuous process of deforestation in
Great Britain. Woodlands were cleared for agriculture, and timber was used for a
variety of domestic and industrial purposes, for instance, as charcoal in iron-smelting,
for fuel, housebuilding, domestic and agricultural equipment, and shipbuilding.
Following the Industrial Revolution, cheap and easily workable timber began to be
required in ever-increasing amounts for a variety of new industrial needs, which could
only be met from imported supplies, and by 1914 home woodlands provided only
7 per cent of requirements. The sudden demands of the first world war brought
about a realisation of the need for a national forest policy.
The Forestry Commission and Forestry Policy
In 1919 the Forestry Act was passed establishing the Forestry Commission as the
national forest authority, with the general duty of promoting the interests of forestry,
the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber in Great
Britain. The commission consists of a chairman and not more than nine commissioners
who are appointed by the Crown; in exercising their functions, they are required to
comply with such directions as may be given to them by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland. There is continual contact
between the commission’s staff and private owners of woodland, and the staff gives
advice, free of charge, on silvicultural and management problems; substantial grants
for planting and forest management are paid to woodland owners.
In the years before the second world war, some progress was made by the com¬
mission in increasing the area under forest. During the war, however, extensive felling
was necessary to replace imports of timber. In 1943 the Forestry Commissioners
recommended, in their report on post-war forestry policy, that the nation should aim
at having at least 5 million acres of productive forest, of which 2 million acres, mostly
in private ownership, would accrue from the rehabilitation of existing woodlands and
3 million acres from the afforestation of bare land by the Forestry Commission. The
acreage of woodland proposed would, it was estimated, produce ultimately a volume
of timber equivalent to about one-third of the country’s needs. On this basis, forestry
would become a major industry which, in addition to its economic value, would help
to arrest the depopulation of rural areas.
In 1958, after reviewing forestry policy, the Government decided that the planting
programme of the Forestry Commission for the five-year period 1959 I9^3 should
be about 300,000 acres and for the period 1964 t° 1968, by which time the Forestry
Commission’s existing plantations would begin to come into full production, about
235,000 acres.
The Commission owns over 500 forests, totalling 1,700,000 acres of forest land,
well distributed over England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests are covered by
management plans, which provide for such work as planting, road construction,
thinning and fire protection.
Nearly half of the Forestry Commission’s new planting is being carried out in
Scotland, about a quarter of it in the Highland counties. The poorer types of land
are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable for other agricultural
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
355
purposes, and has become suitable for forestry only as a result of recent advances
in deep ploughing. Sand dunes are also used; on the southern shore of the Moray
Firth, Culbin Forest now covers 7,700 acres of land which had been unproductive
for centuries. Similarly, in Wales, 1,900 acres of sand dunes at Mon, Anglesey, and
nearly 2,400 acres at Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, are being successfully planted.
Finance. The Forestry Fund was established by the Forestry Act, 1919; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid their
receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with the amounts
voted annually by Parliament. From 1920 to 1961, net grants from Parliament totalled
^130*7 million and receipts from other sources ^41-9 million. Expenditure during
these years totalled ^172-4 million. In the year ended 30th September, 1961,
expenditure amounted to ^15-6 million, of which nearly £1-2 million represented
various grants to private forestry.
Private Forestry
Privately owned woods in 1961 comprised about two-thirds of the total forest area
in Great Britain (as shown in Table 22), and contain most of the mature and semi-
mature timber. The size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few
acres to several thousand acres, and a high proportion of the privately owned woodland
area belongs to small owners (i.e. owners of woods of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands by the
introduction of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme under the Forestry Act, 1947.
Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently to timber
production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan agreed with the
Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of planting and management grants
and technical assistance. By September 1961 the total area dedicated was 682,000
acres. In addition, there are the woodlands covered by the Approved Woodlands
Scheme in which a planting grant, but no management grant is made; and these
bring the total area managed under an agreed plan to over 832,000 acres. Woodland
owners are represented, in their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the
Forestry Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations
of woodland owners, the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in England and
Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.
The Forestry Commissioners have encouraged the development of co-operative
forestry schemes and have made loans available. The co-operative societies provide
for landowners and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing facilities,
and a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The commission also co-operates
with the principal forestry societies, such as the Royal Forestry Society of England
and Wales and the Royal Scottish Forestry Society, in disseminating technical
knowledge.
In 1959 the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established by the
timber merchants to promote the use of home grown timber.
Consultative Machinery
The Forestry Act, 1945, established national committees for England, Scotland
and Wales, composed partly of forestry commissioners and partly of persons outside
the commission. These committees supervise certain aspects of the commission’s
work, including particularly the acquisition and management of land and the pro¬
motion of private forestry.
356
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing and
utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee,
established by the Forestry Commissioners in 1939, consists of representatives of the
Forestry Commission, the Board of Trade and associations of landowners and timber
merchants. In 1949 the Forestry Commissioners set up the Advisory Committee on
Utilisation of Home Grown Timber to advise landowners and to undertake research
into problems connected with the marketing of timber from the commission’s own
forests A voluntary scheme was agreed upon in 1961 for consultation on proposals
for afforestation of land within National Parks (see p. 186) that has not previously been
planted with trees. The Forestry Commission agreed, and the Timber Growers
Organisation and the Country Landowners’ Association undertook to advise their
members, to submit such proposals to the park planning authorities.
Forestry Education and Research
The Forestry Commission maintains four forester training schools: in England, at
Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near Bettws-y-Coed in
Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Benmore, Argyllshire, and Faskally, near Pitlochry
in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the commission s
educational centre, and is used for practical courses for university students, land-
owners and agents, planning officers, school teachers and others connected with, or
interested in, forestry. _ # -
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a proportion of
suitable graduates is recruited by the commission as forest officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near Farnham,
Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this station and in
experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted to £427,000 in 1961.
This sum included grants for special forestry research work to various institutions
and to university departments including the Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford,
which is also financed by the University, the Colonial Office, and Colonial Govern¬
ments. Research into the qualities of home-grown timber is carried out by the Forest
Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, which is one of the
establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and also by
grant-aided research associations.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new Ministry
of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar powers and duties
to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the Forestry Act, 1919. At that
time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres for afforestation, of which 700 acres
had been planted. a _ /xt
Forest policy in Northern Ireland is now implemented by the Forestry Act (Northern
Ireland), 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act provides the Ministry
with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give financial and technical assistance
for private planting. It introduced measures for the protection of all woodlands,
whether owned by the State or privately owned, against destruction by over-cutting,
fire or depredation by animals. .
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace since the
end of the second world war. By 1962 over 115,000 acres had been acquired, of
which nearly 63,000 acres had been planted. The present afforestation programme
provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an area of 150,000 acres of productive
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 357
State forest. To reach this objective, a minimum annual planting rate of 5,000 acres
has been set.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and receipts
from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1922 to 1962 expenditure
amounted to about ^9 million, and receipts, other than parliamentary grants, were
in the region of £3-05 million. About 1,400 people are employed in field labour and
ancillary work. The area of exploitable private woodlands is at present about 27,000
acres, and private planting, which is gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the
supply at a low cost of young trees from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards
the cost of the establishment of new plantations, and by free technical advice.
In October 1961 the Ministry opened Pomeroy Forestry School at Pomeroy House,
Co. Tyrone, which provides training and refresher courses for forestry workers,
school teachers and others interested in trees and forestry.

TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed about 7-3 per cent of
the total labour force in the United Kingdom at the end of 1961. Of the 1,688,200
persons so occupied, 28 per cent were engaged in road passenger transport and road
haulage contracting, 27 per cent in railways and 19 per cent in postal services and
telecommunications. Sea and air transport absorbed respectively 10 per cent and
something less than 3 per cent. Nine per cent were occupied in port and inland water
transport, and 4 per cent in miscellaneous transport services and storage. Transport
and communications contribute nearly 8 per cent to the gross national product and
14 per cent to gross fixed capital formation at current prices.
SHIPPING
About 18 per cent of the world’s sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over is
registered in the United Kingdom. Although the British merchant fleet is still the
largest in active employment, British shipowners have been subject to increasing
competition from the growing fleets of other nations. Between 1955 and 1961 the
British merchant fleet increased by 11 per cent while the total tonnage of all other
countries increased by 41 per cent, from 81 million to 114 million gross tons. The
balance of payments for shipping services has been positive until recently (it was
minus ^50 million in 1961) and shipping still makes one of the largest contributions
to the United Kingdom’s total earnings of foreign exchange. In 1961 freights,
charter receipts and passage money amounted to £582 million, or 25 per cent of the
total value of invisible exports. In recent years freight carried in cross-trade has
amounted to nearly two-thirds of total shipping earnings. The proportion of the United
Kingdom’s own sea-borne trade carried in British ships is not known exactly, but is
believed to amount to about half.
THE MERCHANT FLEET
A total of 21-5 million gross tons of merchant shipping (steam and motor vessels of
100 gross tons and over) was registered in the United Kingdom on 30th June, 1961,
the largest tonnage ever recorded.
Recent trends in the composition of the merchant fleet have been the reduction
of tramp tonnage other than specially built bulk carrier tonnage, the growth of tanker
tonnage, the increasing size of tankers, and the commissioning of vessels specially
1 One gross ton (g.t.) = 100 cubic feet. One deadweight ton (d.w.t.) = 1 long ton (2,240 lb.).
Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed spaces on a ship. Deadweight tonnage
denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before sinking to the load line.

built to carry ore, sugar, and other commodities in bulk. Including Admiralty and
other tankers, the United Kingdom accounts for over 7 million gross tons or 17 per
cent of the world’s total sea-going tanker tonnage.
Modernisation, Age and Size
From 1945 to the end of i960 orders for new ships placed in United Kingdom yards
by British owners totalled over 15-5 million gross tons, with an aggregate value of nearly
£1,700 million. As a result, 55 per cent of the total gross tonnage in 1961 was less
than ten years old, compared with 43 per cent in 1955. The corresponding figures for
tankers were 74 per cent in 1961 and 58 per cent in 1955. There has been a tendency
for replacements to be larger because big ships are more economical to run; between
1955 and 1961 the average size of all ships (over 500 gross tons) increased from 5,200
to 6,200 tons, and that of tankers (over 500 gross tons) from 8,400 to 11,100 gross tons.
In 1962 there were four liners of 30,000 gross tons and over operating on trans¬
atlantic passenger services: namely, the Queen Elizabeth (83,673 g.t.), the Queen Mary
(81,237 g.t.), the Mauretania (35,673 g.t.), and the Caronia (34,173 g.t.). An extensive
programme of replacement of their fleet of passenger liners is being carried out by
the liner companies and the two largest liners to be built in Britain since 1939, the
Oriana (42,000 g.t.) and the Canberra (45,000 g.t.), came into service in i960 and 1961
respectively on the services from Britain to Australia and across the Pacific to North
America. The most notable passenger liner launched in the United Kingdom in 1961
was the Transvaal Castle (33,000 g.t.), which will be used on the South African mail
service. During that year three tankers, each of some 65,000 d.w.t., the Serenia, the
Sepia and the Solen, were completed for service with the Royal Dutch Shell group.
In June 1961, 14 tankers of 40,000 d.w.t. and over were owned and registered in the
United Kingdom.
Propulsion
The amount of coal-fired tonnage was somewhat less than 400,000 gross tons in
1961 and continues to fall. Oil has taken the place of coal in steamships, while steam
has continued to give place to the diesel engine, nearly 51 per cent of all tonnage being
diesel-driven in 1961. The first new ocean-going cargo ship to be powered by free
piston engines was launched on Clydeside in January 1959* The Ministry of Transport,
with the co-operation of the shipowning, shipbuilding and marine engineering industries,
is investigating the possibility of applying nuclear propulsion to merchant ships.
Employment of Shipping
In June 1961, 17-4 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and over
were owned and registered in the United Kingdom.1 The usual employment of this
fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping as follows:
8-4 million gross tons were employed as ocean-going passenger and cargo liners;
2-9 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps; 5-2 million gross tons as ocean-going
tankers; and i-o million gross tons in coasting and trade with ports between the Elbe
and Brest (home trades). During 1961, 28-8 million tons of cargo were carried in tramps
and liners between United Kingdom ports, compared with 33-5 million tons in 1955.
In both years coal comprised nearly three-quarters of the total.
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Admiralty
vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of cargo, and shipping
registered in the United Kingdom but owned in other Commonwealth countries (including
over 600,000 gross tons of tankers).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SHIPOWNERS
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom consists
of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter. Practically all
these ships are owned by large liner companies or groups of liner companies. Many
of them operate wide networks of scheduled freight and passenger services which,
between them, cover every ocean. The 2-9 million gross tons of ocean-going tramp
ships are operated by a large number of private owners, some of them having only a
small number of ships and some only one ship.
According to a survey published in 1959, the British shipping industry was composed
of some 270 companies, about half the tonnage being owned by nine or ten main
groups controlling over 50 companies. The many world-famous British shipping
lines operating services on international routes include: the Cunard, to North
America; the Royal Mail, to South America; the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the
Far East; the Peninsular and Oriental (P. and 0.)-0rient and the British India
lines, to India and Australia; the Union Castle, to South Africa; Elder Dempster,
to West Africa; Furness Withy, to North America and the West Indies; the New
Zealand line, to North America, Australia and New Zealand; and Shaw Savill and
Albion, to Australia.
Over two-thirds of the total United Kingdom tanker fleet belongs to the oil com¬
panies, although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies. A new type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier—is in use
on a substantial scale; some of the ore-carriers are partly owned by companies in the
steel industry, but are managed and operated by shipping companies.
Since the second world war United Kingdom shipowners have received no direct
financial assistance from the Government. For some years, however, the Government
has recognised that the United Kingdom shipping industry is faced with severe
competition and has found it increasingly difficult to build up finance for the replace¬
ment of ships. In 1956 the shipping industry was the only industry allowed to retain
the 20 per cent investment allowance in respect of taxation which was withdrawn from
industry generally (but restored in 1959). The allowance was raised to 40 per cent
in 1957 for capital expenditure on the construction of new ships.
SHIPPING ORGANISATIONS
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
The Society of Lloyd's
This body, which was founded in the late seventeenth century, is an incorporated
society of underwriters whose main business is marine insurance (see p. 416).
Lloyd's Register of Shipping
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s) which
surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety and operational
efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying and giving technical advice on
vessels of all flags from the initial stages of building, at regular intervals during their
service, and after casualties. A satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an
underwriter that he may accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between
the Register and the Society of Lloyd’s.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
361
Shipowners' Organisations
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for the
most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool
Steamship Owners' Association. The General Council of British Shipping co-ordinates
the views of the shipping industry as a v/hole on all matters of major policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners' Association, the London General
Shipowners' Society, and the North of England Shipowners' Association. Others represent
companies specialising in a particular trade or type of cargo.
Employers' Organisations
The Shipping Federation and the Employers' Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organisations concerned with labour relations and the regulation
of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are responsible for the adminis¬
tration of the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, under which shipowners
engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons and above engage them through the
Merchant Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to offer
two-year Company Service contracts. The Shipping Federation is also responsible
for the day-to-day operation of the National Sea Training Schools set up for the
purpose of training ratings for the deck and catering departments and as firemen.
Seafarers' Organisations
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association, navi¬
gating officers, engineer officers, apprentices, cadets, pursers and ships’ surgeons by
the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers' Association’, and radio officers by the Radio
Officers' Union. Some uncertificated engineer officers are represented by the Amalga¬
mated Engineering Union. The interests of the deck, engine-room and catering ratings
are represented by the National Union of Seamen.
The National Maritime Board
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representatives
of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of wages and
conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except by special arrangement,
National Maritime Board agreements do not apply to vessels of under 200 gross tons,
or to certain other ships, including tugs and salvage vessels. Detailed working of the
board is carried on by a number of ‘panels’ representing the various interests of those
forming the seafarers’ part of the board.
Conferences
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other and
with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a series of
‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates, and to maintain
frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle of a conference is the
establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or passenger fares from each port of
departure. Each conference meets from time to time to review and revise existing rates,
or to compile new ones. Some of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or
have joined together to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing
with trade to and from the United Kingdom.
The Baltic Exchange
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of London’s
seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world s largest market for the chartering of
262 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’ representatives meet here to
arrange the chartering of ships, or space in ships, for the carriage of all kinds of goods
to and from all parts of the world.
RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
The Ministry of Transport is the Government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping Act of
1894 and subsequent legislation, it administers many regulations for marine safety and
welfare, for instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that ensures that a ship
is not overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship construction;
ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment;
and dealing with the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of
seamen. Most of the work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the
officers of the Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is also a
Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen in whose office at Cardiff a complete
record of all British ships and seamen is kept. The Ministry is represented on the
Merchant Navy Welfare Board and on the Merchant Navy Training Board (see
P- 363). The Ministry fosters the development and use of modern navigational aids.
The Ministry of Transport is responsible for transporting by sea the men and
materials of the armed forces and looks after ships that it owns or has chartered. It is
concerned with general shipping policy and the strategic implications of the Merchant
Navy; and it is also the sponsoring department for the shipbuilding, ship repairing
and marine engineering industries.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those provisions
dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the United Kingdom,
are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of the Commonwealth and
Colonial Governments. . .
In August 1962 the Minister of Transport announced the setting up of a Shipping
Advisory Board, under his own chairmanship, to advise him on commercial and
economic matters likely to affect the well-being of the shipping industry.
The United Kingdom is a party to the 1954 International Convention for the
Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. The nations
which have ratified this convention agree to prohibit their national fleets from dis¬
charging oil within 50 miles of any coast and also in extensive areas of the Atlantic
Ocean and the North Sea. Amendments to the Convention were agreed at an inter¬
national conference held in London in 1962, but it will be some time before the changes
can become effective. British ships registered in the United Kingdom were already
prohibited from discharging oil within a wide zone of the sea around the United
Kingdom under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955, which is administered by the
Ministry of Transport. The discharge of oil from any source into United Kingdom
territorial waters and harbours was first prohibited in 1922.
Lighthouses, Pilotage and Rescue
The Ministry of Transport administers the Coastguard Service. This is primarily
a life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around the coast for
vessels in distress and renders assistance either by rocket life-saving apparatus or by
informing other authorities who may be able to give help. There is close liaison
between the Coastguard Service and the Royal National Life-boat Institution. The latter
maintains lifeboats around the coast of the United Kingdom; it is supported entirely
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 363
by voluntary subscriptions, and depends largely for its operation on voluntary workers.
From its foundation in 1824 to the end of 1961, the Royal National Life-boat Institution
rescued 83,451 people. Lifeboats were launched 960 times in 1961, and rescued 416
^ The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first Royal
Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board of ten Elder Brethren,
elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Lighthouses in Scotland and
Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the Commissioners of Northern Lig t-
houses and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.
Trinity House is also the chief pilotage authority in the United Kingdom, licensing
some 650 pilots in 41 districts in England and Wales, including London. In some cases
the harbour authority or local council is the pilotage authority. The Ministry of
Transport also has certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses and pilotage.
THE MERCHANT NAVY
The number of masters, officers and men serving in December 1961 in British ships
on articles of agreement opened or closed in the United Kingdom was nearly 147,000.
Masters and deck and engineer officers numbered about 43,500 and deck and engine-
room ratings about 47,500. There were 43,000 catering personnel, nearly 6,000
apprentices and cadets and 3>5°0 radi° officers.
Qualifications
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies at sea
of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their examinations for certificates
of competency as second mate.
The Ministry of Transport holds examinations for, and issues certificates ol com¬
petency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of foreign-going
ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class engineer and second-
class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board ships in these grades unless
they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate. # ,
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio telegraphy
issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open examination.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom registered
ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted by the Ministry
of Transport, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate a seaman must,
among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on deck, have obtained a
certificate of proficiency as lifeboatman and have passed a qualifying examination. .
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for a second
mate’s certificate.
Conditions of Employment and Welfare
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both officers and
ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, introduced by
the board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty formerly associated
with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take two-year contracts, not only with
individual shipping companies but with the industry as a whole, and get special

benefits, in addition to the normal unemployment insurance benefit, when they are
ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and seamen’s
unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Ministries of Transport,
Labour, and Pensions and National Insurance, and the Colonial Office, has been
responsible since 1948 for the control and co-ordination of the welfare services for
merchant seamen in the United Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
PORTS
There are over 300 ports in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that 125 million
tons of imports passed through the ports in 1961, and 31 million tons of exports and
re-exports, including 7 million tons of coal.
The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of dock estate,
including 36 miles of deep water quays, is the largest port in the Commonwealth,
and with New York and Rotterdam is one of the three largest ports in the world.
Goods of every kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to perfume, pass through
the docks; in the year 1961, 59 million tons of cargo were handled. Imports are dis¬
tributed all over the United Kingdom, though the port supplies, primarily, Greater
London and the home counties. The Thames Navigation Service, operating from
Gravesend, provides navigational surveillance and information, by means of radar
and radiotelephone and other methods, for vessels between the estuary and London
Bridge.
Liverpool is the second largest port and the major export cargo outlet of the United
Kingdom. The port handles one-fifth of Britain’s grain imports, and has one of the
largest grain-handling plants in Europe. There are tobacco warehouses with a capacity
of 70,000 casks, and for wool imports, a warehouse with a capacity of 30,000 bales. In
1961, 8-5 million tons of imports (excluding petroleum and cattle) passed through
the port. Full use of the new terminal at Tranmere caused imports of oil to rise from
under a million tons in i960 to 7 million tons in 1961, and crude oil is now the major
commodity entering the port of Liverpool.
Manchester is an inland port, access to which is by the Manchester Ship Canal.
Petroleum is both the main import and the main export. At Eastham is the largest oil
dock in the United Kingdom, covering 19 acres.
Southampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic, and the principal port for
imports of deciduous and citrus fruits. Southampton’s value as a port is enhanced by
its double tides and its easy access to London. A considerable volume of oil for the
refinery at Fawley (see p. 366) is handled.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial north-east of
England and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest ship repairing
centre in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of Yorkshire
and the Midlands, and is one of the largest white fish ports in the world.
Middlesbrough is one of the largest importing centres in Britain for iron-ore, and
exports mainly steel and engineering products.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales. As well
as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its immediate
neighbourhood.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Bristol and nearby Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the city of
Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade. About 7 million tons of cargo are
handled annually, including a quarter of Britain’s banana imports and one-fifth of its
tobacco imports. There are also extensive oil installations.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the industrial
area of central Scotland, and is the principal outlet for exports of Scotch whisky.
Leith is the port of the city of Edinburgh. The chief import is grain and the main
export coal from the Lothian coalfields.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main traffic across
the Irish Sea.
Developments
At the end of 1961 port improvement projects costing some ^48 million were in
progress. Among the most important were improvements to the port of Hull, costing
some £6 million and due for completion in 1963, and a new dry dock, quay and
tanker-cleaning installation at Greenock on the Firth of Clyde, expected to cost over
£4 million and to be completed in 1964. At Bristol a programme for providing addi¬
tional grain-handling and storage facilities is in hand, and a newT 30,000-ton granary,
with services, costing j£i‘4 million will be completed in 1963' Important developments
are in hand at London, Liverpool and other ports, including the Canada-Langton
dock improvement scheme at Liverpool, due for completion by the end of 1962 at a
total cost of about £18 million.
Ownership
Since 1948 about a third of the total port capacity has been in public ownership.
Prior to the Transport Act, 1962, the majority of these ports were managed by the
British Transport Docks Division; they are now to be managed by the British Trans¬
port Docks Board (see p. 3^9)* The ports of Cardiff, Hull, Swansea and Southampton
are among those to be controlled by the Docks Board. The conservancy authorities
at Southampton and Hull are the Southampton Harbour Board and the Humber
Conservancy Board respectively.
Certain ports and docks used largely for the cross-channel services of the railways
are administered by the British Railways Board: examples of these are Folkestone,
Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay (at Harwich).
In 1961 shipping arrivals and departures at British Transport docks, at which over
17,000 were employed at the end of that year, totalled over 104 million net tons, and
the total cargo handled was about 59 midi°n tons.
Other ports are controlled by public trusts on which are represented users of the
port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other bodies, such
as local authorities. Examples are London (controlled by the Port of London Authority),
Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board), Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commis¬
sioners), Glasgow (Clyde Navigation Trust) and the Tyne ports (Tyne Improvement
Commission). The Port of London Authority has 28 members, nominated by Govern¬
ment departments, local authorities, port users and the Corporation of Trinity House.
A few ports—Bristol is the most important example—are owned by the town or city
council and controlled entirely by a committee of the council. Finally, there are about
100 ports which are privately owned. Manchester is the only major port so owned—
by the Manchester Ship Canal Company—and here the Manchester City Council
exercises considerable control by appointing 11 of the company s 21 directors.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
366
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main, set down
in private Acts of Parliament. A model set of clauses dealing with many of the details
is set out in the Harbours, Docks and Piers Act, 1847.
Most ports, other than those owned by the British Transport Commission, are
represented on the Dock and Harbour Authorities' Association, formed in 1917 to
represent the common interests of port authorities in their relations with Government,
shipowners and traders.
Labour
There are about 140,000 people employed in the operation of ports in the United
Kingdom. Just under half of these are administrative, clerical and technical staff,
and pilots, lightermen and customs officials. Over half are the dock workers (popularly
called ‘dockers’) who do the physical handling of cargo.
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule, with
the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers available,
sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual labour until 1941,
when war-time schemes were introduced to control the port registers of employers
and workers. The war-time arrangements were superseded in 1947 by a permanent
scheme administered by the National Dock Labour Board, which consists of a chairman,
vice-chairman, and eight members appointed by the Minister of Labour, four to
represent employers and four to represent employees. Workers on the board’s registers
now receive a guaranteed minimum wage for attendance, even when there is no work
available. The National Joint Council for the Port Transport Industry agreed in 1959
to a pension scheme which came into operation in January 1961.
Tanker Terminals
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude oil are
berthed at special tanker terminals which are near the oil refineries and are owned and
operated by the oil companies. The maximum deadweight tonnage of tankers able to
use some of the most important terminals is: Finnart (West of Scotland) 100,000; Isle
of Grain (Thames estuary) 42,000; Coryton (London) 45,000; Purfleet (London)
32,000; Thames Haven (London) 60,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 65,000; Milford
Haven 100,000; and Fawley (Southampton) 65,000. Long pipelines connect Finnart
with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth, and Milford Haven with the
refinery at Llandarcy.
New terminals for crude oil are planned at Milford Haven and on the River Tees,
whilst the capacity of existing terminals on the Thames and at Southampton is also
being increased by dredging.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly by road
and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland waterways are
important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk cargoes.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is nationalised; namely, the
railways, London passenger transport, certain road haulage and road passenger services,
inland waterways and some of the vessels on them. Many local authorities and private
1 For an account of inland transport in Northern Ireland, see p. 381-
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 367
firms run road passenger services, while road haulage is largely, and coastal shipping
entirely, in the hands of private enterprise.
Table 23 gives comparative figures relating to the carrying activities of the nation¬
alised transport undertakings in Great Britain. At the end of 1961 the nationalised
section owned 25 per cent of the 91 >4^0 public road passenger vehicles and over 2 per
cent of the 1,394,900 road goods vehicles in use. British Railway and Road Services and
London Transport were responsible for 42 per cent of the 15,219 million passenger
journeys made in public passenger vehicles in 1961. In the spring of 1962 there were
6 million motor cars and i-8 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds licensed for
use on the roads.
In 1958 the Ministry of Transport made a sample survey of goods transport by
road. According to this survey, 76 per cent of the total tonnage carried in 1958
(estimated at 1,320 million tons) went by road, while in terms of ton-mileage1 the
proportion was 45 per cent. The railways accounted for 19 per cent of all tonnage
carried and 35 per cent of ton-mileage. The proportions for coastal shipping were
4 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, and for inland waterways 1 per cent of the
total tonnage. Although the volume of goods transported by the railways was reduced
considerably in 1958 by the fall in demand for coal and for iron and steel, the survey
affirmed that it was clear that, whatever unit of measurement was used, road transport
was now the major means of inland carriage of goods. Of the total ton-mileage carried
by road and rail in 1958, 56 per cent was by road. The corresponding figure for 1961
was estimated to be 60 per cent.
Between 1958 and 1961 the number of vehicle-miles travelled by motor cars on the
roads of Britain is estimated to have increased by 36 per cent, while in the case of
light vans and other goods vehicles the increases were 35 and 17 per cent respectively.
The growth of private and commercial motor traffic is causing congestion problems
of increasing severity, especially in large cities (see p. 378).
THE NATIONALISED TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS
The present role and structure of the nationalised transport undertakings are the
result of a series of legislative measures passed over the last 15 years.
Transport Legislation, 1947-56
On 1st January, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act of
1947, the British Transport Commission (BTC), came into being and assumed control
of Britain’s railways, all railway-owned steamships, docks, hotel and road transport
interests, most of the country’s canals (including all those owned by the railways) and
the whole of the London passenger transport system. In addition, the BTC was to
arrange for the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance road haulage
firms. Road passenger transport outside London was not taken over, but the BTC was
given powers to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating passenger services by road
and rail, including power to acquire road passenger undertakings for this purpose.
A considerable amount of road haulage, several waterways and many docks were left
outside the commission’s scope.
The Conservative Government which took office in 1951 announced a new policy
for the operation of public transport, including decentralisation of the railway
administration, greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice (particularly
1 Ton-mileage is calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance it was
transported.

in charging), the partial return of long-distance road haulage to private enterprise,
and the revocation of the commission’s power to make schemes for the co-ordination
of road and rail passenger services. The policy was put into effect by the Transport

Act of 1953, and the actual reorganisation of the BTC was completed by 1st January,
1955. A further Act, the Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act, i95^>
provided for the completion of the denationalisation of road haulage.
The British Transport Commission
The British Transport Commission (whose members were appointed by and
responsible to the Minister of Transport) was a policy-making and not a managing
body. Management functions were carried out by seven divisions, corresponding to
various activities, namely: British Railways, British Road Services, the Tilling Bus
Group, the Scottish Omnibus Group, British Transport Docks, British Waterways,
and British Transport Hotels and Catering Services.
The London Transport Executive was established by the Transport Act, 1947,
as an agent of the BTC to operate road passenger transport and the underground
railways in the London area.
Finance. The BTC was required to submit an annual report and statement of
accounts to the Minister, who laid it before Parliament. The Commission was under
obligation to cover its outgoings, taking one year with another, but during the period
of railway modernisation it was permitted to carry forward the deficits arising on
British Railways. Meanwhile, in order to meet financial needs during the critical years
of reconstruction, the Government, under the Transport (Railway Finances) Act, 1957,
and the Transport (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1959, was empowered to make repayable
advances to the Commission of up to £400 million to meet the annual revenue deficits
until 1962. Since the financial year 1960-61 these deficits have been met by the
Exchequer from revenue and are not repayable advances. The Commission s ordinary
borrowing powers (i.e. excluding those to meet deficits) have been limited to ^1,200
million.
Gross receipts from the Commission’s principal carrying activities in 1961 were:
passenger traffic, £319 million; freight traffic, £374 million; and miscellaneous,
£18 million. In addition, gross receipts from other principal activities amounted to
£58 million. Interest on British Transport Stock and other interest charges amounted
to £103 million. Fixed assets at the end of 1961 were valued at £2,097 million, of
which £1,798 million related to British Railways.
Reorganisation: the Transport Act of 1962
The Transport Act of 1962 is a continuation of the policy announced by the
Government in 1951 and results from a situation described largely in the i960 report
on British Railways from the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries. A main
feature of the situation by i960 was the large accumulated deficit of the BTC. By the
end of 1961 this had risen to £573 million; for British Railways alone, the accumulated
deficit since 1947 amounted to £650 million. The BTC was found to be impeded by
its cumbersome structure and those in charge found it difficult to reconcile the statutory
duty to provide services to the public with economically desirable policies; the BTC
was also hampered in operating commercially by numerous restrictions such as control
over charges and the common carrier obligation dating from the time when the
railways had a virtual monopoly of transport.
Statutory Boards. According to the Transport Act, 1962, the BTC will be dissolved
and each of its main activities will be managed by a separate board holding its own
assets and responsible for its own capital debt.1 Four boards for British Railways,
1 The transfer of the undertakings and property of the BTC to these new undertakings is to
take effect on a vesting date to be fixed by the Minister.
37°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London Transport, British Transport Docks and British Waterways will each be
incorporated under statute and will be responsible directly to the Minister of Transport,
who will appoint their members. Road passenger and haulage undertakings, such as
British Road Services, the Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibus Group, Road
Freight Shipping Services, Thomas Cook and Son and other holdings, will be operated
as companies incorporated under the Companies Act, with their own boards; they will
be grouped under a new Transport Holding Company, responsible to the Minister of
Transport, who will appoint its directors. The hotel property of the BTC will be
transferred to a subsidiary hotel company, the shares of which will be held by the
British Railways Board.
The cross-channel shipping services operated by British Railways and certain
ports and docks used for them will pass to the British Railways Board.
Duties and Rights of the Boards. Each board is required to conduct its business so
as to pay its way, taking one year with another, and to set up general reserves. The
Railways Board and the British Waterways Board may receive financial assistance
from the Exchequer for five years from vesting date. All the boards may borrow up to
specified limits from the Minister with the approval of the Treasury. The Act facilitates
operations on a commercial basis by conferring on the boards powers to sell or develop
their land and to construct and operate pipelines, and by freeing them from controlled
charges schemes. Except for railway passenger fares in the London Passenger
Transport area and road passenger fares in an area including London, the boards are
free to fix the rates charged for their services. The boards are also released from
common carrier obligations as regards carriage by rail or inland waterway.
Financial Changes. The Treasury will assume responsibility for outstanding British
Transport stock (amounting to about £1,450 million), so that interest on this debt
will be met in future out of taxation instead of the BTC’s receipts. The Treasury
will also assume responsibility for Exchequer advances for capital purposes, which
are expected to amount to £700 million by the end of 1962, and for £300 million lent
to the BTC since 1957 to meet revenue deficits. Altogether, the community as a
whole will assume responsibility for debt amounting to about £2,450 million. Of
this amount, £475 million representing accumulated revenue losses will be written
off, leaving about £1,975 million to be apportioned among the new undertakings as
debt due to the Exchequer. About £675 million of the Railways Board’s debt will not
be interest bearing.
Nationalised Transport Advisory Council. A Nationalised Transport Advisory
Council of up to twelve members is to be established to advise the Minister on
questions relating to the co-ordination, or any other aspect, of the nationalised trans¬
port undertakings.
Transport Tribunal. The Transport Tribunal, set up under the 1947 Act, had
jurisdiction over the charges schemes governing maximum charges which the British
Transport Commission could make in respect of all its activities save road services.
It could also hear appeals arising from applications for road haulage (goods vehicles)
licences. Under the 1962 Act, the tribunal is to sit in two divisions, one having juris¬
diction over London rail and road fares and the other continuing to hear appeals
relating to road carriers’ licences.
Transport Users’ Consultative Committees. The 1947 Act set up a structure of Area
Transport Users’ Consultative Committees, which enables transport users to put
forward criticisms and suggestions. There is also a Central Committee which can make
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
371
formal recommendations to the Minister; he may then issue a directive to the BTC
which must give effect to it. These committees are to continue under the 1962 Act,
with some changes in functions and membership. In addition to their former functions,
the Area Committees are to consider objections from users to proposals put forward
by the Railways Board or the London Board to discontinue uneconomic railway
passenger services. In such cases closures may not be carried out until the Minister has
considered a report from the Area Committee and given his consent.
Coastal Shipping. The main features of the existing safeguards for coastal shipping
are that a complaint may be made on behalf of coastal shipping to the Transport
Tribunal if charges made or proposed by the railways in competition with coastal
shipping place coastal carriers at an unfair advantage, or are inadequate in relation to
the cost of the service provided. The 1962 Act provides that complaints of this kind
can be made to the Minister.
RAILWAYS
Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and of the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when George
Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century of widespread
railway development. The great period of railway building was from 1840 to 1875,
with a short lull following the collapse of the speculative railway boom in 1846.
During the first world war, the railways came under centralised Government
direction through a Railway Executive Committee. This experience emphasised the
need for concentration and a reorganisation of the whole rail system. The Railways
Act of 1921 amalgamated 123 private companies into four large groups: the London,
Midland and Scottish; London and North Eastern; Great Western; and Southern.
In the 1920s and 1930s the railways suffered from the prolonged industrial depression
and the growing competition from road transport. The causes of road competition were
twofold: first, motor transport often offered cheaper and better facilities; secondly,
the statutory regulation of the railways’ charging system resulted in the loss of some
lucrative traffic and the forced retention of unprofitable traffic.
In 1938 the railways made proposals for relief from statutory regulation of charges,
but the outbreak of war in 1939 postponed action and the railways again became
controlled by the Government.
Organisation under Public Ownership
The Transport Act of 1947 brought the railways under public ownership as a
single enterprise, British Railways, grouped in six regional sub-divisions and operated
under the overall management of a Railway Executive established as the agent of the
BTC.
The 1953 Transport Act abolished the Railway Executive and provided for a
reorganisation of the administration. The operation of British Railways was placed
in the hands of six area boards (the areas corresponding with the former regions),
day-to-day management being left to the general managers of the areas. Important
matters affecting general policy were reserved to the BTC and were dealt with by the
British Railways Division and the Railways Sub-Commission.
Under the Transport Act, 1962, the BTC’s functions will pass to the British
Railways Board. Area boards will be replaced by regional railway boards to which the
British Railways Board will delegate responsibility for the management and operation
of their regional railway systems.
372
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Operations
Statistics relating to the operations and traffic revenue of British Railways are given
in Table 23. The number of passenger miles travelled increased between 1955 and i960;
but there was a slight fall in 1961, compared with i960. The urban and suburban
passenger commuting services for London and other large conurbations carry about
2| million passengers a day, mainly to and from their work in brief rush hour periods.
These services account for about half the annual total of 1,000 million passengers on
British Railways. The number of freight ton-miles carried decreased by 18 per cent
between 1955 and 1961. Traffic revenue increased, partly owing to increases in fares
and freight charges.
British Transport Hotels and Catering Services owned refreshment rooms at 339
stations and also 38 hotels. These contributed £20 million to gross receipts. At 85 of
the stations, tenants operated refreshment services.
Development
Capital Expenditure. Because of the economic difficulties of the early 1930s, the
strain of the war years, and the numerous post-war claims on national resources, for
many years it had not been possible for the railways to carry out any large modernisa¬
tion schemes or to maintain an adequate replacement programme. The Government
and the BTC decided that this should be remedied and, in 1955, the BTC produced
a modernisation plan which was designed to transform virtually all the services offered
by the railways. Since then the plan has been modified in the light of prevailing
conditions but in the last five years some £770 million has been spent on the modernisa¬
tion of the railways, and capital expenditure will continue to be substantial.
Progress in Modernisation. In 1955 there were on main lines about 18,000 steam,
450 main line diesel and 71 electric locomotives. At the end of 1961 the corresponding
figures were about 11,500 steam, 1,285 diesel and 158 electric locomotives. In addition,
there were 4,000 diesel and 6,890 electric passenger-carrying multiple units. The
phase of railway modernisation represented by the diesel multiple unit has now been
completed. The total fleet of diesel shunting locomotives at the end of 1961 was nearly
1,900, which almost completed the BTC’s requirements in this field.
Passenger services have continued to improve as steam is replaced by electric or
diesel traction. The replacement of out-of-date passenger coaches by new stock, with
improved amenities, continues and diesel electric de luxe trains are in operation on
routes from London to Manchester, to Birmingham, to Wolverhampton, and elsewhere.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new and modern type freight
vehicles come into service and as facilities become available for concentrating freight
traffic at fewer and better equipped and better sited marshalling yards and terminals.
For example, a new marshalling yard is being constructed at Sheffield at a cost of
over £6-5 million. This yard will be capable of sorting wagons quickly for the 130
different destinations for which traffic passing through the area requires to be
marshalled. The construction of major freight facilities at a number of other places
is well under way; for example, that at Kingmoor (Carlisle) costing about ^5 million,
and at Stourton, in Yorkshire, costing over £4 million. Many others, such as the
hump marshalling yard at Port Talbot (Margam) which is the most modern in Europe
and cost about £2-8 million, have been completed and are now in use.
The installation of modern colour-light signalling, coupled with the installation of
either electro-mechanical or power operated signal boxes and the rapid extension of
the automatic warning system, is enabling faster and more frequent trains to be run
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
373
with a greater degree of safety. A scheme, costing some ^1-5 million, for the complete
modernisation of signalling over 25 miles of the main line between London and
Reading is in hand. When completed, the entire line from London to Reading—which
carries 200 passenger, parcel and freight trains in each direction daily—will be con¬
trolled by multiple-aspect colour-light signalling. One of the principal features of the
new installation will be a new signal box at Slough, from which the movements of
trains within an area of about 16 miles will be controlled.
Electric and Diesel Traction. One of the most important suburban electrification
schemes carried out is that of the Glasgow suburban train services north of the Clyde.
The extension of the Southern Region’s electrification of the line to the Kent coast
at a cost of over £20 million has been completed. Good progress is also being made
on the electrification of the London Midland Region’s lines from Euston via Crewe to
Liverpool, including the lines serving the industrial complexes around Birmingham,
Northampton and Stoke-on-Trent, at a cost of about ^175 million. This includes
the cost of rolling-stock and works such as overhead equipment, signalling improve¬
ments and station modernisation.
On other main lines, and in specific areas, steam traction is being eliminated by
diesel traction as quickly as economic and other factors allow.
ROADS
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to set up a
central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established by the Develop¬
ment and Road Improvement Funds Act of 1909. In 1919 the board’s responsibilities
were taken over by the newly established Ministry of Transport.
In April 1961 Great Britain had 195,220 miles of public highway. There were
130 miles of motorway, 8,340 miles of trunk roads, 19,750 miles of Class I roads,
17,620 miles of Class II roads, 48,930 miles of Class III roads and 100,450 miles
of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to their traffic value, those of
purely local traffic importance remaining unclassified. On maps and signposts the
trunk and Class I roads can usually be identified by the latter ‘A’ in front of a route
number, and Class II roads by the letter ‘B’. Trunk roads are the main arteries of
national traffic and the whole cost of their upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The
Minister of Transport is the highway authority for trunk roads in England and Wales
and on these roads he administers expenditure, which is provided wholly from central
Government sources, although for many purposes he employs local authorities as his
agents. The highway authority for Class I, Class II and Class III roads is, in general,
the council of the county or county borough in whose area the road lies. The Minister
makes grants towards approved expenditure on construction and improvement of
these roads at the rate of 75, 60 or 50 per cent according to the class of road. (Classified
roads include nearly all the main streets of the large cities.) The Secretary of State for
Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland. Unclassified roads
are entirely the responsibility of the local authority in whose area they lie.
Development
While it was impossible in the years immediately following the second world war
to spend much more on the roads than was required for their essential maintenance, a
large road-building programme has now been in progress for several years. Central
Government expenditure on new construction and major improvements has recently
been rising steadily: for the whole of Great Britain in the year 1959-60 it was

^64 million and in the year 1962-63 it is expected be £102-5 million. The current
programme includes Britain’s first motorways, constructed for the use of limited classes
of traffic under the powers granted to the ministers by the Special Roads Act, 1949
(now consolidated in the Highways Act, 1959). A five-year programme for the
improvement of classified roads was started in the spring of 1961; the estimated cost
is £150 million and the chief aim is the relief of urban congestion.
The motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national net¬
work of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this programme
will eliminate the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and thus give free outlets from the
big cities and from other main sources of traffic to the trunk routes, while smaller
road-works will be undertaken to the maximum possible extent all over the country.
Motorways. It is planned that 1,000 miles of motorways should be completed by
the 1970s. At the end of July 1962 there were 176 miles of motorway in use and
120 under construction; tenders had been invited or schemes prepared for another
300 miles. A further 400 miles were being surveyed for inclusion in the second half
of the 1960s. The motorways in Great Britain open to traffic or under construction
were:
M 1—London to Yorkshire. The projected length of this motorway is about
190 miles, of which 73 were open to traffic in July 1962.
M 2—Medway motorway, London to Dover. The 25 miles of this motorway are
under construction and are expected to be in use in 1963.
M 4—London to South Wales. The projected length of this road, which will
link London with Cardiff and Swansea and will include a new £11 million
bridge over the Severn, is 134 miles. By July 1962 a 6-mile bypass at Maidenhead
had been completed and a further 24! miles were under construction.
M 5—Birmingham to Bristol. Of this 102-mile motorway, the first 28 miles
running south from Birmingham were opened in July 1962. The 2o|-mile Ross
Spur (M 50), opened in i960, will link the M 5 with the existing road system
leading from Ross-on-Wye (Herefordshire) to South Wales.
M 6—Birmingham to Penrith. The projected length of this road, which will run
from Dunston (north of Birmingham) to Penrith (Cumberland) is 153 miles.
The completed length of 20 miles includes the 8^-mile Preston bypass, the first
section of motorway, opened in 1958. A 78^-mile section between Birmingham
and Preston is under construction. A system of motorway links will connect this
road at its southern end with the M 1 and M 5.
In Scotland, the construction of 22 miles of motorway will have been authorised
by mid-1964, provided the necessary funds are available.
Other Roads. Notable schemes for improving existing trunk roads include those for
the Great North Road (Ai) between London and Newcastle, estimated to cost £50
million: over 150 miles of dual carriageway are already open, several sections built to
motorway standards. Improvements are being made on the A40 route, linking London
with Gloucester and South Wales via Oxford. A 13^-mile bypass around High
Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, built to motorway standards, has been planned.
Eleven schemes to improve trunk roads, costing altogether £5'4 Hiillion, were started
in Great Britain in the last half of 1961.
In Scotland, it is expected that the improvement of some 42 miles of trunk road by
the introduction of dual carriageways will be authorised by mid-1964. The schemes

in question and the motorways are concentrated in central Scotland, where industrial
traffic is greatest.
Bridges and Tunnels. An important bridge at Queensferry over the River Dee, near
Chester, was opened in 1962: it will relieve the traffic congestion between North
Wales and Lancashire and Cheshire. Among bridges under construction are: the
Severn Bridge, which has the sixth largest main span in the world; the ^2-3 million
Medway Bridge, which is part of M 2 and is the largest pre-stressed concrete structure
of its kind in the world; and the new bridge across the Firth of Forth, which is
expected to be completed in 1963 at an estimated cost of £17 million.
Work started in i960 on the second Blackwall Tunnel (under the Thames), which
is expected to cost ^6-5 million and is due for completion in 1965. Work on the
£12-6 million Tyne Tunnel between Wallsend (Northumberland) and Jarrow
(Durham) was started during 1961. The first Whiteinch Tunnel (under the Clyde)
is due for completion in 1963. The £11 million Dartford-Purfleet tunnel (under the
Thames) will also be completed in 1963.
ROAD TRANSPORT
In 1961 there were 9-9 million motor vehicles licensed to use Great Britain’s roads.
Of these, 1-4 million were goods vehicles and 92,000 were public road passenger
vehicles (i.e. buses, trolleybuses, trams and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles, and
road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the railways. The
first step towards Government regulation of public road transport was the passing
of the London Traffic Act of 1924, which gave the Minister of Transport power to
control the number of buses and their journeys in London; this was followed, in 1933,
by the setting up of the London Passenger Transport Board (see p. 380). In 1928 a
Royal Commission was appointed to examine the problems that had arisen out of the
growth of motor traffic. The recommendations of this commission led to the introduc¬
tion of further legislation.
The Road Traffic Act, 1930, ended the licensing of public service (i.e. passenger)
vehicles by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas, of which there are now
eleven, covering the whole country and each under the control of three traffic com¬
missioners (except for the London metropolitan area, which has one) appointed by
the Minister. The commissioners regulate, by means of a licensing system, all public
road passenger transport services, and sanction routes and time-tables in order to
secure proper co-ordination of services and to eliminate unnecessary competition;
they also control fares. Competing operators and local authorities are entitled to raise
objections concerning applications to the commissioners for new licences or the
renewal of existing licences.
Organisation of Road Haulage
Licensing. The Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, based upon the recommendations
of the Royal Commission and of an experts’ report (the Salter Report) of 1932, estab¬
lished a system of licensing for road haulage vehicles, which is still in operation,
designed to restrict vehicle operations to approved needs and to eliminate wasteful
competition. A licence has to be secured from the licensing authority (the chairman of
the appropriate body of traffic commissioners) before a goods vehicle can be used on
the road. There are three types of licence: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage;
the ‘B’ licence for public haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and covering
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
377
also the carriage of the licensee’s own goods; and the C licence for the carriage by
traders solely of their own goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B licences are examined
by the licensing authorities to see if they are necessary in view of existing transport
services, and competitors may raise objections. There is a right of appeal to the
Transport Tribunal against the decision of the licensing authorities. The ‘C’ licence
is granted on application, as of right. All goods vehicle operators are bound by regu¬
lations concerning the fitness and loading of vehicles, the movement of large vehicles
likely to obstruct traffic, the keeping of records and the pay and hours of their
employees.
State-owned Services. Under the Transport Act, 1947, the BTC took over ‘A’ and‘B
hauliers predominantly engaged on long-distance haulage; vehicles operating under
‘C’ licences and those used for carrying certain specialised traffic were not affected.
After the change of Government in 1951, the Transport Act of 1953 required the
BTC to dispose of the bulk of its road haulage undertaking. In 1956 this process was
halted by the Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act, which enabled the
Commission to retain under its control more vehicles than were permitted under the
1953 Act. Altogether, the Commission disposed of 20,000 vehicles. Since September
1956 British Road Services (BRS), a division of the Commission, have been conducting
their business through the medium of five companies which together own about
16,000 vehicles: British Road Services Ltd. (general haulage); BRS (Pickfords) Ltd
(special traffic and some contracts); BRS (Contracts) Ltd.; BRS (Parcels) Ltd.; and
BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. The shares of all these companies are owned by the B1C;
those of BRS (Parcels) Ltd. and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. are still subject to disposal
at some later date. All the Commission’s vehicles are subject to the licensing system.
Under the 1962 Transport Act these companies will be operated as companies
incorporated under the Companies Act, with their own boards, and will be grouped
under a new holding company responsible to the Minister of Transport.
Size of the Industry. The number of licensed vehicles in the road goods transport
industry rose from i-2 million in 1955 to 1-4 million in i960. The percentages with
‘C’ licences were 78-3 in 1955 and 85-6 in i960. In 1961, 1,253,800 or 87-1 per cent of
the 1-4 million haulage vehicles were operated under ‘C’ licences. Of the other 185,200
vehicles, with ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences, about 12,800 are operated by British Road Services
and the rest are operated by some 61,000 hauliers. There are only a few operators with
lar-e fleets of vehicles in any of the licence categories. ‘C’ licence vehicles include a
large number of small vehicles used locally in the delivery of groceries and other
goods Other vehicles in this class are engaged in long-distance carriage of traders own
goods. A sample survey made by the Traders Road Transport Association in 1958
indicated that ‘C’ licence operators with fleets of over 100 vehicles were probaoly
fewer than 3 per cent of the total number of operators, but accounted for over half the
‘C’ licence vehicles in use in the country.
Public Passenger Transport by Road
With the exception of the London transport system which is operated by the
London Transport Executive, road passenger transport in Great Britain is run by
about 5,000 operators, 94 of them being local authorities owning and operating urban
bus services. About 4,000 are independent operators of coaches and of these, 3,600
have not more than 5 vehicles. Most of the remainder operate both bus and coach
services and belong to three main groups—Tilling, Scottish Omnibuses and BnUs
Electric Traction. The British Electric Traction Group is a private concern but
378 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
substantial shareholdings in many of its companies, without any controlling interest,
are held by the British Transport Commission, who own the Tilling and Scottish
Omnibus groups outright.
There are 49 concerns operating fleets of over 250 vehicles, 12 of which are local
authorities, the largest being the Birmingham Council, with 1,795 buses and coaches.
Glasgow, where the last tramcars in Britain made their final journey in September
1962, has 193 trolleybuses and 1,360 buses and coaches; Manchester has 1,35° buses
and 116 trolleybuses. During 1961 Birmingham transport carried 438 million
passengers, Glasgow, 478 million and Manchester, 382 million.
Road Safety Measures and Traffic Problems
Britain has the highest density of traffic in the world, giving rise to pressing problems
of road safety. In 1961, 6,908 people were killed on the roads and 342,859 injured.
This compares with 7,343 persons killed and 231,603 injured in 1934, when there were
only 2f million motor vehicles on the roads—an indication that the problems have, to
some extent, been held in check by road safety measures introduced under Acts of
1934, 1956, and i960. Among these are a speed limit of 30 miles an hour in built up
areas, modified later by the introduction of a 40 m.p.h. limit on certain main roads on
the outskirts of London and a 50 m.p.h. limit on certain roads during peak periods of
summer holiday traffic; the requirement that all new drivers must pass a driving test;
the provision of pedestrian crossings, including some illuminated by flashing beacons
and marked with conspicuous white stripes (zebra crossings); and a new system of
road markings, including double white lines at dangerous bends, to keep traffic to its
own side of the road and prohibit parking.
Private motor cars and motor cycles and goods vehicles up to 30 cwt. which are seven
years old or more (six years or more from November 1962) may not legally be used on
public roads without a valid certificate of road worthiness.
All drivers of motor vehicles—including motor cycles, motor scooters and powered
pedal cycles—have to pass a driving test before being granted a substantive licence to
drive1; until they pass the test they must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates
their displaying ‘L’ (Learner) plates and, in all cases where vehicles are constructed
to carry passengers, other than pillion passengers, learner drivers must be accompanied
by a qualified driver.
The Road Traffic Act, 1962, redefined the standard of unfitness to drive a motor
vehicle when the driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs and increased the
severity of penalties for dangerous driving.
In addition, vigorous road safety campaigns are conducted by local authorities
with the aid of Government grants. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents,
which acts as the Government’s agent in this connection, assists and co-ordinates
these campaigns. The police and education authorities are actively at work in the
cause of road safety. The standard of conduct for all road users pedestrians and
drivers—is set out in the Highway Code. A failure to observe the code does not of itself
render a person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any
such proceedings. There is a Pedestrians’ Association for Road Safety; a voluntary
society which promotes the reduction of road accidents.
Relief of Congestion. The Road Traffic and Roads Improvement Act, i960, permits
the employment of traffic wardens (with strictly limited powers), and provides for
fixed penalties (the ‘ticket’ system) for parking offences. Other measures in the Act,
1 For overseas visitors’ licences, see Appendix.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
379
designed to reduce traffic congestion, include the granting of greater powers of action
to the Minister of Transport within London and to local traffic authorities in other
areas. Several extensive schemes for the improvement of road safety and the relief of
traffic congestion are being undertaken: these include ‘fly-overs at road junctions;
new outlet roads from cities; and, as an experiment, the designation of certain stretches
of trunk roads as ‘clearways’, on which waiting on the carriageway is (with certain
exceptions) prohibited.
In London, street parking in certain areas is permitted only for limited periods and
on payment at parking meters, and increased off-street parking facilities are being
provided. In i960 a London Traffic Management Unit was established, charged
with securing the maximum use of London’s streets as traffic arteries oy applying
modern traffic engineering techniques. Measures taken to improve the flow of traffic
in the London area include the wider use of parking meters and the introduction of
a one-way traffic plan in central London and the institution of peak-hour clearways
on certain main roads.
INLAND WATERWAYS
In lydi James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from the
collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester. This marked
the beginning of canal building in modern Britain; and canals played an important part
in promoting the industrial and commercial expansion of the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. As railway competition developed, about one-third of the canal
mileage passed to the control of the railways. During the first world war Government
control of railways included railway-owned canals and, under the Transport Act,
1947, most of the country’s canals passed from Government control, which had been
re-established in the second world war, to that of the British Transport Commission
in January 1948. Since 1955 the canals have been managed separately by the waterways
division of the Commission, known as British Waterways.
Under the Transport Act, 1962, control of British Waterways is to be vested in a
British Waterways Board.
The System
There are some 2,600 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain, some
2,141 miles of which belong to the BTC; the remainder is still in the hands of local
authorities or private companies. About 1,000 miles of the Commissions canals are
narrow waterways which can generally be used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in
width, capable of carrying a load varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder are broad
waterways and canalised rivers which can be used by craft of up to 400 tons capacity.
The canals in Scotland are all broad waterways.
Of the 2,141 miles of inland waterways under the control of the BTC, 298 miles are
closed to navigation or abandoned, leaving 1,843 mtles still open, of which 1,192 miles
are in commercial use. For administrative purposes the canals in England and Wales
are grouped into four divisions, based on the main navigable river estuaries, each
group under a divisional manager. In Scotland, the Caledonian Canal and the Crman
Canal each have a separate manager, and the Forth and Clyde, Monkland and Union
Canals are grouped together under another manager.
In 1961 total traffic on British Waterways amounted to 9-3 million tons, of which
3*9 million tons were coal, 2*2 million tons liquids in bulk and 3-2 million tons general
cargo. The total traffic is stated in net ton-miles in Fable 23* Some three-quarters of
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
38°
the total traffic is carried on 325 miles of the broad waterways, which are mainly
canalised rivers.
Although British Waterways is the largest single operator, most of the traffic is
handled by independent carriers, or by traders in their own craft. The BTC at the end
of 1961 owned 15 tugs and 1,043 carrying craft, with a carrying capacity of 42,709 tons,
including 158 power-driven craft with a carrying capacity of 8,484 tons.
Development
Since assuming control, the BTC has strengthened the commercial organisation; it
has improved dredging methods and equipment, brought better types of craft into
service, established a research organisation and undertaken various development works.
Following the report, issued in 1955, by a specially appointed Board of Survey, a
comprehensive development plan was begun in 1956- Under this plan, nearly j£6 million
is being invested in the improvement of navigation and the provision of modern
equipment on the seven major waterways that carry most of the traffic—the Aire and
Calder Navigation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, the Trent Navigation,
the river Lee, the river Severn, including the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, the
river Weaver, and the Grand Union Canal (on the stretch below Berkhamsted). By the
spring of 1962 at least 75 per cent of the planned improvements had been carried out,
and ^500,000 was to be spent on the scheme during 1962. When it is completed in 1963
the British Waterways Board will control about 300 miles of first-class waterways
linking important industrial districts with ports.
In 1959 the Government set up an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Committee
to consider and advise upon schemes for the development of some 70° miles of canals
which could no longer be maintained economically for the purpose of transport.
The total revenue of British Waterways in 1961 amounted to ^4-7 million, of which
only j£o-9 million arose from carrying activities. The sale of water is an important source
of revenue and has trebled since 1948. British Waterways encourages pleasure boating
and receipts from this source are rising but as yet constitute only just over 1 per cent
of total revenue. British Waterways does not usually own fishing rights and income
from this source is very small.
LONDON TRANSPORT
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities. The
area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from Charing Cross,
contains over 8| million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829 when the
first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared on the London streets. The first regular tram
service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863 the first underground steam railway,
the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great trench for the line and roofing it over.
In 1870 the world’s first tube railway, the Tower Subway, was constructed under the
river Thames; it was cable-operated and ran for only a few months. In 1890 the first
electric tube railway in the world was opened, the City and South London line, and
this was followed in 1900 by the opening of the Central London Railway and shortly
afterwards by the electrification of the steam-operated underground lines. Meanwhile,
horse-drawn buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses and electric trams.
Until 1933 there wrere many separate undertakings providing passenger transport
facilities in London, but in that year these were all vested in a single public corporation,
the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with the establishment of the British
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS S^1
Transport Commission, the London Transport Executive took over control as an
agency of the Commission.
Under the Transport Act, 1962, as in the case of the other BTC undertakings,
the London Transport Executive is to be replaced by a financially independent board;
it will be known as the London Transport Board.
The London Transport System
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger transport
services in the London area with the exception of the London lines of British Railways
and the taxicabs. (Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets are privately
operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the metropolitan
police.) London Transport’s operations extend beyond Greater London to cover an
area of 2,000 square miles (known as the London Passenger Transport Area) with a
radius of about 25 miles from Charing Cross and with a population of some 10 million.
Between 1955 and 1961 the number of passenger journeys made annually on the London
Transport system fell from 4,079 million to 3T97 million, largely owing to increased
private motoring and changes in leisure-time habits and also some shifting of popu¬
lation away from the centre of London.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south and
32 miles from east to west. The total length of the railway over which London Transport
trains operate is 244 miles, of which 90 miles are underground, including the longest
tube tunnel in the world, 17I miles long. London Transport trains serve 274 stations.
London Transport’s buses and coaches travel over more than 3>100 mil68 °f roads.
To carry traffic over all this area, in December 1961 London Transport owned 4T72
railway cars, 8,145 buses and coaches and 221 trolleybuses. The total staff employed
was 76,000.
By mid-1962 all tramcars and trolleybuses had been replaced by diesel buses. The
underground railways have been extended, and a new million station linking two
lines at Netting Hill Gate was opened in March 1959. Since the beginning of 1958 the
London Transport Executive has placed orders worth £30 million for new rolling
stock, to be completed in 1963 at the latest, and has undertaken £7 million worth of
further track improvement schemes. These were part of a general modernisation
scheme for the Underground, on which nearly £40 million, including replacement of
rolling stock, was to be spent in the four years to 1963. Approval for a new tube railway,
estimated to cost at least -£56 million, between Victoria Station and Walthamstow, in
north-east London, was given by the Government in August 1962. New methods of
tunnelling have been tested and proved in readiness for the construction of this tube.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
Passenger transport in Belfast is provided by the Belfast Corporation and private
hauliers are engaged in freight transport in the cities of Belfast and Londonderry.
All other public road passenger and freight services and all rail services in Northern
Ireland are provided by the Ulster Transport Authority, a public body which was
established under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1948.
The road passenger section of the authority’s undertaking operates a wide network
of omnibus services and an extensive programme of coach tours. The road freight
section provides a comprehensive service for the carriage of merchandise of all
descriptions (including heavy indivisible loads and livestock) and can supply vehicles
under contract for the exclusive use of traders. A chain of first-class hotels is also
owned and operated by the authority.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
382
In the year ended 30th September, 1961, nearly 97 million passengers, over 2-3
million tons of merchandise and over one million head of livestock were carried by
road and rail services run by the Ulster Transport Authority. There were 297 miles of
permanent way, 82 locomotives and 158 diesel rail cars and trailers. The route mileage
of regular omnibus services was 2,766 miles and there were 1,033 omnibuses and
coaches and 2,066 goods motor vehicles. The gross revenue of the Ulster Transport
Authority was £9,818,000.
Roads
On 31st March, 1961, there were 13,770 miles of public roads in Northern Ireland,
comprising 373 miles of trunk roads, 955 miles of Class I roads, 1,733 miles of Class II
roads, 2,864 miles of Class III roads and 7,845 miles of unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Commerce is directly responsible for the trunk road system and
bears the entire cost of maintenance and reconstruction work on these roads. In
addition to major reconstruction schemes on trunk roads, a total of about 70 miles of
motorway are planned; the first section, 7 miles long, running southwards from Belfast
to Lisburn, was opened in July 1962.
The Ministry of Commerce also administers the Road Fund (the proceeds of motor
vehicle taxation, driving licence fees, etc.) from which grants are paid to the local
authorities (county, county borough, borough and urban district councils) who are
responsible for the other roads. The rates of grant range from 90 per cent for major
improvement works on Class I roads to 25 per cent for maintenance work on unclassified
roads.
Gross expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March, 1961, was £8-6
million and it is expected to increase in the next few years as major improvement
schemes are undertaken on both trunk and local roads. Expenditure in the five-year
period 1961-66 is expected to be about £56 million, compared with about £30 million
in the five years to 1961.
CIVIL AVIATION
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the Coronation of
King George V in 19n) and among the first to operate regular mail and passenger
services, which were inaugurated on 25th August, 1919, when a daily passenger service
was opened between London (Hounslow) and Paris (Le Bourget). The year I9t9 was
also marked by notable pioneer flights, including the crossing of the Atlantic by John
Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June (both were later knighted for their achieve¬
ment) and the first flight between England and Australia by Captain (later Sir) Ross
Smith and his crew.
Commercial Organisation
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited, which received a Government grant of £1 million spread over the next ten
years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was represented on the board
of directors.
Imperial Airways Limited pioneered the commercial development of inter¬
continental air routes (including the organisation of ground services), following up,
in many cases, the exploratory work of the Royal Air Force. By 1929 there was a
through service from England to India. In 1931 the first service was established to
Central Africa. The first mail service to Australia started in December 1934, followed
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
383
by a passenger service in 1935. During a part of 1939 Imperial Airways operated an
experimental transatlantic service for mail.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation, was established
by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, and took over the undertakings of Imperial
Airways Limited and British Airways Limited in 1940. During the second world war
BO AC operated essential overseas air services in support of the war effort. By the end
of the war, it was carrying more than twice as many passengers as in 1939 and more
than three times as much freight. The routes, moreover, had efficient radio and radar
systems which had been installed for war purposes and which were adapted for civilian
use- . .
After the war British European Airways was established under the Civil Aviation
Act, 1946, as a separate public corporation to cover the United Kingdom and Europe.
In addition to the two large corporations, there were in 1962 about 32 independent air
transport companies.
The Role of the Government
Responsibility for the general development and expansion of United Kingdom civil
aviation is vested in the Ministry of Aviation. The Ministry supervises the development
and production of civil aircraft and undertakes an extensive programme of research
and development to meet civil as well as Service needs. It is also responsible for air
safety and in this capacity is advised by the Air Registration Board and the Air Safety
Board (see p. 389).
Scheduled Services: Government Policy
Up to 1949 Government policy was that independent operators should undertake
charter work and the corporations should operate scheduled services. Starting in i949>
independent operators were permitted to operate certain scheduled services as
‘associates’ of the corporations. From 1952 the independent companies became
eligible to develop new routes and new types of scheduled services. The Air Transport
Advisory Council (ATAC), set up by the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, advised the Minister
whether permission for these services could be given without materially diverting
traffic from existing services. Under the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, i960, an Air
Transport Licensing Board was set up in place of the AT AC, and from 30th March,
1961, the independent operators became entitled to apply for permission to operate
scheduled services on an equal basis with the corporations.
The Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB)
The ATLB consists of six to ten members appointed by the Minister of Aviation.
The Board is responsible for granting licences to both the corporations and the
independent operators for the operation of air services. In granting licences the Board
takes into account an operator’s experience, financial resources, equipment, organisation
and staffing arrangements, and the adequacy of existing services. There is provision
for appeals to the Minister from decisions of the Board. During the first year the Board
received about 2,000 applications for licences for air services of various kinds, including
charters and holiday tours.
The Corporations: Powers and Constitutions
The existing powers and constitutions of BO AC and BE A are laid down by the
Air Corporations Acts, 1949 to i960 (though the Corporations’ monopoly of scheduled
services was repealed by the i960 Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, as noted above).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
384
Each corporation consists of a chairman, deputy-chairman and from 5 to 11 members,
all of whom are appointed by the Minister of Aviation. In the case of BOAC, the
Minister may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy-chairmen.
Finance. Each corporation may, with Treasury consent, borrow either by raising
temporary loans or by issuing stock carrying a Treasury guarantee. In addition, the
Finance Act, 1956, permitted the corporations to raise money by means of interest-
bearing redeemable loans from the Exchequer, and these powTers have been renewed
each year under the annual Finance Act. This procedure of Exchequer advances has
accordingly replaced stock issues as the means of providing permanent capital. Under
the Air Corporations Act, i960, the borrowing powers of BOAC and BE A were
raised to £180 million and £95 million respectively.
Ministerial Control. Although the Minister of Aviation has certain statutory powers
of direction over the corporations, including power to give general directions as to
the exercise of their functions on matters affecting the national interest, these
powers are very seldom used. The corporations function as commercial undertakings
with autonomy in matters of day-to-day management. However, as their activities may
have an impact on matters of national policy or international relations, and as the
Minister is responsible for answering for the corporations in Parliament, there is in
practice close co-operation, consultation and exchange of information between them
and the Ministry. It is also the practice of the corporations to seek the approval of the
Minister and the Treasury for orders of aircraft, which account for the bulk of their
capital expenditure, and for investments in foreign airlines, which commonly involve
foreign currency and may have political implications. Under the 1949 Act the
corporations are also required to render annual reports of their activities, and statements
of account, and the Minister lays these before Parliament.
Growth of Air Services
A selection of operating and financial statistics for the two corporations (including
their associates) and the independent companies is shown in Table 24. Total capacity
ton-miles offered on all services more than doubled between March 1956 and March
1961 and a further increase took place in the following twelve months. In 1961, 15 per
cent of the total passenger-miles flown in the commercial aircraft of 90 nations were
flown in British planes, which also carried 14 per cent of the total freight and mail
ton-miles. In i960, 6-6 million passengers entered or left the United Kingdom by
air, compared with 7*1 million who arrived or departed by sea; in 1961 the corre¬
sponding figures were 7 million by air and 7-1 million by sea. The recent performances
and developments of the corporations and companies are summarised below.
British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC)
BOAC operates scheduled services to all parts of the world: to Europe, the Middle
East, the Far East, Australia, Africa, North America, the Caribbean and South
America. It also operates a complete round the world service. Partnership with
Commonwealth airlines has been a feature of British civil aviation since 1934, when
Qantas and Imperial Airways first co-operated on the Australian route, and BOAC
now operates a number of services in close association with other airlines. In addition,
BOAC has a financial interest in airlines operating in the southern Red Sea area, the
Caribbean and the Arabian Gulf, and is associated either financially or through
advisory or other agreements with local airlines providing services in less developed
areas adjacent to BOAC’s main routes.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
386
In June 1962 BOAC and the Cunard Steamship Company jointly formed a new
company, to be called BOAC-Cunard Limited, with an initial share capital of £30
million, of which BOAC contributed 70 per cent and the Cunard Company 30 per
cent. Services in a large part of the Western Hemisphere for which BOAC and
Cunard Eagle held route licences will be operated on behalf of the new company.
These include services between Britain and the United States eastern seaboard
and mid-west, Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Caribbean, together with the extension
of these services to parts of northern and western South America.
Operations. Table 24 shows that the capacity offered on its own scheduled services
by BOAC rose between March 1956 and March 1962 by 313 per cent to 765 million
capacity ton-miles. At the beginning of the period traffic was carried entirely in
piston-engined aircraft, but in the year ending in March 1962 nearly three-quarters
was carried in pure jet aircraft. Over a third was carried in Boeing joys, which were
brought into service in i960. Over the six-year period, passenger-miles sold on
scheduled services rose by 266 per cent. During that period the load factor fell from
61 to 46 per cent. This was due mainly to the introduction of larger aircraft over the
whole period.
BOAC was the third largest international freight carrier in the world in 1960-61,
and in respect of total load carried on international routes was second only to Pan
American World Airways.
Financial Results. Owing to heavy investment in new aircraft in recent years and
the losses of its associated companies, BOAC’s annual accounts have shown deficits
since 1957-58, despite the increasing revenue from its operations shown in Table 24.
In 1961-62 interest on capital borrowed amounted to ^6 million and the deficit of the
associated and subsidiary companies amounted to £4-3 million. Adding the operating
deficit of £10-5 million, the combined result is a deficit of ^20-8 million.
Some ^65 million of BOAC’s gross revenue was earned in foreign currencies,
which, after payment of local expenditure overseas, produced a net contribution to
earnings of foreign currency amounting to £28 million.
British European Airways (BEA)
BEA operates a network of services serving 83 places in the United Kingdom,
Europe, North Africa and the Persian Gulf. Its services in the United Kingdom
include a number which cannot be operated on a commercial basis, but which meet a
vital social need; these include services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
BEA maintains a close working relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft, by agreement,
use a number of European stopping points. BEA also co-operates with other airlines
in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. It has a financial interest in a number of
subsidiary and associated companies, the majority of which are aircraft operators and
collaborate with BEA in providing a network of services.
Operations. The capacity ton-miles offered and load ton-miles sold by BEA more
than doubled between March 1956 and March 1962 (see Table 24). The increases
were almost equally divided between international and domestic services. Load
factors, which had increased up to 1961, dropped to 60 per cent in 1961-62; but this
was above the European average. Reasons for the previous increased load factor
appear to have been reductions in fares, especially during winter months, the increasing
use of air transport on international routes by passengers from outside London, and
increased services and traffic on domestic routes. The proportionate increase in
freight ton-miles sold on domestic routes by BEA (from o*8 to 2*9 million) was
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
387
outstandingly high. On international routes this type of traffic doubled. In March
1956 BEA’s fleet consisted of 28 Viscounts with propeller-turbine engines in service,
three on hire, and 73 piston-engined aircraft. By March 1962 the number of Viscounts
in service had increased to 62. In addition, there were 20 propeller-turbine engined
Vanguards, 2 Heralds and 13 Comet 4BS with jet engines and only 5 piston-engined
aircraft in service. At the end of 1961 BEA introduced a new type of freighter
capable of carrying 11 tons of freight, the Argosy, with a propeller-turbine engine.
Three of these aircraft are now in service on European routes.
Financial Results. From 1954-55 to 1960-61 BEA earned a net profit after meeting
interest charges. In 1961-62 the Corporation showed a net loss of ^1,488,065, before
bringing in reserves, because of the serious drop in load factor in 1961-62.
The Independent Airline Companies
In 1962 there were about 32 independent airline companies, many of them members
of the British Independent Air Transport Association. Table 24 shows that the charter
and contract services of these companies are extensive. Until 1961 the development
of scheduled services by independent firms was controlled in the interest of the
corporations (see p. 383) and scheduled services operated by these companies have
been mainly in the operation of secondary routes and the provision of special types
of services, such as vehicle ferry services from the United Kingdom to Europe, and
all-freight services to Europe and Africa. They also operate inclusive holiday tour
services. Since 1961, however, the independent companies and the corporations have
been able to apply to the Air Transport Licensing Board for licences for the develop¬
ment of their networks of scheduled as well as other services (see p. 383).
Charter Services. Among the charter services provided by the independent com¬
panies, air-trooping is of great but proportionately declining importance. In 1955-56
military flights comprised 80 per cent, and in 1960-61, 70 per cent, of the passenger
miles sold by these companies. Several firms specialise in other aerial activities, such
as aerial survey and pest control.
Much charter business is arranged through the air section of the Baltic Exchange,
the London market for shipping space (see p. 361). The Airbrokers’ Association,
formed in 1949, operates in London a world market for chartering aircraft to carry
cargo and passengers.
United Kingdom Trade by Air
The proportion of United Kingdom foreign trade carried by aircraft is steadily
increasing. In 1956, 1-7 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of exports (by value)
were carried by air. During 1961 these percentages were 4-6 per cent and 6-i per cent
respectively, and the total value of exports, imports and re-exports by air was £460
million. The chief export items were expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and
vehicle parts, and electrical and electronic products; furs and skins accounted for
about a third of the total value of re-exports by air.
Private Flying
At the end of 1961 there were on the United Kingdom register some 470 active
aircraft in the business and private-owner category, 335 used for instruction in light
aviation, and 200 others, making a total of 1,005 privately owned aircraft. Private
pilot licences were held by 6,300 people.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
388
Aerodromes
The Minister of Aviation is authorised to establish and maintain civil aerodromes,
and so may local authorities, subject to his approval; there are also privately owned
aerodromes. All aerodromes not operated by the Government which are used for
commercial operations are subject to the Minister’s licensing, inspection and regulation.
There are approximately 120 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and, in
addition, about 54 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil
control include 21 directly controlled by the Ministry, 3 in the Channel Islands and
1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island governments, and 30 aerodromes
licensed for public use, of which 21 are owned by municipalities. Customs facilities
are provided at 9 of the Ministry’s aerodromes and at 19 others.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in 1962 were.
for European services: London, Manchester (Ringway), Renfrew, and
Birmingham (Elmdon);
for North Atlantic services: London, Manchester (Ringway), and Prestwick;
for Middle East, African and Far East services: London.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aerodromes continue to increase.
In 1961 all United Kingdom civil aerodromes handled 12-8 million passengers.
Of this total, London (Heathrow) Airport dealt with 6-2 million, and London (Gatwick),
813,000. Outside the London area, Manchester (Ringw^ay) handled 945,000; Glasgow
(Renfrew), 761,000; Belfast (Nutt’s Corner), 515,000; and Southend 488,000. The
three airports in the Channel Islands together handled 11 million passengers. The
number of movements of aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations in
1961 was 447,000 for all United Kingdom aerodromes.
Development. London (Heathrow) Airport, already the largest and busiest airport in
Western Europe, will be strained to capacity within the next few years owing both to
the increasing number of passengers and to the increased size of the new jet aircraft
that many international airlines are bringing into service. The recommendations of a
special committee, set up in 1957, to consider the future of London Airport have been
accepted by the Government as the framework of the airport s development. Domestic
and European short-haul services are handled at the passenger building in the central
terminal opened in 1955. An additional building for short-haul services is planned.
For long-distance passengers a ^3 million terminal was completed in 1962. Ihe
airport at Gatwick, 25 miles south of London, was opened in June 1958 as the second
airport for the London area and considerable further development of the airport will
be undertaken in the next few^ years. The two airports are becoming increasingly
interdependent. Built alongside the main London to Brighton railway, London
(Gatwick) Airport is the first airport in the world to contain road, rail and air transport
in one unit. A privately owned helicopter terminal (or heliport) was opened in
London, on the south bank of the Thames, in April 1959.
Prestwick in Scotland, the second international airport in the United Kingdom,
is being developed so that it can accommodate the new large jet aircraft. The runways
at Ringway Airport, Manchester, have been lengthened and a new terminal building
was due for completion in 1962.
Air Safety
The role of the Government in promoting air safety lies in research and supervision.
Government research is mainly in aircraft design, navigational aids and air traffic
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
389
control. Every aspect of civil aircraft operation is supervised by the Government,
which shares its responsibility for safety with manufacturers and designers of aircraft
engines and equipment, airline operators, flight crews, ground staffs, air traffic
controllers and others.
In major issues of safety policy the Government is advised by the Air Safety Board,
which was established in 1946 and is a standing body of experts; it may make
recommendations to the Minister or give advice on matters referred to it by him.
Aircraft Research. Research on aircraft design and construction is done at the Royal
Aircraft Establishments at Farnborough and Bedford, which belong to the Ministry
of Aviation and are exceptionally well equipped with testing facilities.
The Air Registration Board. All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must have
a valid certificate of airworthiness issued (or rendered valid) by the Ministry of
Aviation on the recommendation of the Air Registration Board. This Board was set up
in 1937 and consists of 18 members, four of whom are independent, the others being
representatives of constructors, operators and insurers of aircraft. No aircraft built in
Britain is granted a certificate of airworthiness unless it has been constructed in
accordance with British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a code compiled and
frequently reviewed by the Board. Continued airworthiness is ensured by regular
inspection and maintenance performed according to a schedule which has to be
approved by the Board.
Firms engaged in the design and construction of aircraft must be approved by the
Board, and the Board is associated from the start with all new developments in aviation,
such as automatic landing.
Flight Crew Qualifications. Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate
licence granted or rendered valid by the Minister. The requirement that pilots of public
transport aircraft must hold licences issued by the Ministry of Aviation is to be
extended to all pilots flying for remuneration. Operators are required to ensure that
pilots employed by them have adequate knowledge of routes, and Ministry inspectors
check the standards maintained by the operators, which must be adequate for purposes
of the Air Operator’s Certificate (see below).
Training. In order to replace the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines from
the Royal Air Force, which has declined in recent years, the College of Air Training
was set up at Hamble in i960. It is sponsored and partly financed by the Government
and the two Airways Corporations. As this college can supply only about half the
pilots needed, the Government approves independent colleges, whose standards are
adequate for the training of professional pilots. Besides the College of Air Training at
Hamble, so far only Airwork Services Training, Perth, has been approved.
Air Operators' Certificates. Every operator of aircraft above a certain size used for
public transport must, as required by the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, i960, and the
Air Navigation Order, of March 1961, possess an Air Operator’s Certificate issued by
the Director of Aviation Safety (who is appointed by the Minister of Aviation) when
satisfied by inspectors that all safety precautions are constantly taken by the operator.
In addition, the Air Registration Board maintains continuous supervision of operators’
maintenance arrangements.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation Services
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for providing efficient navigation and traffic
control services for all civil aircraft flying over or near the United Kingdom. Meteoro¬
logical information is provided by the Air Ministry. The Ministry of Aviation’s Air
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
39°
Traffic Control Service is responsible for the safe, orderly and expeditious movement
of all air traffic using United Kingdom controlled airspace, airways, terminal areas
and control zones.
In 1959 the Government established the Air Traffic Control Board, consisting of an
independent chairman and representatives of the Ministry of Aviation, the Air Ministry
and the Admiralty. The Board is supported in its work of co-ordination and in the
formulation of air traffic control policy for the United Kingdom, by the Air Traffic
Control Executive and the Air Traffic Control Joint Staff. The Board is responsible
jointly to the Ministry of Aviation and the Secretary of State for Air.
Technical Provisions. In 1950 the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
introduced a system of airways covering the main traffic routes with controlled zones
around the major airports. During 1957 an<^ I95^ a rev^sec^ an<^ extended airways
system was brought into use. There are three main air traffic control centres, operated
jointly by the Ministry of Aviation’s Air Traffic Control Service and by the Royal Air
Force, at London (Heathrow) Airport for southern England, at Preston for the north of
England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the Atlantic Ocean to 30° W.
The Southern Air Traffic Control Centre, situated on the boundary of London
(Heathrow) Airport, is one of the most advanced control centres in the world.
In order to provide the means by which the air traffic control system can accept
the increasingly heavy load of air traffic, the Ministry has provided a variety of radar
installations and equipment. The United Kingdom was the first country to use radar
for the control of civil air traffic. The radar approach system known as Ground Con¬
trolled Approach (GCA) is now in use at all major airports in the United Kingdom,
in addition to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). The United Kingdom Air
Traffic Control Development Plan, designed to handle, expeditiously and with
increased safety, the rapidly growing volume and speed oi air traffic, includes the
extension of radar surveillance to cover all controlled airspace (airways, terminal areas
and control zones) and the progressive introduction of semi-automatic equipment in
the new air traffic control centres, in which civil and military staff will work
together. .
The Ministry has provided a number of radio navigational aids to help aircraft to
remain safely within the controlled airspace and to make accurate estimates of their
time of arrival. In addition, the Ministry supports the Decca Air and Marine Navigator
System now operating over a wide area of the United Kingdom and northern Europe
which can be used, by arrangement with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted
with the appropriate receiving equipment. Research is in progress into new landing
aids for use in bad weather. A unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, at Bedford, in
co-operation with industry, has successfully developed a fully automatic landing
system for the final stages of aircraft landing. The system is now coming into use with
the Royal Air Force and, when it has been further developed to meet the requirements
of civil operations, it offers the prospect of much greater safety in landing in both good
and bad weather. . .
Radio stations maintained by the Ministry provide air to ground communications
for the use of the Air Traffic Control Service. There is also a network of communications
between ground stations in the United Kingdom and between United Kingdom and
overseas ground stations.
Automation. For operational use at the new air traffic control centres a specification
of a comprehensive flight plan processing and printing system is being prepared,
following work at the Air Traffic Control Experimental Unit.

Two automatic systems will be used to study the application of computers to Air
Traffic Control. The first known as Apollo, has already been installed at the Oceanic
Centre, Prestwick, and is being used in a three-year programme of experimental work
connected with the North Atlantic Air Traffic Control. The second, more complex,
system is expected to be available in 1964.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office with its staff of some 366,000 is a Government department. It
is also the oldest of Britain’s State undertakings. In 1657, under the Protectorate
of Cromwell, an Act of Parliament was passed which declared that ‘there shall be
one general post-office and one officer, styled the Postmaster General of England
and Comptroller of the Post Office’.1
Organisation
The ministerial head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General who, with the
Assistant Postmaster General, is responsible to Parliament for his department. Six
of the main divisions of work at headquarters are carried down into the organisa¬
tion of three directorates—Scotland, Wales and Border Counties, and Northern
Ireland—each under the control of a director of the Post Office, and, in England,
seven regions, each under the control of a director; London has two directors, one
for postal services and one for telecommunications. In the United Kingdom there
are about 470 head post offices, nearly 25,000 subordinate post offices, and 57 telephone
The Postmaster General normally presides over meetings of the Post Office Advisory
Council on which the principal users of the Post Office services are represented.
In addition, there are about 190 local Post Office Advisory Committees which are
formed on the initiative of, and are maintained by, local interests, and are not organs
of the Post Office.
The work of the Post Office falls into two main categories: (1) direct services—
mail services, telecommunications and remittance business; (2) agency services -
savings services, broadcasting services and other business undertaken on behalf of
Government departments.
Finance
Although a Government department, the Post Office is also an immense trading
concern. The Post Office Report and Accounts for 1961-62 showed that its income that
year was £495-3 million and its expenditure £481-7 million, leaving a surplus of
£13-6 million. The postal service earned a surplus of £i-o million and the telegraph
and telephone services earned a surplus of £12-6 million.
The Post Office Act, 1961, changed the status of the Post Office in order to give greater
recognition to its commercial character. While it remains a Government department,
its finances have been separated from the Exchequer and a sepaiate Post Office Fund
has been established which is managed by the Postmaster General, and into which all
Post Office receipts are paid and out of which all payments are made. Treasury control
over the Post Office is confined to investment and foreign exchange, and the pay and
conditions of Post Office staff, who are still civil servants. The Post Office is required,
while maintaining its standard of services, to ensure that its income is enough, taking

passed a similar Act in 1660.

one year with another, to pay its expenses. Parliament is still able to debate and ask
questions about Post Office policy and management and to control Post Office charges
and borrowing.
Mail Services
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from the time
when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern airmail transport.
There was a great expansion in the postal services in the eighteenth century with
the introduction of mail-coaches in 1784. In the first half of the nineteenth century
the Post Office was quick to take advantage of Britain’s early lead in engineering and
railway development, and the first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830 between
Liverpool and Manchester.
The inauguration of the penny post (the uniform charge for any inland distance
being prepaid by means of postage stamps, which originated in Britain) in 18401 was
followred by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal services. The registered post,
ensuring additional safety for valuable mail, was introduced in 1841. The money
order system, which had operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838, was supple¬
mented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed amounts. Letterboxes had been
instituted in London in 1855 to facilitate the increased postal traffic, and in 1883 the
parcel post was introduced. By the end of the nineteenth century a regular delivery of
letters was assured to every house in Britain. In the twenty-three years from 1938-39
to 1961-62, the parcel post increased from 185 million items a year to 233 million,
registered postal traffic from 62 million to 80 million and other postal correspondence
from 8,240 million to 10,600 million. Every day the Post Office handles about 30
million letters and parcels. Each year the Post Office deals with an ever-increasing volume
of Christmas mail; during the Christmas-New Year season 1961-62, more than 935
million letters and cards were posted.
Developments
Between 1919, when the Post Office inaugurated its own motor transport fleet, and
1962 the number of motor vehicles used in carrying mail or for engineering purposes
rose from 48 to 40,000. For quick transmission of mails within the central area of
London, the Post Office has for over 30 years operated an automatically controlled
underground railway that runs for miles, connecting Paddington in the west with
Whitechapel in the east, and serving six intermediate stations.
The Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, London, has developed an electronic
letter-sorting machine (ELSIE). These machines are being used at busy centres,
and at Norwich, where postal codes are being used experimentally in addresses on mail,
all the sorting of small letters is mechanised. An experiment with a fully automatic
sorting machine is being carried out at Luton. A parcel-sorting machine has been
developed and installed at Leeds; new parcel offices being erected in London and
Manchester are designed to accommodate similar units. Field experiments are being
carried out with machines for separating letters and packets, and for automatic ‘letter¬
facing’ (ALF), i.e. stacking letters with all the stamps in the same corner.
Airmail Services
Railways and motor vans as means of transport for mail are supplemented by
ships and aeroplanes. Each year about 4,000 tons of mail are carried by air within
the United Kingdom. Special night air services for mail are run between Great

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

Britain and Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. In the year ended March 1962
total overseas correspondence amounted to 476 million items, 59 Per cen^ which
travelled by air. First-class mail to all European countries is sent by air or by surface
transport, whichever offers earlier delivery, without payment of any air surcharge.
The Post Office dispatches over 40 tons of letter mail a week to European destinations
by this ‘all-up’ service, mainly in aircraft of British European Airways, whose network
of services enables many of the letters posted in London for Europe to be delivered
the following day. The air parcel service now operates to all countries in Europe except
Roumania, and about 14 tons of parcel mail are dispatched weekly to Europe by air.
First-class mail and second-class mail are dispatched by air to countries outside
Europe upon payment of special airmail rates of postage. Light-weight air letters
costing 6d. each are popular, and air parcel services are also available to over 150
countries outside Europe.
Telegraphs
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of the
Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission of inland
telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the present automatic
switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now one of the most up-to-date
systems in the world and gives direct connection between any of the 500 larger telegraph
offices. The Post Office accepted 13-3 million inland telegrams in 1961-62.
Telex
The Telex Sendee combines the speed of the telephone and the authority of the
printed word. Calls may be made between the rapidly increasing number of telex users
in the United Kingdom (8,888 in May 1962) and also to some 200,000 subscribers
spread throughout the world. To send a message, the subscriber types it on the keyboard
of his teleprinter: it is then reproduced simultaneously on both the sending and
receiving subscribers’ installations.
The service is available day and night except for a few routes outside Europe.
Messages may be transmitted to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is unattended,
for attention when his office reopens. Use of the service is expanding rapidly and the
Post Office is planning for a system of 40,000 United Kingdom subscribers by 1980.
For call charging purposes the United Kingdom is divided into 50 charging areas,
each with its telex centre. All inland and most European telex calls are connected
automatically by dialling. They are charged in 2d. units, the amount of time bought
for 2d. ranging from 60 to 5 seconds according to the distance of the call.
Inland and overseas telegrams may be sent to the Post Office and to cable offices
by telex. No charge is made for these calls and the telegrams are charged for at normal
rates. Arrangements may also be made for incoming telegrams to be received by telex.
Telephones
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Company in
1912, it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in the country.
Local authorities wishing to operate their own telephone service were permitted to do
so under licence from the Postmaster General, but the only municipal system now in
existence is that provided by the Corporation of Hull. Local telephone service in
the Channel Islands is provided, also under licence, by their Governments’ telephone
departments. The Hull and Channel Islands local systems, although operated
independently of the Post Office system, are connected to the Post Office trunk network.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
At the end of March 1962 there were 6,010 local telephone exchanges in the United
Kingdom. There were some 8*62 million telephones, including 74,200 telephone call
offices for public use. Over 84-9 per cent of the telephones are connected to automatic
exchanges and it is planned that by 1970 all the exchanges will be automatically
operated. Telephones are being connected at the rate of about 445,000 a year. A
system of national telephone numbers is being introduced which makes it possible to
dial trunk calls. Trunk dialling by subscribers began in Bristol in December 1958;
the system will have been extended by March 1963 to approximately 500 exchanges,
serving one-third of all subscribers, and by 1970 to 90 per cent of all telephones. The
introduction of the new group routing and charging equipment (GRACE) brings the
advantages of quicker service, automatic accounting and cheap long distance calls of
short duration, and constitutes the most radical reform of the telephone service since
the Post Office assumed national responsibility for it.
The number of trunk calls made has trebled since 1939; in the year ended 31st
March, 1962, the Post Office handled a total of 475 million, of which nearly a quarter
were at the cheap night rate, available from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and during the whole of
Sundays. The number of local calls handled during the year ended 31st March, 1962,
was 4,500 million, an increase of 5 per cent over the previous year.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959 and at present restricted to
South Lancashire and parts of Cheshire, enables the users of vehicles fitted with
suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive them from, any telephone in the
United Kingdom network. Telephones transmitting messages through loudspeakers
instead of through instruments held by hand were made available to the public in 1961.
There are several specialised services available by telephone, including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service, enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly as possible,
and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade services; the automatic time
sendee; and a telephone weather forecast service available in 13 centres. In London
a telephone information service provides details in English, French, Spanish and
German of important events being held in and around the capital on the day of the
call and a similar service in English in Edinburgh and Glasgow exists during the
summer months. In Birmingham there is a daily cooking recipe service. A test match
cricket score service operates at 32 centres during the cricket season and a road weather
service is provided in collaboration with the Automobile Association at nine centres
from 1 st October to 30th April each year.
For some years research has been done on the development of electronic exchange
systems and the first electronic exchange in Europe to carry public telephone calls will
be opened by the Post Office in 1963.
Private Telecommunications Services
There are 79,728 private circuit stations not connected with the public exchange
networks. These circuits are rented for private use for telephone conversations, tele¬
printer connections, photo-telegraphy, television, music, or for the transmission of
signals which represent data for computers or operate other devices.
Overseas Telecommunications
All the overseas telephone services from the United Kingdom have for a great
many years been developed and operated by the Post Office. The overseas telegraph
services, on the other hand, were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable
and Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947. The
Post Office, which acquired the United Kingdom services, operates all overseas tele-
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
395
graph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign telegraph
companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd. continues to operate its cable and wireless services
in many colonial and foreign territories.
The overseas telegraph, telex and telephone services are operated from inter¬
national centres in London.
Telegraphs. Telegraph services to overseas countries are operated from Electra
House, Victoria Embankment, London. In the year ended 31st March, 1962, there
were 22-7 million inward, outward and transit telegrams.
Telex. The International Telex Exchange provides a teleprinter service to 68
countries abroad. In 1961—62, 4'2 million inward, outward and transit calls were
made. In mid-1961 facilities were introduced enabling telex customers to dial
directly to many European countries.
Telephones. Telephone service to Europe is through the Continental Exchange,
from which 1,022 direct telephone circuits give service to all countries except
Albania. These circuits are also used to send and receive pictures, and special
circuits are used for broadcast transmissions. In 1961-62, 3-4 million outgoing
calls were made. Automatic dialling by operators to subscribers in certain Euro¬
pean countries has been extended and will be further developed. Radio circuits
which provide service with most countries outside Europe and with many of the
larger liners at sea are controlled at the International Exchange.
Transoceanic Cables
In 1956 the first transatlantic telephone cable—also the first long-distance submarine
cable in the world—was inaugurated. Another transatlantic cable was laid by the Post
Office cable ship, H.M.T.S. Monarch, during 1961 between Scotland and Newfound¬
land. It was opened for service by the Queen in December of that year and provides
the first link in the projected Commonwealth telephone cable. The second link,
between Australia and New Zealand, started working in 1962 and the trans-Pacific
link between Canada and New Zealand, which will cost about £26 million, will be
laid by 1964. Extensions from Australia to New Guinea, Borneo, Hong Kong and
Singapore are planned for 1966 and further extensions are possible.
Before the first transatlantic cable was opened in 1956 the weekly averages of radio
calls between London and Canada and London and the United States were 53°
2,320 respectively. By March 1962 these figures had increased to 3>30° an<^ 8,700.
The two existing transatlantic cables provide 57 public telephone circuits from
Britain to the United States and 23 to Canada. Other European countries lease a
further 9 telephone circuits in the cables to obtain direct services with the United
States and Canada. The cables also carry a number of telegraph channels.
A telephone cable between Scotland and Iceland, via the Faroe Islands, was opened
early in 1962 and an extension of this, via Greenland to Newfoundland, is planned
to be opened at the end of 1962. There is also to be a new cable between Britain and
the United States which is expected to open in 1963 with capacity for 132 telephone
circuits.
Present day techniques limit the number of telephone calls which can be carried
by long-distance submarine cables to about 100. A cable which can carry 250 circuits
is now at the design stage.
Satellite Communications
Research on the use for long-distance communications of satellites, with a probable
capacity of 1,000 circuits, is being done in co-operation with the United States and in
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
396
consultation with Commonwealth countries. The Post Office has set up on Goonhilly
Downs in Cornwall, at a cost of £0-75 million, an experimental statellite communica¬
tions ground station to transmit telecommunications to, and receive signals from, the
United States through an artificial earth satellite, Telstar (see p. 2i7)« Later similar
transmissions will be made using a second satellite—Relay.
Ship-to-Shore Radio Communications
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post Office
has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations provide radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges of up to
some 500 and 300 miles respectively. There is also the long-distance radiotelegraph
station, Portishead-Radio, which communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with safety
of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or aircraft and take immediate
action to obtain assistance for any vessel in distress. During 1961-62 the stations
handled 807 urgent and SOS calls from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange radio-
telegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone subscribers
ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast navigational warnings and
weather bulletins.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical authorities on
the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard ship. During 1961-62
the stations dealt with 180 medical inquiries in this service.
The Post Office Counter: Agency and Direct Services
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension and his family allowance,
buy a licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew his car
licence and buy national insurance stamps and premium savings bonds. In these
and many similar transactions the Post Office acts as agent for other Government
departments or local authorities. Largely as a result of the extension of social legislation
and the widening scope of the social services, the volume of work at post office counters
has increased greatly compared with the total for 1938-39. In the twenty-three years to
1961—62, the value of transactions with the public increased from just over £1,000
million to £6,300 million. In 1961-62 the Post Office paid out £1,085 million in
benefits under the National Insurance Scheme, and sold £161 million worth of savings
stamps and National Savings Certificates and £52 million worth of premium savings
bonds.1
Counter sales include also an increasing volume of direct Post Office business:
during the year ended 31st March, 1962, about 660 million postal orders were issued
by post offices. The work of the Post Office Savings Bank is described on p. 411.
1 Post Office engineers were responsible for the development of ERN IE, the electronic random
number indicating equipment used for selecting winning premium savings bond numbers.

FINANCE
A detailed description of the financial system of the United Kingdom may be found
in the comprehensive report of the Committee on the Working of the Monetary System
(Cmnd. 827), published in August 1959. This committee was set up by the Govern¬
ment in April 1957, under the chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe; the inquiry was the
first of the kind since 1931.
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (i.e. the central Govern¬
ment and local authorities) finance their activities—how their expenditure is decided
upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into two
categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but also
in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in accordance
with the proposals of the Government, as approved by Parliament (principally
the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central Govern¬
ment departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts which
do not come from the Exchequer. The only important one is the National
Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions and National
Insurance and used for the payment of benefits under the National Insurance
Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes on
dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property and trading
receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer, and partly from
loans raised in the open market (see p. 76).
The following broad account of Government finance is concerned mainly with the
Exchequer and only incidentally with local government and other public funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the principle
that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was gradually evolved.
The principle was established, at the end of the constitutional struggles of the Stuart
period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that of the
United Kingdom, see pp. 407-8.
2 The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered cloth,
round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in the twelfth century.
397
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
398
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the King
was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free to spend it as he
chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House of Commons gradually
developed the modern system of controlling expenditure through the device of
Appropriation which was embodied in the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such financial
control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of Commons.
This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seventeenth century, but
as regards expenditure it was not effective until the nineteenth century. The con¬
trolling power of the House of Commons is acknowledged today in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of a new session of Parliament, which is addressed to
both Houses but contains a special paragraph addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to modify
financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus, to minimise the
chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of embodying the main financial
provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill. Since the passing of the Parliament
Act, 1911, however, the assent of the House of Lords is no longer needed for a Bill
certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill (see p. 38).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all expenditure
by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue by taxation or borrowing.
All Government revenue, other than sums received by Government departments in
the course of their normal activities (known as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into the
Government account with the Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account
or the Consolidated Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously
stated, being National Insurance benefits), all payments by the Government come
out of this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and revenue
are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money is spent and the
sources from which revenue is obtained.
ESTIMATES AND EXPENDITURE
Glassification of Expenditure
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Acts of Parliament other than
annual Appropriation Acts. This expenditure includes the loans made by the
Government (shown ‘below the line’1 in the Exchequer accounts) to nationalised
industries, local authorities and other public and private concerns for which
the Treasury has specific statutory authority to borrow. It also includes the
Consolidated Fund services, which are ‘above the line’ in the Exchequer
accounts. These services, which represent a permanent charge on the Con¬
solidated Fund, include the interest, sinking funds and cost of management of
the National Debt, the financial provision made for members of the royal
family, and salaries and pensions of judges and certain high officers whose
independence of the Government is thought to be better guaranteed by
permanent grant than by annual vote.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorised by annual Appro¬
priation Acts and which includes all expenditure on defence, on the social
1 See footnote on page 401.
FINANCE
399
services and on the general administration of the country. These are called
Supply Services because the House of Commons, when voting money is,
granting to the Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . . the
pecuniary necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that some of
this expenditure may also depend on legislation, such as the National Health
Service Acts, which relates to a specific object of expenditure.
Authorisation of Expenditure
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of Commons
in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House with the Chairman
of Ways and Means, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair). The committee usually
discusses public policy relevant to the Estimates, though any Estimate may be
examined in detail if members wish and if time allows (see also p. 41).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April are
submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding November and
December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’
which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in the
Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes. Within each
Vote, a ‘virement’, the spending of money on one subhead instead of on another,
is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
The Service departments may spend money on one Vote instead of another, but only
with Treasury sanction which, in turn, requires the retrospective authorisation of
Parliament. Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they
please subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An insufficient Estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or a virement
of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be brought to the
attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate. The Treasury exercises
the same power of scrutiny over this as over the ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Expenditure
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, and by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees of the House
of Commons.
The Treasury
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the responsibility
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the House
of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments, the Treasury
has to look at the proposals for expenditure in relation to prospective national resources
and to weigh the advantages of administrative proposals against the monetary and
economic cost, taking into account current Government policy; to decide the relative
merits of expenditure proposed by different departments; and to eliminate any over¬
lapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of depart¬
mental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, throughout
the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates of pay and the
aggregate size of the staff in all Government departments, in addition to exercising a
general supervision over all departmental expenditure. The Treasury also lays down
general rules of financial and accounting procedure for departments and prescribes
400
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the principles on which departmental contracts shall be made and the limits within
which losses may be written off.
The Comptroller and Auditor General
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is exercised
by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent appointment with
the status of an officer of the House of Commons. Since 1866 he has had two functions:
as Comptroller of the Exchequer he controls receipts and issues of public money to and
from the Exchequer Account; and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts
and submits his report on the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts, as required
by statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure that all expenditure is
properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made which go beyond any relevant
statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been obtained wherever necessary.
In addition, however, he has been encouraged by successive Committees of Public
Accounts (see the next paragraph) to examine departmental expenditure with a view
to drawing attention to any cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The Public Accounts Committee
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by the
Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee called the
Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, on the motion of
Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was properly incurred in
accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and with any relevant Acts of
Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee are to examine the accounts
and these terms have been widely interpreted by successive committees which have
investigated whether full value has been obtained for the sums spent by departments
and examined cases in which the administration appears to have been faulty or
negligent. The committee has therefore become a powerful instrument for the
exposure of waste and inefficiency. It embodies its findings in reports which may be
debated in the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the
Treasury in consultation with departments and put into effect, so far as they are
accepted, according to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is submitted by
the Treasury to the committee of the following session and where the recommenda¬
tions have been unacceptable to the Treasury the committee may either accept the
objections or return to the charge in subsequent reports.
The Estimates Committee
This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed annually
except during the war years. In i960 it was made a select committee set up each session
under standing orders. The committee’s functions are to examine the Estimates, to
report whether the policy implied in the Estimates can be carried out more economically,
to examine the principal variations between the Estimates of the current year and those
of the previous year and to suggest the form in which the Estimates should be presented.
Usually, the committee selects each year a few Votes, or aspects of Government-
voted services, for review.
Since 1945 the committee has functioned through the medium of four, later five,
sub-committees, which carry out extensive investigations into the departments under
consideration. In practice, the Estimates for the current year are not affected, but the
committee’s recommendations produce changes in future Estimates and strengthen
Treasury control. In i960 a further sub-committee was added to examine and
report briefly on the spring supplementary estimates. The committee’s functions have
FINANCE
401
been extended to examine the principal variations between the estimates presented
and those of the previous year, and additional parliamentary time has been allocated
for discussion of the reports of the committee and of the Public Accounts Committee.
THE BUDGET
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The use
of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor of the
Exchequer opened his Budget’, which was applied in Parliament to the annual speech
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals for balancing revenue and
expenditure.
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the financial
state of the nation, and its formal basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising
money by taxation. By the time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the Esti¬
mates of expenditure under various headings will have been presented to Parliament
and published, and the expected total of Government expenditure for the year will be
known. The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis of existing
taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as will provide whatever surplus or
deficit he considers desirable on economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied
in detail in a Finance Bill. The gap between the Budget Statement and the Royal
Assent to the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by the Provisional Collection
of Taxes Act, 1913, whereby changes in income tax and customs and excise duties1
have immediate statutory effect if adopted by Resolution of the House of Commons.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to certain payments of a capital
nature for which the Government has statutory power to borrow and which are there¬
fore excluded from the Budget expenditure met from revenue. These items and others
are set out in the part of the Budget which lies ‘below the line’.2 Since 1961 a White
Paper has been issued before the Budget giving details of below the line expenditure.
Budget Policy
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money for
Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated that
taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the level of expendi¬
ture on particular goods and services. At a later period it was realised that taxation
also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore the general level of economic
activity. Since the second world war, Budgets have been consciously designed in
greater or lesser degree to bring the total demand for goods and services into balance
with the supplies which could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the proportion of a high
income taken in tax being much greater than the proportion of a small one; at the
same time, the services provided by the Government (whether in cash or kind) are
generally available to all, irrespective of wealth, but in some cases they are specially
designed to benefit people with lower incomes. Indirect taxes, or taxes on expenditure
(see p. 403), do not affect the distribution of income; their main purpose has always
1 In 1957 the Act was extended to include purchase tax.
2 Items ‘below the line’ are: (1) receipts applicable by statute to debt interest which would
otherwise be paid out of revenue; (2) receipts applicable to debt redemption; and (3) payments
for which the Treasury has power to borrow.

been the raising of revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of
particular goods thay can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the pattern
of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the total demand
for goods and services, in the following way: if there is an increase in Government
expenditure without an increase in taxation then total demand for goods and services
will tend to rise; the same thing will happen if there is a decrease in taxation without
a decrease in Government spending. In this way the Budget can be used to counter
unemployment. On the other hand, if there is an increase in taxation without an increase
in Government expenditure or a decrease in Government expenditure without a
decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods and services will tend to fall.
In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation. Growing emphasis is being
placed on long-term programmes of public expenditure and on regular surveys over
a period of years taking into account prospective resources.
For some years after the war, budgetary policy was mainly designed to counter
inflation by holding down consumer demand for goods and services so that it would
not hamper exports, investment or the defence programme. Budgets were aimed
particularly at encouraging higher investment and production. The Supplementary
Budget of October 1955, and the succeeding Budget, had the object of curtailing
excessive internal demand and of strengthening the balance of payments. After some
reductions in taxation in 1957 and 1958, the aim of the Budget of April 1959, which
provided for further important reductions in taxation, was to give a further stimulus to
economic activity. The i960 Budget was designed to consolidate and fortify the
progress of the economy, and that of 1961 to counter inflation and encourage exports.
The 1962 Budget’s aim was to keep the economic position in balance.
Sources of Revenue
Money to meet ‘Ordinary’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the central
Government is in normal years derived from taxation. Taxes can be divided into
two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond roughly to the duties collected
by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Board of Customs and Excise. The
most important inland revenue duties—income tax (including surtax), profits tax
and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly on the income or property of those
who, in general, have to bear them. Income tax on individual (though not on corporate)
incomes and estate duty are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates
bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. Stamp duties, although not a direct tax, are
also collected by the Board of Inland Revenue. Taxes on motor vehicles are collected
by the principal local taxation authorities, which are the county or county borough
councils in England and Wales and the corresponding councils in Scotland; the
proceeds are paid by the local authorities to the Exchequer.
Income Tax, Surtax, and Profits Tax
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. The standard rate for the year 1962-63 is 7s. gd. in the £ (38-75 per
cent). The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances
and reliefs, by reduced rates of tax on the first sections of taxable income,1 and by the
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and reliefs
is taxable income. For 1962-63 the reduced rates are: is. Qd. in the £ on the first £60; 4s. 3d.
in the £ on the next £150; and 6s. 3d. in the £ on the following £150. The remainder is charged
at the standard rate.

surtax.1 In the case of a married couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated
and are treated as one income, but a higher personal allowance is given than for a
single person. Earned income bears less tax than other income as certain fractional
deductions (‘earned income relief’) are allowable.
A single person earning ^700 a year pays £101 in income tax, while a married couple
with the same earned income pays £67; if the couple have two children under the
age of 11, their tax falls to £15; when the children are between the ages of 11 and 16,
the tax is only £5; if the children are over 16 and receiving full-time education, no
tax is paid at all. The range of tax payable by a single person varies from, for example,
,£49 on an earned income of £500 a year to .£1,440 on an earned income of £5,000;
if the income is unearned, tax liability on £500 will be £84, and on £5,000 will be
£2,34°.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay-as-you-
earn’) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling them to keep up
to date on tax payments.
Companies are liable at the standard rate of tax on their total income irrespective
of its amount; they are also subject to profits tax, the rate of which was increased from
i2| per cent to 15 per cent from 1st April, 1961.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the United
Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including companies) resident
in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that interest on certain United
Kingdom Government securities belonging to persons not ordinarily resident in
the United Kingdom is exempt; income from certain classes of possessions abroad is
chargeable not on the amount of income arising but on the amount of income remitted
to the United Kingdom; and the trading income of specified overseas trade corporations2
is not charged so long as it remains undistributed. The United Kingdom has entered
into agreements with many countries providing for relief from double taxation; where
such agreements are not in force, the United Kingdom allows unilateral relief.3
Estate Duty
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or not)
which passes or is deemed to pass at death. Thus, it is not limited to property owned
by the deceased. It may, for example, extend to trust funds to the income of which
the deceased was entitled during his lifetime, and to gifts made by the deceased within
five years of his death (one year in the case of a gift for public or charitable purposes).
Estates with a net capital value of £4,000 or less are exempt from duty, but on estates
of a higher value there is a progressive duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
Indirect Taxes
Most indirect taxes, or taxes on expenditure, are customs and excise duties and are
levied on commodities or services. They are called indirect because the importer,
1 The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on personal incomes
exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal allowances in excess of the single
person’s basic allowance. In addition, the same earned income relief as for income tax and a
special earnings allowance (not exceeding £2,000) are deductible from earned income only.
Surtax is imposed at rates which increase progressively until (for 1962-63) on investment
income above £15,000 a year, income tax and surtax combined amount to 17s. gd. in the £.
2 Broadly speaking, these are companies, which, though managed and controlled in the
United Kingdom, carry on all their trading activities overseas.

manufacturer, wholesaler, or provider of commodities or services pays them first and
then adjusts his prices to his customers accordingly.
Customs duties are levied on imported goods, and excise duties on goods produced,
and services provided, at home. The purchase tax, which is also collected by the
Board of Customs and Excise, applies equally, and at the same rate, to home-produced
and to imported goods.
The system of customs duties is twofold in its purpose: it has the function of provid¬
ing a measure of protection for British industries or preference for products imported
from Commonwealth countries overseas and it has also the function, in association
with the excise system, of providing revenue.
The principal revenue duties collected by the Board of Customs and Excise are
those on tobacco, alcoholic drinks and hydrocarbon oil. There are a number of smaller
revenue duties, for instance, on betting, matches, television licences and television
advertisements. The protective customs duties cover a wider field, but their contribu¬
tion to the yield of indirect taxation is relatively small.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly ail of them consumer
goods, at four rates, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 25 per cent and 45 per cent of the
wholesale value. Articles subject to revenue duties of customs and excise are in general
exempt from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax include food (other than
confectionery, soft drinks and ice cream), fuel, books and newspapers, young children’s
clothing and footwear, certain non-proprietary drugs and medicines, some household
appliances and textiles. In the 1961 Finance Act, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was
given power, which lapses annually, to vary by order the rate of purchase tax and of
the main customs and excise duties on certain goods by up to 10 per cent in either
direction. This power is intended to be a regulator of the economy and was renewed
for the 1962-63 financial year.
THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS 1962-63
In the Budget of April 1962, total current expenditure for the financial year ending
31st March, 1963, was estimated to reach £6,364 million, while the estimate for total
current revenue (after allowing for taxation changes) was £6,797 million, making a
surplus of £433 million. ‘Below the line’ total payments were estimated at £1,096
million, while total receipts were estimated at £589 million. After taking into account
the surplus on current account there was an estimated deficit of £74 million to be met
by borrowing.
Table 25 shows the Budget estimates for 1962-63 in comparison with the out¬
turn (Exchequer receipts and issues) for the previous year and Table 26 gives a general
functional analysis of the estimates. They were presented to Parliament in this form
for the first time in 1962. The diagram on p. 404 illustrates the pattern of Government
estimates of revenue and expenditure on current account in 1962-63.
CAPITAL PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS
Capital expenditure dealt with in the part of the Budget statement which lies
‘below the line’ consists chiefly of loans to the nationalised industries. The remainder
consists of loans to other public bodies, such as the New Towns Development Corpora¬
tions, loans under the Export Guarantees Acts, and loans for overseas assistance.
If, on balance, there is a deficit, it is met from the proceeds of Government borrowing
or from the surplus, if any, in revenue and expenditure, i.e. ‘above the line’; while
if there were a surplus it would go to reduce the National Debt.

* A revenue surcharge of io per cent on most Customs and Excise duties became operative
on 26th July, 1961. It was estimated that this surcharge would produce an additional £13° million
in 1961-62.
Apart from the use of surpluses, repayments and extra-budgetary funds such as the
National Insurance Fund, Exchequer payments ‘below the line’ are financed by
direct borrowing from the public either through the National Savings Movement (see
p. 410) or by borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues
of Government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinancing
maturing issues (conversion issues) or to raise new money (issues for cash). Since
1956, capital requirements of the nationalised industries have been met by the
Exchequer, while most of those of the local authorities since 1955 have been met by
direct borrowing from the public by mortgages or stock issues; net Exchequer lending
(via the Local Loans Fund) to local authorities has steadily diminished since 1955
and in the last four years local authorities have, on balance, been repaying debt to
the central Government.
The National Debt
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million in

1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million
in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March, 1962, the total National
Debt was £28,669 million, of which £1,923 million was repayble in currencies other
than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the £26,746
million of internal debt, £5,591 million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of
91-day Treasury bills, while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds,
loans, and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from 2|~ to 6 per cent)
and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
PUBLIC FINANCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main features,
similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under which public
revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the Exchequer, from which no
money can be withdrawn except on the authority of Parliament. That authority is
expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund charges in permanent legislative form,
o
408
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and in the case of Supply Services by annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates
prepared by departments and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of taxation (customs duties and most excise duties, purchase
tax, income tax, surtax and profits tax) is imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament
over the whole country, and is paid, in the first instance, into the United Kingdom
Exchequer. From the amount attributable to Northern Ireland, known as ‘Reserved’
Revenue, there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom Treasury, under the
Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the sum contributed by Northern Ireland towards
Imperial Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the cost of the administration
of the Supreme Court, and other Reserved Services, and the cost of collecting Reserved
Revenue. The balance, termed the ‘Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes’ is paid over
to the Exchequer of Northern Ireland and joins with the proceeds of taxes levied and
collected by the Government of Northern Ireland, called ‘Transferred’ Taxes, and
with other non-tax receipts of a miscellaneous nature, to form the public income. The
items of Transferred Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties, pool betting duty,
bookmakers’ licence duties, television advertisement duty, television licence duty, most
excise licence duties and motor vehicle duties.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry of
Finance for Northern Ireland, constituted in accordance with the Government
of Ireland Act, 1920, determines the amount of Reserved Revenue and the cost of
Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland for each year, the amount of
the Imperial Contribution and such other questions affecting the financial relations
of the two Governments as may be referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1962-63 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £126-94 million and expenditure at £119-39 million. After
allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated at £7-5 million, there
was a small Budget surplus of £53,200.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £100-5 million on 31st March, 1962,
is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held by the Ministry of
Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have been
established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes.
In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal funds being
those relating to National Insurance and Government loans. The latter constitutes
a pool of capital money available for local and public authority borrowings; on
31st March, 1962, a sum of approximately £93 million was outstanding against such
authorities.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It comprises
a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main banking services;
the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main business is in other countries;
and various specialised banks and similar financial institutions.
The Bank of England
The Bank of England is the central bank and its principal business is to act as
banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the Government
for important financial operations and as the central note-issuing authority; it also
maintains relations with central banks overseas. It was established in 1694 by Act
FINANCE 409
of Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate body, and its entire capital stock was
acquired by the Government under the Bank of England Act, 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England is responsible for co-ordinating the appli¬
cation of the Government’s monetary policy. One of the main instruments for this
purpose is the Bank Rate—the minimum rate at which the Bank of England will
discount approved bills of exchange and a key factor in the general pattern of interest
rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main Government
accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and registration of
Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the administration of exchange
control which has been in force since 1939.
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England and these
balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves. In addition, under an agreement made
with the London clearing banks and Scottish banks in 1958, the Bank of England
may call on these banks for ‘special deposits’ which, not being freely disposable, do
not rank as part of their liquid assets. This scheme, designed to restrict the liquidity
of the banking system should the need arise, was first put into operation in i960,
when, on two separate occasions, each of the banks was called upon to deposit a sum
equivalent to 1 per cent (£ per cent for Scottish banks) of its total deposits. A further
call for 1 per cent per cent for Scottish banks) was made in July 1961; this was
released at the end of May 1962.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities, together with
a limited amount of coin, the part covered by securities and coin being the ‘Fiduciary
Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary control. In practice very little
gold is now held by the Issue Department of the Bank of England, the bulk of the
United Kingdom gold (and foreign exchange) reserves being in a separate Government
fund, known as the Exchange Equalisation Account; this account was originally
established in 1932 for the purpose of checking undue fluctuations in the exchange
value of sterling, and is operated by the Bank of England as agent for the Treasury.
The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility of a Government department,
the Royal Mint.
The Commercial Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the United
Kingdom are limited liability companies which, in the main, are subject to the ordinary
law relating to such companies.
Some of the main features of the United Kingdom commercial banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
United Kingdom members banking of the British Bankers’ Association
include 11 London clearing banks,1 5 banks in Scotland and 3 in Northern
Ireland, and control some 13,000 branches and had total deposits of over
£8,goo million at the end of 1961.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp duty
of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small payments
—are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques, drafts, bills and
bankers’ effects cleared in 1961 through the London and Provincial Clearing
1 Three of these banks are members of the London clearing house but have headquarters
outside London (at Liverpool and Manchester).
410
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Houses was £801 million; and many cheques do not, for various reasons,
pass through clearing houses. In addition, a growing volume of payments is
effected through the credit transfer scheme introduced in i960: the average
daily value of the credit clearing through the London Clearing House in 1961
was £17 million.
3. It is the practice of the London clearing banks to maintain a ratio of about
8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which just over one-half
are repayable on demand, the remainder being mainly deposits at interest
and subject to notice).
The banks make advances to customers partly in the form of overdrafts
and partly in the form of loans (with or without collateral security); in either
case, the advance is normally for a short term only, unless renewed.
The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits declined
from about 43 per cent in 1938 to about 17 per cent at the end of the war,
but gradually climbed back to settle down to a level of 26 to 30 per cent for a
number of years from 1951. After the withdrawal in 1958 of official requests
to the banks to restrict the level of their advances, the percentage again moved
up, and by July 1961, when the banks were again asked to restrain their
lending, was over 47 per cent. In May 1962 the ratio of advances to total
deposits was nearly 45 per cent, still above the 1938 level.1 The increase
since 1958 was accompanied by innovations in bank lending practice, including
the introduction of schemes for personal loans repayable by fixed monthly
instalments over periods up to two years, and facilities for limited service
accounts at low cost. Another development was the acquisition by many
banks of share capital in hire purchase finance companies.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited rights
to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by legislation for
each bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England notes and by coin.
United Kingdom Offices of Banks Operating Mainly Overseas
The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main business
is in other Commonwealth countries and foreign countries to maintain London
offices2; in some cases, indeed, the institutions concerned are United Kingdom
companies and the London office is the head office. These London offices form part
of the complex structure engaged in the financing of trade not only between the
United Kingdom and other countries but also in goods which are shipped direct
between other countries.
Savings Banks and the National Savings Movement
The function of Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank is to
provide readily available facilities for the investment of savings, particularly the
small savings of persons with low incomes. Both these types of banks were already
well established during the nineteenth century. The growth of their business was,
1 About 33 per cent of the banks’ deposits at this time were covered by cash and other highly
liquid securities, while 15 per cent were covered by British Government and other long-term
securities. It is an invariably accepted convention that at least 30 per cent of deposits should be
covered by cash and other liquid securities.
2 Twenty-nine overseas banks are members of the British Bankers’ Association.

however, encouraged in the first world war when the War Savings Committee was
set up under Government auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type
of long-term security for the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was
the National Savings Certificate, encashable at par at any time, with interest payable
only on encashment, but free of income tax. From this war-time drive originated the
present National Savings Movement, which encourages the widespread investment of
savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National
Savings securities. The policy of the movement is determined by the National Savings
Committee for England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and Northern
Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent persons representing regional
savings organisations and various national institutions connected with such matters as
finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a salaried staff of civil servants.
Voluntary local savings committees, often assisted or promoted by local authorities,
co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
There are now three National Savings securities: the National Savings Certificate,
the Defence Bond and the Premium Savings Bond. Defence Bonds were introduced
in 1939 and are repayable at par on notice; interest is payable half-yearly and is
taxable. Premium Savings Bonds, which were first issued in 1956, after an initial
period of three months and thereafter monthly, give investors a chance to win prizes
ranging from £25 to £5,000 instead of receiving interest. At the end of August 1962,
£366-5 million was invested in this form of savings.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and managers,
and two-thirds of the funds deposited with them are ordinary deposits which are with¬
drawable on demand or at short notice. These deposits are invested with the National
Debt Commissioners, and the Government is responsible to the trustees for the repay¬
ment of the money so invested, with accrued interest, as and when required. In certain
circumstances, Trustee Savings Banks also accept deposits of up to £3,000 for special
investment. These deposits, which may receive a slightly higher rate of interest
than ordinary deposits, are invested under the supervision of the National Debt
Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible to the trustees for the repay¬
ment of these investments. There are about 1,400 Trustee Offices controlled by
80 independent banks and depositors number over 8 million. Deposits at the end of
April 1962 totalled about £1,470 million, an increase of £94 million in twelve months.
The Post Office Savings Bank, which celebrated its centenary in 1961, is the largest
organisation of its kind in the world. It has over 22 million active accounts; in December
1961 total balances, which carry a Government guarantee, amounted to £1,737
million, nearly £80 per depositor. Through a centralised system of accounting, a
depositor can pay in money or make a withdrawal at any one of some 20,000 post
offices throughout the country.
A person may have deposits in only one Trustee Savings Bank and his holding in
the ordinary department is limited to £5,000. He may also hold up to £5,000 in the
Post Office Savings Bank. The maximum amount of National Savings Certificates
which may be held by any one person is £900 worth of the current (tenth) issue, in
addition to holdings of previous issues, and £800 worth of Premium Savings Bonds.
The limit on individual holdings of the current issue of Defence Bonds (5 per cent) is
£5,000; this is in addition to holdings of previous issues. By April 1962 national

and district groups, all of a voluntary nature.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
savings had reached a record total of over £7,503 million, and covered one-quarter of
the National Debt.
Co-operative Banks
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department about
the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in banking was legally
defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1876. The primary purpose
of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to serve the co-operative movement,
whose financial centre it has become, but the bank has also come to include among
its clients trade unions and other mutual societies, local authorities and individual
depositors. The bank’s headquarters are in Manchester. The Scottish Co-operative
Wholesale Society has similarly engaged in banking since 1948, with headquarters in
Glasgow.
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which are
supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly provided
through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, hire-purchase finance companies,
the Stock Exchange, Investment Trusts, Building Societies and the Insurance Market.
The firms engaged in such activities are in the main highly specialised, e.g. discount
houses, stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers. Another type of
financial institution, the merchant bank, has been of great importance in the finance
of trade and commodity dealings and in the flotation of major issues of bonds, particularly
for overseas concerns and governments.
The merchant banks helped to give London an international reputation as the
main world centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long-term loans for
development purposes floated on the London market earned for Britain a continuing
flow of interest and attracted a steady flow of orders for British goods and products.
Where short-term credit was required, much British trade and also a large proportion
of trade between foreign countries was usually financed by bills of exchange, which
were accepted as payable at maturity by the merchant banks (also known as accepting
houses) and were traded on the discount market, thus providing an easy method of
transferring debts and claims.
The Discount Market
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury bills and
other short-term securities. In recent years commercial bills have become a small
proportion of the discount market’s business, while dealings in short-term bonds and
Treasury bills have increased considerably. Tenders for Treasury bills are invited by
the Government each week and the firms which comprise the discount market acquire
the bulk of their Treasury bills in this way. They finance the purchase of the bills
and securities they hold, chiefly by loans from the banks; about half of these loans
come from the London clearing banks, and most of the remainder from other United
Kingdom and overseas banks. In the main these loans and deposits may be called in
at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the Discount
Market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held until they become
of a currency required by the banks.
FINANCE
4I3
The Bank of England acts as lender of last resort to the 12 members of the London
Discount Market. The clearing banks do not borrow money directly from the Bank of
England; if they need to add to their cash resources they call in part of their loans to
the Discount Market. If, as a result, any particular discount house is unable to cover
its needs for cash elsewhere, it is obliged to borrow from the Bank of England,
normally at bank rate.
Finance Corporations
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the Industrial
and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in 1945 assist in dealing
with the problems of post-war reconstruction and development. Although the Govern¬
ment displayed considerable interest in their formation, the corporations themselves
are ordinary limited companies with no official representation on their boards and
having no recourse to public funds. Another finance corporation, the Commonwealth
Development Finance Company Limited, was established in 1953 t0 assist develop¬
ment projects in the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note are
the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, and the Scottish Agricultural
Securities Corporation Limited.
Finance Corporation for Industry Limited
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of £200,000
and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major industries with a view
to promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase of
employment.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may borrow up to
four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of £125 million. The share
capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance companies, 30 per cent by trust
companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of England. At 3IS^ March, 1962, the capital
called and paid up was 2 per cent (£500,000); the Bank of England paid £5 million
in advance of call in 1958—59. The liability of the shareholders in respect of the
uncalled capital represents security to the banks providing loans for the corporation s
working capital.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
such as steel, oil, chemicals, shipping, diesel engines, and electrical components.
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited
The ICFC has a smaller issued capital than that of the FCI and has as its main
object the provision of credit and finance by means of loan capital and share capital
for industrial and commercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where
the existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange are
not readily or easily available.
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC is £15 million paid up in full
and a line of credit of £i3'5 million, both provided principally by the London clearing
banks and the Scottish banks in proportion to their size, with a token participation by
the Bank of England. In addition, a public debenture issue of £10 million was made
in July 1959 and a further issue of £6 million in April 1961. The current resources of
the ICFC, including reserves shown in the balance sheet, therefore total about
£49 million.
The corporation’s function is to provide finance in sums ranging between £5,000
and £200,000 for small and medium-sized concerns. It has over 650 customers and
has established branches in several large provincial cities.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company was set up in 1953 as a new
channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth development schemes.
Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which about 14! million ‘A’ ordinary
shares of £1 (2s. paid) are held by industrial, shipping, mining and banking interests
in the United Kingdom, and nf million ‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 (10s. paid) are
held by the Bank of England and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. At
the end of March 1962, its commitments amounted to the sterling equivalent of
approximately £22 million.
Agricultural Mortgage Corporations
The primary function of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd., established
in 1928, is to grant long-term loans against first mortgages on agricultural lands and
buildings in England and Wales. The share capital was subscribed by the Bank of
England and other banks, but the funds are mainly derived from public issues of
debentures, of which about £50 million was outstanding in March 1962.
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited was established in 1933
and fulfils broadly similar functions in Scotland. Its share capital is subscribed by
three Scottish banks.
The Stock Exchanges
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the London
Stock Exchange is by far the most important and is one of the world’s two foremost
free markets in securities.
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stocks or
shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer for his
securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new capital by
Government and commercial borrowers. Some 9,000 securities are quoted on the
London Stock Exchange; at the end of March 1962 these had a total market value of
.£50,224 million, of which over three-fifths represented equity capital.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains are
made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and demand for the
securities concerned. All the Stock Exchanges operate under strict rules of conduct
which they formulate themselves.
In recent years there has been a constantly rising demand for ordinary (equity)
shares, partly in expectation that such shares will maintain their real value or grow
in value in periods of rising prices. Insurance companies and pension funds now
invest a larger proportion of their assets in these shares than formerly, and the Trustee
Investments Act of 1961 permits trustees, under certain conditions, to invest up to
half the funds they hold in trust in equity shares.
The ownership of Stock Exchange securities in the United Kingdom is much more
widespread than formerly: it is estimated that there are about 3 million shareholders
and that their shareholdings are widely distributed. The largest public company in
Britain has over 300,000 shareholders and there are several others with over 25,000.
Investment Trusts and Unit Trusts
Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks and
obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company, registered
under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is to invest its capital
FINANCE
415
in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it may issue several types of
stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to build up reserves. Investment
trusts grew to importance in the latter half of the nineteenth century and have been
prominent in directing capital towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company and
a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the management company
buys a block of stock exchange securities spread over several companies in certain
sectors of the economy and re-sells them to the general public in the form of units
or sub-units. The price at which the sub-units are sold includes a service charge
which represents the remuneration of the managers of the trust. In deciding which
securities to buy, the managers of unit trusts are limited to a choice from among the
stocks listed in the Trust Deed. _
Although the first unit trust appeared in London in 1868, it was not until about
1931 that unit trusts became important. By 1939 there were 98 trusts, with total
assets estimated at £98 million. During the last few years unit trusts have grown
considerably, and there are some 750,000 unit holders. By the end of 1961 the value
of their assets was £237 million. Under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act,
1958, unit trusts are subject to the supervision of the Board of Trade.
The Insurance Market
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by Friendly Societies and
Trade Unions, most insurance services in the United Kingdom are in the hands of
either mutual or joint stock companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
Table 27 shows the distribution of business in terms of gross premium income m
i960, the latest year for which figures are available.

ducted by both friendly societies (called collecting societies) and companies, the former account¬
ing for a gross premium income of £41 million in i960 and the latter for a further £161 million.
Insurance Companies
There are over 300 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom but
most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most United Kingdom
insurers write several of the main classes of business although some specialise in one
class, particularly in life assurance where about 40 companies write only that type of
business. A few specialise in reinsurance.
416
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In addition over too overseas companies carry on business (and even more companies
are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the international nature of
the market. The natural centre of the market is in London, but some of the large
companies have their administrative headquarters elsewhere.
In i960 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies and collecting
societies amounted to £6,700 million; of this, £4,300 million was ordinary life funds,
£1,400 million was industrial life funds and £1,000 million general non-life funds.
With the growth of group pension schemes the rate of accumulation of life funds is
increasing greatly.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance funds and
these represent one of the most important sources of funds for investment in commerce
and industry. More than a third of the total assets of British insurance companies
are invested in equity shares and debentures, and this proportion is gradually increasing.
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. The name ‘Lloyd’s’
is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late seventeenth
century, where merchants with maritime and other interests gathered to transact
business. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Lloyd’s coffee house had become the
principal centre of underwriting business and of intelligence about shipping move¬
ments. Although in its earlier history the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the
conduct of marine insurance business, during the last sixty years there has also been
built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market for the transaction of other
classes of insurance business, except life assurance of which the amount transacted at
Lloyd’s is negligible. In addition to its insurance activities, Lloyd’s maintains a
world-wide organisation of the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
Lloyd s is now governed by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871;
the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered by the
Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact insurance business.
The interests of a holder of a Lloyd’s policy are safeguarded in the following ways:
(1) every Lloyd’s underwriter is liable for his underwriting debts to the full extent
of his means and is required to lodge security by way of a deposit with the Committee
of Lloyd s; (2) the whole of the premiums received by an underwriter must be placed
in a trust fund to be used exclusively for the payment of his underwriting liabilities
and expenses, and only ascertained profits can be released to the underwriter and then
only with the consent of the trustees; and (3) every underwriter must submit his
accounts to an annual audit.
The usual practice of underwriters today is to form themselves into groups known
as syndicates which generally specialise in particular branches of insurance. The
underwriters forming the syndicate appoint an agent who is empowered to accept
risks on their behalf and to control all matters concerned with the syndicate’s business.
If the insurance is for a relatively large amount, several syndicates may participate,
but each underwriter is individually liable only for the proportion of the risk accepted
on his behalf.
Underwriters may not accept business directly from the public, but must transact
through Lloyd’s brokers in London, who must be connected with Lloyd’s, either as
members or subscribers.
Insurance Brokers
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf of
the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable part
FINANCE
417
of the company market. Many brokers specialise in reinsurance business, acting as
intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between companies, both British and
overseas, and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
International Insurance Services
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business comes from
abroad, partly by direct placing in London and partly from branches and agencies
established in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business
is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for use
in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very substantial
assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of uncalled capital and the
whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and personal fortunes of Lloyd’s
underwriters.
Building Societies
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on the
security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner occupation, though loans
are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial premises and
farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly from the general public
who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of share capital is not fixed, shares,
which have a fixed value, are not dealt with on the Stock Exchange but may be with¬
drawn in cash if notice is given. The Building Societies Acts, 1874 to i960, prescribe
the general way in which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar
of Friendly Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the society s
business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid expansion of
building society activity in the twentieth century has been accompanied by a con¬
centration of most of the business in the hands of a few very large societies. At the end
of 1961, 706 societies were in operation, with total assets of £3>437 million. The
seven largest societies, however, account for more than half the total funds. The amount
advanced on mortgage in 1961 was ^54^ million, about ^13 million less than the
record i960 total.
Under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, the Minister of Housing and
Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland were empowered to make
advances to building societies which fulfilled certain requirements as regards assets
and liabilities, liquid funds, reserves and other matters. These advances are for
relending to prospective house purchasers in respect of houses built before 1st January,
1919, which do not exceed £2,500 in value; they were suspended in July 1961, having
been running at the rate of about £40 million a year.
14
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Britain was one of the first countries to remove legal and fiscal restrictions on the
internal movement of persons and goods, and the first to develop adequate facilities
for the movement of large quantities of goods by mechanical transport (canals, roads,
railways and steamships). With its resources of coal and iron, and its succession of
mechanical inventions, Britain was also the first country to industrialise on a large scale
and to produce a wide variety of consumer goods in large quantities. In addition,
Britain evolved, over a long period of years, the specialised financial services essential
for the smooth functioning of overseas trade.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for only 2 per cent of the world’s
population, the United Kingdom is the world’s second largest trading nation, conduc¬
ting nearly 10 per cent of international trade.
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in international
trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of manufactures entering
into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of world imports was somewhat
larger than that of world exports, as imports into Britain were paid for not only by
exports of goods but by interest on overseas investments and net receipts from shipping
and a variety of financial services. Even before 1914, however, this supremacy was
being increasingly challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United
States, and although Britain’s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937 Britain’s share in
world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to 22 per cent compared
with 24 per cent in 1929 and 30 per cent in 1914. In the years immediately following
the second world war, Britain’s share rose again and in 1950 was 25 per cent; but by
1961 it had fallen to 16 per cent.
For over a century international trade has been of vital importance to Britain’s
economy. Britain relies upon imports for half its total consumption of foodstuffs and
nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries. Its exports of goods and services
together absorb over a fifth of the gross national product. It is a major supplier of
machinery, road and railway vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, electrical apparatus,
chemicals and textiles. Britain is the world’s largest market for foodstuffs, and among
the largest for metals, cotton, wool, petroleum and many other products.
PATTERN OF TRADE
Changes since 1938 in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution
of imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Value and Volume
Imports, which amounted to million in 1938, passed the £2,000 million mark
in 1948. With rapidly rising raw material prices, they totalled £3,892 million in 1951,
418
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
4J9
but this level was not surpassed until 1957. The 1961 total of £4,398 million was
£143 million below the peak figure reached in i960. The rise in the value of exports
was from £471 million in 1938 to £2,174 million in 1950. There were marked ex¬
pansions between 1954 and 1956 of £493 million to £3,143 million, and again between
1958 and 1961 of £506 million to £3,682 million.
Calculations of changes in the volume of trade (i.e. changes after eliminating varia¬
tions due to price movements) compared with pre-war cannot be made with precision,
as the relative values of different types of goods on which the volume figures are based
have changed considerably since 1938. It has been estimated that in 1961 the volume
of imports was about one-third greater than the 1938 figure, while the volume of
exports was over twice that of 1938. Statistics showing the value and volume of
imports and exports in 1938 and in selected post-war years are set out in Table 28.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The increased importance of exports in the economy can be assessed broadly by
comparing their value with that of the gross national expenditure; the proportion has
risen from 10 per cent in 1938 to about 16 (in 1961) or 17 per cent. Over the same
period there was a much smaller change in the relationship of imports to gross national
expenditure; it was about 16 per cent in 1938, and nearly 18 per cent in 1961.
Commodity Composition
An analysis of the commodity composition of total imports and exports and the
composition of engineering exports and food imports in 1961 is given in the diagrams
below.
COMMODITY COMPOSITION OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN 1961
(Percentages of total values)
Miscellaneous.2 Food, drink and tobacco 6
Composition of Food, Drink and Tobacco Imports Composition of Engineering Products Exports
As domestic output of agriculture has expanded by some 80 per cent compared with
pre-war while the volume of food imports is now probably not very different from the
pre-war level, Britain relies relatively less than before the war on imported food, which
now forms a markedly smaller proportion of total imports. The value of imports of
food, beverages and tobacco represented 45 per cent of total imports in 1935-38;
since 1954, the percentage has not been above 40 per cent and in 1961 had fallen to
about 34 per cent. On the other hand, imports of manufactures have increased since
before the war and are now relatively more important in proportion to the total.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
421
Imports of semi-manufactures formed 15 per cent of the total in 1935-38 and 14 per
cent in 1948; by i960 the proportion had risen to 20 per cent falling back to 19 per cent
in 1961; for finished manufactures (including both capital and consumer goods) the
proportion has risen from 7 per cent in 1935-38 to a peak of over 13 per cent in 1961.
(A marked growth in trade in manufactured goods has been a general feature of world
trade since the war.) Although the volume of imports of basic materials has shown a
modest increase since 1938, their share of the total (based on value figures) is now less
than pre-war: 28 per cent in 1935-38 and about 22^ per cent in 1961. Imports of fuels
rose from 5 per cent of the total in 1935-38 to 10 per cent in 1954 and 11 per cent in
1961, owing to the greatly increased consumption of petroleum products.
In the early post-war years exports of engineering products increased considerably
in importance in relation to United Kingdom exports as a whole. In 1935-38 they had
represented 20 per cent of the total; in 1948 the proportion had risen to 36 per cent and
since then there has been a steady increase to 451 per cent in 1961. Although within
this group the increase in the relative importance of motor vehicles and aircraft has
been particularly marked; by far the largest items are machinery and equipment,
such products as instruments and electronic apparatus expanding particularly rapidly.
The share of chemicals has risen steadily. On the other hand, the share of textiles
declined almost without a break from 24 per cent in 1935-38 to 19 per cent in 1948,
with a sharper fall in later years to under 8 per cent in 1961. In the fuels group, the
proportion of petroleum to the whole has fallen since 1954 but in 1961 was still greater
than before the war. Most of the decline in the share of coal exports had taken place by
1948. The proportion of the total of exports of metals has remained fairly constant.
Further details of the percentage composition of United Kingdom exports are set out
in Table 29.

Area Distribution of Trade
In 1961 the Commonwealth provided a market for a little less than two-fifths of
exports of United Kingdom goods, while the six countries of the European Economic
Community or Common Market (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands
and the German Federal Republic) took nearly 17 per cent, the United States 8 per cent,
the Middle East (including members of the sterling area) 6 per cent and Latin America
4^ per cent. The other members of the European Free Trade Association (including
Finland) (see p. 426) accounted for about 13 per cent of United Kingdom exports.

(б) Sterling and non-sterling area countries.
From a longer term standpoint, one of the most important trends is the growth of
exports to industrial countries, and particularly to the United States and Canada. The
sterling area provides a higher proportion of United Kingdom imports than pre-war,
although there has been a slight decline in the latter part of the past decade. Removal of
restrictions has stimulated imports from North America since 1959, mainly industrial
TRADE AND PAYMENTS

materials and capital goods. The expansion of oil consumption has been a major
factor in the increasing imports from the Middle East. In Western Europe, there has
been a sharp rise in recent years in trade with Western Germany, which has become
the most important British market there. Nearly one-third of both exports and imports
relate to trade with Western Europe.
Re-Export Trade
Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they are
imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—e.g. simple blending,
husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially unchanged. For some hundreds of
years Britain has been an important centre of re-export trade, although its importance
relative to total United Kingdom export trade has declined in the last half-century.
Traditionally, the greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade is in raw materials
and foodstuffs, for example, wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals and fur-skins.
Recently, a considerable re-export trade has developed in machinery. A large part
of the re-export trade is in commodities imported from Commonwealth countries and
sent on to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports such as tea and wool.
In 1961 the value of re-exports was £158 million, the highest total in any year to
date and the principal items were: rubber, fur-skins, raw wool, tea, non-ferrous
metals, beverages and aeroplane engines.
Invisible Transactions
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom has normally imported more goods
than it exports; until a few years ago the gap was covered by net earnings from invisible
transactions, but since 1958 this source of foreign exchange income has declined sharply.
In 1958 net invisible earnings were ^285 million; in 1961 they amounted to £65
million.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main groups:
Government; shipping; interest, profits and dividends; travel; migrants’ funds; and
other services. Some of these figures are precise (for instance, for Government trans¬
actions), others are estimates. The diagram on p. 424 shows the breakdown of the
figures in i960 and 1961.
Under the heading of Government current transactions, the main items on the
debit side are rising military expenditure overseas and grants and loans, mainly to
less-developed countries. Shipping receipts come mostly from export freights and
cross trades between other countries and also from passenger traffic. Shipping payments,
on the other hand, arise mainly on account of tramp shipping services. Shipping
transactions produced a net credit until 1958, but now represent a net burden to the
balance of payments. This deterioration has in part occurred because the capacity of
the British merchant fleet has been outstripped by the expansion of Britain’s overseas
trade and by the growth of foreign fleets.
About three-fifths of Britain’s receipts under the heading interest, profits and
dividends come from investments in the sterling area. On the debit side, major items
include interest paid on sterling held by other countries (which thus fluctuates with
changes in short-term interest rates in Britain) and interest payments on long-term
loans from Canada and the United States. Receipts from travel have increased greatly
since 1950, reflecting the growing importance of the British tourist industry (see p. 424),
but expenditure on travel and tourism overseas has also expanded, and the small net
debit has changed little. Major components of other services include payments and
receipts in respect of insurance, civil aviation, films; expenditure of United States

and Canadian forces in Britain and offshore sales by the United States Government
(£59 million and £6 million respectively in 1961); net earnings of merchants; and
royalties, commissions, banking and other services.
INVISIBLE OVERSEAS TRANSACTIONS, I960 and 1961
Tourist Trade
The tourist industry is now one of Britain’s largest earners of foreign currency. Over
the period 1951-60, earnings from the foreign tourist trade and business travel
amounted to the equivalent of £1,180 million, in addition to £500 million earned by
associated British shipping and air services. In 1961 tourist receipts from overseas
amounted to £206 million, while a further £93 million was estimated to have been
paid to British carriers. United Kingdom residents on holiday or travelling on business
overseas spent about £227 million in the same year. The United Kingdom usually
has a large net surplus on earnings from tourism with North America (£60 million in
1961) but a deficit with Western Europe (£121 million in 1961).
The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom in 1961 was i,824,ooo1—an
increase of 9 per cent on the i960 total and twice that of 1954.
1 This total excludes tourists (other than aliens) from the Irish Republic and foreign visitors
in transit to other destinations.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
425
The British Travel and Holidays Association, which is a grant-aided body, is con¬
cerned with the promotion of the tourist trade, particularly by means of publicity
overseas. It maintains offices, agencies or representatives in many overseas countries
(see Appendix p. 518). The association was formed in April 1950 by the merger of
the British Travel and Holidays Board and the Travel Association.
CONDUCT OF TRADE
It has been a major aim of successive United Kingdom Governments since the
second world war to work for the removal of restrictions on trade and payments, to
reduce barriers to exports and, as far as possible, to restore the convertibility of
sterling. To this end, Britain has taken a leading part in setting up such organisations
as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (succeeded
in the autumn of 1961 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop¬
ment (OECD)) and the European Payments Union (succeeded by the European
Monetary Agreement), and has had a large share in these organisations activities,
especially those to free trade from the restrictions which grew up in the war and post¬
war periods.
In addition to substantial reductions in tariffs on imported goods, carried out
through the GATT, the United Kingdom has removed almost all its quota restrictions
on imports from countries with which it is in normal GATT relations.
There is a very short list of goods on which import controls remain. It includes some
items of special difficulty and a few where restrictions are recognised internationally,
such as arms, ammunition and radioactive materials.
Tariff Policy
In the nineteenth century the United Kingdom became strongly attached to the
principle of free trade, and at the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs
duties were those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. During
the first world war, certain duties (the McKenna duties) were introduced to discourage
imports of motor cars, musical instruments, clocks and watches and cinematographic
film. These were continued after the war. Certain key industries, notably optical and
scientific instruments and fine chemicals, were given protection for strategic reasons
under an Act passed in 1921. In 1925 duties were imposed, for revenue purposes, on
imported silk, artificial silk and articles containing these materials; these duties were
later transformed into protection duties. It was not until 19325 however, that any
serious departure was made from the principle of free trade. Under the Import
Duties Act of that year, the United Kingdom imposed a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem
on all imported goods except those on a Free List (mainly important raw materials
and foodstuffs) and set up machinery for the imposition of additional duties and
for additions to be made to the Free List where appropriate. This measure provided
a degree of protection for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations
with foreign countries already in possession of a tariff structure.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United Kingdom
customs tariffs in 1919 and, as a result of the Ottawa Conference in i932> agreements
were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries providing for reciprocal
preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of goods. The Import Duties Act had
already permitted the duty-free entry of goods from the United Kingdom dependencies.
A series of bilateral trade negotiations with other countries between 1932 and
1939 resulted in some modification in the level of protection and in the Commonwealth
426
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
preferences which had been established. During the second world war, because of
Government purchase and import control, protection by the tariff was of relatively
minor importance, and it was only after the substantial relaxation of quantitative
import controls in 1949 that the tariff again became an effective instrument of protection.
Since the war, the United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified
as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under the auspices of the
GATT, which permits the retention of existing preferences but prohibits the creation
of new ones. The United Kingdom has, however, obtained certain limited waivers from
the GATT no-new-preference rule; these permit, under certain conditions, increased
tariff protection for United Kingdom industries while preserving duty-free commit¬
ments for Commonwealth goods, and allow increased preferences for the benefit of
Colonial products wholly or mainly dependent on the United Kingdom market. In the
negotiations under the GATT, United Kingdom customs duties have been reduced,
or bound against increase, on goods which account for about half of Britain’s normal
imports from other contracting countries, in return for concessions by those countries.
Margins of preference have thereby been reduced in some instances, but only in
return for compensating tariff concessions by other countries, and only after consultation
with all the Commonwealth countries concerned. The most recent series was com¬
pleted in July 1962, after negotiations lasting nearly two years; it consisted mainly
of tariff reductions negotiated between the members of the European Economic
Community, the United Kingdom and the United States. The necessary changes in the
British tariffs were to be brought into effect on 31st October, 1962.
Two Acts of recent years have affected tariff policy. The Customs Duties (Dumping
and Subsidies) Act, 1957, empowers the Board of Trade to impose duties on imported
goods of any description which have been dumped or subsidised and which are causing
or threatening material injury to a particular industry. To date, on only five occasions
has the Board found it necessary to impose anti-dumping duties. Several other cases
have been settled by negotiation. The Import Duties Act, 1958, replaced the existing
legislation relating to the protective tariff (i.e. four main Acts and some 70 Finance
Act provisions) and brought it up to date in a single measure. Following the passing
of the Act, the tariff was recast into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels
Nomenclature), which came into use from 1st January, 1959.
European Economic Integration
The moves towards establishing closer economic unity in Europe have a direct and
far-reaching influence on tariff policy. The British Government in February 1957
put forward proposals under which the six countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Italy and Western Germany) which in March 1957 signed the
Treaty of Rome, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC), and other
members of OEEC, would be associated in a free trade area covering industrial
products in Europe. The negotiations proved unsuccessful and were suspended in
November 1958.
During 1959 seven members of OEEC—Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom—agreed to establish between them¬
selves a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with the object of reducing trade
barriers in Europe and establishing a bridge between the EEC and the other members
of OEEC. A convention was initialled in Stockholm in November 1959 and ratified
by member countries in the early months of i960. Under it, customs tariffs on trade in
industrial products between members of EFTA are being eliminated by stages over a
ten-year period. Reductions of 50 per cent had been made by 31st October, 1962.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 427
In March 1961 an Agreement of Association was signed between Finland and EFTA,
providing for a similar progressive reduction in customs tariffs.
On 10th August, 1961, the United Kingdom Government made a formal application
for membership of EEC under Article 237 of the Rome Treaty. Negotiations started
in the autumn of 1961 and have been principally concerned with safeguards for
British agriculture and the interests of Commonwealth suppliers to the British market
and the need to respect Britain’s obligations to the other EFTA countries. Agreements
covering a number of important issues, in particular those concerned with the trading
interests of certain Commonwealth countries and with the position of British agri¬
culture, had been reached by August 1962, when the negotiations in Brussels were
interrupted for a short period.
Methods of Trading
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry,
the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export trade, especially
of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through export merchants in the
United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to importers and consumers abroad
through their own agents or resident representatives in the countries concerned; in
other cases, sales are made through a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisa¬
tions or subsidiary sales companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or domestic
trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may find it more
convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export houses, commission
agents, and the representatives of overseas firms. Since January 1957 overseas trading
undertaken directly by the Government has been confined to jute goods; the purpose
of this is to protect employment in Dundee, where the jute industry is concentrated
and forms the mainstay of employment.
CONTROLS ON TRADE AND PAYMENTS
During the war and in the difficult economic circumstances of the post-war period, a
large number of restrictions on the movement of goods and services and on payments
were imposed. Most of these have been progressively abolished. The following section
gives a short account of the controls still in force.
Exchange Control
Exchange control, which includes, inter alia, control over the purchase and sale of
gold and foreign currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in September
1939. Most of the temporary war-time powers were embodied in permanent legislation
in the Exchange Control Act, 1947.
Exchange control is now confined mainly to transactions between residents of the
sterling area and residents outside it, and has been greatly relaxed in the past few years.
Since the end of December 1958 residents of all countries outside the sterling area can
settle transactions between themselves in sterling. Sterling held by non-residents of the
sterling area on an external account is freely convertible into other currencies, including
dollars. The only remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital
from the United Kingdom to non-sterling countries.
Exports of goods to destinations outside the sterling area are subject to exchange
control and, in general, have to be paid for within six months in an acceptable currency
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
428
or by sterling from an external account. Control is also exercised over imports, to
ensure that currency authorised for their payment is, in fact, used for that purpose.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of the
administration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent of the
Treasury; and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks a
wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Overseas Travel
Restrictions in various forms on the amount of foreign currency and sterling notes
that United Kingdom travellers might take abroad were in force from the end of the
war until November 1959. Since that date there has been no limit on the amount of
foreign currency that United Kingdom residents may obtain; a bank or authorised
travel agency will supply up to £250 in foreign currency for any one journey to each
traveller for purposes of travel outside the scheduled territories (sterling area); and an
amount exceeding £250 may be authorised by the Bank of England on application being
made through the traveller’s bank. Reference is made to the Bank of England as a pro¬
tection against the unauthorised export of capital and not to limit the amount available
for travel. Travellers may take up to £50 in sterling notes and £250 in foreign currency
notes without formality.
Import and Export Control
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers the
Board of Trade to make statutory orders prohibiting or regulating the import or export
of goods. The powers of both import and export control derive from the same legisla¬
tion, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
Import Licensing
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the IMF,
the United Kingdom Government has, as the balance of payments has permitted,
progressively removed restrictions from almost all imports from the countries of the
free world. Goods still subject to control require a specific import licence and quotas
have been set up for most of these goods. Some quotas refer specifically to individual
countries and are usually shared out among exporters by the authorities of the countries
concerned. Others are accorded on an overall or global basis; these are generally
allocated by the United Kingdom authorities to United Kingdom importers, usually
on the basis of their share of the trade in the commodity in the past.
Export Controls
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner (see above), United Kingdom
exports are not, except in a very minor way, subject to any Government control or
direction. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise exports of
military and strategic importance, to conserve materials, such as metal scrap, which
may be in inadequate supply, to assist exchange control operations in preventing the
export of capital in the form of valuable goods, and to prevent the export of works of
art classed as national treasures, such as paintings, manuscripts and antiques. Normally,
individual licences are required for specific consignments of goods subject to export
licensing control. Goods controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category
of atomic energy materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may be exported to
the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic and the United States of America without
licence.

GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO OVERSEAS TRADE
The United Kingdom Government does not subsidise exports, but supplies informa¬
tion, advice and practical assistance (including credit insurance facilities) to exporters1
and seeks to create conditions in which export trade can flourish. Its general economic
policy includes the use of fiscal, credit and other measures to maintain a stable economy
and to control excessive demand for goods and services by the home market, and action
through international negotiation to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and to
move towards the freest possible system of trade and payments.
Information and Advice to Exporters
The Government department most concerned in export promotion is the Board of
Trade, which calls upon the assistance of overseas representatives. At each Embassy
or Legation there is always an officer of high rank, a Minister, Counsellor or First
Secretary (Commercial), who specialises in commercial matters. These officers direct
the commercial activities of consular officers in their respective territories. At important
centres in the Commonwealth there are Trade Commissioners, who are directly
responsible to the Board of Trade.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions,
pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and generally
assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters in trade with the country
in question, particularly those arising out of governmental regulations. These officers
investigate potential markets for United Kingdom products, advise about methods of
trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass on opportunities for export
business and inquiries for United Kingdom goods. Assistance is also given to United
Kingdom exporters in appointing agents and locating potential importers. From records
kept in London, brought up to date by reports from its overseas officers, the Export
Services Branch of the Board of Trade can provide information concerning any
country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) local tastes and preferences in design; and
(5) the probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates
entering into business relations.
The Government’s official information services overseas help to promote trade by
publicising British industrial achievements and providing information on new develop¬
ments in British industry.
Export Credit Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, responsible directly to the President
of the Board of Trade, is run on commercial lines to provide insurance for United
Kingdom exporters and merchants against the main risks of financial loss incurred in
overseas trading. These facilities have been developed over a period of more than
1 Export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), the
Northern Ireland Development Council, and the Development Corporation for Wales, see p. 262.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
thirty years, and the department insured £806 million worth of exports in the financial
year 1961-62; this sum represents nearly one-quarter of the total United Kingdom
export trade. The department is obliged to conduct its business on a self-supporting
basis, taking one year with another, and cannot therefore be regarded in any way as a
provider of subsidies to exporters.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, govern¬
mental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the United Kingdom
exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions in the buyer’s country,
war between the buyer’s country and the United Kingdom, cancellation or non¬
renewal of a United Kingdom export licence, or ‘any other cause of loss occurring
outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the exporter or the buyer,
and not normally insurable with commercial insurers’. Cover may commence from
the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date of shipment.
The main types of export insurance policy are:
1. Comprehensive policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to six
months’ credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the whole of his
trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve months (or, in some cases,
three years) covered by his policy. For certain engineering goods this type of
cover is extended to goods sold on credit terms of up to five years. Cover is
also available for goods of foreign origin sold by a United Kingdom merchant
to third countries, provided this trade does not conflict with direct United
Kingdom exports.
2. Specific policies which cover capital and other goods sold on credit terms of
up to five years. Specific policies are negotiated for each individual contract.
In October i960 it was announced that to match overseas competition, in certain
cases cover would be given for periods in excess of five years; where competition was
supported by an overseas government, full matching cover would be given; in other
cases, cover would be given on payments due within five years. In April 1961 ECGD
introduced financial guarantees for United Kingdom banks providing finance on a
long-term basis for overseas purchasers of large capital goods and works, and in
January 1962 the London Clearing Banks, the Scottish Banks and a number of in¬
surance companies agreed to provide finance at fixed rates of interest for such loans,
and also in respect of other export financing on longer than three years’ credit which
was secured by an ECGD guarantee to the bank concerned.
The exporter or merchant is normally required to retain an interest in the debt
or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are given up to a maximum of between
85 and 95 per cent of loss. In February 1962 this was extended to 100 per cent for
transactions involving over three years’ credit which had already operated satisfactorily
for two years. Premium rates are assessed separately for each country, and vary
according to the risks and the terms of payment. Cover is also available for United
Kingdom concerns carrying out services for overseas firms or, under certain conditions,
entering into an international consortium.

give economic assistance to other countries (see p. 437)*
Trade Fairs
An inquiry carried out by the Federation of British Industries (FBI) in 1957 showed
that the large majority of British trade associations favoured the development of
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
431
specialised fairs, concentrating on the products of a particular industry or group of
industries, rather than the general fair at which wide ranges of products are exhibited.
Some 70 specialised fairs are held every year in the United Kingdom and the number
is growing steadily. An increasing proportion, at present about half the total, are
international in character, and the remainder are national (i.e. open only to firms
showing United Kingdom products). Some of the specialised fairs, such as the Motor
Show and the Radio and Television Show, attract large numbers of the public as well
as many trade buyers from home and overseas, and provide an important means of
advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufactures are shown at most of the large international trade
fairs throughout the world. For example, the United Kingdom is usually well repre¬
sented at the Milan, Hanover and Poznan Fairs. In addition to such international
events there are, from time to time, specially organised displays of British products.
Through a subsidiary company, British Overseas Fairs Ltd., the FBI organised British
Trade Fairs in Baghdad in 1954, in Copenhagen in 1955, in Helsinki in 1957, in
Lisbon in 1959, in New York in i960, and in Stockholm in 1962. In 1961 a British
Trade Fair, organised by Industrial and Trade Fairs, Ltd., was held in Moscow, at
which 620 British firms exhibited. United Kingdom manufacturers have been promi¬
nent at the many important specialised international fairs which are held in North
America and Europe.
Participation in trade fairs and ‘British Weeks’ overseas is a form of export promotion
for which the Government provides information, advice and, in certain cases, free
facilities. The Government is prepared to provide stands for United Kingdom trade
associations whose members wish to take part in overseas fairs; to build and manage
British pavilions at trade fairs where displays are on a basis of nationality; to provide
exhibits at all-British fairs; and to give support to ‘British Weeks’ and similar events
(often including promotion of British goods in department stores). The amount
allocated to the Board of Trade for these purposes has risen from £60,000 in 1955-56
to £570,000 in 1962-63.
Exports Councils
In i960 the Dollar Exports Council was renamed the Western Hemisphere Exports
Council and its area of responsibility was extended to include the whole of Latin
America and the Caribbean as well as Canada and the United States. The Council
(originally named the Dollar Exports Board) was established in 1949 6y representatives
of United Kingdom industry, trade, finance and organised labour, with the approval
and support of the United Kingdom Government. It is an independent, self-governing,
voluntary organisation to promote exports. A similar task is being undertaken in
Europe by the Export Council for Europe, also set up in i960.
BRITAIN’S ROLE IN THE FINANCING OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
By a process of evolution through the centuries, the United Kingdom has developed
an efficient and adaptable organisation of trade and financial services, centred mostly
on London, and capable of meeting the needs, not only of Britain itself, but of the
world in general. Britain’s supremacy in this respect derives from a number of factors—
historical, geographical and economic—as well as the technical efficiency and low cost
of its services. In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, com¬
merce and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain the
market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for the chief world
432
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
markets in raw materials (see below), freight, insurance, and precious metals. At the
same time, British capital was invested in overseas countries to assist their development,
increase their output and exports, and provide markets for manufactured goods.
London became the chief supplier of capital for many Commonwealth and foreign
governments and a centre for entrepot trade proceeding to and from the growing
industrial areas on the continent of Europe and in North America. In course of time,
the pound sterling and the sterling bill of exchange developed into the principal
form of money for transactions between one country and another in all parts of
the world.
Side by side with these developments, a sound commercial banking system and a
flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialised institutions
such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the stock exchanges,
investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy particular needs for
short-term or long-term finance (see pp. 408-15). The facilities provided by merchant
banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of
goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries themselves.
Commodity Markets
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic commodities.
Most of these markets were closed during the war but most, if not all, have now
reopened and many have fully regained—some even surpassed—their previous position.
Among the more important are the Baltic Exchange (the market for shipping and air
transport, grain, seeds and vegetable oils), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa,
coffee, copra, hides and skins, rubber and sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the
London Metal Exchange, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn
Exchange. These markets not only cater for the import of goods for home consumption
but do much business in effecting transactions between buyers and sellers in other
countries. In addition to these formal markets, there is scarcely any product which
cannot be traded through an intermediary in the United Kingdom. For example,
London is the world’s most important philatelic market and also the leading inter¬
national centre for the sale of works of art.
The Foreign Exchange Market
The Foreign Exchange Market is subject to United Kingdom exchange control
regulations governing the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in the sterling area,
but these regulations have been progressively relaxed in recent years. The turnover
of the market has increased materially since the introduction in December 1958 of
external convertibility for the principal European countries.
The market consists of about 130 authorised banks and nine firms of brokers, all
linked together by telephone in the United Kingdom, and by telephone, telex and cable
with overseas centres.
The London Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak of war,
was reopened on a restricted basis in March 1954, under the general supervision of
the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the leading centre for
dealings in gold, handling about four-fifths of the gold coming on to the free markets
of the world. The market consists of five firms dealing in gold bullion, whose repre¬
sentatives meet each working day to ‘fix’ the official London gold price.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
433
The Sterling System
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several countries
tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for international transactions,
but also to maintain central currency reserves in Britain. When Britain abandoned the
gold standard in 1931 these countries, which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’
and later as the ‘sterling area’, did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates
to the pound sterling. In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no
longer freely convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more
formally defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes. The United
Kingdom imposes no exchange control on transactions with residents of other sterling
area countries.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma, Iceland,
the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Republic of South Africa and South
West Africa, the British protected States in the Persian Gulf and Western Samoa are
members of the sterling area. These countries contain one-quarter of the world’s
population and do one-quarter of the world’s trade. The main feature of the sterling
area is that the greater part of the overseas trade of member countries is financed in
sterling; they keep their foreign reserves largely in the form of sterling and maintain
a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member countries for the
most part sell their foreign currency earnings in London in exchange for sterling and
can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require. They generally also sell gold
in the London market for sterling. The United Kingdom reserves of gold and foreign
currencies are held in the Exchange Equalisation Account, which buys and sells
exchange in the market as appropriate, and is a large buyer of gold from the sterling
area and elsewhere.
All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or centralised
rules of conduct, the Commonwealth member countries agreeing between themselves
at periodic conferences the broad policies to be followed for the strengthening of
sterling and of the reserves.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments are published half-yearly
in White Papers. These publications provide a summary of the whole range of the
United Kingdom’s transactions with other countries, classified by type of transaction
and by area.
The transactions fall into three main groups—current account, long-term capital
account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is composed of
the balance of visible trade (i.e. the difference between merchandise imports and exports
and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles (see p. 423)- On long-term capital
account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental loans (including amortisation)
and other identified net long-term investment abroad by United Kingdom residents,
or in the United Kingdom by non-residents. The third heading, monetary movements,
reflects in part the United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes
identified capital transactions not of a long-term character (e.g. changes in acceptances),
changes in overseas sterling holdings and changes in the United Kingdom reserves of
gold and convertible currencies.
With the decline in receipts from invisible transactions and the continuing need
for Britain to export capital, and in particular to give financial assistance to developing
countries, the main balance of payments problem for the country is to achieve a
434
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
substantial surplus on visible trade account; that is to say, to export more while
preventing imports from rising equally.
Between 1945 and 1951 the balance of payments on current account fluctuated
widely. From 1952 to 1959 there were surpluses in each year except 1955. In i960
there was a substantial deficit of £288 million, but in the following year this was
reduced by over £200 million to £70 million.

Balance of Payments in 1961
The United Kingdom adverse balance on current account of £70 million in 1961
was made up of a surplus of £310 million with the rest of the sterling area and a
deficit of £380 million with the non-sterling area. Formerly the deficit on visible
trade was more than balanced by invisible earnings, but this did not happen in i960
or 1961. The reserves of gold and convertible currencies rose by a total of £31 million
and the total sterling holdings rose by £81 million during the year. At the end of
1961 these overseas holdings of sterling totalled ^4.515 million, of which about three-
fifths were held by the rest of the sterling area countries. Table 31 gives details of the
United Kingdom’s balance of payments from 1959 to 1961.

In addition to the gold and convertible currency reserves, Britain has drawing
rights on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) based on its ‘quota’, which was
raised to £696 million in 1959. In August and September 1961, to strengthen the
reserves, the United Kingdom drew $1,500 million (£536 million) in nine different
currencies from the IMF, plus a further $500 million to be held by the IMF under
stand-by arrangements. This was the third occasion on which Britain has had recourse
to IMF facilities. A final instalment of $512 million (£183 million) at the end of July
1962 completed the repayment of these borrowings. At the same time a new stand-by
arrangement with the IMF authorised drawings by the United Kingdom up to the
equivalent of $1,000 million over the twelve-month period from 8th August, 1962.
A further line of reserves is provided by the dollar securities, with an estimated
value of $750 to $1,250 million, held by the Exchange Equalisation Account.
OVERSEAS INVESTMENT
Overseas Borrowing by Britain
Britain’s difficulties in balancing its external accounts, particularly with the dollar
area, in the immediate post-war years, were greatly alleviated by aid received from the
United States and Canada. In 1945 the United States extended to Britain a line o
credit of $3,750 million, and a loan of $650 million (later adjusted to $622 million)
in settlement of Lend-Lease and reciprocal aid adjustments arising out of the war
In 1946 Canada also extended a line of credit, amounting to $C. 1,250 million, of
which the United Kingdom drew $C. 1,185 million. The terms of settlement with
both countries provided for repayment in 50 annual instalments, starting on 31st
December, 1951, with interest at the rate of 2 per cent a year. (Between 1948 and 1951
Britain received in all $2,700 million in Marshall Aid from the United States under
the European Recovery Programme.)
Overseas Private Investment in Britain
Overseas investors in Britain are allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the sale of their
investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued, provided that the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
436
investment was made after ist January, 1950. Earned profits and dividends can be
transferred, irrespective of the amount; transfers of this kind have never been
restricted.
By far the largest proportion of private investment by overseas countries in Britain
is made by United States firms. It has been estimated1 that between 1950 and i960
the total value of United States direct investments in Britain rose from $847 million
to $3,194 million, representing about 48 per cent of the total United States direct
investment in Western Europe over the period. The i960 total included $600 million
in petroleum refining and distribution and $2,164 million in manufacturing industry.
A British Industrial Development Office has been established in New York to provide
potential American investors with advice and information about manufacturing
conditions in Britain. According to a survey by the Board of Trade, it is estimated that
private direct investment (excluding oil and insurance) in i960 amounted to £132
million, of which about £84 million was United States capital, £18 million Canadian
and £16 million from Western European countries. Portfolio investment (for instance,
by purchase on a stock exchange of securities in United Kingdom companies) by
people in overseas countries has also increased markedly since 1957 and particularly
in the latter half of 1961.
United Kingdom Investment Overseas
For well over a hundred years the United Kingdom has been a major supplier of
external finance for other countries; up to the first decade of the twentieth century
it was the foremost supplier of private long-term capital. The greater part of such
private finance goes to Commonwealth countries (including colonial territories).
All the countries of the sterling Commonwealth except the United Kingdom are
net importers of long-term capital and look to the United Kingdom for a substantial
proportion of their external capital requirements. The sources and availability of
capital for development are therefore regularly considered at Commonwealth Economic
Conferences and similar meetings.
Private investment abroad may take several forms: the raising of loans on the
London capital market; direct investment; the establishment of subsidiary companies;
the ploughing back of profits earned overseas; and participation, jointly with domestic
capital, in enterprises overseas.
The United Kingdom imposes no restriction on investment in the sterling area by
United Kingdom firms. Such investment is frequently made from a firm’s existing
resources. However, borrowers outside the United Kingdom must normally obtain
the consent of the Treasury (which is advised by the Capital Issues Committee) if the
amount borrowed exceeds £50,000 in any one year. Borrowing by Commonwealth
and Colonial Governments in the London capital market has fallen in recent years,
but averaged about £50 million a year in the 1950s. Finance is also made available
by the Commonwealth Development Finance Company (see p. 4I4)> which, by
March 1962, had entered into commitments totalling £22 million in thirteen Com¬
monwealth countries for a wide variety of projects.
Investment outside the sterling area is subject to Exchange Control regulations.
Restrictions introduced in July 1961 limited the provision of official exchange to
direct investment projects which promised benefit in the short-term to the United
Kingdom balance of payments. Revised arrangements, announced in May 1962,
allow direct investment which does not meet this test to be financed in other ways.
1 United States Department of Commerce’s Survey of Current Business, August 1961.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
437
Official exchange is not made available for portfolio investment (for instance the
purchase of securities).
In recent years the net level of United Kingdom private investment in all areas
has been over £100 million a year. The gross outflow of new funds has, however,
been much larger and is estimated to have averaged ^300 million yearly since 1953.
About ^150 million a year goes to under-developed countries. The results of a survey
by the Board of Trade showed that private direct investment abroad by United
Kingdom companies totalled £247 million in i960, three-fifths being in the sterling
area, some £43 million in North America and about £25 million in Western Europe.
Preliminary estimates for 1961 give a total of £211 million. The figures exclude
operations of oil and insurance companies but include reinvested profits.
UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT AID FOR DEVELOPMENT
Since the second world war, despite economic difficulties, the United Kingdom has
made available to other countries very large sums in the form of grants and loans for
relief, rehabilitation, development and other economic purposes. Non-military loans
and grants to the less-developed countries from the United Kingdom Exchequer have
been increasing; figures are given in Table 33. The greater part of such assistance
goes to dependent territories and to developing countries inside and outside the
Commonwealth.

This assistance takes two forms; grants and loans, and payments for technical
assistance arranged directly with the country receiving help (bilateral assistance), and
contributions to international bodies (multilateral assistance), d he division of assis¬
tance between these various forms is shown in Table 34. In 1961 bilateral assistance
totalled £155 million and multilateral assistance was £6-5 million. Technical assistance,
in so far as it is quantitatively assessable, accounted for over j£i8 million. Almost
half of the bilateral assistance is in the form of grants.
There are several public sources of finance from which United Kingdom funds
are made available for overseas development. The following are the principal forms
of machinerv through which funds are provided.
Export Guarantees Acts
Under Sections 2 and 3 of the Export Guarantees Act, 1949, as amended by Section 2
of the Export Guarantees Act, 1957, the Government has authority to give economic
assistance to overseas countries. Securities issued by the borrowing country are

acquired by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), and their purchase
price used to facilitate payment for United Kingdom exports. The loans made through
these powers to overseas Governments bear interest at rates related to the notional
rates for United Kingdom Government borrowing.
From 1949 to June 1962 over 30 loan agreements with a total value ot about ^,280
million had been made, of which all but 7 have been made since mid-1958 The total
includes 11 loans to India, amounting to about £157-5 million, and 5 to Pakistan to a
value of £35 million. For the more recent loans, repayment periods are up to 25 years,
and in certain cases there is a grace period before repayments begin.
Colonial Development Corporation _ .
The Colonial Development Corporation is a public corporation set up in February
1948 to assist Colonial territories in the development of their economies. The Corpora¬
tion can borrow up to £150 million on a long-term and medium-term basis, and £10
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
439
million on a short-term basis. Exchequer advances to the Corporation outstanding at
any one time may not exceed £130 million long-term and medium-term advances.
At the end of 1961, the Corporation reported that it had 102 continuing projects,
and a total capital commitment of nearly ^116 million. Of this, about ^20-3 million
was in the Far East, £16-5 million in the Caribbean and the remainder in Africa.
It was announced at the end of July 1962 that legislation would be introduced to
authorise the Corporation to undertake development schemes in countries which have
become independent members of the Commonwealth and in which the Corporation
had previously been empowered to operate. It would be renamed the Commonwealth
Development Corporation.
Colonial Development and Welfare Acts
The United Kingdom has made available, under the Colonial Development and
Welfare Act of 1945 and subsequent Acts, £220 million for planned development
and welfare in its dependent territories for the period 1946-60. Under the Colonial
Development and Welfare Act, 1959, a further ^95 million will be provided for the
period 1959-64 for the continuation of assistance on the existing basis. The 1959 Act
also provides for additional Exchequer loans of up to ^100 million in the same period;
the maximum amount approved for any one year must not exceed £25 million. In the
financial year 1961-62, loans amounting to ^16 million were approved; by the end of
the financial year some 3^50 million had been made available. These loans and grants
are used by the dependent territories to supplement development expenditure from
their own resources and from market borrowing.
Aid through Intergovernmental Organisations
The principal intergovernmental organisations through which the United Kingdom
provides aid to other countries are the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and its affiliates, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
and the International Development Association (IDA), the United Nations Expanded
Programme for Technical Assistance and Special Fund for Technical Assistance.
The United Kingdom’s subscription to the capital of IBRD, $2,600 million, is
the second largest of any country. The £84 million representing the United Kingdom’s
paid-up sterling subscription to the Bank had been disbursed in full by September i960,
all but 3^4 million was for lending to Commonwealth countries. Repayments on loans
financed in this way may be used by IBRD for fresh lending, thus constituting a
revolving fund. In addition, IBRD has also borrowed 3^20 million by the issue of
bonds on the London market.
The United Kingdom is contributing the equivalent of $131 million to the capital
of the IDA, set up in i960, which provides long-term finance capital on special terms
for under-developed countries.
The United Kingdom is also the second largest contributor to IFC,1 and has
subscribed $14-4 million of the corporation’s total capital of $100 million. In addition,
since 1949 the United Kingdom has contributed about million to the United
Nations Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance2 and since 1959 has provided
nearly £2 million annually towards the resources of the United Nations Special Fund.3
1 IFC was set up as an affiliate of IBRD in 1956 to provide capital to assist the growth of
private enterprise in member countries.
2 The object of this programme is to provide under-developed countries with expert advice
and training facilities over a wide field.
3 The object of the fund is to extend the scope and resources of the existing technical assistance
and development programmes of the United Nations.

Colombo Plan
The Colombo Plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South-
East Asia had its origin in, and took its name from, the meeting of Commonwealth
Foreign Ministers held at Colombo in January 1950. It is designed to provide a frame¬
work within which a co-operative effort can be made to raise the area s standards of
living and to undertake economic development.
The cumulative total of commitments from the United Kingdom Exchequer for
capital aid and technical assistance to Colombo Plan countries from 1951 t-0 3°^ June>
1961, amounted to about ^259 million, of which ^183 million had been disbursed.
The United Kingdom undertook at the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee
meeting at Seattle in November 1958 to increase the amount of technical assistance
to be provided up to 1963 from £7 million to £9 million.
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad categories:
trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products (for example, vehicle
components) and trade in consumer goods, that is to say goods for direct sale to the
public. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is outlined in Chapter 9, The National
Economy.)
The 1957 census of distribution, which was a large-scale sample inquiry, provides
an account of the structure of retail trade and a full-scale inquiry into the wholesale
trade was made by the Board of Trade for 1959. The full census of distribution,
relating to the year 1950, also covered wholesaling and the catering and other service
trades, and provides a comprehensive picture of the distributive trades as a whole. It
also included more detailed information on the retail trades than was given in the
1957 census. Both censuses covered Great Britain but not Northern Ireland. A full
analysis of retail trade will be provided by the results of the Census of Distribution
carried out in 1962, and covering trade in 1961.
WHOLESALE TRADES
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers:
sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling organisations (in¬
cluding their own retail outlets and mail order business); and other sales are made
directly by producers to retailers. Wholesale channels are particularly in evidence in
the distribution of textiles, agricultural produce and foodstuffs. The inquiry made by
the Board of Trade in respect of 1959 showed that out of a total of 19,000 business
units engaged in wholesale distribution in Great Britain, over 3,000 dealt in clothing,
footwear and textiles, 2,000 in grocery and provisions, 2,000 in vegetables and fruit,
and over 3,000 in other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,000 dealers
(wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies, and
7,000 dealers in other industrial materials and machinery.
Latest estimates for 1961 show that the level of stocks held by wholesalers and
dealers is just under £900 million; expenditure on capital assets is about £80 million
a year, about one-quarter of which is invested by business units engaged in distributing
petroleum products, most of them being the distributing organisations of the major
oil companies.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fresh fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres or, in some cases, direct
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
44I
to retailers; fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, may be sold by growers to com¬
mission agents who dispose of the produce either to wholesalers or direct to retailers,
or alternatively the grower may deal only with wholesale firms.
London’s wholesale markets are of outstanding importance in the distribution of
foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Covent Garden handles about five million
tons of fruit, vegetables and flowers each year; nearly 8,000 tons of meat pass through
Smithfield market each week; Billingsgate is the principal distributing centre in
Britain for fish. Other markets in London include those at Leadenhall (poultry) and
Spitalfields (fruit and vegetables).
Voluntary wholesale chains, that is to say independent retailers linking themselves
to a single wholesaler or a group of wholesalers and so benefiting from some of the
lower operating costs of large-scale trading without losing their independence, have
developed quite rapidly in the grocery trade since 1954- As yet, however, they account
for only a small, though growing, proportion of grocery business.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of Retail Shop
Retail shops in Britain may be classified under four heads: (1) retail co-operative
societies; (2) department stores with a number of departments selling different types
of goods (in some cases a firm may own several department stores); (3) multiple
traders, that is organisations, other than co-operative societies or department stores,
with ten or more branches; and (4) independent retail business and branches of small
multiple stores (i.e. chains of stores with nine or fewer branches). In addition, there
are a number of market and street traders but, according to the 1950 census of
distribution, the amount of business done by these traders is usually very small;
their average turnover was less than £2,000 per year. Table 35 shows the shares of
the four main groups of retail business in total turnover in 1957*

There are a large number of small undertakings; the 1950 census recorded 246,000
businesses with an annual turnover of under £5,000. Most of the smaller under¬
takings have working proprietors; out of the 2-6 million persons engaged in the retail
trade in 1957, 590,000 were working proprietors and unpaid family helpers. Out of a
total of about 574,000 establishments shown by the 1957 census of distribution, and
recorded in Table 36, grocery and other food retailing groups numbered nearly
276,000 establishments, and the clothing and footwear group about 94,000. The 1957
442
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
census also showed that among multiple retail enterprises the three largest, each with
more than 2,000 establishments, accounted for about one-eighth of the total turnover
of this group of retailers.

Present Trends in Retail Trade
By the end of 1961 the value of total retail sales in Great Britain had advanced
15 per cent by value over the 1957 level> the annual average rate of increase being
about 4 per cent. Multiple retailers have been showing the fastest rate of expansion.
Their sales in 1961 were up by 6 per cent on the i960 figure (compared with increases
of 1 per cent for co-operatives, 5 per cent for department stores and 3 per cent for
independent retailers) and they had raised their total share of trade from 24! per cent
in 1957 to about 27^ per cent; over this latter period the shares of independent and
co-operative societies have declined. The rate of increase also varied according to type
of shop. Sales in the durable goods sector (furniture, radio and television, household
appliances and cycle shops) decreased sharply after the re-imposition of hire-purchase
restrictions at the end of April i960, and in 1961 were about 5 per cent below the
1959 total, although an upward trend appeared towards the end of the year. Clothing
and footwear shops’ sales showed an increase of 3 per cent between i960 and 1961
(after a rise of 8 per cent in the previous year) while food shops’ sales advanced by
4 per cent. Retail prices, which had previously been rising for some years until i95^»
were relatively stable in 1959 an^ again in I9^°> but again moved upwards in 1961,
and only about half of the increase in the value of sales (4 per cent over i960) was
attributable to a greater volume of sales.
In Northern Ireland the value of retail sales per week was 5 per cent higher in
1961 than in i960 and 7 per cent higher than in 1959*

Development in Methods of Retailing
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has probably
helped the multiple stores and, to a lesser degree, the retail co-operatives to achieve
a higher rate of expansion in sales. The number of self-service shops in the United
Kingdom in 1961 has been estimated at about 9,000 and new self-service outlets are
being established at the rate of well over 1,000 a year. Over two-fifths of these shops
are thought to be owned by retail co-operative societies and about one-third by
multiple stores. On the basis of returns provided for the 1957 census of distribution,
the Board of Trade has estimated that their total turnover in that year exceeded £200
million; unofficial estimates for self-service trading put the 1961 rate of sales at some
/600 million. Self-service shops as a whole are now estimated to be responsible for
over a quarter of retail sales (compared with 10 per cent in 1957) in the grocery and
provision trade, but for other types of merchandise the proportion is insignificant.
Supermarkets, which may be broadly defined as self-service shops with a selling
area of more than 2,000 square feet and selling all types of food and some household
goods (such as cleaning materials), have been operating since 1956 in the United
Kingdom. By 1962 about 650 had been opened, of which about one-half were in
or around the London area. Co-operative societies own about a third of the super¬
markets, and multiple stores over half.
New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since 1955, and
an increasing number of coin operated machines are being installed in factories and
commercial premises as well as in normal retail outlets. The range of goods sold is
widening and hot and cold beverages and prepared foodstuffs are among the most
popular. Well over 200,000 machines are in use, and total sales are of the order of
£20 million to £25 million a year. _ , , . , •
An even more recent trend is the emergence of ‘discount houses , which in essence
are supermarkets often located outside established shopping areas, and selling house¬
hold goods (as well as groceries) at prices below those normally prevailing. So far
only a few discount houses have been opened in Britain.
There has also been a large increase in the number of mobile shops serving out¬
lying housing estates and rural areas. Several thousand mobile shops, about half of
which are owned by retail co-operative societies, are estimated to be in operation, the
majority selling groceries or other foodstuffs; several manufacturers specialise in
building fully equipped vehicles for this type of trading.
Mail Order Sales
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling in the
United Kingdom in recent years, especially in the north of England. Retail sales
amounting to £128 million were reported by specialist mail order houses in 1957,
compared with only £47 million in 1950, and some manufacturers and large stores
also sell by mail order. Sales in 1961 have been estimated to be twice as great as in
1957. Mail order houses operate through recruiting agents who have at their disposal
elaborate catalogues. The twenty largest companies account for about 85 per cent of
total mail order sales; the bulk of their trade consists of clothing, footwear and house¬
hold textiles. The smaller mail order businesses normally specialise in a single com¬
modity, notably in the sale by post of seeds, plants and small horticultural requisites.
Retail Co-operative Societies
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisations
engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their customers.
444
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
An operating surplus is returned periodically to members as a dividend, and the
amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the member’s purchases.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open to
anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the member to
an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of the society. Invest¬
ment by individual members is limited to ^500 but the rules of some societies fix
lower limits. Only a low rate of interest is paid on the shares.
At the end of i960 there were 955 retail co-operative societies registered under
the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Amalgamations are slowly diminishing
the number of societies, the total having fallen by 60 in two years. More than a quarter
of the total membership of the co-operatives (12,746,000) was provided by the eight
largest societies, each of which had a membership of more than 150,000. One, the
London Co-operative Society with just under 1-3 million members, is the largest
retail co-operative in the world. Total sales of the retail co-operative societies in i960
reached ,£1,008 million (this figure includes certain activities not covered by the
census of distribution figure in Table 35); the largest society had a turnover of more
than ^56 million, and of the total trading surplus, ^48 million, or about three-quarters,
was allocated to dividends on sales.
Retail co-operative societies are free to purchase where they wish or to produce
their own goods, but in order to secure the advantage of large-scale production and
distribution, they have collectively established wholesale and production societies.1
Hire-Purchase Sales
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such as cars,
furniture, washing machines, refrigerators and cookers, has been greatly helped by
instalment purchasing. The Board of Trade has powers to regulate the terms of hire-
purchase and credit sales agreements. In April i960 minimum deposits and maximum
repayment periods for most categories of consumer goods were reintroduced, but the
former were reduced in June 1962. Total hire-purchase debt outstanding rose by
over ^450 million to ,£937 million between October 1958 (when controls were revoked)
and April i960; it amounted to £887 million at the end of June 1962.
Retailers finance most of their own hire-purchase business (covering furniture and
other domestic goods) and at the end of June 1962 the hire-purchase debt owed
directly to them, including the amount rediscounted by finance houses, was £294
million. The balance of their hire-purchase business is directly financed by finance
houses but these companies are mainly concerned with the financing of hire-purchase
business in motor vehicles and industrial, farm, and commercial equipment. At the
end of June 1962 the hire-purchase debt owed directly to them was ,£593 million.
There are a large number of these companies but a high proportion of the business
is done by a small number which operate on a national scale. Finance houses suffered
substantial losses in i960 and 1961 as a result of bad debts, fraud and a declining
volume of business. Measures have been taken to improve standards of credit-
worthiness among potential borrowers.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance houses
operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1961 to over ,£11 million
and at the end of 1961 the hire-purchase debt owed to them amounted to over .£12
million.
1 The two major wholesale societies are the Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited and the
Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
445
Service Trades
About i-3 million people are employed in Great Britain in industries providing services
directly to the public. The largest number are in the catering and hotel trades, employ¬
ing about 540,000, and the garage and motor repair trades, with over 360,000. Others
include laundries, dry cleaning, entertainment, sports and recreations, and betting.
A census undertaken by the Board of Trade relating to i960 showed that there
were 125,000 establishments primarily concerned with catering with a total turnover
in that year of £1,300 million. (Catering was defined to cover public houses, canteens,
and fish and chip shops, as well as hotels and restaurants, etc.) Hotels and holiday
camps (i.e. excluding boarding houses and small unlicensed hotels) had receipts of
about £180 million, of which £80 million was from residential accommodation.
Nearly half the total turnover of the catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks.
There are about 1,500 commercial laundries with an annual turnover of about
£70 million, of which some £45 million is domestic laundry. (The latter figure has
tended to decline with the increasing popularity of coin-operated washing machines
and launderettes.) Dry cleaning firms have an annual turnover of around £30 million.
Of the estimated 36,000 garages in Britain, nearly one-third are mainly petrol
filling stations, about the same proportion also deal with repair work, and the remainder
are primarily motor car distributors. Most garages are tied under contract to major
oil companies, selling only one company’s petrol, and sometimes lubricants also.
Packaging
The Institute of Packaging estimated in 1961 that British industry spent between
£500 million and £600 million annually on packaging, an increase of one-half during
the previous decade. The expansion of self-service shops and the growth of sales in the
form of branded and standardised products have been major factors in the great
changes which have taken place in packaging methods. These developments are
reflected in the marked increases in output of the industries concerned plastics, fibre-
board, metal tubes, tin plate and glass containers. Fruit and vegetables, for example,
are increasingly sold in packs of transparent film. Aerosol dispensers, almost unknown
a few years ago, were being used at a rate of over 55 million in having increased
from about 28 million in 1959. Their principal uses are for insecticides and air fresh¬
eners. Laminated aluminium foil is now employed extensively as a wrapping material
in the food industry.
Advertising and Industrial Information
The expansion of productive capacity in industries manufacturing consumer goods
in Britain, and the ever-increasing choice of goods and services available to the
consumer in recent years, have been accompanied by a steady upward trend in
expenditure on advertising. About £466 million is estimated to have been spent on all
forms of advertising in 1961, £21 million more than in i960. About £210 million was
expended on press advertising, over three-fifths of it in the national and provincial
press and the rest in periodicals and magazines and in the technical trade press, and
about £87 million (nearly half as much again as in 1959) was spent on television
advertising. The remainder was divided between other media, such as posters, films,
catalogues, window displays, exhibitions, and free samples and gift schemes. Most
of the advertising is carried out by advertising agencies, which, in some cases, also
provide marketing, consumer research and other services. The central organisation
of the agencies is the Institute of Incorporated Practitioners in Advertising. The trade
association for agencies, owners of advertising media, and all concerned in advertising
446
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is the Advertising Association. The latter was responsible for the setting up in 1962 of
the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body whose objective is the
promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of advertising.
Industry and commerce have in recent years paid increasing attention to improving
public understanding of their work and objectives. Public relations consultancy firms
and the public relations departments of advertising agencies provide general services,
apart from the increasing employment by industrial organisations and trade associations
of staff specialists in public relations. Their professional body, founded in 1948, is
the Institute of Public Relations: not only commerce and industry, but the professions,
national associations, central and local government are represented within the Institute.
Consumer Protection
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the consumer
against specific abuses. Independent organisations have also sought to establish
voluntary minimum standards of quality. Weights and measures legislation, one of
the earliest forms of consumer protection, is strictly enforced by qualified inspectors.
The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953, are designed to ensure that the marking of
goods is both accurate and honest. The British Standards Institution (see p. 272) has
established a number of standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial
Design (see p. 230) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
Advice to the public on the merits of consumer goods is provided through the British
Standards Institution’s Consumer Advisory Council and by the Consumers’ Associa¬
tion Ltd., a private body financed by the subscriptions of members; both issue to
subscribers regular bulletins reporting on the qualities of products tested. Assistance
with certain aspects of consumer guidance is also given by a number of other private
bodies and by certain Government departments, e.g., the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research. Special arrangements in the form of consumer councils and
consumer committees, have been made for the nationalised industries. Individual
trades and industries have also taken measures to raise standards of quality.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs
Acts, 1955, 1956, and 1958.
A committee, set up by the President of the Board of Trade in 1959 to consider
and report whether changes in the law and other measures were desirable for the
further protection of the consumer, presented its report in July 1962 (the Molony
Report). It recommends the setting up of a Consumer Council, wholly supported by
public funds, which would act as an authoritative spokesman for the consumer. It also
recommends, inter alia, that additional support be given to Citizens’ Advice Bureaux
(see p. 136); that the protection at present afforded to those making hire-purchase
transactions be extended; and that the Merchandise Marks Acts should be consolidated
and amended.
In March i960 the President of the Board of Trade set up a confidential fact¬
finding inquiry into the extent and effects of individual resale price maintenance
(see p. 274).
A prospective purchaser of a second-hand car can obtain guidance as to whether
the car he proposes to buy is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement. Virtually every
hire-purchase agreement on a car is registered with H.P. Information Ltd., a non-
profit-making company whose members are car dealers or finance companies con¬
cerned with car sales, and this company will answer inquiries made through its
members, the police, solicitors, the motoring associations, or the Citizens’ Advice
Bureaux.

LABOUR
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the end of June 1962 was about
24 million, some 47 per cent of the total population, and included about 76 per cent
of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for women, 15 years to 64
years for men). About 97 per cent of the men of working age are today in or seeking
gainful work. The remaining 3 per cent consist mainly of those continuing their
education, of the severely disabled and of some persons of private means. The pro¬
portion of women of working age in or seeking gainful work is much lower, about
47 per cent, as many housewives have no wish to take employment outside the home,
or if they have, are prevented by household duties from doing so. Besides those of
normal working age, there are probably about a million older men and women still at
work. The great majority of the working population work for a wage or salary, but over
i-6 million are employers or self-employed.
The situation is markedly different in Northern Ireland, where the ratio of working
to total population is under 40 per cent, and farmers and smallholders working their
own holdings account for about an eighth of the working population. Northern Ireland,
however, has under 3 per cent of the United Kingdom population, so that the figures
for Great Britain are broadly representative of the position in the United Kingdom.
During the present century, decreases in both birth and death rates have had the
effect of increasing the proportion of persons over the age of 35 years in both the total
population and the working population (see p. 12). Changes in laws and customs have
also had an effect. The school-leaving age has been raised to 15 years. The piopoition
of those over the normal working age who are still working has declined (though the
great increase in the number of older persons has meant that the actual number who are
working has increased). The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at woik has
remained very high at all ages. Among women, on the other hand, there has been a
steady increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age groups
15 to 59, but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age and by
a decrease in the proportion of women employed above the age of 60. There has been
an increase in the employment of married women, particularly in the last twenty years.
The proportion of women at work tends to decrease with age but is at every age
much higher for single than for married women. Nearly 30 per cent of the female
labour force is under 25 years of age and about 6 per cent is over 60. Almost all single
women under 45 are in, or seeking, employment, compared with rather more than
half in their late fifties; among married women, however, the proportion occupied,
which is nearly 40 per cent for women in their early twenties, declines for the age-
groups 25 to 34 but rises again for those aged between 35 and 50. An increasing
proportion of women in the middle age groups are taking up employment (including
part-time work) and the total number of married women working is now about the
same as the number of single women working.

The total working population (including men and women in the armed forces)
rose considerably during the second world war when housewives, including mothers
of young children, manned war factories while men served in the armed forces. From
the end of the war until mid-1947 the size of the working population declined as women
left industry; then, after remaining fairly steady until mid-1949, it began to rise and
has continued to rise since except for a slight recession in 1958. It is expected to
continue to increase fairly rapidly for the next few years as the bulk of the young
people born in 1946-48, when the birth rate was high, enter employment.

and mid-1962 are shown in Table 37.

Deployment of Labour
About 40 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 4 per cent in agriculture and fisheries, even
during the harvest season. Over half of those in manufacturing are in the metal,
engineering and chemical groups of industries.
LABOUR
449
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as under¬
ground work in coal mines, which are forbidden to women. The industrial groups
in which women are chiefly employed are in the metal-using industries, in the
manufacture of textiles and clothing, in the food, drink and tobacco industries, and
in the distributive trades and professional and miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial groups is
given in Table 38.

(b) The mid-1962 figures are provisional.
The numbers given in Table 38 as working in an industry or service, include those
engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that the totals given for the
production industries are greater than the numbers on productive processes. Only
about a third of the men at work and only about a quarter of the women at work are
employed in manual occupations in mining or manufacturing industries.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
45°
The industrial and occupational distribution of the population has changed during
the twentieth century. Some short-term changes were brought about during the two
world wars and by the severe trade recession and unemployment of the inter-war
years, but the following appear to be the main long-term trends:
1. A continuance at a decreasing rate of the decline in agricultural employment
which was rapid at the end of the nineteenth century.
2. A general increase in administrative, technical and clerical employment,
including public administration, and a very large increase in the employment
of women in clerical work.
3. A decline in employment in certain of the large old-established industries,
notably coalmining, cotton textiles and shipbuilding.
4. A very large increase in employment in the metals, engineering and vehicles
group of industries and the chemicals group of industries. Employment in
these industries approximately doubled between 1931 *951 and has since
increased by a further 20 per cent. Expansion has been most marked in those
sections of the industries making relatively new types of products, e.g., cars,
aircraft, electrical and electronic apparatus and plastics. The rate of increase
in certain branches of these industries was accelerated during both world wars.
5. A decline in indoor private domestic service, in which the number of women
employed fell by about a million between 1901 and 1951.
6. A considerable increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades.
Unemployment and Labour Demand
Since the end of the second world war, unemployment in all parts of Great Britain
has been very much less than in the period between the two world wars, when the
general rate ranged between 9 and 22 per cent.
This decline in unemployment is due partly to specific measures taken by the Govern¬
ment (see pp. 260-2) but, in the main, to changes in the general economic situation.
The general demand for labour has been high, the number of unfilled vacancies on the
registers of employment exchanges often exceeding the number of registered unem¬
ployed (especially in the summer months) while the demand for certain types of skilled
craftsmen and for qualified scientists, engineers and technicians has far exceeded the
supply.
Since 1945 the unemployment rate in Great Britain (the ratio of the number of
unemployed to the total number of employees) has ranged, except for brief periods,
between 1 and 2 per cent.
The unemployment rate varies in different localities and, though high unemploy¬
ment has ceased generally to be a problem in any of the major industrial regions, there
is still relatively high unemployment in a number of districts in Scotland and Wales,
and in certain seaside resorts and isolated localities in England. Under the Local
Employment Act, i960, the Government has powers to alleviate unemployment in
those districts known as development districts (see p. 261).
Northern Ireland
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed, but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 539,000 in June
1961 (365,000 males and 174,000 females). The largest productive industries are
agriculture and textiles. Most of the agricultural work in Northern Ireland is done by
LABOUR
451
small farmers and their families without hired help. The total manpower in agriculture,
forestry and fisheries was 73,000 in mid-1961, according to the official estimates of
the Ministry' of Labour and National Insurance of the Northern Ireland Government,
and was considerably larger according to other estimates whicn include unpaid helpers,
but the number of insured employees in these industries was only about 17,000.
The textile industry, traditionally concerned with linen, employs about 60,000 people
and now makes extensive and ever increasing use of man-made fibres as well as natural
fibres. . . ,
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than m England,
Wales or Scotland. In July 1962 it was about 7-2 per cent of the insured employees
and during the last 10 years has rarely fallen below 6 per cent. The Ministry of Com¬
merce of the Northern Ireland Government has wide powers (similar to those of the
Board of Trade in development districts in Great Britain) to assist the development
and diversification of industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an attempt to
improve the situation.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the principal
functions of the Ministry of Labour since its inception in 1916. Northern Ireland has
its own legislation in these matters which embodies the main principles of the corre¬
sponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing to the much smaller area of adminis¬
tration and the less favourable employment situation, the facilities available are not
so comprehensive in their scope as is the case in Great Britain, and administrative
arrangements are in some respects on different lines. The responsible department is
the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in general
to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the services in
Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision of advice on
employment and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The Employment and
Training Act, 1948, provided a permanent legislative basis for these wider services.
The main services are provided through the country-wide network of some 900
local employment and branch employment offices, which act as employment exchanges.
Local employment committees, composed of representatives of employers, workers
and other local interests serving all areas, are attached to certain employment exchanges
as advisory bodies to secure for the department the full benefit of local knowledge and
the close co-operation of employers and workers. There is an additional service
designed to meet the needs of men and women who are qualified for professional,
administrative, managerial, senior executive and technical and scientific posts at home
and overseas and for those likely to qualify, i.e. ex-regular officers of the armed
forces and young men and women suitable for training. This service is operated in
Great Britain through the Professional and Scientific Register, held at 38 of the larger
exchanges.
General Employment Services for Adults
All the offices referred to above accept on their registers both employed and
unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary function is to introduce
suitable persons seeking employment to employers requiring employees, thus providing
an efficient service to employers and job-seekers and meeting the needs of the national
economy.
452
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The employment exchanges holding the Professional and Scientific Register are
also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations to young
men and women aged 18 years and over who have not already established themselves
in a profession or in the business world, and to older people who wish to change
their careers.
In certain densely populated areas where there are large groups of hospitals, there
are employment exchanges with officers specially trained to deal with the employment
problems of nurses, midwives and those in related occupations. There are 27 of these
offices. Outside the larger areas, nurses and their employers are dealt with at the local
employment exchange. Qualified nurses are available to give advice and conduct
interviews where necessary.
The Regular Forces Resettlement Service exists within the Ministry of Labour,
and works through the employment exchanges, helping regular officers and other
ranks returning to civilian life to find suitable employment. During the past 4J years
nearly all officers and other ranks leaving the armed forces have been satisfactorily
resettled. The Ministry of Labour arranges with local education authorities in various
parts of the country for the provision at commercial colleges of business training
courses lasting six weeks designed to meet the needs of regulars who wish to take up
a business career on leaving the forces. Four-week courses in industrial supervision
are provided to help the resettlement in civil life of regular Warrant Officers and
senior NCOs: these courses are held at the Ministry’s Staff Training College,
Letchworth. Where necessary, training for a civilian trade is available under the
vocational training scheme (see below).
In view of the increasing number of older persons in the population the Ministry
recognises the need to promote the employment of older men and women and has
carried out considerable publicity to persuade employers to consider older workers
on their merits without regard to their age; employment exchanges have instructions
to make special efforts to find employment for older persons.
Vocational Training
A special responsibility of the local employment offices is recruitment under the
vocational training scheme. In Britain the main responsibility for vocational training
for employment below professional level rests on the industries and trades directly
concerned. The main purpose of the Ministry’s scheme is to assist certain classes of
people in special need of help to fit themselves for suitable employment, but the
Ministry is also concerned in helping to overcome shortages of labour in key industries
and for this purpose training is available to a much wider range of workers. The
majority of trainees under the scheme are disabled persons but many are able-bodied
men and women seeking employment after voluntary service in the regular armed
forces, or other unemployed persons having special difficulty in resettlement (including
skilled workers whose prospects of employment in their existing trade are poor).
The training is normally provided at one of the 13 Government Training Centres
which are situated near the main industrial areas, but training under the scheme can
in some cases be arranged at technical and commercial colleges, private training schools
or employers’ establishments and, for the more severely disabled, at four residential
Training Centres run by voluntary societies.
Courses vary in length according to the trade; most last for six months. Schemes of
training for particular trades have been drawn up in consultation with representatives
of the employers and workers concerned, who in some cases also assist in the selection
of persons suitable for training. Allowances, at a higher rate than for unemployment
LABOUR
453
benefit, are paid to trainees during training to maintain them and their dependants.
About 5,000 people were trained under the scheme in 1961, and about 95 per cent ot
them were subsequently employed in the trade for which they had been trained.
Training of Apprentices
As one measure designed to encourage industry to increase its intake of apprentices
during the years 1961 to 1963, when large numbers of children are leaving schoo ,
facilities have been provided in Government Training Centres for full-time training
of apprentices in their first year. The object is a demonstration, limited in numbers,
to enable employers to see for themselves what can be achieved by systematic methods
of practical and theoretical instruction, combined with day-release for further educa¬
tion at technical colleges. The employers continue to pay the apprentices wages
during the course and are responsible for completion of the remaining years o
apprenticeship. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
sponsors the training of additional apprentices by employers in the engineering
industry, a condition being that the sponsored apprentices are available for recruitment
to new industries.
Special Training Services
The Ministry of Labour provides a service to industry through its scheme of Training
Within Industry for Supervisors. The four programmes of instruction which comprise
the TWI scheme are: job relations, the fostering of good working relationships, jo
instruction, the technique of instructing or directing staff; job methods, the steps taken
in planning the best way of doing a job; and job safety, which seeks to arouse safety
consciousness and to train supervisors to detect dangers and deal with them.
The Ministry employs a small staff of TWI officers, who both train supervisors
directly and also train firms’ representatives to enable them to present TWI courses
to supervisors in their own concerns. The Ministry is prepared to extend a measure
of these services to overseas branches of British firms. It is prepared also to tram
suitable persons to develop the scheme in their own territories The arrangements
may be made by the government of the country concerned or (where appropriate)
by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). , ti ^ u-
In addition, the Ministry’s Technical Staff College at Letchworth, Hertfordshire,
provides two-week courses in teaching methods for instructors responsible for the
training of apprentices and other workers. These courses have been developed by the
Ministry to meet its own requirements for the training of instructors engaged in
training adults in skilled occupations at Government Training Centres, and the
syllabus has been made available to employers in the United Kingdom and in overseas
C° Vocational training services at Government Training Centres, TWI courses and
courses at the Ministry’s Technical Staff College at Letchworth, are available to
trainees from overseas under approved schemes (for instance, those of the ILO or
the Colombo Plan).
Employment of Workers from Overseas
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued “ the pros¬
pective employer by the Ministry of Labour (the Ministry of Labour and National
Insurance for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment is in Northern Ireland).
454
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Over 50,000 such permits are issued each year. Of these, nearly two-fifths are for
domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other institutions and private households, and
nearly one-eighth for student employees. Employment is limited to a maximum of one
year in the first instance but may be extended on application by the employer. In
certain circumstances, permission may be given by the Home Office for foreigners who
landed as visitors or students to take employment approved by the Ministry of Labour.
Approval is subject to the same conditions and requirements as are applied to the issue
of permits to foreigners while still abroad.
Before a permit is issued, the Ministry of Labour must be satisfied that there is a
bona fide ]ob, that no suitable British or foreign worker already resident in Britain for a
long period is available, and that the wages and conditions of employment are not less
favourable than those enjoyed by British workers. These conditions are waived for
student employees who are admitted for limited periods in order to improve their
English and to gain a wider knowledge of their occupations. A foreigner permitted to
take employment in the United Kingdom may not change his employment, unless his
prospective employer has obtained prior approval from the Ministry to employ the
foreigner.
The permit system applies to individual foreigners. In addition, after the second
world war, far greater numbers were admitted under various schemes organised by
the Ministry, notably the resettlement of members of the Polish Forces who felt
themselves unable to return to post-war Poland, and the recruitment of European
volunteer workers from the displaced persons’ camps in Germany, Austria and
Denmark. More recently, the United Kingdom Government has admitted many
Hungarian refugees who fled from their country following the uprising in October
1956, and there is a current scheme whereby the Ministry assists in the bulk recruit¬
ment of Italian workers. Special arrangements are made to dispense with the need for
individual permits in these cases.
The United Kingdom, as a member of the Western European Union, participates
in the arrangements for assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain
employment in other member countries.
These controls over entry and employment used to apply only to citizens of foreign
countries. Until 1st July, 1962, all citizens of the Commonwealth had the right of
free entry to the United Kingdom. Since that date, however, Commonwealth citizens
from overseas have been subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants
Act, 1962. Except for those who were born in the United Kingdom or hold passports
issued by the United Kingdom Government, the control applies, broadly, to all
Commonwealth citizens. Such people, if they wish to come to Britain for full-time
employment, are now required to be in possession, on their arrival, of an employment
voucher issued by the Ministry of Labour. Vouchers are issued without restriction to
those who have obtained jobs with named employers, and to those who have some skill
or qualification of particular value. Subject to a numerical limit laid down from time
to time by the Government, vouchers are also issued, on the basis of ‘first come, first
served’, to other Commonwealth citizens who wish to come to Britain to seek employ¬
ment. (Commonwealth citizens who wish to work in Northern Ireland, and who are
not ‘Northern Ireland workers’1, need special Northern Ireland employment permits,
which are issued only in respect of definite jobs).
The Commonwealth Immigrants Act applies also to citizens of the Irish Republic;
but no control is imposed on persons travelling between Ireland and Britain.

The Republic of South Africa formally left the Commonwealth on 31st May, 1961.
Under the South Africa Act, 1962, South Africans who possessed British nationality
by virtue only of their citizenship of the Republic of South Africa ceased to be British
subjects and became aliens on 31st May, 1962. From that date, therefore, any South
African entering the United Kingdom for the first time for employment must be in
possession of a permit issued to the prospective employer.
Youth Employment Service
The Ministry of Labour is also responsible in Great Britain for two specialised
employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the Disablement Resettle¬
ment Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people leaving
school and young workers under 18 years of age at the start of their working life.
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Education
and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive is appointed by the
Minister of Labour, who is responsible to Parliament for the Youth Employment
Service as a whole. The Minister has appointed a National Youth Employment Council
and separate advisory committees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him.
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment Offices
established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education authorities) in
accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and
approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not in operation, the service
is operated by the local office of the Ministry of Labour.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information on
careers, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, find suitable employment
and keep contact with young workers to help them to settle down. A further function
is to help employers to fill vacancies for young people. Local youth employment
committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers and other appropriate interests,
assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the youth employment service are similar to
those in Great Britain but its organisation is different. A new unified service, for which
the Minister of Labour and National Insurance will be responsible, started with the
establishment in December 1961 of a statutory board composed of representatives
appointed by the education committees of the counties and county boroughs, and
persons appointed by the Minister to represent the governors of voluntary grammar
schools, teachers, employers, workers, the universities and colleges, youth organisations
and the Churches’ Industrial Council. There will also be local youth employment
committees, as in Great Britain. This service will gradually replace that now operated
by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance with the co-operation of the
Vocational Guidance Service of one of the education committees.
Disablement Resettlement Service
The purpose of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Acts, 1944 and 1958, on which
all the work of the Ministry of Labour for disabled persons is based, is ‘to make further
and better provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure
employment or work on their own account’, and the Disablement Resettlement Service
is designed to help disabled persons to get and keep suitable work. The service is
available to all persons over school-leaving age who are substantially handicapped as a
result of injury, disease or congenital deformity in obtaining or keeping employment.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
456
The Ministry of Labour is responsible for the administration of the service. At each
of its local offices there is a disablement resettlement officer, working under the
direction of the manager and in co-operation with other officers. Besides his contacts
with employers this officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area and visits any
patient who wishes to discuss the question of future employment. His work involves
close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary welfare agencies.
The help given by the service falls under five main headings:
1. Vocational Guidance. This is given at local offices by disablement resettlement
officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local disablement advisory committees,
hospital resettlement clinics and medical interviewing committees, and also by
vocational psychologists in the industrial rehabilitation units (see paragraph 3).
2. Placing in Ordinary Employment. Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifica¬
tions and aptitude and to medical guidance, and concentrating on what the person can
do rather than on what he cannot do, the disablement resettlement officer endeavours
to find the work most suited to each person, either immediately, or in appropriate
cases after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To some extent
this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act,
1944, namely, that all employers of 20 or more persons are required to employ a
quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except shipping, in respect of the manning
of ships) of registered disabled persons. Registration is voluntary. The number of
disabled persons registered on 16th April, 1962, was 656,402. At the same date 52,323
registered disabled were unemployed, 47,346 being considered capable of ordinary
employment. The remaining 4,977 were so severely disabled as to be classed as
unlikely to obtain ordinary employment, though in fact many so classed are found
work in open industry by careful selective placement.
3. Industrial Rehabilitation1 is provided at seventeen units run by the Ministry of
Labour. These units offer to men and women an opportunity, when their medical
treatment is completed, to adjust themselves gradually to normal working conditions
and to obtain vocational guidance based on a skilled assessment of their aptitudes.
No charge is made for attendance and maintenance allowances are paid. Courses are
individually planned and average about eight weeks. Recommendations for courses
are made in the first instance to the disablement resettlement officer at the employment
exchange, who has responsibility for placing in employment after the course.
For the blind, similar industrial rehabilitation facilities are available at two centres
conducted by voluntary organisations, with the financial assistance of the Ministry
of Labour.
4. Vocational Training. There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at
Government Training Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments.
For the more seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by
voluntary organisations with the financial assistance and technical help of the Ministry
of Labour. There are also arrangements for the training of special categories of disabled
persons such as the blind, and for providing disabled persons (including the blind),
who are of the appropriate educational standard, with grants to undertake study or
training for the purpose of qualifying for professional or comparable employment.

facilities for registered disabled persons unlikely to obtain work except under special
conditions. Its powers include the provision of special factories and workshops, hostel
accommodation and facilities for homeworkers. The directors are appointed by the
Minister of Labour; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour Vote. At the end of 1961
Remploy Ltd. operated 89 factories and employed 6,251 severely disabled men and
women, including some 160 homeworkers.
Facilities for the employment of both blind and severely disabled sighted people
are provided by local authorities and by voluntary organisations, with the financial
assistance of the Ministry of Labour. At the end of December 1961, 67 workshops for
the blind accommodated 258 blind people in training and 3)^57 employment. In
addition, some 1,100 blind people were working at home under homeworkers’ schemes.
The Ministry also helped to finance the training and employment of 1,075 severely
disabled sighted people in 45 workshops provided by local authorities or voluntary
undertakings, and 132 such people in workshops for the blind.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT,
CONDITIONS OF WORK AND LABOUR RELATIONS
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, industrial workers lacked legitimate
means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their working conditions.
The traditional methods of fixing wages had become obsolete, trade unions were
regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there was no protective legislation setting
minimum standards of safety, health and welfare in places of work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of Apprentices
Act, 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833, which created an inspec¬
torate employed and paid by the central Government to enforce its provisions. Since
that date, legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the statutory
protection for employees has been passed at an accelerating rate. The progress in
standards has owed much to the recommendations of strengthened inspectorates,
much to the example of progressive employers and much to the persistent pressure of
trade unions and disinterested reformers.
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as legal
entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had been made
acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions, who had abandoned
the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of earlier trade unions to pursue
the limited practical objectives of securing for their members better wages and im¬
proved working conditions.
After 1880 the organisation of unskilled workers became more extensive and effective
and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and political, while
employers began to form associations in an increasing number of industries. Partly
as a result of continuing antagonisms and of the changing and difficult economic
situation, much of the first thirty years of the twentieth century was marked by
widespread and prolonged strikes. Since 1932, however, the strike rate (in terms of
man-days lost) has, in most years, been very much lower, and arrangements for the
negotiation of terms of service and the peaceful settlement of disputes have become
general and are on the whole satisfactory.
This improvement in industrial relations has been achieved mainly by voluntary
action. There is, in general, no legal obligation on an employer to recognise a trade
union, or not to refuse to employ trade unionists; nor is a collective agreement with a
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
458
trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of employment, though under recent
legislation there is a procedure whereby an employer can be legally bound to observe
the terms or conditions of employment established by collective agreement in his
industry (see p. 474).
Nevertheless, in the majority of trades and industries minimum or standard wages,
normal working hours and other terms of employment are effectively settled by
collective agreements, v/hose negotiation and observance continue to depend primarily
on the strength, integrity and representative character of the signatory organisations
rather than on any legal sanction. The determination by statute of minimum wages,
holidays and holiday pay is in principle confined to those trades and industries where
the organisation of employers or workers, or both, is inadequate to negotiate collec¬
tive agreements and to ensure their observance.
On the other hand, the conditions of work of employees—their safety, health and
welfare—depend to a far greater extent on minimum standards established by statute
and enforced by official inspectorates. Voluntary action is, however, of the greatest
importance even in these matters. In some cases, additional health, safety or welfare
requirements are the subject of collective agreements, while many employers provide
higher standards on their own initiative with help and advice from Government
departments and various voluntary bodies.
Management-employee relations depend not only on terms and conditions of
employment, but on human relationships at the place of work; managements have in
recent years become increasingly concerned with improving such relationships.
PAY, HOURS AND HOLIDAYS
Minimum or standard time rates for most British manual workers, as determined
by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between 3s. qd. and 4s. qd. an hour for men
and between 2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d. for women. Actual earnings are usually higher. Higher
rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates, shift rates and overtime rates raise the level
of average earnings. The Ministry of Labour conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings
and hours of work of manual workers in manufacturing industries and in some of the
principal non-manufacturing industries in Great Britain. The survey made in October
iq6i covered about 7 million workers and showed the average hourly earnings in all
the industries covered to be as follows:

The survey does not cover agriculture, coalmining, railways, dock work, shipping,
distribution, catering or other services. In agriculture the average weekly earnings
for regular adult male workers were £11 4s. id. in the half-year April 1961 to September
1961; in coalmining, the average weekly cash earnings for men were £17 3s. 3d. plus
19s. 3d. in kind in October 1961; in the railway services average weekly earnings in
March 1961 were £14 8s. for men in the wage-earning grades, including the workshop
grades, and £7 9s. for women; average weekly earnings of dock workers registered with
the National Dock Labour Board from July to September 1961 were £15 ns. id.
Since 1947 average weekly wage rates have increased by about 101 per cent and
average weekly earnings by about 140 per cent. Most of the increase in wage rates
has been offset by a rise in the cost of living. The trends of manual workers earnings,
and of wage rates and retail prices from 1950 to 1961 are shown in the diagram
below.
Women in industry are for the most part engaged on different tasks from men
and are paid less than men on the grounds that these tasks are unskilled or semi¬
skilled. In the relatively few instances in the field of manual employment where men
and women are employed on precisely the same work and under identical conditions,
collective agreements frequently provide for equal remuneiation.
Information about the spread of earnings of manual workers, i.e. the propoition
of manual workers with weekly earnings within certain ranges, has become available
for the first time since 1938 as the result of a special inquiry made by the Ministry
of Labour as part of its survey of earnings in the second pay-week of October i960.
460
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
This survey covered establishments not only in manufacturing but also in mining
(other than coalmining), construction, gas, electricity and water supply, transport
other than rail transport, public administration, laundries and cleaners, garages and
shoe repairers. It is estimated that returns received relate to about four-fifths of the
full-time adult manual workers in manufacturing and probably to about two-thirds in
the other industries surveyed. Corresponding figures for coalminers, dock and agri¬
cultural workers have been compiled by the National Coal Board, the National Dock
Labour Board and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
In all the industries surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, 3-6 per cent of the men
earned less than £9 and 42 per cent earned £15 or over; in manufacturing industries
alone, 3-1 per cent earned less than £9, and 48 per cent ^15 or over; in the non¬
manufacturing industries covered, 4-8 per cent earned less than £9 and 28 per cent
.£15 or more. In coalmining no full-time workers underground earned less than £10
and no surface workers less than £9. Nearly two-thirds of the underground workers
earned £ 15 or more, but only just over a quarter of the surface workers earned £ 15 or
more, while about the same proportion earned less than £10. A few dock workers
(2-3 per cent) earned less than £9 while 65-5 per cent earned £15 or more and 19-5 per
cent earned £23 or more.
It must be stressed, however, that in all these cases the distribution of earnings is
that for a single week. Particularly in dock work, but also in coalmining and in a number
of manufacturing occupations, there are sharp variations in piecework earnings from
week to week, so that it is probable that relatively few manual workers maintain over a
long period the high level of earnings which a substantial proportion attain each week.
There are no similarly detailed and comprehensive figures for the rates of pay
and earnings of non-manual workers, as these are often based on individual contracts,
except in the public service, teaching and retail distribution. The evidence suggests
that the majority of male non-manual workers—the clerks and shop assistants—have
average earnings little different in range from those of manual workers, but the
earnings of women in these occupations are somewhat higher than in manual occupa¬
tions. According to a Ministry of Labour survey of the earnings of administrative,
technical and clerical employees in manufacturing and certain other industries in
October 1961, the average earnings of male salaried employees in manufacturing
were £109 os. nd. a month for those paid monthly and £15 14s. 4d. for those paid
weekly. For all industries covered the corresponding figures for males were £106 12s. lod.
and £15 9s. 1 id. respectively. For females working full-time, average earnings in
manufacturing were £46 3s. a month for the monthly paid and £7 15s. 2d. a week for
the weekly paid; and in all industries covered, £46 9s. nd. a month and £7 17s. a
week respectively. The pay of shop assistants is on scales prescribing weekly minima
from about £7 8s. 6d. to £10 4s. for men and £5 4s. 6d. to £7 7s. 6d. for women.
The Office Management Association makes periodic surveys of clerical salaries. The
latest survey, of March i960, covered 1,112 establishments, employing 87,011 clerks,
and showed that the average weekly salaries for young inexperienced clerks ranged
mainly from 76s. to 120s. for youths and from 66s. to 101s. for girls, while average
salaries for adult male clerks ranged from £9 12s. for the lowest grade of skill and
responsibility (normally filled by juniors) to from £12 6s. to £16 19s. for the three
highest grades. Corresponding women’s salaries were 25 to 30 per cent less.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in the
range of £500 to £700 a year, though they may be lower for trainees starting work in
their teens, and higher for some graduates entering industry and the Civil Service.
Such posts offer incremental progression to higher salaries and opportunities for
LABOUR
461
promotion. According to an investigation carried out by the Central Office of Informa¬
tion Social Survey in 1955-56 (but referring to the previous year) and published in
the report of the Royal Commission on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration, the
average (median) annual remuneration of qualified people ranged from £1,600 to
£2,000 in the leading professions. It is probably now from 15 to 30 per cent more.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service are in
the range of £1,700 to £7,000 a year. The posts with salaries of £5,000 to £12,000
a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, most chairmen and full-time members of
boards of nationalised industries, judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal,
and Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretaries of Government departments, the
clerks of the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers, some persons
outstanding in their professions and in the higher managerial posts in industry,
commerce and banking. A few persons in business draw still higher salaries, while the
earnings of star entertainers and certain other very successful people exceed £25,000
a year. .
Regarding the incidence of such salaries, it may be noted that in 1959-60 only
12 per cent of all male employees and i-8 per cent of female employees earned £1,000
or more a year. Only about i-i per cent of all employees were earning over £2,000
a year, while only about 0-4 per cent earned over £3,000 and about o-i per cent
over £5,000. ...
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices, administrative
posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for doing the same work in
medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, radiography, university teaching, journalism,
broadcasting and architecture, and as Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament,
salaried magistrates and solicitors, pharmacists working in hospitals, and administra¬
tive, professional and technical workers in local government. Women in independent
professions are not expected to charge lower fees than men. In many other non-manual
occupations, however, a woman in Britain doing the same job as a man is still paid
less for doing it, although the position has been changing.
The principle of equal pay for male and female salaried staff began to be implemented
in 1955 iu the public service, including national and local government service, the
national health service, the nationalised industries, and teachers in maintained and
assisted schools. Progressive increases in women’s salaries resulted in most cases in
men’s and women’s salary scales being assimilated by 1961. Women’s salaries outside
the public service are being similarly adjusted in some cases.
HOURS OF WORK
National legislation in the United Kingdom embodies a general prohibition of
employment of children under thirteen years of age; forbids the employment of older
children and women in certain occupations; and limits and defines permissible hours
of work for women and young persons in a number of industries or trades. Children
aged thirteen to fifteen may not be employed during school hours or before 6 a.m. or
after 8 p.m. on any day, or for more than two hours on school days or on Sundays.
This part-time employment is regulated in various ways by statute and by by-laws
made by local authorities.
The Shops Act, 1950, makes local authorities responsible for ensuring that the shops
in their area observe its requirements. With certain exceptions, shops must be closed
on weekdays by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. on one late day) except on the early closing day when
they must be closed by 1 p.m., and all day on Sunday; but local authorities may make
462
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
orders modifying these and other provisions of the Act within their own area. The
hours of work of shop employees under sixteen years of age are normally restricted to
44 a week, and those of employees between sixteen and eighteen years of age to 48 a
week, with limited provision for overtime. Broadly speaking, all shop assistants must
be given a half-holiday (half a day) every week and, in addition, every Sunday off or
another day off instead.
In premises under the Factories Act the working hours of women and young
persons between the ages of sixteen and eighteen are generally limited to 48 a week
and nine a day, although some overtime is allowed (up to six hours a week but not
more than 100 hours a year or in more than 25 weeks in a year). Young persons under
sixteen years of age are limited to 44 hours a week. Adequate intervals for meals must
be arranged for women and young persons and the employment of women and young
girls at night is, in general, prohibited.
In mines and quarries, women and young persons under eighteen may not normally
start work before 6 a.m. and must never start before 5 a.m. Their work must normally
end before 9 p.m., in the case of young persons under sixteen, and before 10 p.m., in
the case of women and young persons aged sixteen to eighteen; and never in any case
after 11 p.m.
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, imposes restrictions on the hours
of work of young persons (48 a week at the age of sixteen years and over and 44 for
those under sixteen years) in certain occupations not covered by the Factories Act,
the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, or the Shops Act, 1950.
While the hours of work of adult men are not, in general, restricted by statute,
normal hours of work for both sexes and those of all ages are usually well within the
legal limits on the hours of women and young persons. Agreed weekly hours, in
which substantial reductions have been negotiated in many cases within the past
two years, are mainly 42 to 44, and may be worked as either a five-day or a five-
and-a-half-day week according to the industry and the rule of the particular establish¬
ment. Hours actually worked by men are somewhat longer owing to overtime working.
The survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour in October 1961 into earnings and
hours of manual workers showed that average weekly hours actually worked were as
follows:
Men   47-4 hours
Youths and boys .. .. .. .. .. .. 43-6 hours
Women: full-time   39-7 hours
part-time   21-8 hours
Girls   40-6 hours
Holidays with Pay
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in industries
covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays of twelve
days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or statutory public holidays,
which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday and Christmas Day, there are Bank
Holidays in England, Wales, and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, Whit-
Monday, the first Monday in August and the first weekday after Christmas (Boxing
Day), and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, the first Monday in May, and the first
Monday in August. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and, in addition,
has a Bank Holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and a statutory public holiday
on 12th July (commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); Easter Tuesday is also
LABOUR 4^3
a customary holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide that payments
should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
In some industries there are also agreements on extended holidays related to length
of service. In addition, numerous firms have long-service extended holiday schemes
which apply to both staff and manual workers.
SAFETY
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their employees
and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of care towards
each other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety in certain kinds of
workplace or work are laid down under a number of statutes, some of which also deal
with health and welfare. The statutes include: the Factories Act, 1961 (which con¬
solidates earlier Acts); the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954; the Shops Act, 1950; and
the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956.
Fatal and serious industrial accidents have tended to diminish during the twen¬
tieth century, and the rates for fatal and serious accidents are among the lowest in the
world. There were, however, disturbing increases during 1959 and i960 but the
upward trend of accidents on industrial premises was checked in 1961.
Factories and Industrial Premises
Over 200,000 industrial premises (factories, workshops, slaughter-houses, shipyards,
docks and warehouses) and about 25,000 building and civil engineering sites come
under the Factories Act, which is administered by the Ministry of Labour and
enforced by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories, which forms part of the Ministry. The
total strength of the Factory Inspectorate, including medical and other specialists,
was 426 in December 1961 and its authorised strength is 480.
Under the Act any person intending to use premises as a factory has to notify H.M.
District Inspector of Factories of his intention not less than one month before he
begins to occupy them and every fatal accident and every accident causing more than
three days’ incapacity must be reported to the factory inspectors; provision is also
made for compulsory notification and for investigation of certain dangerous occurrences
and, in addition, a number of general and specific safety requirements are laid down.
The general requirements include provisions concerning the fencing of prime
movers, transmission machinery and dangerous parts of other machinery; the sale,
hire or use of power-driven machinery without effective guards of certain parts; the
cleaning of machinery in motion; the training and supervision of young persons
employed at certain machines; the examination of hoists and lifting equipment, steam
boilers and steam and air receivers; the construction of floors; precautions against
falls, against gassing, and against explosions of flammable dust or gas; fire prevention,
fire-fighting, fire alarms and means of escape in case of fire; the protection of the eyes;
precautions where dangerous substances are present; and the lifting of heavy weights.
These general requirements are supplemented or modified by regulations providing
for safeguards against special risks in particular industries, processes, and types of
machinery.
Safety depends in fact at least as much on the education and voluntary efforts of
the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations. In addition to regulatory
functions, the Minister of Labour since 1959 has had the duty of promoting safety,
health and welfare by the collection and dissemination of information and by investi¬
gating safety, health and welfare problems—activities which had, in fact, long been an
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
464
important part of the Ministry’s work. The Accident Prevention Movement, a volun¬
tary educational campaign, is strongly supported by the Factory Inspectorate. Inspectors
inquire into safety aspects of machine design and specification, circulate expert
advice by personal exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appointment
of safety officers and the formation of works safety committees.
The concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with safety helps
to maintain safety standards, and the requirements about accident notification help
inspectors to examine the means of prevention with employers, machinery manu¬
facturers and interested organisations. But the voluntary co-operation of managements
and employees in individual workplaces is essential to the safety drive.
Many firms have works safety committees and, in many areas, safety groups have
been organised, whose members meet monthly for the exchange of information,
discussion, lectures and films on safety measures.
Training for safety is an important facet of the safety drive and, to help in this
work, the Ministry of Labour has recently incorporated a safety course in the Training
Within Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme (see p. 453). An industrial health and
safety centre in London is also maintained by the Ministry. An industrial safety
training centre in Birmingham is run by the Birmingham and District Industrial
Safety Group, and training centres for building and civil engineering foremen have
recently been set up, with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour, by the local
accident prevention groups at Enfield (London), Aintree (Liverpool) and Granton
(Edinburgh) and the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors at Cardiff. The
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents helps the Accident Prevention Move¬
ment by providing publicity and by organising conferences and courses for safety
officers.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing extent
with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information and advisory
services to their members. They participate also in joint standing and advisory com¬
mittees appointed by the Minister of Labour. Representatives of the Trades Union
Congress, the British Employers’ Confederation, the nationalised industries and the
Ministry of Labour meet on the Industrial Safety Sub-Committee of the National
Joint Advisory Council. The Minister of Labour has established a joint advisory
committee, representative of employers and workers in the building and civil engin¬
eering industries, to examine safety and health problems in these industries.
Mines and Quarries
The safety of workers in mines and quarries is the subject of comprehensive
legislation which also deals with health and welfare at work and a number of related
matters. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of 1842, which forbade
the employment of women underground; successive measures laid down detailed
requirements for the safe conduct of operations and dealt with such matters as
ventilation, dust suppression, support of workings, the safe use of electricity, rescue
and first aid. The latest stage was reached when the Mines and Quarries Act was
passed in 1954. This Act established the basic modern principles of safety, health
and welfare, leaving the details to be dealt with in statutory regulations; it both
consolidates the previous law and brings it up to date. Apart from technical matters,
it also covers such subjects as the general responsibilities of owners and managements,
the appointment and duties of officials, training, welfare, the powers of official
inspectors, statutory qualifications of managers and under-managers, employment of
women and young persons, and inspections on behalf of workmen.
LABOUR
465
The Ministry of Power is responsible for the administration of these enactments,
while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of the Ministry of Power,
is responsible for their enforcement.
The National Coal Board is expressly charged with the statutory duty of securing
the safety, health and welfare of its employees and has set itself to accomplish this in
all practicable ways. The Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing Com¬
mittee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at divisions, areas and
the largest collieries. It conducts courses of safety training for workmen and officials
and is constantly on the alert for new methods of reducing risks. Its research programme
includes a number of projects with a direct bearing on safety. Examples of voluntary
action by the Board to reduce risks include the use of fire-resistant conveyor belting,
and the withdrawal of light alloy equipment from the coal face pending the develop¬
ment of an alloy unlikely to cause dangerous sparks.
The Ministry of Power maintains a Safety in Mines Research Establishment, with
stations at Buxton and Sheffield, which carry out research into safety problems in
co-operation with the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate and the National Coal Board’s
research organisation.
Agriculture
Two Acts provide for the protection of agricultural workers by means of regulations
made by the Ministers concerned with agriculture in Britain. The risks involved in the
use of chemicals are dealt with in the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act, 1952;
other risks are covered by the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions)
Act, 1956. Regulations have been made dealing with the safe use of dangerous
chemicals, the provision of first-aid equipment, safety standards for workplaces and
ladders, the safeguarding and safe operation of farm machinery, the lifting of heavy
weights and the avoidance of accidents to children arising out of the use of farm
vehicles and machines. Regulations are enforced by inspectors of the Agricultural
Departments. To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by
the use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is operated
by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and with the full co-opera¬
tion of the chemical industry.
Transport
The general safety legislation covering the main forms of transport protects transport
workers as well as members of the public against accidents involving moving vehicles.
The Minister of Transport is responsible for the administration of the Merchant
Shipping Acts, which cover in great detail the question of marine safety, including
navigational procedures, the strength and design of hulls, the safety of machinery, the
safety and design of living quarters, life-saving appliances, measures for protection
against fire, and the carriage of special cargoes and dangerous goods.
The Air Navigation Order and Regulations provide for the registration of aircraft
and for the issue of certificates of airworthiness and of competency certificates and
licences for aircrew, lay down requirements for safety equipment and for safety
procedures during take-off, flight and landing, and prescribe maintenance schedules
for public transport aircraft. The Minister of Aviation delegates most of his powers in
respect of airworthiness to the Air Registration Board (see p. 389).
The Minister of Transport exercises technical supervision of the safety aspects of
railway construction and operation through an inspectorate, whose main functions are
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
466
statutory approval of new works on railways carrying passenger traffic; accident investi¬
gation, including the holding of formal inquiries; and technical advice to the Minister.
In the interests of road safety, the hours of driving and the rest periods of drivers
of buses and goods vehicles are regulated by the Road Traffic Acts. In certain cases,
the driver must be accompanied by a second person.
In addition to general safety legislation, there are certain statutory provisions
concerned entirely, or mainly, with the safety of employees; for example, railway
employees are protected by the Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act,
1900, and the statutory rules and orders made under it which enable the Ministry of
Transport to require the use of safe plant and appliances, to forbid what is unsafe,
and to make rules for safe railway operation. This Act also sanctioned the employment
of inspectors, now known as Railway Employment Inspectors, who inquire into the
more serious accidents to railway employees.
Both transport operators and the Ministries of Transport and of Aviation give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every endeavour is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities, by improving
the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment, by traffic regulation and control
of standards of maintenance and by training crews in competency and safety awareness.
The detailed regulations and instructions issued by the ministries and their agents
form the basis of elaborate safety procedures laid down by the operators themselves
and by the makers of vehicles and aircraft, equipment and works. The radio industry
and the transport services co-operate in the development and application of radar
systems and other safety devices (see p. 390).
Other Work Premises
There are at present (September 1962) no specific statutory safety requirements in
offices, shops, hotels and restaurants, places of entertainment or educational establish¬
ments apart from the fire regulations applicable under local authority by-laws to all
large buildings. The employers, however, are bound by their common law obligation
to provide a safe system of work, and employers and educational authorities may
voluntarily seek the advice of the Factory Inspectorate if they have occasion to install
power-driven machinery or deal with any other special risk.
Under the Offices Act, i960, whose provisions were due to come into force on
1 st January, 1962, the Secretary of State for the Home Department is empowered
to make regulations specifying the standards to be applied in offices to protect the
safety, health and welfare of the employees. The Home Secretary, however, is not
exercising his powers and the Government has announced its intention of introducing
shortly more comprehensive legislation to supersede this Act.
HEALTH AND WELFARE
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work and
to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances
the abatement of which can be enforced. They are also responsible under the Shops
Act, 1950, for seeing that shops in their area observe the requirements of the Act, which
include, besides a number of provisions relating to closing hours and to hours of work
of young employees (see p. 461), maintenance of reasonable minimum standards of
ventilation, temperature, lighting, sanitary accommodation and washing facilities.
LABOUR
467
Factories and other industrial premises must comply with the health and welfare
requirements of the Factories Act. These include: with regard to health the cleanli¬
ness of workrooms, adequate ventilation and suitable temperature and lighting, the
avoidance of overcrowding and the provision of sanitary accommodation, and the
protection of workers against inhaling harmful dust or fumes; with regard to welfare,
the provision of washing facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor
clothing, drinking water, first aid, and adequate seating arrangements. All young
persons under eighteen years of age must, on entry into employment in factories and
docks, or on building operations, be medically examined by doctors appointed by the
Chief Inspector of Factories and known as Appointed Factory Doctors, and they must
be re-examined annually until they reach the age of eighteen. Boys employed in
certain jobs involving night work are examined more frequently.
The general requirements of the Factories Act in regard to health and welfare are
supplemented by regulations, some of general application, others providing for the
needs of particular industries or processes. They may include provision for compulsory
periodic medical examinations. . , ,
The far-reaching and detailed requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts and the
regulations made thereunder include specific provisions for the protection of merchant
seamen, covering such matters as the engagement and discharge of seamen, limitations
on the employment of young persons at sea, standards of crew accommodation, scales
of provisions, medicines and medical stores, and the care and repatriation of seamen
left behind at ports abroad.
The laws restricting the employment of children, young persons and women form
an important part of legislation to protect the health and welfare of employees.
National legislation, besides forbidding any employment of children under thirteen
years of age, forbids the employment of children under fifteen years of age in any indus¬
trial undertaking; of women and young persons under sixteen years of age underground
in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for example, those involving
work with lead compounds); and of women in factories and workshops within one
month of childbirth. It also limits and defines the permissible hours for children aged
thirteen to fifteen and for young persons under eighteen and women in a number of
industries and occupations. Local authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the
Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, as well as by the Education Acts 1944 48,
which regulate hours and conditions of employment of children under fifteen years
within their areas within the limits of national legislation. .
The above are the main legislative provisions relating to health and welfare at wor ,
but it is essential to note that employers frequently achieve health and welfare
standards considerably higher than those prescribed by law. They are helped to do
this by the inspectorates, by Government departments and agencies, by employers
associations and trade unions and by expert voluntary bodies.
An increasing number of firms in Britain provide a canteen with hot meals pay
part or all of the cost of clubs and sports grounds, operate retirement and sickness
insurance schemes supplementing the State insurance schemes, and afford training
and educational facilities. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support
convalescent homes.
Industrial Health Services
In addition to the statutory requirements of the Factories Act, 1961, and Regulations,
a number of employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees. It is
estimated that there are about 400 full-time and 4,000 part-time doctors employed in
468
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
factories, together with several thousand nurses and assistant nurses. There are also the
2,200 Appointed Factory Doctors who carry out the compulsory medical examinations
under the Acts and Regulations.
The big employers, including the State and the boards of nationalised industries,
have naturally taken the lead in this expansion. A number of smaller factories also
provide medical services and in some cases (for instance, in Slough and Harlow) have
joined together in group medical schemes. There are, however, difficult problems to
be solved in connection with the further development of industrial health services, and
in 1955 the Minister of Labour appointed a Standing Industrial Health Advisory
Committee, of which he is the chairman, to advise him on this subject. The membership
of this committee includes persons nominated by the British Employers’ Confederation,
the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries, the British Medical Associa¬
tion, the Royal College of Nursing and other organisations and bodies closely concerned
with the promotion of industrial health. In connection with its consideration of the
possibilities of developing and extending medical supervision in factories, the com¬
mittee has advised on the conduct of two pilot surveys, one in the town of Halifax and
one of the pottery industry in Stoke on Trent, and has approved the issue of a booklet,
Health at Work, describing fourteen individual medical schemes in factories in different
parts of Great Britain.
Industrial hygiene services can give valuable assistance in securing healthy working
conditions in industry; there are at present three centres in Great Britain which
undertake studies of factory conditions. They are staffed and equipped to make
comprehensive investigations of particular problems or health risks and also carry
out routine physical, chemical and biological tests for industry.
Prompt and effective action in industrial health depends, among other things, on
adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation and research.
Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate, which has specialised
medical and technical branches. Research facilities are provided by Government
agencies such as the Medical Research Council and the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research; by the faculties of industrial health and social medicine of the
universities; and by the research departments of various industries and large industrial
concerns.
Welfare
Welfare standards vary considerably from one factory to another. The amenities
provided by large factories depend partly on the employees’ needs and desires.
The requirements of a factory where the work is light, and where many employees are
women or young persons, are different from those of an iron foundry or steelworks,
where much of the work is arduous and is undertaken by men. Progressive firms are
careful to find out what their employees want, and welfare policy is often decided in
consultation with the workers, through regular consultative machinery or by other
means. The National Coal Board, for example, has provided pithead baths and
canteens, while other social welfare of coalminers and their families has been, since
1952, the responsibility of the Coal Industry Welfare Organisation, which is controlled
by the Board and the miners’ trade unions.
During and since the second world war, the provision of meals for workers at their
place of work has become usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller
ones. There are also colliery canteens providing meals for about 98 per cent of coal¬
miners. It is customary for any surplus earned by canteens to be used to improve the
canteen or to finance some other welfare services, while any losses are borne by the firms.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in Great Britain
and is embodied in separate statutes to meet the special requirements of Noithern
Ireland. Provision for the safety, health and welfare of workers in factories with and
without power, shipyards, electrical stations, certain institutions and at docks, ware¬
houses, building operations and civil engineering works is embodied in the Northern
Ireland Factories Acts. Many firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial
Safety Group for the area, supported by representatives of industry, trade unions,
insurance companies and public authorities, is very active and makes a valuable
contribution in the field of industrial accident prevention on similar lines to what is
done in Great Britain.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’ asso¬
ciations and trade unions. These organisations1 discuss and negotiate terms and con¬
ditions of employment and other matters affecting the workpeople at their work.
In some industries these negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings,
which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary joint machinery has been
established on a permanent basis. Normally these arrangements for collective bargaining
suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is often made for matters
not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain
trades where wages cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary agreement owing to
the inadequate organisation of employers or workers, provision has also been made b}
the State for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Act, i959> Agricultural
Wages Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act, 1949.
Employers’ Associations
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations, which are
wholly are partly concerned with labour questions.
The primary aims of such employers’ associations are to help to establish suitable
terms and conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper
standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees
and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which
may arise. Different associations vary in the emphasis which they put upon these
different aims and in the means by which they try to achieve them. Some concentrate
on defensive action, trying by negotiation and representations to modify proposals of
trade unions and Government in their members’ interests. Others also try to give their
members practical help and advice in developing positive employment policies. A
number of them, for example, have developed training schemes for their industries
and some provide advisory services on recruitment, training and further education
and general or specialised training courses.
There is diversity in regard to structure as well as function. Generally, however,
employers’ associations are organised on an industry basis rather than a product basis.
Some associations are purely local in character and deal with a section of an industry,
1 Some employers, including the central Government and the public corporations operating
the nationalised industries, negotiate directly with the trade unions representing their different
types of employees.
470
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of a particular industry.
In some of the chief industries there are local or regional organisations combined into
national federations, while in others, within which different firms are engaged on
making different principal products, there is a very complex structure with national
and regional federations for these different sections of the industry as well as for the
industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 1,500 employers’ associations dealing
with labour matters and about 80 of them are national federations.
The final authority of a local or small national association may be a meeting, where
all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations some form of
indirect representation is necessary, either through local associations or through the
regions or sections into which these associations are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders, form a
general council, central committee or general committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to take major policy decisions, to elect committees and to ratify their
work. The committees usually include a general purposes committee and a negotiating
committee. A small paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the day-to-day
work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group, consisting of senior
officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent questions and
co-ordinate the work of the committees.
The British Employers' Confederation
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers’ Confederation,
which was set up in 1919 and was at first called the National Confederation of
Employers’ Organisations. Its membership now comprises some 52 separate auto¬
nomous organisations in industries employing about 70 per cent of the persons engaged
in private enterprise industries and services in the country. The boards of nationalised
industries are not in membership. The confederation’s business is managed by a
council which meets under the chairmanship of the President and on which every
member organisation is represented.
The confederation deals with matters affecting the interests of organised employers
and their relations with their employees and is recognised by the Government as a
channel for consultation between Government departments and representatives of
private employers as a whole on such matters. It acts as an advisory and consultative
body for its member organisations, providing them with information and statistics,
ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, for instance, on the International Labour
Organisation. Its representatives sit on various councils and committees advisory to
the Government, on other statutory bodies, and on a number of voluntary bodies.
Trade Unions
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up gradually
and independently over a great many years, and consequently their form and organi¬
sation vary considerably. Trade unions started more than two hundred years ago
among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and unskilled
classes. More recently trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory,
technical and administrative workers. A number of associations of professional
workers, formed primarily for the preservation and improvement of professional
standards, have also come to exercise many of the functions of trade unions, including
negotiations on salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.

LABOUR
471
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational, e.g., they may
recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed, while in others the qualification is industrial,
i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an industry, whatever their occupation. In a
number of unions recruitment is based on a combination of these principles. A few
large unions recruit members in a number of different occupations and industries.
At the end of i960 the total membership of British trade unions was about 9,803,000.
There were 650 trade unions, but about two-thirds of all trade unionists were in the
17 largest unions.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local branch
(called a lodge in some trade unions). Every member of the union belongs to a branch
or lodge. He may attend its meetings, put forward suggestions about terms and con¬
ditions of employment, discuss the work and policy of the union, and take part in
the election of branch officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered
to be entirely, or mainly, of local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national
or regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of work
to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on agreed or customary
conditions of work, and in some cases to act as representatives of members at their
place of work for the settlement of grievances. In a few trade unions, mainly in the
printing and allied trades, organisation is based primarily on the place of work.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines: elected
officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist staff, are in
charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a national executive council
or committee which may be part-time or full-time, and which is usually elected by,
and responsible to, annual or biennial conferences of delegates from the branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government of the
unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry out policy
decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some regional, district or area organisation, while in large
unions there are usually regional, district or area committees or councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations whose
main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade unions in an industry
in negotiations with employers. The scope and authority of these federations and
confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
Most trade unions of any size and importance are affiliated to the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), the national centre of the British trade union movement. The main
exceptions are the National and Local Government Officers Association (NALGO),
the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and certain Civil Service staff associations.
The TUC’s objects are to promote the interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises
183 organisations, of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate unions;
approximately 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These represent over
8 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions which concern trade
unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on questions relating
to particular trades or industries at the request of the trade union concerned.
The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a week
every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and to employees
generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents it during the remain¬
ing 51 weeks of the year. The General Council is responsible for carrying out congress
decisions, for watching economic and social developments, and for providing
Q
472
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
educational and advisory services. It is also empowered in certain circumstances to
mediate in inter-union disputes.
The TUC and a number of affiliated unions have in recent years substantially
developed their educational services to members. At the training college in TUC
headquarters, Congress House, London, one-week and two-week courses are provided
for about 700 students each year in general trade union subjects, production and
management subjects, industrial relations, collective bargaining, and social insurance
and industrial welfare. The TUC Educational Trust also provides summer schools,
regional week-end schools, and special week-end schools for women and for young
workers.
Certain unions organise one-week and other short residential courses, and these
and other unions provide week-end schools, for the education and training of officers
and members in the principles and practice of trade unionism. More than 80 unions
arrange education schemes either with the National Council of Labour Colleges or with
the Workers’ Educational Association, or with both these organisations. Scholarships
for longer-term studies (usually one academic year) at Ruskin College, Oxford, other
adult residential colleges, or the London School of Economics, are offered by the
TUC Educational Trust and by certain unions.
The Trades Union Congress has been critically examining trade union educational
facilities and in 1961 approved proposals that will begin to be applied in 1963 and are
designed to lead eventually to the disbanding of the National Council of Labour
Colleges and the Workers’ Educational Trade Union Committee (but not the Workers’
Educational Association itself) and their replacement by a co-ordinated educational
scheme financed mainly out of increased affiliation fees to the TUC.
The TUC is recognised by the Government as the channel of consultation between
the Government departments and representatives of organised workers on matters
affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade unions
may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
The TUC is a non-political body, but individual trade unions can, by a ballot
vote of members, decide to set up a political fund, financed by a separate levy, which
any member can refuse to pay without loss of his normal trade union rights and
benefits. About 80 separate trade union organisations, including most of the largest
trade unions, have such a fund and, in almost every case, it is used to support the
Labour Party (or the Co-operative Party, which is associated with the Labour Party
and has substantially the same platform).
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local trades
council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common interest and
as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year. There are more than
500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together in 22 federations.
Voluntary Joint Negotiating Machinery
At National Level While in some industries all matters affecting terms and conditions
of employment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers organisations
and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard procedures for
dealing with such matters by joint discussion at national level. In many industries
there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of representatives of both sides of the
industry with, in some cases, an independent chairman. There are about 200 of these
bodies, most of which are called Joint Industrial Councils. Their functions vary
considerably, some being simply negotiating bodies, while others deal with a wide
LABOUR
473
range of subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned. Provision is some¬
times made in their constitution that a dispute on which it is not found possible to
reach agreement should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by
independent persons, including the means provided under the Conciliation Act, 1896,
or the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions are not
civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are not, therefore,
in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms and conditions is based
mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual respect and vigilance of trade
unions and employers’ associations, but can be secured in particular instances through
reference to the Industrial Court (see p. 474).
At District and Factory Level. Arrangements for negotiation and joint consultation
also exist at district and factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed
either between the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or
through regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar
bodies and Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at a national
level may be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have no power to alter
the terms of such national agreements. They also discuss new problems which may
arise, and if no solution can be found at factory or district level, refer them to the
national body. In many of the larger industries national agreements recommend such
consultation, and in some they even prescribe model rules for its conduct.
Statutory Wage-Regulating Machinery
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organisation among employers
and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist for the effective settle¬
ment of terms and conditions of employment or are inadequate to secure their obser¬
vance by voluntary methods throughout the industry, statutory bodies known as Wages
Councils and Agricultural Wages Boards have been set up. These are composed of
equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in the respective industries,
with the addition of certain independent members. Wages Councils may submit
proposals for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Minister
of Labour, who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals,
subject only to his right to return them as a whole to the council for further
consideration.
Orders relating to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate Agri¬
cultural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such orders are effective
only in the county agricultural wages committee area in respect of which they have
been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable in England and Wales and
also one for Scotland.
State Provision for Conciliation, Arbitration and Investigation
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred by
agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which the parties
can tind such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of Labour. Under
authority derived from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and the Industrial Courts Act, 1919,
the Minister has certain powers to assist industry to settle disputes which it is not
found possible to resolve through an industry’s own machinery and procedure. These
powers are all intended to supplement and not to supersede the industry’s own
machinery. There is no legal obligation on the parties to a dispute to notify the dispute
to the Minister, nor to place the question before a conciliator.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
474
To assist conciliation in industry, a staff of conciliation officers long formed part
of the Ministry of Labour. The duties of these officers were to keep in touch with the
course of relations between employers and workers at national, district, and, in some
cases, factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to settle their problems by joint
discussion and negotiation. Conciliators have no legal powers. In i960 this service and
the Ministry’s personnel management advisory service (see p. 477) were merged to
form an integrated industrial relations service.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both parties,
be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or an ad hoc Board
of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent tribunal established under the
Industrial Courts Act. The court normally consists of three members—the president,
one member experienced in representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves enforceable
at law, but, under the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act, 1959, reports that a
particular employer is not observing the recognised (i.e. agreed or awarded) terms
or conditions of employment in his trade or industry may be made to the Minister
of Labour by organisations which are parties to the agreement or award. If the matter
is not otherwise settled, the Minister must refer it to the Industrial Court which, after
hearing the case, may issue an award requiring the employer to observe the recognised
terms or conditions. Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of
employment. This procedure, established under the 1959 Act, replaced an earlier one
of similar intention and effect.
The Minister of Labour is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or Com¬
mittee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended. These proce¬
dures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the facts of a dispute and
are not means of arbitration. The report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before
Parliament. Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies
are not binding on the parties, they often provide the basis for further negotiations
which lead to a settlement.
Strikes and Lockouts
In general, the arrangements for negotiation and conciliation of disputes are
effective in making resort to direct action unnecessary. For example, in the twelve
months ending in December 1961 about 180 important claims for increased wages or
shorter hours, covering almost every industry, were settled peacefully, while less than
10 claims resulted in disputes which gave rise to stoppages of work.
The amount of working time lost in strikes and lockouts has been much less in the
past three decades than formerly. The average time lost per year in Great Britain from
I933 1961 inclusive has been 2*8 million man-days (or about one-eighth of a day per
employee per year), compared with an average of 21 million man-days in the 23 years
1910 to 1932. It must be noted, however, that the reduction has been in the size and
duration of strikes and not in their number; also that in the last six years the number
of man-days lost has been appreciably higher than in the previous 22, and that the
figures do not include employees laid off at establishments not on strike. The great
majority of the stoppages in recent years have been in breach of the constitutional
procedures in the industry and have been ‘unofficial in the sense that they have not
been supported by the national executives of the unions concerned. Over half the
total time lost as a result of stoppages in i960 and 1961 was lost in four industries
(coalmining, docks, motor manufacture and shipbuilding) which employ only 7 per cent
of the working population. The time lost through stoppages is, however, still low,
LABOUR
475
when every allowance has been made. For 1961 it worked out at a little over three
hours per year per worker in the productive and transport industries (in which most
of the stoppages occur), which is insignificant when compared with the average of
13 days per employee lost through sickness and accidents. The record also compares
favourably with that of many other major industrial countries.
Liaison between the Government and Industry
The Government is in contact with representatives of employers and workers at
all levels on matters affecting their common interests. At local and district level the
industrial relations officers of the Ministry of Labour keep in touch with the representa¬
tives of both sides of industry, while, at national level, officers of the department are
requested by many Joint Industrial Councils to attend their meetings as liaison officers.
Standing arrangements also exist for consultation between the Government, the British
Employers’ Confederation and the Trades Union Congress through the National
Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on matters
in which employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Labour. Its membership consists of representatives of
the British Employers’ Confederation and the Trades Union Congress, together with
representatives of the managements of nationalised industries. Among the subjects
which it has considered in recent years are the machinery for settling industrial
disputes, joint consultation in industry, redundancy, communications, the efficient
use of manpower, restrictive practices, the selection and training of supei visors and
the training of shop stewards.
Labour Relations of Public Authorities
While labour relations in Government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there are
some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and con¬
ditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations (trade unions)
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by means
of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils (see p. 69), corresponding to the
Joint Industrial Councils in industry. The two sides of the National Whitley Council
are parties to a Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which, subject to certain limitations,
provides that if there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or
association may report the dispute to the Minister of Labour for reference to the Civil
Service Arbitration Tribunal. The tribunal is an independent one appointed by the
Minister by virtue of his powers under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919’ Industrial
employees of the central Government, however, are organised by trades and not by
departments; negotiations regarding their wages and conditions of employment take
place on Trade Joint Councils and Departmental Joint Councils.
In local government services there are separate National Joint Councils for the
main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical employees, and road-
menders) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other matters.
There are corresponding regional and district councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to detailed
governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory arrangements for
collective bargaining in their industries and for joint consultation with their employees;
but in carrying out these duties they are free to choose the arrangements that suit them.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
476
In nearly every case a complex system which already existed before nationalisation has
been taken over and modified. The arrangements, therefore, as in industry generally,
vary substantially. The main difference from private industry is that the corporations
are not usually members of employers’ associations. In some industries they are sole or
main employers, but even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example
in air or road transport, the corporations are separately and directly represented on
wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally settled
by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade unions at the national
level; in most cases there are also regional and local bodies, similarly representative,
charged with the duty of applying these agreements and dealing with any difficulties
or differences which may arise. Most of the industries use the facilities for arbitration
offered to industry generally by the Ministry of Labour, but coalmining and rail
transport have their own special arrangements.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation in the United Kingdom is usually
agreed by and based on the industry as a whole and not on the individual establishment
or firm. Accordingly, those industries, such as electricity or gas supply, where there are
several corporations which act as employers, are covered by a single set of arrangements
for each industry, and the duty of seeing that the arrangements are made falls on the
central authorities, e.g., the Gas Council or the Electricity Council. In civil aviation,
there is a single joint council at national level on which both the nationalised air
corporations and the private operators are represented. Where a single public corpora¬
tion engages in various activities, these may be treated as separate industries and
organised separately. For example, the National Coal Board’s coke and by-products
plants have arrangements quite distinct from the coal mines, and the British Transport
Commission’s rail, road and water transport have their different methods based on
individual traditions which existed before nationalisation. In road passenger transport
(unlike civil aviation) the arrangements cover only the commission’s employees; there
is separate machinery for the employees of municipal chid private undertakings.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was best carried
out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate and specially con¬
stituted joint committees at all levels. In general, where consultation and negotiation
are conducted through the same machinery, separate committees exist for different
groups or grades of employees; where the consultative and negotiating arrangements
are kept apart, a single consultative committee serves all grades.
Northern Ireland
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same principles
as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of Labour and National
Insurance has powers and duties broadly similar to those of the Minister of Labour
in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade unionists in Northern Ireland are members
of trade unions whose headquarters are in Great Britain.
HUMAN RELATIONS AT THE WORKPLACE
The establishment of good working conditions is assisted by the organisation of
employers and workpeople, by arrangements for negotiation and settlement of
differences, and by protective legislation and its enforcement. This institutional frame¬
work, however, cannot by itself create satisfaction with work and working conditions,
nor the mutual trust and co-operation of management and workers, nor the sense of
shared effort and achievement known as ‘team spirit’. Nor will good wages and hours,
LABOUR
477
high standards of safety and health and lavish employee services necessarily bring
about these attitudes and responses; their achievement depends rather on building up
good relations between individuals and interacting groups within the organisation.
In recent years, therefore, there has been a marked increase of interest in human
relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between management and their workers as indivi¬
duals, as distinct from relations between organisations of employers and organisations
of workers. This has led to more widespread attention being given to all aspects of
personnel management and to the establishment of more personnel departments.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a personnel
department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of organisation
of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer is generally responsible for
advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour relations. This officer
also has particular duties with regard to recruitment, selection, education and training,
transfer of labour, the application of wage agreements, the promotion of joint
consultation and the supervision of working conditions and employee services.
Both voluntary and official organisations are concerned with promoting better
human relationships in industry. Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal
with management problems and provide a service to subscribing firms, professional
associations, linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions of
management, and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In 1945 the Ministry of Labour established a Personnel Management Advisory
Service which did much to promote good personnel management and to assist firms
by discussing problems of personnel policy. In i960 the service was amalgamated
with the conciliation service to form an integrated industrial relations service which
will continue to promote good personnel management and assist in the settlement of
disputes. It will in future be staffed by specially trained industrial relations officers of
the Ministry.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking decides
for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited by collective
agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently been attached to
selection; and courses for training personnel officers in modern interviewing techniques,
including the use of test procedures, are now well attended. Selection of applicants for
jobs is assisted by the Goverment Employment Services.
Education and Training
In Britain practical industrial training is the responsibility of industry, though
the Government accepts entire responsibility for theoretical technical education.
Since the end of the second world war, there has been an intensification of the
educational and training activities arranged by industry. Short-term training is
almost entirely the responsibility of individual firms, but in about 120 sections of
industry and commerce, employers and trade unions have agreed national or regional
schemes of apprenticeship and other long-term training. Further expansion and
improvement of training facilities were urged in the report of a sub-committee of
the National Joint Advisory Council which was published in February 1958 under
the title Training for Skill. The report stressed that the increase in the number of young
people leaving school in the next few years afforded a great opportunity to increase the
supply of skilled workers and technicians, and proposed that a council should be formed
by industry to follow up its various recommendations. As the outcome, the Industrial
Training Council was established in July 1958 by the British Employers’ Confederation,
the Trades Union Congress and the boards of nationalised industries. Representatives
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
478
from the interested Government departments, the Association of Technical Institutions
and the City and Guilds of London Institute were also appointed to participate in the
council’s work. The council’s aims are to keep under review the recruitment and train¬
ing of workpeople, to provide encouragement and help to industries in dealing with
the training of workpeople, and to collect and disseminate information about aspects of
training common to more than one industry, including information about training
practices in other countries.
In 1959 the council accepted the offer of a Government grant-in-aid for the general
purpose of promoting the expansion of training for young people, and for the particular
purpose of assisting in the appointment by employers’ organisations or joint bodies of
training development officers to stimulate the setting-up of training schemes for young
people. The council can draw up to £75,000 until March 1964, the only condition
being that industry must itself match the amount of grant drawn by an equal sum.
Joint Consultation
The realisation that the co-operation of workpeople depends largely on their proper
understanding of management’s aims and plans has focused attention on the means
of conveying information to workers. Methods used include posters, wall information
sheets, production charts, displays of photographs, the production of news-sheets and
house journals, discussions and lectures, film shows and exhibitions. It is increasingly
held, however, that, although these media have their use, it is more important to
improve communications down the normal chain of responsibility to workshop level
(a matter which depends on personal relations and on the adequacy of supervisor
training) and to establish means for joint consultation, such as those provided by a
works council.
In the nationalised industries the various Acts placing them under public ownership
impose obligations on the management, except where adequate machinery already
exists, to consult with the appropriate trade unions to establish such machinery for
promoting measures affecting the safety, health and welfare of employees and for
discussing matters of mutual interest, including efficiency. Arrangements for con¬
sultation at all levels, including the workplace level, have been made in all the
nationalised industries according to the traditions and needs of each industry.
The range of subjects which works councils can fruitfully discuss is wide and
includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety, health, efficiency
of production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training, education, recreation and
employees’ services generally. Works councils are usually kept informed about the
state of trade and production and the firm’s prospects, and frequently consider problems
resulting from decisions to change production methods. It is the general practice,
however, to exclude all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and
other matters covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and workers.
The Government has assisted these developments by advice on techniques, by the
supply of posters, pamphlets, films and other publicity material, and by encouraging
and promoting joint consultation. Industrial relations officers of the Ministry of
Labour are often approached by firms seeking advice on the establishment of works
councils or on ways in which their activities can be made more effective.
The Government has sought to extend by research the available knowledge of the
factors influencing human relations in industry and human efficiency. Research units
of the Medical Research Council have worked on these problems for many years. In
1948, the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy set up a committee on industrial
productivity, and in March 1953* the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
LABOUR
479
and the Medical Research Council set up two committees concerned with research on
the human factor in industry, the Committee on Human Relations in Industry and the
Committee on Individual Efficiency in Industry.
Results of some of the sponsored researches have been appearing during the last
few years. The committees were disbanded in 1957 on completion of their terms of
office and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research has appointed a new
Committee on Human Sciences, while units of the Medical Research Council are
continuing research into cognate problems.

SOUND AND TELEVISION
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated under
powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1949-
1955, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio communications, except under
licence. Users of sound and television receiving sets must obtain an annual licence,
which can be purchased from most post offices.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal Charter
in 1927. Television services are provided by both the British Broadcasting Corporation
and the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which was established by the
Television Act, 1954.
The number of receiving licences current in the United Kingdom at the end of
June 1962 was 15,479,517, of which 11,983,683 were for sound and television combined
and 3,495,834 (including 509,685 for sets fitted in cars) for sound only. A combined
sound and television licence costs £4 (including £1 excise duty); a sound only licence
costs £1. Registered blind people are entitled to free sound licences or to combined
licences for £3. One licence covers all receiving sets in a household, but a separate
licence is required for a set fitted in a car.
Development of the Services
When sound broadcasting began in the United Kingdom in 1922, it was decided
in Parliament that the Postmaster General should grant only one licence for that
purpose at any one time, and the first licence was granted exclusively to a limited
company (the British Broadcasting Company). The decision to grant only one licence
for broadcasting was maintained when the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
was formed to take over the functions of the limited company in 1927; it was reaffirmed
in 1937 when the BBC’s second charter was granted to cover the sound services and
the television service which the BBC had inaugurated during the previous year;
and it was upheld throughout the second world war and during the post-war period
until 1952.
During the second world war television broadcasting was suspended and trans¬
missions were not resumed until 1946. After resumption, however, the television
service gained rapidly both in technical efficiency and in popularity; and between 1949
and 1952 the Government instituted a major review of sound and television broad¬
casting which aroused great interest in Parliament, in the press and among the public.
After prolonged parliamentary and general discussion it was decided by the Govern¬
ment that the potential power of television was so great that it would be undesirable
480
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 481
to leave transmission services in this medium in the hands of a single authority,
however excellent. The Independent Television Authority was therefore established
in 1954, as a public body, to provide services additional to those of the BBC for an
initial period of ten years; and independent television transmissions began in September
1955—the BBC’s monopoly in the provision of sound broadcasting services remaining
undisturbed.
A further review into the fundamentals of the broadcasting services, which covered
both the technical considerations and constitutional principles on which broadcasting
in the United Kingdom has hitherto been based and the whole question of future
sound and television services, was undertaken by a Government-appointed Committee
of Inquiry set up under the chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington in i960.
The committee’s report, published in June 1962, contained a number of recom¬
mendations, some of which were endorsed in a Government White Paper issued the
following week and debated by Parliament in July. As a result, certain technical and
other changes are being made in the television services (see p. 487). On the more
controversial issues, such as the future constitution of independent television services
and the use of pay-television, the Government deferred its decision to allow time for
the expression of public opinion on the committee’s views.
Broadcasting Authorities
The BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in the day-to-day operations of
broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The Government, however,
retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General, as the responsible Minister, is
answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy and may issue directions to the
BBC and to the ITA on a number of technical and other subjects. The Postmaster
General also has powers to prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class
of matter, or to revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time; these powers,
however, are treated as major reserve powers, and no formal veto has ever been placed
on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA are required to
prepare annual reports and accounts, which are presented by the Postmaster General
to Parliament.
The BBC and the ITA both consult with the Postmaster General as to the hours
of television broadcasting, and he has approved an arrangement which permits a
maximum of 50 hours a week, together with extensions (averaging ten hours a week)
for certain stated purposes, such as religious broadcasts, ministerial and party political
broadcasts, schools broadcasts, programmes of adult education, outside broadcasts
and Welsh language broadcasts. The authorities may broadcast television programmes,
within the prescribed maxima, during any periods best suited to the needs of their
audiences. The BBC broadcasts its domestic sound services for some 18 hours out
of the 24.
Organisation and Finance
The BBC operates under the provisions of two documents, each granted for a limited
period at the end of which they may be renewed or amended: the Charter, which
sets out the constitution, objects and organisation of the BBC and contains certain
financial provisions; and the Licence and Agreement between the BBC and the Post¬
master General, which deals with technical matters, certain non-technical conditions
such as the prohibition of commercial advertisements and sponsored programmes,
and details of the financial arrangements in force. The operations of the ITA are
governed by the provisions of the Television Act, i954> which formulate its constitution,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
482
its functions, its purpose and the framework of its finances; and by the Licence (which
contains technical provisions) issued to it by the Postmaster General in 1955-
The British Broadcasting Corporation
Under the current Charter (which came into force in 1952 an<^ ^as been extended to
1964, the date of the expiry of the functions of the ITA under the Television Act) the
corporation consists of nine governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman and
separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed
for a period of not more than five years by the Sovereign in Council. As a corporate
body, the governors are responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation,
including the content and presentation of the programmes in sound and television,
and the provision and working of the necessary installations and equipment.
In the discharge of its responsibilities the BBC is required to ensure that its
services are used, as stated in the preamble to the Charter, ‘as a means of disseminating
information, education and entertainment’, and to pay heed to the requirements of the
Licence (for instance, it must allow the broadcasting of any announcement at the
request of a Government department, and must not broadcast commercial advertise¬
ments or sponsored programmes). It must refrain from expressing editorial opinion
on current affairs and on matters of public policy, and it is relied on to treat contro¬
versial subjects with complete impartiality.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of councils,
established in accordance with the terms of the Charter, e.g., the General Advisory
Council, which has been in existence, except for a break during the war years, since
1934; the National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales, which, under the
chairmanship of the national governors for Scotland and Wales, are responsible for
domestic sound services in those countries; and the Regional Advisory Councils for the
English regions and for Northern Ireland. There are also a number of other councils
and committees, not specifically required by the Charter, but established by the BBC
to advise on such matters as religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting, music and
agriculture.
The chief executive officer of the BBC is the Director-General, who is appointed
by the governors at their discretion and with whom they discuss all major matters of
policy and finance. Under the Director-General are six directors (the Chief Assistant
to the Director-General, and the Directors of Sound Broadcasting, Television Broad¬
casting, External Broadcasting, Engineering, and Administration) who, between
them, cover the whole work of the BBC, and who, with the Director-General, con¬
stitute its Board of Management. The number of staff employed is approximately
18,000.
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by Parliament,
which is related to revenue derived from the sale by the Post Office of broadcast
receiving licences; (2) an annual grant-in-aid, voted by Parliament, for the External
Services, i.e. the European Services, the Overseas Services, and the Monitoring
Service; and (3) profits from BBC publications, mainly the Radio Times, which has a
weekly sale of over 5^ million copies and attracts a large advertising revenue. The gross
revenue from the sale of licences for the year ended 3Ist March, 1962, amounted to
£39,327,207, excluding the excise duty which is not regarded as part of the income
from licences and is not available to be spent on broadcasting.
In 1961-62 the Post Office deducted £2,595,34° from the gross licence income, for
the expenses it incurred in collecting the licence fees, investigating complaints of
electrical interference, and administration, and the BBC received £36,73 Id the
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 483
same year, the net revenue from publications was ^1,056,673 and grant-in-aid receipts
for the external services amounted to £7,384,000.
The Independent Television Authority
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and eight ordinary members (three of whom have special responsibility for Scotland,
Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland severally) appointed by the Post¬
master General. The ITA owns and operates the transmitting stations, but the pro¬
duction studios and equipment are owned, and the actual programmes are provided, by
programme companies under contract to the ITA. The Authority has controlling and
regulatory powers of a wide and important character in regard to programmes; the
Television Act requires it to ensure that they do not offend against good taste or
decency, that they are balanced in their subject matter, that they preserve due impar¬
tiality in presenting matters of industrial or political controversy, and that the news is
reported accurately. In the choice of programme companies the ITA is guided by
their potential ability to provide an efficient service and, in the case of regional
companies, by their associations with the local communities concerned.
In the discharge of its duties the ITA is advised by three statutory committees:
the Advertising Advisory Committee; the Children’s Advisory Committee; and the
Central Religious Advisory Committee, which by arrangement with the BBC acts
as the statutory advisory body to the ITA on religious broadcasting. The ITA has
also appointed a panel of six consultants to assist it in the exercise of its day-to-day
responsibilities for religious services and programmes.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There are also two
Deputy Directors-General, and a headquarters and regional office staff covering all
technical, administrative, clerical, typing and office services, which numbered 189 in
1962. Staff has also been recruited for the transmitting stations, bringing the total
number of ITA staff to 527. Fifteen programme companies are under contract
with the ITA: Associated-Rediffusion Limited; Associated Television Limited;
ABC Television Limited; Granada TV Network Limited; Scottish Television Limited;
Independent Television for South Wales and the West of England Limited (TWW);
Southern Television Limited; Tyne-Tees Television Limited; Anglia Television
Limited; Ulster Television Limited; Westward Television; Border Television
Limited; Grampian Television Limited; Wales (West and North) Television Limited;
and Channel Television Limited. A common news service is provided by Independent
Television News Limited. A standing consultative committee, composed of two
representatives of the ITA and a representative of each of the programme companies,
provides consultative machinery between the ITA and the companies on matters
affecting the companies as a whole. There is also an Independent Television Companies
Association, designed to further the collective interests of the companies with such
outside bodies as trade unions and sporting organisations, and generally to ensure that
they speak as far as possible with one voice on public issues connected with television
broadcasting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; its finance is drawn from annual
payments made to it by the programme companies of amounts about three times
greater than the actual cost of the engineering and administrative services it provides. In
the year which ended on 31st March, 1961, these payments amounted to approximately
£4-2 million. Of its surplus of £1,300,000 for the financial year 1960-61, £450,000
was paid by the ITA into the Exchequer at the direction of the Postmaster General,
who also directed that £450,000 should be placed in the Authority’s reserve fund
484 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(which would then total ,£1,920,000), and that £450,000 should be carried to capital
reserves to meet the net cost of capital expenditure during that year.
Sound Broadcasting
The BBC operates its domestic sound broadcasting services from 57 long-wave
and medium-wave transmitters at 43 transmitting stations, and from 27 very high
frequency (VHP) transmitting stations. In addition, a further 33 relay VHP stations
will be completed by the end of 1964, to add 565,000 listeners to these broadcasts and
to improve reception for 1,360,000 more. The VHP service will then be available to
99-7 per cent of the population of the United Kingdom. The external broadcasting
services are at present transmitted from 39 high power, high frequency transmitters:
37 in the United Kingdom and two (used for relay purposes) at Tebrau, near Singapore.
The Government has approved a major programme of building new transmitters for
the overseas services, which will cost over £4! million.
There are 141 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 58 are in
London and 83 at various centres in the regional areas. The external services use
35 London studios. There are also 23 semi-automatic studios which can be operated
by programme officials without an engineering staff.
Domestic Services
The domestic sound services (which produce over 20,000 programme hours a year)
consist of the Home Service, the Light Programme and the Third Network (carrying
the Third Programme and Network Three). These separate, but inter-related, services
give the BBC reasonable scope in providing programmes that fall within a very wide
range of what can be effectively broadcast in sound only.
Each of the four services has its own characteristics: the Home Service is planned
as a general service, and in addition to a wide range of musical programmes and plays
provides the principal news and information services, discussions on domestic and
foreign affairs, political broadcasts (ministerial broadcasts and controversial broad¬
casts by party spokesmen) and special programmes of various kinds, including
broadcasts for schools. It is also the vehicle for regional broadcasting (i.e. programmes
specially compiled for listeners in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the Midlands,
and north and west of England). The Light Programme is intended for those who wish
to enjoy relaxation and distraction in the least demanding form. The aim of the Third
Programme is to satisfy the intellectual and cultural interests of a minority audience,
and that of Network Three to meet the practical need of various groups of people for
expert information on hobbies or work, which cannot properly be met during the
evening hours by the other main services.
Following the recommendations of the Pilkington Committee, the Government
proposes to authorise extended hours for BBC sound broadcasting; with these exten¬
sions the Light Programme will run continuously from 5.30 a.m. to 2.00 a.m. daily
and the Third Network will carry a service of music during the morning and afternoon
of each day.
External Services
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link of
culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United Kingdom
and those in all other parts of the world; to present events of world-wide importance
with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British opinion and the British way of
life. These services are broadcast in English and in 39 other languages for some 600
hours a week, which is longer than the output of all the BBC’s domestic sound and
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 485
television services added together, and involves the transmission of some 43,000
news bulletins and 50,000 talks (including press reviews) in the course of a year.
The services, under the Director of External Broadcasting, are divided into the
European Services and the Overseas Services, each in charge of a Controller. Within
these two groups are the regional divisions. Common to both groups is the External
Services News Department, which prepares all the news broadcasts for audiences
outside the United Kingdom.
The European Services broadcast over 220 programme hours a week and are
subdivided into four regional groupings: South European (Spain, Italy, Greece,
Turkey, Israel), Central European (Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Finland),
East European (Soviet Union, Roumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania), and
German. A French language service provides programmes for both European and
African listeners. There is also an English service directed to the whole of
Europe. The material broadcast by the regional services is mainly supplied by
two central departments: the European Talks Department and the European
Production Department.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe, broadcast
over 380 programme hours a week. They comprise the General Overseas Service
(started as the Empire Service in 1932) with its world-wide audience of English-
speaking listeners, and a number of regional services in English and 22 other
languages. The General Overseas Service, which includes among its audience
peoples of the Commonwealth, British Forces and British communities overseas,
gives a complete programme service for 22hours every day. The regional
services consist of the African Service with programmes in English, Hausa,
Swahili and Somali; the Arabic Service; the Asian Service with programmes in
14 oriental languages; the Latin American Service with programmes in Spanish
and Portuguese; and other special programmes in English for North America,
Australia, the Pacific, the Caribbean and the Falkland Islands, in Maltese for
Malta, in French for Canada and in French and English for Mauritius.
The external broadcasting services also include the Transcription Service, which
records some 700 BBC sound programmes annually and distributes them to broad¬
casting organisations in all parts of the world; the ‘English by Radio' service, which
broadcasts some 200 English lessons with commentaries in 46 languages every week
and reaches an audience of several millions by direct transmission from London and
the BBC’s Far Eastern station and by recorded broadcasts from some 200 local stations
in 87 countries; and the Monitoring Service, which reports foreign broadcasts from some
35 countries and languages and works under a reciprocal agreement with its American
counterpart as regards monitored material from the Far East and other areas inaudible
in the United Kingdom.
In the external services the Corporation works in consultation with the Government
departments concerned with overseas relations which prescribe the languages and
hours of broadcasting, but the day-to-day content of the programmes remains the
responsibility of the BBC.
The BBC maintains offices in New York, Paris, Berlin, Ottawa, Toronto, Sydney,
New Delhi, Singapore and Beirut, to encourage local interest in the BBC, to promote
the use of BBC television and radio material and to provide the BBC with advice and
help concerning programmes, whether for home listeners about that area or for
listeners in the area itself. The offices (which are concerned with the whole field of
sound radio and, where appropriate, television) are also responsible for promoting
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
486
good relations with the local broadcasting organisations, and for keeping the BBC
informed about local broadcasting and other developments of interest; in these matters,
they work closely with the BBC’s Overseas and Foreign Relations Department.
Audience research is undertaken by sampling surveys and other research methods to
assess the size, nature and tastes of various audiences.
Television Broadcasting
In 1936 the BBC launched the world’s first regular public service of high definition
television. By 1962 this service was being transmitted from 33 stations and was available
to 99 per cent of the population. A further forty relay stations will be completed by the
end of 1964 to extend coverage to another 275,000 viewers and to improve reception
for 1,367,000 more. The total coverage will then be 99-5 per cent of the population
of the United Kingdom.
In the course of a year, the BBC television service broadcasts on a national network
more than 7,000 items, made up of studio productions, outside broadcasts, films,
and relays from the continent of Europe. BBC Television Enterprises undertakes
the world-wide sale of BBC television programmes (films, tele-recordings and video¬
taped material); it also purchases material for the use of the BBC television service and
conducts business relations with other television organisations throughout the world.
BBC studio productions come from the four main studios at the Television Centre,
at Shepherds Bush in West London; and three studios at Lime Grove, London;
and from fully equipped regional studios at Manchester, Birmingham,1 Cardiff,
Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast. In addition, twelve small interview studios (used mainly
for short insertions into the news) have been established in London, Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland, and in the north, midland and west of England regions. The
Television Film Department of the BBC is housed at the Ealing film studios; and
Television News and newsreel programmes originate from a specially equipped studio
at Alexandra Palace, London. Three further main studios are now to be equipped at
the Television Centre in west London; eventually, the Television Centre will be able
to produce 1,500 hours of television programmes in a year.
Outside broadcasting, which provides nearly 1,000 programmes annually (over
16 per cent of the total BBC television output), covers most parts of the United
Kingdom with its mobile units, presenting programmes both of national and of
specifically regional interest. Programmes and news items from many parts of Europe
are brought to viewers in the United Kingdom over the Eurovision network (see p. 490).
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in September
I955 by a programme transmission from the IT A London station at Beaulieu Heights,
Croydon. By the end of 1962 programmes were being transmitted from 21 stations
in all parts of the United Kingdom, and over eleven million homes in the United King¬
dom were able to receive independent television.
ITV programmes are produced at studio centres in London, Birmingham,
Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Southampton, Newcastle, Norwich, Belfast, Dover,
Plymouth, Carlisle and Aberdeen. The establishment of these studios is the direct
result of the ITA’s policy of encouraging the development of regional television, and
the programmes are either for local broadcasting or for transmission to one or more of
the other regions through the link system operated by the ITA. This consists of some
3,000 miles of vision links, about 60 per cent of which are two-way circuits.
1 Work has started on a new Midland regional headquarters near Birmingham, which will
become the first combined television and sound radio centre in the world.
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
487
Both the BBC and the ITV services include programmes of music, drama, light
entertainment, variety, films, news reports covering international, national, and local
events, political programmes, and outside broadcasts, particularly of national and State
occasions and sport. Religious broadcasts and broadcasts for schools also feature
regularly in both services, as do programmes designed to stimulate thought and widen
people’s horizons, such as interviews with outstanding personalities, investigations into
matters of public interest, and programmes on the arts; and there are programmes of
specialised interest, such as children’s and family programmes, programmes for
women, regional programmes, and programmes on agriculture. The BBC provides
time and broadcasting facilities for party political broadcasts (the contents of which are,
however, the responsibility of the political parties). The Television Act lays down that
the programme companies (ITA) may take the whole service of party political broad¬
casts but not some only.
Commercial advertising is excluded from the television programmes of the BBC,
as from its sound programmes, and the BBC seeks to avoid giving publicity to any
individual firm or organised interest except in so far as is necessary in providing
effective and informative programmes under the terms of the Charter. The ITA
broadcasts advertisements (on which the programme companies depend for their
revenue) subject to the relevant provisions in the Television Act, namely, that there
should be no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all advertisements should
be clearly distinguishable as such and recognisably separate from the programme, and
that the amount of time given to advertising should not be so great as to detract from
the value of the programmes as a medium of entertainment, instruction and informa¬
tion. The ITA also has rules agreed with the Postmaster General about certain classes
of broadcasts (including, in particular, religious services) in which advertisements may
not be inserted and, on the advice of the Advertising Advisory Committee, has drawn
up certain ‘principles for television advertising’ with a view to the exclusion of mis¬
leading or unsuitable advertisements from the programmes. The cost of inserting
advertisements in the ITA service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the programme
companies for advertising time.
Changes in Television Broadcasting
The following are among the more important changes to be made in television
broadcasting, as a result of the Pilkington Report, the Government White Paper and
the parliamentary debates.
1. The line definition standard is to be changed from the present 405 lines to
625 lines, the internationally agreed standard in general use throughout
Europe. For technical and other reasons, the present service will have to
continue in VHF on 4®5 lines for some considerable time, but any new service
will be in ultra high frequency (UHF) on 625 lines from the start.
2. The BBC is to be authorised to provide a second television service on 625 lines
in UHF, to begin in London in mid-1964 and thereafter be extended to the
rest of Britain as rapidly as possible.
3. Colour television is to be introduced. The Government proposes to authorise
the BBC to start transmitting some programmes in colour as part of its second
service, and similarly for any second ITA service.
4. Pending the coming into operation of the full number of UHF services
(estimated at a total of six), the BBC is to be authorised to provide a new
488
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
transmitter to enable a distinctively Welsh television service (in VHF) to be
given to South Wales. Stations to serve north-east Wales and south-west
Scotland are also likely to be provided to implement the conception of self-
contained national television services.
5. The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and for Wales are to be
given the same rights and duties, in respect of the BBC’s television services
in those countries, as they now exercise in respect of the Home Service on
sound radio: this means that they will be able to opt out of the national service
and provide programmes of their own origin and choice within the limits of an
annual sum of money decided by the Board of Governors of the BBC.
Wire Broadcasting
Wire broadcasting—a system whereby radio programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers—began in the
United Kingdom in 1925 as a private venture and remains in the hands of private
enterprise. Wire broadcasting companies operate under licence from the Postmaster
General. They are not allowed to originate programmes of their own, and their function
is to distribute programmes put out by general broadcasting stations. A specified
minimum of their programme material must be taken from BBC sources. Subscribers
to wire broadcasting services must have ordinary broadcast receiving licences. At the
beginning of 1962 there were 609 wire broadcasting services, of which 426 gave tele¬
vision service and the remainder sound-only service. The number of subscribers at
that date was 1,119,269, including 554,728 who were receiving television services.
Audience Research
Audience research, as conducted by the BBC, is carried on by means of (a) a Survey
of Listening and Viewing, during the course of which a representative sample of the
population is interviewed each day about its listening and viewing on the previous
day, and (b) a continuous system of gathering, through panels of representative
listeners and viewers, information about the way programmes are received by those
who happen to see or hear them. Matters outside the scope of these routine and con¬
tinuous operations are the subject of ad hoc investigations.
Independent Television relies in the main on figures supplied by an independent
research organisation—Television Audience Measurement Limited—using a machine
known as a Tammeter, which is fixed to a number of representative television receivers
and records the actual time these receivers are in use.
Technical Developments
The Postmaster General is advised on the technical aspects of television (and VHF
sound broadcasting) by the Television Advisory Committee, which consists of an
independent chairman, the Director-General of the BBC, the Director-General of
the ITA, representatives from the radio industry, independent members, and repre¬
sentatives of interested Government departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineering
staffs of the BBC, the Post Office and the radio industry. Recent studies include:
investigations into various systems of stereophonic sound transmissions giving satis¬
factory reproduction on conventional VHF receivers; methods of improving studio
acoustics, microphones and loudspeakers; long-distance propagation studies in the
short wave, VHF and ultra high frequency bands; and methods of increasing national
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
489
coverage both in sound and television by such means as the sharing of frequencies
between stations in different parts of the United Kingdom, the construction of trans¬
mitting aerials having special horizontal radiation patterns, and the development of
unattended relay transmitters of low power for providing a television and VHP sound
service to small and isolated communities. The BBC has also developed equipment for
converting television programmes from European standards to those of North America,
and has granted a licence to a British company and a company in the United States for
its manufacture. In the autumn of 1962 the BBC began a new series of experimental
television transmissions on 625 lines in the UHF bands (Bands IV and V) which were
transmitted in black and white and in colour from the Crystal Palace site in south
London.
International Relations
The BBC and the IT A (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. The union,
which now has 29 active members among the broadcasting organisations in the
European zone and 16 associate members (mostly from outside Europe, including
the United States of America and many of the nations of the Commonwealth) meets
every year to exchange views and information, and to study common problems in
the programme, technical and legal fields. It also maintains a Technical Monitoring
Station, where frequency measurements and other observations on broadcasting
stations can be carried out. .
Within the Commonwealth, the BBC is closely associated with the broadcasting
organisations of the other member countries and of the dependent territories. A
decision, taken at the third Commonwealth Broadcasting Conference in 1956, to
achieve still closer co-operation, resulted in the BBC joining with the Australian
Broadcasting Commission, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Rank
Organisation to establish a British Commonwealth International Newsfilm News
Agency Trust. Through an associated non-profit-making company (the British Com¬
monwealth International Newsfilm News Agency Limited), this joint enterprise
provides a reliable service of international news on film for subscribers who operate
television services, produce cinematograph newsreels or acquire newsfilm for any other
purposes, including education, anywhere in the world.
Both the BBC and the independent television companies are associated with the
centre for educational television (recently registered in London), which concentrates
particularly on the needs of the service in developing countries. The centre receives
a Government grant totalling ^100,000 over five years, but most of its funds come from
private sources, including the independent television companies. The BBC provides
free technical and other facilities, including film library resources and some use of
lecture studios.
The BBC and the ITA also participate in the work of the International Telecommuni¬
cation Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency responsible for the
regulation and control of all international telecommunication services (including sound
and television), for the allocation and registration of all radio frequencies and (through
its International Consultative Committees) for the promotion and co-ordination of the
international study of technical problems in broadcasting. In addition, the BBC has
long-established relations with the United Nations Radio Division, with the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and with the
Council of Europe.

Eurovision
As well as taking part in the exchange of sound radio programmes arranged between
the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the BBC is a
regular contributor to the network of European television (Eurovision). This network
now includes 17 Western European member countries; the exchange of television
programmes between them is arranged by the EBU, which maintains an International
Television Co-ordination Centre (Eurovision) in Brussels. To facilitate programme
exchanges on the Eurovision network a permanent television link, operating in either
direction between London and the Continent, has been constructed by the Post
Office. The range of Eurovision is steadily increasing as countries expand their
networks and facilities, and new countries participate. Successful programme exchanges
have also been made between Moscow and London by both the BBC and the
independent television companies.
Transatlantic Television
The first television relay across the Atlantic by means of Telstar, the communication
satellite, was seen in Britain in the early hours of nth July, 1962. The first programme
exchanges between America and Europe via the satellite Telstar (see p. 217) were
televised on 23rd July. The programme from Europe to America was prepared by
the European Broadcasting Union under the executive producership of a BBC producer
seconded to the EBU. It consisted of items from nine of the sixteen Eurovision countries
and was controlled from the EBU international control room in Brussels. The
programmes from America were translated into eight European languages. It was
estimated that 30 million sets in Europe and 55 million sets in the United States were
switched on for the programme exchanges.
17
THE PRESS
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education and a
wide range of interests. It is free from Government censorship and interference.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the world.
It has been estimated (United Nations Statistical Year Book, 1961) that for every 1,000
inhabitants of the United Kingdom 514 copies of daily papers are sold every day.
Next comes Luxembourg with 500 and Sweden with 462 per 1,000 inhabitants.
Circulation figures of individual newspapers are proportionately high: five of the daily
morning newspapers and five of the Sunday papers have circulations in the millions.
These high figures are largely explained by the fact that the London morning and
Sunday papers have ‘national’ circulations, i.e. they are distributed throughout the
United Kingdom, being available almost everywhere on the day of publication.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, while the rest is made
from imported raw materials. In 1961 1-3 million tons of newsprint were used in the
United Kingdom. The average size of London national morning papers varies between
16 and 32 pages. Prices of daily newspapers vary from 3d. (for the majority of papers)
to 5d. (for The Times). Sunday papers run up to 48 pages and to a price of 6d. (The
Sunday Times includes, in addition, a colour magazine section running to 28 pages.)
According to The Newspaper Press Directory' there are some 150 daily and Sunday
newspapers and over 1,300 weekly papers published in Greater London and almost
every sizable town in the rest of the country. These papers deal mainly with news
of interest to the region where they are sold. There are also the sporting papers,
papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident in Britain,
and religious papers. . .
In 1947 a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into the finance,
control, management and ownership of the British press. Its report was issued in
June 1949 {Cmd. 7700) and found that the British press ‘is completely independent ot
outside financial interests and . . . its policy is the policy of those that conduct U;
there was evidence that the direct influence of advertisers on policy was ‘negligible .
After studying management and ownership, the Royal Commission concluded that
‘there is nothing approaching monopoly in the press as a whole, or . . . in any class
of newspaper’. Among other recommendations it suggested the establishment of a
General Council of the Press and this was set up in 1953 (see p. 498).
Since 1949 there have been signs of a trend towards concentration of ownership
and a number of newspapers have had to close, because of inability to pay their way,
or have been absorbed by others; they included in i960 and 1961 five ‘national’ news¬
papers—the daily News Chronicle, the London evening Star, and the Sunday Empire
News, Sunday Graphic and Sunday Dispatch. On the other hand, one new Sunday
paper, the Sunday Telegraph, was successfully launched in 1961. The economic and
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the 1962 edition
of The Newspaper Press Directory.
491
492
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
financial factors affecting the production and sale of newspapers and periodicals have
been examined by a second Royal Commission, under the chairmanship of Lord
Shawcross, appointed in March 1961 to consider, in the public interest, whether these
factors tend to diminish diversity of ownership and control or the number or variety
of publications. The Commission’s report was due at the end of September 1962.

Ownership
Ownership of the press is varied: it includes individual owners, two or more partner
proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper companies owning between
one and half a dozen papers, or press groups controlling a chain of newspapers in
different parts of the country. In some cases newspaper groups also have interests in
groups of periodicals.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their pohtica
leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any political party.
While early newspapers were often family concerns (and some provincial weeklies
still are), with the development of papers for mass readership large capital sums were
needed and ownership began to be transferred to joint stock companies. The largest
press groups are: Associated Newspapers Limited, which has 3 London papers and
through its subsidiary company Northcliffe Newspapers Group Limited owns a
further 14 dailies and 19 weeklies; Thomson Newspapers Limited, which owns
16 dailies, 33 weeklies and 2 Sundays and whose chairman also controls Scotsman
Publications; Westminster Press Group, which controls 9 dailies and 50 weeklies;
494
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Provincial Newspapers Limited, which owns 4 dailies, 20 weeklies and one bi-weekly;
the Mirror Group, which (with Odhams Press Ltd., which it has owned since 1961)
has 2 London dailies and 2 Sundays and one Glasgow daily and one Glasgow Sunday
paper; and the Beaverbrook Group, which owns one London morning, evening and
Sunday, one weekly and one Glasgow evening paper.
The Daily Mirror Group is by far the largest publisher of periodicals in England
and Wales. Its subsidiaries include Fleetway Publications (formerly the Amalgamated
Press), Odhams Press Limited, the George Newnes Group and the Longacre Press
(formerly Hulton Press). Between them they publish more than 350 periodicals,
magazines and yearbooks. There are other, smaller groups, and publishers of single
magazines. In Scotland the largest publishers of magazines are the Thomson-Leng
Group.
Certain newspapers and periodicals are controlled by trustees whose aim is to
preserve the character and traditions of the paper and prevent control from falling
into the hands of people who might change the editorial policy and tradition. Various
forms of trust govern the direction of The Times, Guardian, Observer, Economist,
Spectator and New Statesman.
The ‘National* Press
Ten morning papers with headquarters in London, and one (the Guardian) in
Manchester, are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the British Isles, and
there are eight ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 39). Ten of these papers have
northern editions published in Manchester which, after London, is the largest press
centre in England; while the Guardian has had a London edition since September 1961.
The leading Scottish papers (see below) circulate widely, and certain specialised daily
papers also have a circulation not limited by region, for example, Lloyd's List and
Shipping Gazette and Sporting Life. The two London evening papers each have
affiliations with a national daily, but draw their readership very largely from people
living within fifty miles of London.
Provincial Newspapers
The provincial newspapers, numbering over 80 morning or evening dailies and
Sunday papers and over 850 weeklies, provide the general and local news expected
by readers whose daily life and interests are known to, and shared by, the newspaper
staff. A number of the provincial papers still in existence were founded before 1800; the
oldest being Berrow's Worcester Journal, dating back to 1709. With a few exceptions
(e.g., Yorkshire Post, Birmingham Post, Newcastle Journal, Northern Echo, Sheffield
Telegraph, Western Mail) they reflect no definite political tendency. The total circula¬
tion of the provincial morning papers is about million, of the provincial evenings
about 7 million, and of the provincial weeklies just over 11 million. Among the pro¬
vincial mornings, The Journal (Newcastle), the Yorkshire Post and the Northern Echo
have circulations of over 100,000; two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun
(Newcastle) and the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—have circulations of over 200,000;
while, among evening papers, the Liverpool Echo and Evening Express has a circulation
of 415,429, the Manchester Evening Nezvs of 334,972, five {Birmingham Mail, Man¬
chester Evening Chronicle, Newcastle Evening Chronicle, Sheffield Star, Yorkshire
Evening Post) have circulations of over 200,000 and nine of between 100,000 and
200,000. The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly than the national
daily, is a valuable medium for national and local advertising.
There are over 90 London suburban weeklies.
THE PRESS
495
Scotland
Scotland has eight morning, eight evening and three Sunday newspapers, including
the Scottish editions of the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sunday Express. The
Glasgow Herald, founded in 1783, and The Scotsman, founded in 1817 and a daily
since 1855, published in Edinburgh, are among the papers which influence serious
opinion in Great Britain. The circulation of the former is 85,126 and of the latter
68,430 (average figures January to end-June 1962). Other morning papers are the
Daily Record and the Noon Record, published in Glasgow; the Courier and Advertiser,
published in Dundee; and Aberdeen’s Press and Journal. Evening papers include
the Edinburgh Evening News and Evening Dispatch, Glasgow’s Evening Times and
Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evenmg Express,
the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the
Sunday Mail and the Sunday Post as well as the Scottish Sunday Express.
Among the weekly papers are the Weekly Scotsman and the People's Journal, which
also circulate outside Scotland; in all there are about 160 weekly papers published in
Scottish towns.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has three morning papers and one evening paper, all published
in Belfast: they are Belfast News-Letter, Northern Whig, Irish News and the evening
Belfast Telegraph which has a circulation of 211,236 (average figures January to end-
June 1962). There are 43 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, including two
published twice a week. The majority are published by individual companies and all
the counties have good coverage of local papers. There are no Sunday newspapers.
Wales
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff, has a
circulation of over 104,000, mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales, the Liverpool
Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers published in
Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus, Newport, and the
South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and
to a smaller extent by evening papers published in Manchester, the Manchester
Evening News and the Manchester Evening Chronicle. The News of the World, the
People and Reynolds News carry news about Welsh affairs written by columnists.
The weekly press includes 63 weekly papers in English, many of them carrying
articles in Welsh; 2 bilingual papers; and 8 papers in Welsh, of which 4 are
denominational.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands have one morning paper (Guernsey Star), two evening papers
and two weeklies. The Isle of Man Times is issued from Mondays to Wednesdays
with a special weekly edition which is published on Friday; its companion paper, the
Isle of Man Examiner, is published on Thursday. There are four other weeklies.
Periodicals
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. Salient features
of the last twenty-five years have been the development, on the one hand, of periodicals
with a mass appeal, particularly those for women and adolescent girls; and, on the other
hand, the growth of the trade and technical press. There are over 4,600 periodical
publications: general magazines with circulations ranging up to over a million; women’s
magazines, some of which have even larger circulations, numerous publications
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
496
for children; a wide range of religious periodicals for all denominations; magazines
dealing with sports, hobbies, fiction and humour; periodicals specialising in various
subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the professions, and the arts;
nearly 2,000 trade and technical publications, many of which have circulations through¬
out the world, while others are published solely for export; and the journals of learned
societies, trade unions, regiments, universities, colleges, schools, and other associations.
There has also been a large increase in recent years in the number and circulation of
‘house journals’, produced by industrial organisations mainly for their staffs; a
survey made in 1961 by the British Association of Industrial Editors estimated that
some 1,500 house journals were published.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Woman (3,311,582); Woman's Own
(2,515,412); Reveille (1,533,183); Woman's Weekly (1,471,692); Woman’s Realm
(1,424,831); Weekend (1,140,392); Woman's Mirror (1,136,483); together with the
Radio Times (5,610,035) and TV Times (3,678,535).
Although their circulations are smaller, the weeklies dealing with political, social
and economic affairs enjoy an increasing and influential readership. The Economist and
the Statist cover topics of the day from a far wider angle than their titles would indicate
and are politically independent; the New Statesman is a review of politics, literature
and the arts with an independent socialist political tendency; the Spectator covers
much the same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; Time and Tide
has a strong liberal tendency; and Tribune has a left-wing but strongly anti-communist
bias. Other papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands are the illustrated
weeklies such as the Illustrated London News, the Sphere, the Field and Country Life,
while Punch is the leading humour periodical. All these weeklies are widely read in
libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, generally speaking, appeal to the more serious
type of reader, particularly the literary and political journals and those specialising
in international and Commonwealth affairs.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, Wales has had
since 1957 its own farming weekly, the Welsh Farm News. There are also several
monthly and quarterly publications in both the Welsh language and English.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish Field,
Scotland's Magazine, the Scots Magazine (founded 1739) and Scotland; and two
weeklies devoted to farming interests, Farming News and the Scottish Farmer. Among
literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood’s, published in Edinburgh.
Popular magazines are numerous: the Thomson-Leng Group of Dundee alone
distributes about 10 million copies of weeklies in the British Isles and abroad.
In Northern Ireland weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover farming,
the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., a world news agency owned by the newspapers of the United Kingdom,
Australia and New Zealand and operated by them on a non-profit-making basis under
the terms of a deed of trust which guarantees the independence and integrity of
Reuters news services. Founded in London in 1851, Reuters today maintains hundreds
of correspondents throughout the world, supplying a continous report of foreign
news to the London newsroom. This is then distributed to United Kingdom news¬
papers, radio and television services and,, through an extensive private network of
communications, to news media in almost every country of the world.
THE PRESS 497
Press Association Ltd., which distributes home news. It is owned by British provincial
newspapers. All profits are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd., a public company which distributes home news
to British papers and other subscribers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of United Press International,
an American agency.
There are also some 80 United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services with offices in London, as well as agencies in other cities, specialising
in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as in some
countries, but there are agencies specialising in this type of work.
Training for Journalism
Until recently, and this therefore applies to most older newspapermen working
today, journalists were, broadly, of two classes: those who entered newspaper offices
on leaving school and worked their way up, learning by experience; and university
graduates who held some of the specialised posts, such as correspondents abroad or on
special subjects, leader-writers, sub-editors or reporters. The second class has always
been comparatively small.
In 1952 an agreement was reached for a comprehensive plan for the training and
education of journalists in newspaper offices. A National Council for the Training of
Journalists, on which the principal press organisations are represented, administers
the scheme, which is based on training in newspaper offices and local colleges of
further education. Regional training committees of local newspaper representatives
supervise the operation of the scheme in provincial areas. Examinations are taken at two
levels: the Proficiency Test which may be taken after three years of active journalism;
and the Diploma, which may be awarded after further examination and submission
of a thesis. It is compulsory for all new entrants to journalism in offices which are
members of the Newspaper Society to participate in the training scheme.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union travelling fellowship scheme (launched in
i960) for the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, about ten journalists from overseas spend six months in the United Kingdom:
two or three months in the offices of newspapers or periodicals and the remaining
time acquiring a general idea of life in Britain.
Press Institutions
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the employers’
side, the most important organisations are the Newspaper Proprietors Association,
whose members are proprietors of London (national) daily and Sunday newspapers,
the Newspaper Society, whose members are proprietors of provincial daily and weekly
newspapers in England and Wales; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society; the Scottish
Newspaper Proprietors’ Association; the Belfast Newspaper Society; Associated
Northern Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Proprietors’Association, whose member¬
ship embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical publications and
general magazines. On the employees’ side there are the Institute of Journalists
(I0j)_the National Association of Journalists until 1889—incorporated by Royal
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
498
Charter in 1890, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907. The
National Union of Journalists has a membership of 16,500 (June 1962) working
journalists and is the largest trade union confined to journalists in the world; editors
who have powers of dismissal are excluded from full membership but may be associate
members. The Institute of Journalists, as it admits all qualified journalists on equal
terms of membership, may claim to be representative of the profession as a whole.
Free-lance journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper or group of papers, but
send contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ or loj. The aims of these
organisations are the improvement of the economic status of journalists, the promotion
of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of the status of the press and its
editorial staffs.
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain the
dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors, to
protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the education and training
of journalists: the guild has about 320 members. The British Association of Industrial
Editors is the professional organisation to which most editors of house journals belong.
The Typographical Association, in the provinces, and the London Typographical
Society, in London, are the principal craft unions organising such workers as
compositors and machine minders. The National Union of Printing, Bookbinding
and Paper Workers is principally concerned with the publishing and distribution
side, and the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA)
includes machine assistants, clerical workers and general assistants in printing works.
These unions cover the printing industry generally.
The General Council of the Press
Following the recommendations of the 1947-49 Royal Commission on the Press, a
Press Council representative of the various press organisations was set up in 1953.
Its aims are:
to preserve the established freedom of the British press;
to maintain the character of the British press in accordance with the highest
professional and commercial standards;
to keep under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of informa¬
tion of public interest and importance;
to promote and encourage methods of recruitment, education and training of
journalists;
to promote a proper functional relation among all sections of the profession;
to promote technical and other research;
to study developments in the British press which may tend towards greater con¬
centration or monopoly; and
to publish periodical reports recording its own work and reviewing from time
to time the various developments in the British press and the factors affecting
them. Reports are published annually.
The Council consists of eight national and provincial newspaper editors, four
nominees of the National Union of Journalists, three nominees of the Institute of
Journalists, and ten managerial representatives.
The work of the Press Council has been largely concerned with complaints by
individual members of the public, organisations, and local authorities about the
publication of errors of fact and contested opinions, intrusion by the press into the
THE PRESS
499
private lives of individuals or other breaches of professional standards. The Council
also promulgates its view on ethical concepts applicable to all newspapers. The Council
has no statutory authority; its only powers are those of rebuke and publicity.
The Press and the Law
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say what it
likes provided it does not transgress the law; and, in general, it enjoys very great
liberty of comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers, there are no laws applying
to the press in particular and not to the general public; but requirements which affect
journalists and the press occur in a variety of Acts of Parliament. For example, the
Public Bodies (Admissions to Meetings) Act, i960, and other Local Government Acts
govern the admission of the press (and the public) to meetings of local councils;
and restrictions on the reporting of domestic proceedings and proceedings concerning
juveniles are imposed by legislation governing procedure in the law courts. The
press must comply with the copyright laws and with the laws against the publication
of matters covered by the Official Secrets Acts, with the laws of seditious libel, blas¬
phemous and obscene libel, and defamation, with the laws for the protection of
children from publications which might do them moral harm, and with the laws against
fraudulent advertising, against breach of parliamentary privilege, and against ‘contempt
of court’—for example, the publication of anything affecting a case before the courts
which might tend to influence the result of the trial, or of comment on court proceedings
which might tend to prejudice their reputation for fairness.
Legal proceedings against the press are infrequent; the majority of actions that do
take place are brought by private individuals seeking to protect their own interests,
for example, against libel. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be held
responsible.
18
SPORT
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such activities as organised
outdoor games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games, aquatic sports, and such
popular pursuits as horse-racing, dog-racing, show-jumping, riding, boxing, rock
climbing, motor racing, cycling and rifle shooting as well as those (for instance,
archery, fencing, gliding and ice-skating) which, although less popular judged by the
number of participants and spectators, all have their own devotees. Those who engage
in sport may be professionals (i.e. paid players) or amateurs (i.e. people who play
games or take part in other forms of sport usually in their leisure time and without
monetary reward). Professionals keep up the technical standards of the sports in
which they take part1 and spectators make a vital contribution by their enthusiasm
and their financial support; but the sporting life of Britain derives its character
principally from the amateur element—people who devote time and energy to organ¬
ising sport and to teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages
who engage in sport for pleasure alone.
Central and Local Government Participation
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion of
sport, but it gives encouragement and support to physical education through the
Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department, and it allocates
grants from public funds to bodies responsible for the provision of playing fields
and other facilities for physical recreation, and to national sporting organisations
towards the cost of appointing instructors (coaches) in various kinds of sport. The
Government of Northern Ireland gives similar support.
The Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland, although not
responsible for prescribing the curricula in any school, require that all schools receiving
financial assistance from public funds shall provide for the physical education (gym¬
nastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils, and are concerned,
through inspectors of physical education and by means of departmental publications,
that a high standard shall be maintained. All schools in the national system must have
their own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gym¬
nasium. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of sport are also provided at
the independent preparatory and public schools, and at the universities (some of
which have departments of physical education).
Local authorities are empowered under the Public Health Acts and the Physical
Training and Recreation Act, 1937, to provide playing fields. They also provide
gymnasia, tennis courts, golf courses and swimming baths, on a varying scale.
1 Some sports, for example, athletics, Rugby Union football, hockey and rowing, are entirely
amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur status is becoming
less strictly defined.

Composite National Bodies
The national organisations most closely concerned with the development of sport
are the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish Council of Physical
Recreation, and the National Playing Fields Association. The British Olympic Associa¬
tion, whose main functions are connected with the participation of British teams and
competitors in the Olympic Games, is also interested in all matters likely to benefit
sport or physical recreation in Britain as a whole.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR), formed in 1935, is a voluntary
association of all national bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland concerned
with the development of post-school physical recreation. Its funds are partly raised
by voluntary contributions but it receives a grant from the Ministry of Education,
with which it is closely associated in much of its work.
The CCPR is composed of representatives of the British Olympic Association, the
National Playing Fields Association, the governing bodies of 41 sports, 16 national
outdoor activity associations, 16 bodies concerned with dancing and rhythmic move¬
ment, and 34 voluntary youth organisations, in addition to representatives of com¬
munity centres, educational, physical education and health education organisations,
local authorities and the Services’ sports branches. Its headquarters are in London
and it has nine regional offices in other parts of England. Its activities in Wales are
controlled by a representative Welsh committee, and in Northern Ireland by a separate
section with its own executive committee.
Broadly, the function of the CCPR is to promote all forms of physical recreation.
Its activities include the organisation of a wide range of courses for coaches and
instructors, courses in personal performance, lectures, displays and other publicity
events. Its staff give advisory, technical and administrative help wherever required,
but particularly to the headquarters, regional, county and local branches of the con¬
stituent organisations and to local education authorities and industrial concerns.
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation (SCPR) was formed as a fully
autonomous body in 1953. It is the counterpart in Scotland of the CCPR, performing
many of the same functions, and it receives a grant-in-aid from the Scottish Education
Department under the Further Education (Scotland) Regulations, 1959*
The National Playing Fields Association
The main aim of the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA), founded in 1925,
is to stimulate the provision of playing fields and playgrounds, especially for children,
by publicity and financial assistance. Since its inception it has distributed some
£ii million in the form of grants for playing field and playground schemes and about
£55,000 in the form of loans. It sponsors more than 400 schemes a year.
The NPFA council is composed of representatives of the governing bodies of
16 sports, and of other sports bodies, of the British Olympic Association and the
CCPR, and of a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth organisations, physical
education associations and local authorities. The national headquarters in London
employs a small full-time staff, including a technical and research department which
gives advice on all aspects of playing field provision, design and maintenance. The
NPFA, which works in close co-operation with the Ministry of Education, the
5°2
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ministry of Housing and Local Government and local authorities, derives its funds
mainly from voluntary contributions; it also receives a contribution from the Ministry
of Education towards administrative costs.
The NPFA has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland; there are also branches
in nearly every English and Welsh county; administration is carried out, in the main,
on a voluntary basis, in many cases in association with a county Rural Community
Council.
National Recreation Centres
There are five National Recreation Centres in Britain—two in England, one in
Wales and two in Scotland—administered by the CCPR and the SCPR. The purpose
of the centres, which were established by voluntary funds, is to provide residential
facilities for leadership and personal performance training in a wide range of games,
sports and outdoor activities.
A further National Recreation Centre is being built by the London County Council
at a cost of over £2 million on a 36-acre site at Crystal Palace. This centre will include a
stadium with seating accommodation for 12,000 spectators; a sports hall in which
there will be a large gymnasium divisible into three, with seating for 1,320 spectators,
and a swimming hall with racing and diving pools of Olympic dimensions, a teaching
pool and a gallery for 1,750 spectators; practice rooms for cricket and lawn tennis; a
lecture theatre, two first-aid rooms and six changing rooms; and a hostel and staff
housing. The centre will be administered by the CCPR; its main purpose will be
training, but it is also designed for international competitions.
Outdoor Games
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football, cricket,
and hockey, and games, e.g., lawn tennis and golf, in which individuals or couples
match their skill. Judged by the number of participants and spectators, the most
popular of the team games are football and cricket, and the most popular of the
individual games is lawn tennis.
Football
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier, as an
organised game it dates from just over a century ago. One type of football, in which
only the feet are used, was adopted at Cambridge in 1855; the other type, in which
the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played at Rugby School, whence it
derives its name, and was adopted by the Blackheath football club in 1859.
In England the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association Football
(colloquially known as ‘soccer’), is the Football Association (FA), which was formed
in 1863. Its chief function is to promote the interests of the game and to prevent
infringement of the agreed rules; it also arranges for the instruction of promising
young players (some £10,000 is spent annually on coaching); organises various matches
and competitions, including the international matches played by England, the Amateur
Cup competition, two national youth competitions, and the competition for its own
leading trophy, the Football Association Challenge Cup; and chooses and manages
English international teams. Over 350 clubs are registered with the FA, more than
200 as full members and between 130 and 140 as associate members. The FA derives
its main income from subscriptions and admission charges to international and cup
matches, and ploughs back a large portion of the money into the game. Scotland,

Northern Ireland and Wales have their own controlling bodies: the Scottish Football
Association, the Irish Football Association and the Football Association of Wales,
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or twice
weekly) are controlled by the Football League, which comprises over 9° professional
clubs in these countries. The funds of the League are derived largely from contributions
paid by member clubs in the form of a levy of 4 per cent of the net gate receipts from
league matches, after allowable expenses have been deducted, and from annual pay¬
ments (approximately £250,000, of which some £80,000 is passed to the Scottish
League) from the leading football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists.
In Scotland the Scottish Football League is in charge of the weekly games, Northern
Ireland has its own league. Clubs belonging to the English and Scottish Leagues are
organised in divisions, the members of which compete against one anothei for the
respective league championships. Their positions in the divisional tables are decided
at the end of the season by the number of points gained for wins or draws. In the
season 1961-62 a total of nearly 28 million people watched league football matches
and the gate receipts in all amounted to about £4! million.
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the league matches
by filling in what are known as ‘pools’ coupons. The odds against winning anything in
the pools are very great, but the prizes are high and individual payments of £300,000
may occasionally be made. The promoters of the pools deduct varying amounts from
the stakes for commission and expenses.
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis and the
Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year in England; it is
always played at Wembley Stadium, near London, which can accommodate some
100,000 spectators. The Scottish Cup Final is played at Hampden Park, Glasgow.
The international matches between England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland also excite
great interest, as do the matches between British teams and teams from European
and South American countries.
There are many more amateur association football players than there are pro¬
fessionals (the comparative figures are about 650,000 amateurs, including schoolboys
and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals), but with one or
two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal terms, since professional
teams are more systematically and intensively trained. Amateur teams compete against
each other for the Football Association Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby football, or ‘rugger’, is played under the auspices of the Rugby Union (a
controlling body with functions similar to those of the Football Association), which
was established in 1871. The rules of the game are completely different from those
that govern soccer, and there are 15 players, instead of 11, in a side. International
matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and France are played regularly
at the leading rugby football grounds of each country, including Twickenham, London
—the headquarters of the Rugby Union. Other important rugger matches are: the
county championship competitions; the annual match between the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge; the Hospitals’ Cup final; and the Services Challenge Cup final.
Seven-a-side football (a variant of Rugby football) is also played by clubs and in
English and Scottish secondary schools.
Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly confined to amateur clubs, but in the
north of England there is a professional variant of the game played by teams of 13
instead of 15, according to the rules of the Rugby League. The Rugby League (insti¬
tuted in 1895) holds frequent international matches as well as regular inter-county
R
5°4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
competitions. The match for its highest trophy—the Rugby League Challenge Cup—
is played at Wembley and is attended, on average, by some 75,000 spectators.
Cricket
Cricket is often called the English national game. The exact date of its origin is
not recorded, but it is known that the game was played by the boys of Guildford
Grammar School during the sixteenth century, and by the beginning of the eighteenth
century it had gained greatly in popularity both in the villages of England and on the
larger country estates.
The game has been played more or less as it is played today since the adoption
of a generally accepted set of laws in 1744. About 1750 a cricket club was formed in
the little Hampshire village of Hambledon; within 20 years it had made an outstanding
name for itself and acquired a membership representative of patrons of cricket from
all over England. In 1787 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), now the governing
body of cricket, was founded, with its headquarters in London on a site rented by a
Yorkshireman called Thomas Lord. In the year 1809-10 the MCC moved its head¬
quarters to a ground near Regent’s Park, keeping the name Lord’s’, four years later
Lord’s transferred to another ground, at St. John’s Wood, in the same neighbourhood,
where it has remained ever since.
Following the establishment of the MCC, the laws of cricket became stabilised;
other clubs that sprang up all over England during the nineteenth century recognised
its authority, and nowadays all cricket is played according to the ‘laws of cricket’
as laid down by the MCC in consultation with cricketing organisations in Britain and
the overseas Commonwealth.
In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all towns and
villages have their cricket teams which play at least one match a week during the
season—roughly May to September. There are many thousands of cricket grounds
all over England—in the London area alone nearly 400 pitches are provided by the
county council, besides many leased or owned by clubs.
Apart from the university match between Oxford and Cambridge and certain
representative games, such as Gentlemen versus Players, i.e. amateurs versus pro¬
fessionals, the greater part of first-class cricket is played in a county championship
between seventeen ‘first-class counties’. (The other counties have a ‘minor counties
championship’ of their own.) Among famous grounds besides Lord’s, are the Ovalr
Kennington, London, headquarters of the Surrey Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Man¬
chester; Headingley, Leeds; and Trent Bridge, Nottingham.
In the late nineteenth century more amateurs played cricket than economic con¬
ditions in the twentieth century allow. Nowadays, when first-class matches last three
days and each county plays between twenty and thirty matches in a season, most county
players are professionals, although there are still some amateurs who can afford the
time to play regularly. League cricket, which is a feature of the game in the north of
England, is played by teams mainly consisting of amateur Saturday afternoon players
with one or more professionals, many of whom are distinguished players from other
Commonwealth countries. The MCC is an entirely amateur body, although retired
professional cricketers of ‘the highest merit’ are elected to honorary membership.
In addition to county championships, matches known as ‘test matches’ are played
regularly between a number of Commonwealth countries. The first of these matches
was played at Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, between England and Australia. Present-
day test matches last 30 hours (spread over five or six days); they arouse great popular
interest and are widely reported in the press and on radio and television.
SPORT
5°5
Hockey
Variants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain for at
least five centuries; a haphazard form was played in schools before football became
popular, and many hockey clubs were to be found in and around London during
the latter half of the nineteenth century. Modern hockey, however, dates from the
formation (in 1886) of the Hockey Association, which standardised the rules. Nowadays
there are several hundred hockey clubs affiliated to the Hockey Association and a
county championship was instituted in 1957, but the game has never attracted the
same wide public interest as football and cricket, and there are no professional county
teams and no cup-ties. On the other hand, regular amateur international matches
(inaugurated in 1894) are played between England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, with
overseas countries, for instance France, the Netherlands, and Denmark, sometimes
taking part.
In Britain hockey is more commonly played by women than by men. The con¬
trolling bodies are: the All England Women’s Hockey Association (founded 1895) to
which are affiliated some 1,550 girls’ schools and about 950 women’s clubs; and the
Scottish Women’s Hockey Association. The first international women’s hockey match
took place in 1896. Nowadays, one such match is always played at Wembley Stadium
and may be attended by as many as 50,000 spectators.
Lacrosse
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North America,
is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and at universities.
International matches are played, as well as regional matches, by women’s teams repre¬
senting the East, West, South, North and Midlands of England, under the auspices of
the All England Ladies Lacrosse Association.
The men’s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse Union, is
played in seven universities, and by clubs and schools, mainly in and around London
and Manchester. County matches are played and there is an annual fixture between
the North of England and the South.
Netball
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the All
England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English county associations, the
netball clubs of the three Women’s Services and sections of the national youth
organisations for girls and women. Inter-county and home international matches are
played regularly and inter-Commonwealth tours are arranged.
Polo
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British in
India, and brought to England in 1869. The governing body of British polo is the
Hurlingham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth polo associations are
affiliated.
Polo players are a very small section of the community, for the cost of the purchase
and upkeep of polo ponies is very high. However, many of the clubs now own trained
ponies which are hired out to members at moderate cost. There are about 500 players
handicapped by the Hurlingham Polo Association.
Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and large numbers of spectators
attend inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap teams composed
of players from several countries. The better known polo grounds are those at Cowdray

Park, Sussex; Windsor Great Park; Cirencester Park, Gloucestershire; Tarporley,
Cheshire; and Tidworth on Salisbury Plain.
Lawn Tennis
A form of tennis has been played out of doors from the earliest times; but modern
lawn tennis dates from about 1873, when it began to take its place with cricket as one
of the British national summer games. In 1877 the words ‘and lawn tennis’ were added
to the title of the All England Croquet Club at Wimbledon, near London, and in the
same year the first championships were played; the Lawn Tennis Association, the
controlling body of the game in Britain, was founded in 1888. The governing body
of the game in the world is the International Lawn Tennis Federation, with head¬
quarters in London and Paris.
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during the
present century, particularly since the game has spread to practically every country
in the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’ schools and in very
many boys’ schools where the pupils are of secondary school age. It is also played on
private courts, in parks and recreation grounds and at several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end of June
and beginning of July are the main event of the lawn tennis season in Britain and,
in fact, in the world. These championships, in which men and women of many
nationalities compete, draw large crowds; there is accommodation for over 30,000
spectators in the grounds of the All England Club—14,000 can be accommodated
round the centre court where the finals are played. Other tournaments which attract
a good deal of attention are: the British Hardcourt Championships, the British Junior
Championships and the County Championships. There are also competitions for
boys’ and girls’ schools on a national basis, and matches for the Public Schools’
Cup. The most important international event is the Davis Cup (for men). Women
players from Britain and the United States of America also compete annually for the
Wightman Cup.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the other countries
of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nineteenth century. Since then,
however, it has gained steadily in popularity and nowadays there are golf courses in
the vicinity of many towns and villages—some owned by local authorities, but the
majority owned by golf clubs. The headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
is St. Andrews, Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship, which
was first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker Cup (for amateurs)
and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played between Britain and America;
the Amateur Championship; and the Ladies Championship.
Bowls
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century. Nowa¬
days the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling Association is
concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded in 1905. The Bowling
Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come under and play to the laws as
laid down by the IBB, but there are other bowling associations in England—the English
Bowling Federation, the Crown Green Association and the English Women s Bowling
Association—which are not under the IBB’s control.
SPORT
5°7
During the summer bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in winter it is
played on indoor greens, which are increasing in number. At one time regarded as a
pastime for the elderly, the game has gained immensely in popularity during recent
years; over 2,400 bowling clubs in 34 counties of England are affiliated to the English
Bowling Association alone, and international and inter-county matches are played.
Athletics
Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country), relay
racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by the Amateur
Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to encourage, promote and
control amateur athletics, to improve the management of amateur athletic meetings by
the establishment of uniform regulations, and to promote annual championship
matches. The association, whose membership increased rapidly from small beginnings,
is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers and managed by
representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland, Southern and Welsh
areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur athletic clubs, schools and
youth organisations), of which there are hundreds throughout England and Wales.
The AAA administers a coaching scheme, with a constant expenditure of at least
£10,000 a year, under which five full-time national coaches, working mainly in
separate regions, lecture, demonstrate and coach in schools, youth clubs, evening
institutes, training colleges and universities and at special courses organised by the
national associations, by regional associations or by the Central Council of Physical
Recreation. Some of the work of the national coaches is directly concerned with
coaching young athletes but their main duties are to instruct men who wish to qualify
by examination as honorary coaches; some 2,000 qualified honorary coaches give
voluntary services in the counties and districts of England and Wales. Scotland and
Northern Ireland have their own amateur athletic associations, with similar functions;
there are also separate Women’s AAAs for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United Kingdom
are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board, which is composed of representa¬
tives of the three national associations for men and of the Women’s Council, and is
affiliated to the International Amateur Athletic Federation.
Track meetings of athletics are held throughout Britain from April to October.
The main events in England and Wales are: the AAA championships for men and
international matches held at the White City, London; area and county champion¬
ships; and the universities, Services, business houses and schools championship
meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country running from October to March,
and international, county and area cross-country championships are held.
Teams representing Britain compete in the Olympic Games (held every four years),
and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland
compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly intervals between the
Olympic Games.
Highland Games. The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people
in the Highlands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting
the weight, and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take
place. Among the better known Highland games are the Northern Meeting at Inverness,
the Braemar Gathering on Deeside (traditionally attended by the royal family), the
Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the meeting at Aboyne. The Highland games
attract large numbers of spectators from all over the world.

Country Sports
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable part in the
life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their interests is the British
Field Sports Society.
Hunting
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds
especially bred for the purpose, but it also includes stag hunting, which preceded
fox hunting and still goes on, mainly in Devon and Somerset; hunting the hare, either
on foot with beagles or with harriers when the followers are mounted; and otter
hunting along the banks of rivers. Hunting depends not on right but on permit:
most landowners and farmers allow followers of recognised hunts to cross their
property.
Fox hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for the
landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in spite of the
fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds. The sport is not
without its critics, but a large number of people, including many townsmen, take a
keen interest in it and follow the hunt in cars, on bicycles or on foot.
There are between 190 and 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales, 13 in
Northern Ireland, and 10 in Scotland. The packs range in size from the large establish¬
ments in the ‘shires’, i.e. the Midlands of England (for instance, the Belvoir, the
Cottesmore, the Quorn, and the Fernie) where mounted followers may be two hundred
or more, to small kennels in the west and north, where hunting is often on foot.
The fox hunting season proper starts in early November and lasts until April; it is
preceded by cub hunting, i.e. the hunting of young foxes, when young hounds are
taught the science of hunting. At the end of the season most hunts organise steeple¬
chases, known as point-to-points, which are patronised by large crowds.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members and with the aid
of the farmers, whose support enables fox hunting to continue to flourish; sometimes
however, the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in charge of the hunt, must bear
a proportion of the cost.
Shooting
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the early
part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of grouse, partridge,
pheasant and wildfowl (duck and geese) although in some areas it also includes snipe,
woodcock, wood pigeons and hares.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of the United Kingdom. In the first
place, a gun licence or a game licence must be applied for and purchased annually
and secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on privately owned land, shot
over either by the owner and his friends or by syndicates which have leased the
shooting. However, in some parts of the more remote countryside, rough shooting
may be enjoyed in a less formal way. Much of the country’s wildfowling is controlled
by the Wildfowling Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through its
numerous clubs.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other game birds are ‘preserved’; that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected under the game
laws and allowed to breed in security, under the care of privately employed game-
keepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant seasons open on
12th August, 1st September and 1st October, severally, and last for between four
SPORT
5°9
and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly in Scotland, northern England
and North Wales, where the main grouse moors are to be found; partridge and
pheasant shooting in nearly every county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former
mainly over farm land, and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowling on the
marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
A Game Research Association, founded in i960 by a group of landowners, farmers
and others interested in game conservation to take over part of the work on game
research previously carried out by Imperial Chemical Industries, collects and collates
information on a national scale and makes a detailed study of factors controlling
game population, including diseases to which game birds are subject, game ecology
and density, survival rates and movements of game in changing environments.
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get an effective
shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a keen scent, are far¬
sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly a sport of the Highlands of
Scotland. The deer are preserved on privately owned tracts of land known as ‘deer
forests’, ranging in size from 9,000 to over 30,000 acres. The statutory closed seasons
are October to June, inclusive, for stags and February to October, inclusive, for hinds.
Fishing
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach of
everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and line to the
experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in their leisure hours than
hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing. Trout
streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland there are also
many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon fishing may be enjoyed
on many rivers in England and North Wales, but the best salmon rivers are to be
found in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales the most widely
practised form of fishing is for coarse fish (e.g., pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream), and the National Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 350,000
members. Match angling—competitive fishing for coarse fish by weight—is a feature
of the many angling clubs affiliated to the NFA, particularly in the midlands and north
of England; a national angling championship, composed of no teams of 12 anglers,
is organised annually by the NFA; and the NFA enters a team in the International
Angling Competition.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea fishing for
tuna and shark has gained many adherents during the past fifteen years.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all (except for salmon and sea trout fishing
in Scotland) but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and local inquiries
made about any permit or licence required. Most coarse fishing is let to angling clubs;
trout and salmon fishermen either rent a stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel
with its own fishing rights, or pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month.
The cost of salmon fishing is often high.
Indoor Games
Indoor games played in Britain include billiards, table tennis, and badminton, which
are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities are provided in
social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and games such as real tennis (a
game which originated in thirteenth-century France), squash rackets, rackets and fives,
which are less national games than games of the schools, universities and specialised
clubs. Annual championships are held in all these games, the controlling bodies of
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
51°
which are: the Billiards Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association
of England and the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives
Association and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of
netball which originated in the United States of America, is also played in Britain,
primarily by men. Matches in the game are included among the Olympic events. The
controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket Ball Association.
Aquatic Sports
Aquatic sports include rowing, sailing, swimming, canoeing, punting and water
ski-ing. The first three are the most commonly practised in Britain and are included
in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.
Rowing
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community, and
as a sport it arouses considerable public interest. The two most popular annual
rowing events are the University Boat Race, which originated in 1820 and has been
rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836; and Henley Regatta,
founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.
The University Boat Race, which provides one of the sights of London, is between
eight-oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge over a course of some 4^ miles
between Putney and Mortlake; it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters
gathered on both sides of the river. Considerable interest is also shown in the Head
of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which between 200 and
300 eights row in procession—the largest assembly of racing craft in the world.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various kinds of
races are rowed over a straight course of one mile 550 yards; for instance, for the
Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any nation, the Silver Goblets
for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single scullers, and the Ladies Challenge Plate
open to crews from schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. Many other riverside
resorts arrange regattas every summer.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Doggetfs Coat and Badge,
founded in 1716. Originally for professional watermen and limited to six entrants, the
race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be apprentice watermen) and,
if necessary, it may be rowed in heats. The course is from London Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing clubs,
including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as well as men
compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur Rowing Association
is the governing body of the sport.
Sailing
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the inland
waters and round the coasts of Britain, but during the last fifteen years the sport,
and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal. Sail numbers
registered in the Royal Yachting Association’s small boat classes in July 1962 were:
International Fourteen Foot, 318; National Eighteens, 165; Enterprise, 3,301; Firefly,
1,892; Merlin Rocket, 1,110; Redwdng, 156; Swordfish, 133; Twelve Foot, 1,554;
Hornet, 280; Flying Fifteen, 317; and there is an even greater number of still smaller
sailing boats not included in the register.
Most British yacht racing is administered by the Royal Yachting Association,
subject to the rules of the International Yacht Racing Union, founded in 1907. The
main event of the inshore yachting season is the annual regatta at Cov'es in the Isle
SPORT
5H
of Wight, the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron, founded in 1812. Other
events include the Round the Isle of Wight race and the races arranged during the
special yachting weeks (or fortnights) held at such sailing centres as Poole in Dorset,
Bembridge in the Isle of Wight, Lowestoft in Suffolk, Harwich and Burnham-on-
Crouch in Essex, Plymouth in Devon, Falmouth in Cornwall, and on the Scottish
river Clyde.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules drawn up
by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses are: Cowes to
Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente Maritime, France),
and Harwich to the Hook of Holland.
The famous yacht race for the America’s Cup which was originally given by the
Royal Yacht Squadron in 1851 and presented in 1857 to the New York Yacht Club
for competition by the owners of America, the winner of the cup in 1851, is now held
only at long intervals, owing to the expense involved. The last British challenger was
the yacht Sceptre, in 1958; the holders—the United States—were challenged by
Australia’s Gretel in the autumn of 1962.
Swimming
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the seaside,
and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people. The existence of
indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming possible, and instruction and
coaching is provided in some places by qualified teachers who hold certificates for
elementary or advanced teaching and coaching awarded by the Amateur Swimming
Association (ASA). (The Scottish counterpart is the Scottish Amateur Swimming
Association.) The objects of the ASA are to promote the art of swimming and
encourage its teaching to schoolchildren; to stimulate public opinion in favour of
providing proper accommodation and facilities for learning to swim; to promote the
game of water polo and the art of diving; and to draw up, publish and enforce uniform
laws for the control and regulation of amateur swimming and water polo championships
and competitions.
Attempts to swim the Channel between various points on the coasts of r ranee and
England—some of which are successful—are made by swimmers of many nationalities
every summer.
Racing
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean first and foremost, horse-racing.
Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing, pony-racing, trotting races,
and pigeon flying.
Horse-racing
The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the Jockey
Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and even earlier.
The Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee (founded in 1866) now exercise
control over all horse-racing in England and indirectly in many other countries, and
their rules are the basis of universal turf procedure.
There are two forms of racing: flat racing carried on from late March till November
under the authority of the Jockey Club; and steeple-chasing, conducted under the
rules of the National Hunt Committee.
The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies, run on
the Newmarket course, owned by the Jockey Club; the One Thousand Guineas for
fillies only, also run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and fillies, run at Epsom; the
5!2
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Oaks for fillies only, also run at Epsom; and the St. Leger for colts and fillies, run
at Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding event in the racing calendar; it takes place
annually in early June and the scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is one of the most
colourful and exciting of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of the
flat racing season takes place on the course at Ascot in Berkshire. This meeting, which
is held in mid-June, is known as ‘Royal Ascot’, and is traditionally attended by the
Sovereign; it includes the races for the Gold Cup and the Royal Hunt Cup.
The best known steeple-chase is the Grand National, first run in 1839, an<^ mn
annually since then over the Aintree course near Liverpool. The race, which draws
immense crowds and arouses widespread interest (and some criticism) tests the skill,
stamina and courage of both horse and rider to the utmost. Most steeple-chase meetings
are held during the period September to May, one of the most important being the
National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, early in March.
In England and Wales there is racing on 66 racecourses (excluding point-to-point
courses), at which there are approximately 650 days’ racing annually; Scotland has
seven racecourses, where racing takes place on an average of 50 days in the year. There
are approximately 7,500 horses in training in Great Britain, at an average cost of 10 to
11 guineas a week each.
Horse racecourses must be licensed by the Jockey Club or the National Hunt
Committee. Facilities for both cash and credit betting are provided on the course by
bookmakers, who must have personal permits issued under the Betting and Gaming
Act, i960, and by totalisators operated by the Horserace Totalisator Board. Facilities
for off-the-course cash betting are provided both in licensed off-the-course betting
offices maintained by bookmakers holding personal permits under the Act or, through
the post, to the course totalisators. It is illegal for persons under 18 years of age to
place bets.
Under the Betting Levy Act, 1961, which provides for ‘contributions for purposes
connected with the advancement of horse-racing from persons engaged by way of
business in effective betting transactions on horse races’, a Horserace Betting Levy
Board has been set up, with power to impose a levy both on bookmakers and the
Horserace Totalisator Board. The latter is empowered to deduct from money staked
with the totalisator such percentage as it may determine, and the practice is to deduct
15 per cent from the losing stakes in the win, place and forecast pools, and 10 per cent
of the double and treble pools; this provides an average yield of approximately 11 per
cent of the total annual turnover. The Levy Board distributes its revenue from book¬
makers, together with the contribution from the totalisators, for purposes conducive
to the improvement of horse-racing and horse breeding and for the advancement and
encouragement of veterinary science and education.
Greyhound Racing
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926, when
the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester. There are
now some 200 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are situated in or on the
outskirts of large towns. Racing usually continues throughout the year (although betting
is limited by the Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934, to 104 days in any year), and meetings
(which usually consist of eight races) are generally held two or three times a week.
The licensing authorities for greyhound racing tracks are the county and county
borough councils. Some twenty million people a year visit the tracks.
The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club, founded
in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound racing and exercising
SPORT
513
strict discipline over all aspects of the sport. The National Greyhound Racing Society
—an association of 65 of the leading tracks—accepts the rules of the National Grey¬
hound Racing Club. Most of the classic greyhound races, including the Derby at the
White City, the Laurels at Wimbledon, the St. Leger at Wembley, and the Cesare-
witch at West Ham, take place in the London area, although many other large centres
have their ‘big’ nights.
There is a considerable volume of betting at greyhound race-meetings, both with
bookmakers and on the totalisator. Under the 1934 Act, the occupier of any licensed
greyhound track may operate a totalisator on the 104 ‘appointed days ; 10 per cent
of the stake money must be paid to the Government; up to 6 per cent may be deducted
for operational expenses before successful backers are paid. Under the Betting and
Gaming Act, i960, the ‘copyright’ in tote odds granted to the Racecourse Betting
Control Board in respect of horse-racing also applies to the occupiers of licensed
greyhound tracks.
Riding
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase steadily, and many more
people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the second world
war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There are some 1,200 riding
schools in Britain, many of a high standard, and about 50 new schools are opened each
year; membership of the British Horse Society has risen to about 10,500; some 150
riding clubs have been established since 1945 > ant^ Club (open to young
people up to the age of seventeen years) now has an overall membership of about
60,000 members. There are over 700 branches of the Pony Club throughout the
world, of which 200 are attached to hunts in Britain, and the remainder are overseas.
The British Horse Society, as the national equestrian federation of Great Britain,
is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including breeding,
training, riding, showjumping and dressage, and is responsible for preparing equestrian
teams for the Olympic Games and all international events. The Society is also the
parent body of the Pony Club and the riding clubs, and organises and provides tests,
lectures, demonstrations, courses and examinations to promote horsemanship and
horsemastership.
Horse trials of all kinds are held throughout Britain during the spring and summer.
The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton Park, Gloucestershire, and
in September at Burghley House, Lincolnshire—are among the outstanding equestrian
events of the year. These trials include dressage, cross-country riding, and show
jumping; some 25 one-day trials on similar lines are held annually.
Show Jumping
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 1,000 shows. The main
events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at the White
City, London, under the auspices of the British Horse Society towards the end of
July)—the outstanding contest being the individual jumping championship for the
King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competitions are also a feature of the Horse of the
Year Show, which takes place in October at Wembley and is acknowledged to be one
of the finest indoor horse shows in the world.
In recent years show jumping has attracted vast audiences. Its popularity may be
gauged from the fact that the total membership of the British Show Jumping Associa¬
tion has risen to well over 7,000. The number of horses and ponies registered is
approximately 5,000 and over £100,000 is distributed annually in prize money.
5I4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international competitions
(whose successes have materially contributed to the increased popularity of show
jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee of the Association.
Boxing
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern form,
and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates from 1865 wrhen
the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules which eliminated much of the
brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting, and made the basis of the sport
a trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there are various
amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules of the Amateur
Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur boxing, including schoolboy
boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing in the three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control, founded
in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide for the examination
of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of inspectors to ensure that the
regulations are observed and that all contests are ‘vetted’ to safeguard against over¬
matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests since the
presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late Lord Lonsdale in 1909.
Competitions organised by the ABA are decided at ten weights: flyweight, bantam¬
weight, featherweight, lightweight, light welterweight, welterweight, light middle¬
weight, middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight. In professional boxing
there are no light welterweight or light middleweight classes.
Wrestling and Judo
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. Nowadays the style most com¬
monly used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-as-Catch-Can
or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is still practised
in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish style wrestling (in which the
contestants wrear rough canvas jackets by which all the holds must be taken) takes
place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-Roman styles are used at the
Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games only free style is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur Wrestling Associa¬
tion, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling Federation, under the
rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’
or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the free style used in amateur wrestling. Judo,
a Japanese form of wrestling, has a large following, and is governed by the British Judo
Association which has coaching schemes assisted by the Ministry of Education.
Mountaineering
Mountaineering in Britain consists mainly of fell (or hill) walking, rock climbing,
and, in winter when conditions are suitable, snow and ice climbing on the higher hills
of Scotland, northern England and North Wales. Rock climbing is practised on the
crags of Snowdonia in North Wales, in the Highlands of Scotland, Skye, the English
Lake District, and Derbyshire, as well as on many smaller outcrops. Climbs are
graded from ‘Easy’ to ‘Exceptionally Severe’—the technical difficulties of the higher
grades comparing with any that occur in other parts of the world. The popularity of
SPORT
5I5
mountaineering has greatly increased since the end of the second world war, and
a very large number of clubs (ranging from purely local organisations to large bodies
such as the Climbers’ Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club, and the Fell and
Rock Climbing Club) exist throughout the country. The Alpine Club, founded in
London in 1857, is the oldest mountaineering club in the world; the representative
body of the sport is the British Mountaineering Council; the Mountaineering Associa¬
tion organises courses of instruction in climbing both in Britain and the Alps.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the great ranges
of the world and in climbing their peaks, for example the first ascent of the Matterhorn
in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga in 1955.
Motor Racing
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more racing
and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other country; and British
drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation second to none.
British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and world
classic races which are the main features of the sport. They include the British classic
races—the British Grand Prix (held at Aintree), and the Tourist Trophy for sports cars
(first held in 1905 in the Isle of Man, later at Dundrod in Northern Ireland,
and now at Goodwood, Sussex). There are also British national race meetings and
British national rallies, as well as several thousand day and night rallies and trials,
endurance tests, hill climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of
which there are over 500 in Great Britain.
The best-known motor racing circuits (in addition to that at Goodwood) are those
at Silverstone, Northamptonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch, Kent;
Snetterton, Norfolk; Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park, Cheshire; Aintree,
near Liverpool; and Charterhall, Berwickshire, in Scotland. The controlling body of
motor racing in Britain is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), founded in 1897; the
RAC is represented on the Federation Internationale de PAutomobile, which draws
up the regulations for international motor racing.
In addition to motor car racing, there are motor cycle races—the most important
contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—and motor cycle speedway
racing, introduced into Britain in 1928, and governed by the Speedway Control
Board.
Cycling
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom is
the British Cycling Federation. It controls track racing and massed start racing in
Britain, and is concerned with the cycling events in the Olympic and Commonwealth
Games and the annual world championship. Time trials are organised by the Road
Time Trials Council.
Touring by bicycle is also a popular pastime, and both the British Cycling Federation
and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC) cater for this. The CTC is the oldest touring
club in the world and has a membership of some 40,000. Its representatives in all parts
of the United Kingdom give advice and practical help to touring cyclists; its fifty
district associations arrange holiday and week-end tours, and competitions, rallies and
rides of all kinds; and its travel department gives CTC members every facility, both
at home and abroad, from the provision of itineraries to the supplying of tickets, maps
and other essential requirements.

Rifle Shooting
Full-bore (-303) rifle shooting is organised by the National Rifle Association,
founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting is held annually at Bisley Camp, Surrey, and
is open to subjects of the Queen, and for certain competitions to all-comers. The
meeting extends over 17 days: the first week consists of team and individual com¬
petitions for members of the armed forces, and there are three days for schools only.
The premier award of the meeting is the Queen’s Prize, which attracts about 1,250
entries.
Small-bore (-22) rifle shooting—carried out either on indoor ranges of 15 to 25
yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards—is also widely practised in Britain.
Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are affiliated to county rifle associations and
the National Small-Bore Rifle Association (NSRA), which arranges inter-club and
inter-county competitions of various kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA
also organises a National Bisley Meeting (usually attended by about 1,500 competitors),
a Scottish meeting, and a pistol shooting competition at Bisley. International small¬
bore rifle matches are fired against teams from overseas countries, and British teams
are entered for the world championships and the competitions in the Olympic Games.

Currency
The unit of currency is the pound sterling (£), which is divided into 20 shillings (s.).
The shilling is divided into 12 pennies or pence (d.). Prices are often quoted in guineas,
the guinea (an old coin no longer in circulation) being £1 Is.
Coins in common use are: halfpenny, penny, threepenny piece, sixpence, shilling,
two shilling piece (florin) and half-crown (2s. 6d.). Silver and cupro-nickel coins (3d.,
6d., Is., 2s., 2s. 6d., 5s.) are legal tender for payments up to £2; nickel-brass threepenny
pieces up to 2s.; and bronze (Jd. and Id.) up to 12d.
Bank of England notes are issued in denominations of 10s., £1 and £5. Notes of £1
and 10s. are legal tender in the United Kingdom for any amount; notes of £5 are legal
tender in England and Wales only.
Notes are issued by Scottish banks in denominations of £\, £5, £10, £20, £50 and
£100; though not legal tender, these notes are generally accepted in Scotland and in
some other parts of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland banks issue notes with
denominations of £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100.
Exchange Facilities and Control
Persons coming to the United Kingdom may bring in notes in any currency, travellers’
cheques, letters of credit, etc., without limit; and although visitors leaving the United
Kingdom may normally only take with them sterling notes to the value of £50, they
can make arrangements for up to £100 to be changed into travellers’ cheques available in
their own country. Currency can be exchanged at banks and there are bureaux de change
at all the main ports and at London and Prestwick airports, the main London air terminals
and Victoria Station, London.
Regulations relating to exchange control in the United Kingdom are somewhat
complex and are subject to modification from time to time. Accordingly, any person who
is going to live in the United Kingdom or who desires information affecting his own
particular circumstances is advised to consult his own or a United Kingdom bank;
banks in Britain are experienced in all aspects of exchange control.
In general, persons visiting the country for a limited period are regarded as non¬
resident; any sterling account which they open with a United Kingdom bank will be
designated an External Account and funds in it may be used without formality to make
payments anywhere in the world. Persons intending to reside permanently in the United
Kingdom are subject to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act, 1947, and will
require permission to make payments outside the Scheduled Territories.
Income Tax
The question of when a visitor to the United Kingdom who is not domiciled there is
chargeable for income tax as a ‘resident’ is complicated. The main qualifications are:
1. A visitor is resident in the United Kingdom for any income tax year (beginning
6th April) in which he is in the United Kingdom for a period or periods equal, in the
whole, to six months.
2. Even if a visitor does not stay six months in any one year he is regarded as being
resident if he visits the United Kingdom regularly for substantial periods of time.
5i8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3. If a person maintains a place of abode in the United Kingdom available for his use,
he is regarded as resident for any year in which he pays a visit, of whatever length.
Double Taxation Agreements: A visitor who is regarded for tax purposes as resident
in the United Kingdom, and who is liable to United Kingdom tax on income arising in
another country and taxed there, may be entitled to a reduction of liability to United
Kingdom income tax. .
Information on specific questions relating to income tax may be obtained from i he
Secretary, The Board of Inland Revenue, Somerset House, London, W.C.2 (or for
residents in Great Britain, from local offices).
Travel and Tourist Information
Information about travel to Britain can be obtained in the major cities of the world
from travel agents, airline, shipping line and railway offices, and British Government
offices abroad, or directly from the headquarters of the British Travel and Holidays
Association (BTHA), 64 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.l (Telephone: Mayfair 9191).
The Association has overseas offices in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Australia (Sydney),
Canada (Toronto and Vancouver), France (Paris), Germany (Frankfurt-am-Main), Italy
(Rome), the Netherlands (Amsterdam), South Africa (Johannesburg), Sweden
(Stockholm) and the United States (Chicago, Los Angeles and New York); and represen¬
tatives in Brazil (Sao Paulo), New Zealand (Auckland) and Belgium (Brussels). Informa¬
tion available from the Association includes details of places of interest, lists of exhibitions,
fairs, festivals, concerts and special events of interest to overseas visitors to Britain, with
hours of opening, etc.; and advice on motoring and touring itineraries. The Association
publishes an annual guide, Hotels and Restaurants in Britain, listing accommodation,
services and charges, and booklets giving particulars of youth hostels, holiday camps, and
camping and caravan sites.
For information about the principal events of the day in London, visitors may use the
Teletourist Service (operated by the General Post Office in conjunction with the BTHA
and the BBC). The information can be obtained in four languages by dialling the follow¬
ing telephone numbers: ASK 9211 (English), ASK 9311 (French), ASK 9411 (German),
and ASK 9511 (Spanish). If using a call box, the caller should refer to the instructions
notice. The weather forecast for the London area is also given in the French, German,
and Spanish services; in English it can be obtained by calling WE A 2211.
Demand for hotel space in London is heavy, especially in the summer, the London
Hotels Information Service, 88 Brook Street, London, W.l (Mayfair 5414), gives
information free of charge to overseas visitors as to where accommodation is available.
Additional information on travel in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is obtainable
from: the Welsh Tourist and Holidays Board, 7 Park Place, Cardiff; the Scottish
Tourist Board, 2 Rutland Place, West End, Edinburgh, 1; the Northern Ireland Tourist
Board, 10 Royal Avenue, Belfast, and 13 Lower Regent Street, London, S.W.L
Passports, Visas, Registration
As a general rule travellers entering the United Kingdom must have a valid passport.
Foreign nationals must obtain leave to land in the United Kingdom from an immigration
officer at the point of entry and must also have a visa issued by British Consular
authorities abroad, but visas are not required for citizens of the following countries:
Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, German Federal Republic, Greece,
Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States of
America, and all countries in Central and South America. Citizens of the Republic of
Ireland do not require either passport or visa (but, with residents of Commonwealth
countries, are subject to immigration control if seeking employment in Britain: see p. 520).
Nationals of the following countries who wish to visit the United Kingdom for social
or holiday visits of up to three months may use instead of a passport their national
APPENDIX
5X9
identity card (in the Netherlands a ‘toeristenkaart’, obtainable from town halls) in con¬
junction with a special Visitor’s Card (obtainable from travel agents in the tourist’s
own country): Belgium, France, Germany (Federal Republic and West Berlin), Liechten¬
stein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, and Switzerland. A passport must, however,
still be used where the purpose of the visit is other than touristic, or where a stay of
longer than three months is intended.
Foreign visitors who are sixteen years of age or over must register with the police three
months after their arrival.
Customs Duties and Purchase Tax
The personal baggage of persons entering the United Kingdom is subject to Customs
examination. Many articles are liable to Customs Duty and a number to purchase tax.
Failure to make a complete declaration can involve heavy penalties; but, although there
is no legal entitlement to them, certain concessions are given to travellers who properly
declare their belongings.
Used personal effects, including tools of trade and articles of professional use, which
have been in the ownership and use of a traveller for a considerable period and are not
intended for other persons or for sale, may be admitted free of duty and purchase tax,
as mav also used furniture and domestic articles belonging to persons transfeiring
residence to the United Kingdom. Small quantities of dutiable goods, including tobacco,
wine and spirits, and perfume, carried by travellers for their personal use are allowed
to pass free of duty within fixed limits.
Inquiries on importing personal and household effects should be addressed to the
Secretary, H.M. Customs and Excise, King’s Beam House, London, E.C.3.
There are purchase tax concessions for overseas visitors shopping in Britain. Many
of the principal stores are able to send goods to an address abroad free of purchase tax,
and under the Personal Exports scheme, if the tax-free value of goods bought at one time
is £5 or more, a visitor may have them delivered free of tax to the seaport or airport by
which he is leaving the country.
Import of Domestic Animals and Birds
All cats and dogs brought into the United Kingdom have to undergo six months’
quarantine; and the landing of the animals must be authorised by a licence issued by
the appropriate Agricultural Department for England and Wales, Scotland or Northern
Ireland (see Chapter n). The department will provide a list of approved carrying agents
and quarantine kennels. An annual licence (obtainable at any post office) is needed for a
household dog aged 6 months or more.
The import of birds of the parrot family, if they are personal pets, is allowed under
licence, subject to certain conditions, by the Agricultural Departments. Imports of live
poultry are permitted only from certain countries.
Motor Vehicles and Driving Licences
Regulations concerning the temporary import of cars, motor cycles, etc., by visitors to
Britain are best obtained from the national motoring organisations in the visitor’s country
of residence, which will normally issue a Customs ‘carnet/triptyque’. (For an experi¬
mental period of two years from August 1961 a simple form giving brief identification
details has replaced the carnet/triptyque.) A private motor vehicle may be temporarily
imported free of road taxation; after 90 days a motor licence is necessary. Third party
insurance is compulsory. .
A visitor holding a current International Driving Permit or a current domestic driving
licence for his own country is entitled to drive without obtaining a British driving licence
during the currency of his own permit or licence, subject to a maximum of 12 months»
Any person taking up permanent residence must take a driving test to secure a British
licence (see p. 378), which costs 15s. and is valid for three years.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The rule of the road is to keep LEFT. Road signs are illustrated and explained in
The Highivay Code (published by H.M. Stationery Office).
Social Security Benefits
Eligibility for the main social security benefits is dependent on (a) sufficient National
Insurance contributions having been paid under the United Kingdom scheme, or
(b) the existence of a reciprocal agreement between the United Kingdom and the previous
country of residence of the claimant (see p. 137). Information on specific points may be
obtained from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, 10 John Adam Street,
London, W.C.2.
To qualify for family allowances, a residence qualification must be fulfilled, varying
in length according to the nationality and previous country of residence of the applicant.
Health Services
The services provided under the National Health Service are available to everyone in
Great Britain without regard to residence, nationality or insurance qualification.
Immigration authorities have been instructed, however, to refuse admission to the
country to any person coming solely for the purpose of securing free treatment under
the Health Service.
Employment Permits
Persons from countries other than members of the British Commonwealth and the
Irish Republic are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer only if they have a permit issued by the Ministry of Labour (see
p. 453). Until 1st July, 1962, citizens of the Commonwealth and of the Irish Republic
had free entry into the United Kingdom, but since that date they have been subject to
control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962 (see p. 454), and must obtain
an employment voucher issued by the Ministry of Labour before entering Britain for
full-time employment.
Visitors of foreign nationality wishing to set up in any business or profession in
Britain must ask for permission from the Under-Secretary of State, Home Office, Aliens
Department, Princeton House, 271 High Holborn, London, W.C.l.
